It has the effect of transferring the DIFF loan liabilities from EFIC to the government's national interest account and for the consequent payment to the Commonwealth of a portion$40 million-of EFIC's reserves. This bill means that the Commonwealth will assume contingent liabilities of some $1.7 billion in respect of the DIFF loans. The removal of DIFF loans from EFIC's account removes the difficulties which EFIC has faced through concentration of exposure on the fairly narrow range of countries assisted through DIFF. The opposition does not oppose the legislation. In itself it is non-controversial. However, I point out that the DIFF scheme and the potential for loans under it have been far from noncontroversial. I remind the committee of the circumstance we got ourselves into earlier this year when, unilaterally, the government announced the ending of the DIFF scheme. We remember the embarrassment that was caused to the nation and, specifically, to the Minister for Foreign Affairs( Mr Downer) in his telling the parliament that not one country had complained to him about the abolition of the scheme. It was shown, in a very short space of time, that it was true that not one had, but that many had. The minister was forced to come into the parliament and indicate that he had misled it. of the code of conduct of the Prime Minister( Mr Howard), a code of conduct which has been honoured in the breach, not in the application, because this was not the first time there had been scant regard paid to it. The only circumstances in which people are ever ultimately required to honour it is when they are forced to-when they are caught out. The decision of the government, and of the foreign minister in particular, embarrassing as it was for him, was also a very significant setback for a lot of Australian companies which had come to rely on the DIFF scheme. At the time, the minister said that every formal offer for DIFF would be honoured. However, that formal offer only covered seven projects worth some $186 million. In addition to that formal offer, there were 50 other projects which were worth $1 billion which were effectively scuttled because they had received letters of advice to proceed, but not the technicality of the formal offer. The circumstances of this were that this scheme had been in existence over a long period of time-",137,Notices

No doubt it was one of the promises that hit the fence because it was not a core promise. However, the government went to the election saying that the DIFF scheme would be retained. Not only is this scheme important for our bilateral relationships, but it has also been an important driving force for industry development because it has been through this scheme that our heavy engineering industry has actually positioned itself into export markets. Think back a decade ago. At that time, heavy engineering in this cGuntry did very little by way of exports. The difficulty is that it is very hard to get into export markets, particularly in developing countries where what you have to do is compete against other companies bidding for projects where their governments are prepared to back them. Essentially, the backing for those companies comes in the form of either assistance with soft loans through the aid budget or else through a cushioning of the impact, a lessening of the risk. There is risk associated with these things, sovereign risk, but there is also risk in the sense that there is a fairly long lead time before you get payment for the completion of the product. The nature of the DIFF scheme was an essential part not just of our aid program but also it was a sensible use of aid, the leverage of government money, to assist Australian investment, Australian manufactures, Australian expertise and Australian services being exported. This heavy engineering sector has seen a huge growth in exports due in no small measure to the fact that many of the companies were able to rely on the DIFF scheme. There were 52 projects in the DIFF pipeline before the foreign minister created this mess. There were 52 projects but they involved something in the order of 600 Australian companies. There is a multiplier effect in terms of the companies that can be brought into the network. That is what we talk about when we say we shou-ld use the leverage of government assistance, assistance which both parties agreed to, and assistance which is important for the countries to where it is directed. Why can we not have it both ways? Why can we not at the same time say we are prepared to give you that assistance, we are prepared to assist you in your development projects but, provided our own contractors, our own businesses are up to the mark, then they should be able to use this assistance and get themselves into the marketplace? They could be the most efficient producers in the world, they could have the best expertise in the world, but without this assistance they would not be competing on a level playing field. They would have to compete in circumstances where the companies against which they have to bid have the backing of their governments. The point that we are making here is that whilst this technical change in terms of the transfer of the DIFF loan liabilities from EPIC to the government national interest account is taking place, we want to take the opportunity to urge the government to rethink its position on this scheme. It is not the only scheme being changed that has hit Australian manufacturers. The export market development grants scheme, which is being debated in the other chamber, is also a scheme which the government promised would be maintained at the last election but, whilst it is being maintained, it has been heavily slashed. It is very interesting to note these simple facts. Over the last decade, Australia's manufacturing exports have been our fastest growing sector. They now represent 31 per cent of our exports. They are a bigger export earner now than agriculture and they will outpace minerals in the early part of the next decade. The manufacturing sector is not the poor relation",139,Representatives Main Committee
273,Mr Crean,"Not only did it have bipartisan support, but there was a commitment duringWednesday, 19 March 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 2505 any longer of industry sectors or of potential export earners in this country. However, the simple fact remains that whilst we have seen huge growth in manufactures as a proportion of our exports, still today only 13 per cent of our manufacturers export. So what we have is a huge growth in exports, a marketplace out there into which Australia can position itself. But the assistance is not sufficiently based to encourage more exporters to come into the game and that is why we need export schemes. We need assistance to get us into the export market. That is where the growth in world trade is. It is where our expertise has the capacity to position us but it cannot do it on its own. Australia did have to embrace the notion of reducing its protection levels. Protection is the wrong way to go about trade policy and expanding export opportunities; protection is about stopping imports. Australia has to be about growing its exports. It is too small a domestic market to find the critical mass here alone. But it has the potential to position itself with that critical mass in the global economy and, in particular, in the Asian region. But at the same time as reducing our protection levels we have to have a strategy for positioning our industries for a post-tariff environment. It is not good enough to strip away the protection without also underpinning the support mechanisms to get us into the export markets. It is very interesting, looking at that growth in exports of those manufactures that I have talked about before, that the group that has grown the fastest and the strongest is the group called elaborately transformed manufactures, or ETMs-if you like, the high value-added end of the marketplace. Within that group of ETMs, the areas that have grown the fastest, just to name a few, include automobiles, clothing and textile, food processing, information technology and telecommunications equipment. I name them not because they have been the fastest growers in export values per year-at least 20 per cent per annum growth in all of those sectors-but because they are all sectors that have had some form of assistance. Pharmaceuticals is another group. We are looking at the automobile plan and not the tariff level. It is true that Labor significantly reduced tariffs across the board. It treated automobiles and textiles as a separate category but nevertheless reduced tariff levels, and they are still on their way down to 15 per cent. The reason for the growth in automobiles has not been that we have reduced tariffs but that we have had an export facilitation scheme in place. It is because we have deliberately encouraged and given incentives to these companies not just to produce for a domestic market but also to get out there and flog the things into the world market. And it is not just whole cars, it is the componentry industry. It is the positioning of Australia, because of its expertise, to get into the global market for car componentry. A great example of this is at a place in Adelaide called Henderson Springs, where the Labor party launched its car plan a couple of weeks ago. I see the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) smiling knowingly about this establishment. I hope that she has been down there to visit. If she has not, we will arrange an invitation for her, just as we are arranging one for Neil Andrew, who is about correcting his position and stance on tariffs in the Adelaide Advertiser. The member for Port Adelaide( Mr Sawford) is also very interested to hear about this. Alexander Downer and Ian McLachlan, who cannot spell his name-he spelt it Mac in a letter he sent off to the Adelaide Advertiser-say that they cannot state a position on the car tariff because it would be breaching the solidarity of the cabinet. That did not stop Ministers Hill and Vanstone. They have come out and declared their hand. I wonder who is breaching 2506 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 19 March 1997 confidence. I wonder who has got the courage to stand up for Adelaide and stand up for the automobile industry in that place. We know what the position of the Treasurer ( Mr Costello) is. There he was, over at Canberra's most exclusive club the other night, with the minister for industry-and we know where he is at the moment: checking the stock exchanges of the world. Perhaps he is at Stoke Lodge in London. We see that a few on your side of politics are actually vacating for more lofty fields overseas. But the minister forseat. The honourable member for Lowe on a point of order. nothing to do with car tariffs. Could you please ask the member to return to the bill? honourable member for Hotham, I encourage him to stay within the bill, as he has very generally done, but also to refer to members and ministers by their correct titles. to point to the position that this bill, whilst technically correct, is part of a much broader issue that we want the government to focus on. It is not good enough to bury this bill in the Main Committee because it is non-controversial, without understanding the context from which it comes. The context from which it comes is a slate of measures that the government has taken, which is driving our manufacturing base backwards and is restricting our capacity to get into export markets; and DIFF is one of those schemes. To give an example, in relation to the automotive industry, of how these export schemes work in encouraging manufactures, the Henderson seat operation in Adelaide is a very good case in point. It started 12 months ago from nothing. It takes leather from another company, Howe Leather-a beneficiary of the export facilitation scheme, but almost lost because of the bungling of that aggressive bilateralism that the Minister for Trade( Mr Fischer) goes parroting on about. That bungling almost cost Howe Leather its business in Australia, but that has been patched up in some way that has not been completely divulged to the public. Henderson's takes Howe leather and makes a seat for a vehicle which is exported. Henderson's is not part of the Mitsubishi plant in Adelaide, but is peripheral to it. It supplies those seats just in time. Every two hours, seats are going out into export vehicles. This is an example of what the export facilitation scheme has done. This is an example of a company in car componentry, which has mushroomed all around the country as a result of the car plan and a commitment to exports-just as DIFF was a commitment to getting exports up. There are 200 of these companies in the automotive industry all around the country and in regions around the country, and all of them employing between one and 400 people. These are the companies that are now under threat because of actions that the government will take, it is suggested, if it adopts the majority recommendations of the Productivity Commission. We know what the Treasurer's stance is in all of this, because it was divulged over that cosy little dinner at the Commonwealth Club some two weeks ago-over cigars and port, the sort of nightcap that some of that side of politics revel in. Some even stay in this very lavish club, so they can afford to indulge a bit more. This is when the truth comes out, and the truth was, of course, revealed a couple of weeks ago.

There is not space for four automotive manufacturers in this country, and so we have to close one. This is the Treasury view. Let me say this: the mathematics of the automotive industry is such that, if you can get 100,000 units, a car plant is viable. If you want to keep four car manufacturers in this country, it is simple-you need 400,000 units. produce 360,000 units, 40,000 of which are exported. So what do we need? We need another 40,000 units exported. In other words, we need to double our exports. If we achieve that, we have got viability for four manufacturers. If Ford decides to stay, that is up to it. But I tell you what: the government has a responsibility to keep an environment going in which the four can stay. That is their responsibility. And what do they do? They sit there, hiding behind the Productivity Commission's recommendations, giving no certainty and no direction. Labor does not sit there. Labor took the initiative and came forward with a six-point plan for the automotive industry. It was one that froze the tariffs at 15 per cent from the year 2000; one that said that we should have a transparent measure as to what our trading partners do in reducing their level of protection; one that would have a review in 2003 to see where we would go after 2005. It was not retreating from the APEC agenda, but ensuring that our trading partners keep up with it, keeping the pressure upon them. of order, but export finance has got absolutely nothing to do with car tariffs. I have asked you to ask the speaker to return to the bill and I have to ask that again. honourable member for Hotham that, since the prior point of order, I have been looking at the bill and the second reading speech. The primary purpose of the bill is to provide for the Commonwealth to assume the risk associated with DIFF loans.

It is an issue that is important to the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth). They have been out there in the Adelaide Advertiser saying how they are supporting the car industry, but they will not come into this parliament and support it. We should perhaps use the opportunity to get some business on the agenda paper in another chamber to require them to vote in relation to where the Productivity Commission is heading us. Maybe this is not the appropriate forum to do it. If the member for Lowe( Mr Zammit) insists on taking points of order to stop these important deliberations and the opportunities for members on our side to talk about these significant industries for the country, then be it on him. We know that their agenda is to push under the carpet the significance of these measures and their impact on exports. Whether it is the DIFF scheme, the changes in terms of EFIC, the export market development grants scheme or the specific industry plans, this is a government that is driving manufactures down.

Why shouldn't we be doing that? That is a win-win situation. That is the circumstance that we should all be aiming for. That is why we need a bipartisan approach to these issues. This is not an issue just of budget bottom lines. If you say that, you are essentially arguing that you cut regardless of the consequences. If you ignore the consequences of what has happened to the DIFF scheme as a result of the bungling and incompetence of the foreign minister, you also ignore the impact that that scheme has had on significantly growing the heavy engineering base in this country. DIFF is a vital arrow in the quiver, if you like, for going out into the international marketplace and trying to win the battle. There are many arrows that have to be in the quiver and they have to be selected, because some of them will apply differently to different targets. But that is the nature of trade. It is the nature of manufacturing. It is the nature of picking where your niche opportunities are. Not government picking it-not that at all-but government saying to industries, 'You get in there and compete on your own merits. But if, in fact, there isn't a level playing field, then we will try to level it up for you.' There is not another country in the world competing for these projects in developing countries that does not back its heavy engineering industry. It is only Australia that dud its industry and it is only the Liberals in Australia that dud it. Labor was prepared to have a scheme. It was prepared to develop DIFF and the Export Finance Insurar:ce Corporation. It was prepared to put the substance of government in partnership behind industry development. It is prepared to support the goers. You cannot just get up there and preach to manufacturers on the basis of, 'Get out there, chase exports and we will see what happens.' It does not work that way. It needs a partnership, and DIFF was a vital part of the partnership. The opposition, as I said, supports the measures that are before us today but it laments the circumstances in which it comes to us. It urges the government, and those who represent the government in this chamber today, to rethink its position, to restore the DIFF scheme, to honour its election promise in relation to DIFF and to keep the export market development grants scheme going. We urge them to adopt, in a bipartisan way, Labor's plan for the automotive industry. If the government does not do that, we will see not just one manufacturer close but maybe all of them, and that will be a sorry day for Australia. This is a circumstance in which we can build the strength of one of our great industries, just as we can build on the strength of our heavy engineering capacity. But it will not happen on its own. It requires a partnership. It requires government to be working with industry. The great tragedy of this government is that it is not prepared to work with industry. It thinks it understands industry but it just has no idea. The litany of complaints that comes through from businesses these days is about the government not listening to them and not being prepared to act. It is a sorry indictment on a party that claims to represent business interests that those businesses now have to tum again to Labor to try to argue their case. I hope the government takes note of our concerns. We are offering a preparedness to be involved in a bipartisan way in the development of a sensible industry policy for this country; one that embraces schemes such as DIFF and the export market development grants scheme. The simple fact is that people in business need to plan on a longer-term horizon than the term Wednesday, 19 March 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 2509 of one parliament. Just as we give certainty in the economic direction-the treasury line, if you like-we need an industry direction or line. We need to create the environment for certainty against which businesses can invest; an approach of certainty that, regardless of changes in government, will carry on. That is an expectation that people had, when they went to the last election, in relation to the DIFF scheme. It is a promise dishonoured-one of many. The government should be shamed on that ground alone. But let us look forward to where these industries can be taken. Let us try to support the heavy engineering capacity of this nation. Let us re-establish the DIFF scheme, not just transfer the remnants of it to another arrangement against which those that were lucky enough to get in can still be administered. For all of those projects that were given the go-ahead, we require that that be honoured. I think that is the appropriate course for us to follow. We would certainly join in any change to arrangements that saw that happen. Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment Bill 1997. BeforeI enter into the main thrust of what I want to say about this bill, I want to make some passing reference to the matters raised by the honourable member for Hotham( Mr Crean) before he leaves the chamber. The honourable member for Hotham should know that no business is debated in this chamber, no business at all, without agreement from the opposition. If he did not know, he should have known, and if he knew that he is about to leave the chamber, to criticise the Treasurer ( Mr Costello) for making alleged claims in regard to the Mitshubishi plant, when he knows very well the honourable Treasurer has denied that claim. The other matter that he raisesfrom now on the opposition's view is that, unless someone denies it in a way that they think is acceptable, then it is not a denial? the bill. for Hotham said. He said, 'Labor was prepared to put a plan into action.' After 13 years, I think it lacks credibility when they come into this chamber and they say, 'We were going to put a plan into action.' You have had 13 years and you have done absolutely nothing. Ms Worth-Hear, hear! in talking about this very important issue, was to couch it in such a way that he knew-or he should have known-that what he was saying was intended to mislead, because the intention of EFIC and DIFF is to provide EFIC with a lot more flexibility than it had before. That is the intention of the changes in this bill. EFIC is a statutory corporation set up specifically, and in particular, to increase Australia's exports by the provision of internationally competitive insurance and export finance. In fact, the trailblazers in export finance were the Germans. I recall some years ago when I was in",143,Representatives Main Committee

292,Mr Zammit,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I wrote down what the honourable member",145,Representatives Main Committee
293,Mr Zammit,"The other thing that I thought was distasteful from the member for Hotham,2510 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 19 March 1997 business-I am going back some 22 years-I was importing a product from Germany and a similar product from other parts of the world. from Germany and from other countries, they approached me at a given time and said that they were willing to substantially increase the stockholding at no cost to me-very long termto repay over a period of, say, 12 to 15 months. BecauseI had that flexibility, I did not need to obtain the finance to import goods from the other parts of the world that were of a similar nature and similar in price. That meant that my emphasis was on that product from Germany almost to the exclusion of that similar product from other parts of the world. The Germans were able to establish a very strong foothold in Australia for a product that was not manufactured in Australia. What that meant was that they were able to lock out their competitors from other parts of the world. That is one of the added incentives that is there for the government to get strongly involved in export finance. As the minister stated in his second reading speech, in last year's budget the coalition government stated that DIFF loans would be divorced from EFIC and those liabilities transferred to the government's responsibility. The reason for that is the DIFF loans are invariably long-term loans, in the vicinity of up to 25 years. This restricted EFIC in its ability to assist small and medium sized enterprises with their requirements, which are invariably for much shorter terms, with faster turnover and thus being able to assist more enterprises because of the faster turnover. The clients of EFIC are invariably small and medium sized enterprises with a very smallish turnover, in the vicinity of up to about $50 million. These are exactly the sorts of enterprises that are strong in manufacturing that need a bit of a boost to enter the export market and to develop Australia's export drive, especially into the Asia-Pacific region. In his second reading speech, the minister detailed the comparisons. A DIFF grant of some $120 million, needed to develop the export market of a small to medium sized company, translates roughly to an equivalent soft loan through EFIC of something like $350 million. That means that, because of the restriction of the time, less money is available to provide the necessary moneys for export. That has restricted EFIC very strongly. As a result, the potential to assist small and medium sized enterprises with quicker turnover and shorter term loans has been greatly enhanced. In 1995-96, EFIC financed some $7.5 billion of Australian exports to more than 150 countries around the world, benefiting about 1,000 Australian enterprises. There is no doubt that a great deal of that business would have been lost because the availability of finance and the cost of export risk mitigation would have precluded those Australian enterprises from obtaining their share of the export markets around the world. The main function of a DIFF grant is to provide finance for Australia's overseas aid programs, which are invariably focused in the Asia-Pacific region. As a result, their exposure is concentrated in a small number of countries that are very regionalised just to the north of",145,Representatives Main Committee

296,Mr Deputy Speaker,Order! The honourable member for Chifley.,146,Representatives Main Committee
297,Mr Price,"I will take a point of order, Paul!",146,Representatives Main Committee
298,Mr Zammit,"You are very welcome to it. I recall that, as I was importing these goodsWednesday, 19 March 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 2511 Australia. Consequently, EFIC found itself in the very unenviable position of having the risk unevenly balanced. When Australian exporters approached EFIC for funds to export products of a non-aid type to the Asia-Pacific region, the problem was further exacerbated, especially in view of the fact that Australia's exports are growing exponentially into the Asia-Pacific region. In other words, the risk factor is concentrated and it meant that EFIC had to look at expanding the risk and, as a result, had to reduce the amounts of money available for this non-aid type export. The amendments will allow EFIC more room to move and to more efficiently expand loans for short to medium periods for enterprises wishing to export their goods, especially in the Asia-Pacific region. The Commonwealth will receive a special payment from EFIC of $40 million, which is intended to cover any potential losses that may occur, and the Commonwealth will pay EFIC a fee for managing the loans. This amendment will substantially strengthen EFIC's role, which is a niche that needed to be filled because the private sector was unwilling and/or unable or reluctant to provide risk venture capital in some overseas markets because of the risks involved-and quite understandably. EFIC was able to provide that much needed service. EFIC has demonstrated that it can meet most of the Australian exporters' requirements by operating on a commercial basis and paying its way, as well as building up reserves to meet potential future losses. In fact, not only has EFIC operated efficiently and effectively but, in addition, it has paid a dividend to the government during this financial year of $12.6 million. I strongly support the amendment to the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment Bill 1997. this legislation, which really removes the liabilities for DIFF funding from EFIC to the Commonwealth account. I did not hear all of the contribution of the honourable member for Lowe( Mr Zammit), but I do not think he once mentioned that the government he is a member of has actually cancelled DIFF. The scheme no longer exists. I am not sure whether it is out of embarrassment or shame that he is unable to say it. DIFF is no longer there. It is all very well to say, 'EFIC is moving in and filling the gap,' but, in fact, it has not changed at all. It is certainly not changed by this bill, other than having a liability removed from it to the Commonwealth, and having to pay $40 million to the Commonwealth in consideration of the Commonwealth assuming liabilities for about $1.7 billion worth of loans. This whole sorry saga of DIFF funding needs to be again placed on the record. Let me be quite frank. The Minister for Foreign Affairs( Mr Downer), when in opposition-I think in about November 1995-asked the most comprehensive question on notice about DIFF funding to the then Minister Bilney and got a response. The coalition went into the election saying that they were going to maintain DIFF funding. Of course, we know once they were elected they cancelled it. One can only conclude that during the election there was dishonesty when the people of Australia were told that the coalition would maintain DIFF funding. We ought to reflect on the cancellation of this DIFF funding. The Development Import Finance Facility: why did we have it? In fact, it was the coalition that introduced DIFF funding in 1980. The first project under DIFF funding was approved in 1982-1 might say with Labor Party support; it was bipartisan-but they were the ones that actually originated the scheme. You would think that they would demonstrate some pride of ownership. I note that the member",146,Representatives Main Committee

Perhaps he, or whoever is going to be the next coalition speaker, might exhibit a little bit of pride of ownership. him from contributing. DIFF funding is a mixed credit scheme which allows Australian companies to tender competitive contracts for the supply of Australian goods and services for projects in developing countries. Normally DIFF funding will cover an amount equal to 35 per cent of the contract and is combined with export credit from the Export Finance Insurance Commission of Austrade to provide a concessional loan to the recipient country. It has been very successful. In this debate we cannot say DIFF funding created a level playing field for Australian companies. Of course it did not. Other countries have far more concessional arrangements: Japan, Germany, the United Statescertainly not a level playing field. And you have abolished it. The government members over there have been party to the abolition of the DIFF scheme. The member for Lowe was very proud to tell the House his experience as an importer. I do not understand how that is relevant to a debate about how you assist on exporting, but be that as it may, let us be generous about that and accept it from the member for Lowe. I have never been an exporter but when I was involved in communications I well remember a Victorian based company, Ericssons. is not-a parochial interest. They put in, I think from memory, a $300 million bid into Indonesia for communications equipment. Quite frankly, when you discussed it with the officials there, it was not that it was an inferior bid; it was not that the equipment could not and would not have made a significant difference. But when push came to shove the decision really got around to what was the best form of financing-who was giving the better deal there. They were at a disadvantage. That meant that jobs in Ericssons were at risk. We keep on saying as parliamentarians-both sides, but we say it with a greater degree of genuineness-that we need to export more. Traditionally, in communications there have been very few exports. We were pushing companies like Ericssons into the export market. If they could not survive competitively in the bid with DIFF funding, how in the hell are they going to survive without DIFF funding? The member for Hotham( Mr Crean) has pointed out that this backflip by conservatives on DIFF funding and the actions of the Minister for Foreign Affairs at the beginning of their new term of office was a cause of extreme embarrassment, if not humiliation, for the minister and the government. And why was that so? He was reporting to the House that DIFF funding did not make any difference to our neighbours in our region because DIFF funding is very",147,Representatives Main Committee

There they were not concerned about the announced cancellation of the scheme and, of course, that proved to be grossly misleading. We went through a series of exposures one day after another where, far from being indifferent or not concerned about the cancellation of the scheme, and having contacted the minister, the ambassador, or high commissioner, or even having written letters to the minister, he was forced to come into the House and, effectively, make a grovelling apology and have the Prime Minister( Mr Howard) make it clear to the people of Australia that he was on a warning. He had not been sin-binned; he had not been sent off, but he was on his warning. And so he deserved to be. But it brings no credit to this government to remove DIFF funding. We like to think in the Labor Party that we represent the workers and, indeed, we certainly strive to do that. We are absolutely concerned about jobs, about permanent jobs, and about growth in jobs and, given that obsession of ours, we are very concerned to ensure that the full range of measures is available to Australian industry and Australian services when they are producing here in Australia and, more particularly, when they are exporting. And it is quite clear that they need DIFF funding. I should have mentioned that there is a whole range of projects, involving some 50 companies in all, caught up by the cancellation of the scheme. If there is one thing that business really objects to, that narks them more than cutting expenditure, more than slashes, it is an inability to plan and know where a government is heading. And these companies were narked because the government did not say that they are going to cut the scheme off and give businesses some advance warning. They did it overnight, and projects that were in the middle of approval processes were caught up. Given that the coalition, the originators of the DIFF scheme, have now emasculated and removed it, perhaps the parliamentary secretary ( Mr Andrew Thomson) who is going to sum up in this debate might tell us when he comes to this place: what were the conditions? Does he agree with me? What were their reasons for implementing the scheme in the first place, and have those conditions changed? Is Australian manufacturing industry so absolutely robust, flushed with funds and success that it no longer needs DIFF, and what are the implications of the cancellation of DIFF? How many Australian jobs are going to be lost? How many Australian dollars' worth of exports are going to be lost because of the cancellation of DIFF funding? There is one other aspect of DIFF funding that I have not mentioned and that is that, yes, it certainly helps some companies get into the export business. But when you get into the export business, it does not conform to Australian accountants' theory of business. You do not get success in three months, or six months, or twelve months. The export business is a long-term business and you have got to be patient. You have got to be in there; you have got to prove yourself, and after a period of time one success will breed success again. So perhaps the parliamentary secretary might take the trouble to tell us how many Australian companies will be deterred from making that long-term commitment to exports. But how many will be deterred from making that long-term commitment to exports? Can he give us an estimate? Did he ask his department to look at this? Can it provide us with some figures? Can it humour the Labor Party-because we are interested in jobs-and tell us how",148,Representatives Main Commitiee

309,Mr Price,"I am pleased to see the honourable parliamentary secretary in the chamber.2514 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 19 March 1997 many Australian jobs this means? What does it mean to services exports? What does it mean to manufacturing exports? I do not want to speak much longer in this debate; I want to make it clear fromto say this: the Australian Labor Party in opposition is most concerned to do all that it can do to work with industry. The member for Hotham talked about industry plans that had been put in place when we were in government. Of course we are proud of those industry plans. The essential feature of them is that you need, in the first instance, to sit down with the industry, whether that is management or the workers, to ascertain where they are and where they see the potential to be, and develop a plan based around that. Industry plans do not necessarily mean forking out taxpayers' dollars for assistance. For example, the car plan involved an export facilitation approach. This did not cost any dollars, but it put the car manufacturers on notice that they really had to export. Again, with communications, it was looking at the role of the dominant carrier and the new carrier, Optus, in trying to get as many dollars and jobs as they are able to pull through Australian industry. We are not embarrassed or ashamed of the fact that we are concerned about Australian jobs and Australian exports. We are prepared to sit down with industry to work through the impediments to growth and export to ensure that if there is a role for government to play in that, we will play it. I think that when we go to the next election, there will be a distinct contrast between a Treasury-led government indifferent to jobs and to firms surviving, and an opposition where we are concerned about Australian jobs, about growing Australian small and medium businesses and about developing plans that allow them to grow and to export. I think that when we go to the next election, the Australian people are going to see that we are reflecting their concerns on this. They are concerned about it. They are very worried about you mob over there because they believe that you have no commitment to Australian jobs or to Australian industry or services, and you may very well reap the reward of being indifferent to their concerns. We want to be assured on this side of the House that that does not happen to us. As I said, we support this bill, but I am looking forward to-I cannot stay-reading the parliamentary secretary's responseaddressing all the issues that I have raised for him so that the Australian people can be better informed about his government's motivation and reason and what actual numbers they have to back up the actions that they have taken. the opposition does not oppose this legislation, as such. However, the opposition is deeply concerned about the context in which this legislation comes to the parliament which, as previous speakers have said, arises from the government's decision, against its election commitments, to abolish the DIFF scheme. Not a lot has been said in the debate about some of the more recent statistics of EPIC, and I will take a few moments of the Main Committee's time to illustrate how important EPIC is as an organisation to Australian exporters.

314,Mr Sercombe (Maribyrnong) (10.54 A.m.),"As other opposition speakers have indicated,Wednesday, 19 March 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 2515 supported almost $7.5 billion in Australian exports, up some 20 per cent. It had 240 new clients, most of which were small to medium enterprises, 60 per cent of which were manufacturers. Its insurance against non-payment increased by 14 per cent to $6.5 billion. It introduced export finance guarantees, which are a package of EFIC and bank arrangements which provide competitive, medium to long-term finance to Australian exporters. The first loan under that arrangement was made in July 1996 for a project in Thailand. We are talking about an organisation which is growing in importance in terms of Australia's export effort, and one which ought to be acknowledged, I am sure, on a bipartisan basis. But we need to understand, as other speakers have said, that EFIC and Australian exporters operate in a pretty competitive world, and a pretty competitive one in relation to access to finance and insurance. I had a look at some figures that were produced recently in an OECD publication. They are a little dated, but they show the scale of support from organisations comparable to EFIC in other countries with relatively small economies, such as Austria. In 1992, Austria provided cover for export contracts of some 296Y2 billion Austrian schillings. On a quick and dirty calculation, that works out at about over $A32 billion. Sweden's equivalent organisation to EFIC can incur liabilities of up to 72 billion Swedish kronor, which works out at about $A12'h billion. Germany, which the member for Lowe( Mr Zammit) referred to, at the end of 1991 had commitments of DM152 billion-on the OECD figures I had-for export credit insurance, working out at some $Al17 billion. I have a slightly more generous view of the example the member for Lowe gave about his experience as an importer than has the member for Chifley( Mr Price). In a somewhat garbled way, I must concede-and perhaps that is why he confused the member for Chifley-the member for Lowe was making a point, as an importer dealing with a German company, about just how important the package of financial support was that the German company was able to offer him. When you look at the figure of over DM152 billion as the level of commitment that the German equivalent to EFIC offers to its exporters, you can understand what a competitive world this country is operating in, and why it is so important that EFIC be supported. You can see what a tragedy it is for a range of Australian industries, particularly in the engineering area, that the government has proceeded to break its election commitments and abolish DIFF. EFIC's last annual report gives some examples of DIFF supported projects-the sorts of projects which are now not going to happen, which is going to place Australian companies at a huge competitive disadvantage compared with their overseas competitors. A $17 million project for China of machinery for filtering or purifying water is just one that springs to my attention, with the Overseas Project Corporation of Victoria having a project of $6.7 million for a water treatment plant in China. In Indonesia, the Vocational and Technical Training Corporation of Australia has a $27 million occupational health and safety project. In the Philippines, AWA has a project of $30 million for the upgrading and rehabilitation of existing metro-Manila traffic signal systems. These are just some of the projects listed in the EFIC annual report, projects which are simply not going to be there in future. Australian companies are simply not going to have a competitive advantage in obtaining those sorts of projects. I recently picked up another example in the Philippines of a $40 million BP solar project, which apparently is one of the last ones that slipped through the net, as it were, with EFIC making an announcement about providing a concessional loan which included a $13 million Australian government grant from AusAID. As I said, these are going to cost Australians jobs. 2516 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 19 March 1997 They have also cost, and are going to cost, Australia a great deal in terms of its international reputation. If we were talking about an inefficient scheme, one that was not achieving its mark, one might argue that the government could have acted appropriately in wanting to review it. But in government budget papers, in Budget Related Paper No. 2 on the 1995-96 Australian overseas aid program, there is a report of the review by AusAID which says: The review also found that the DIFF had generated substantial commercial benefits for Australia. This is in addition to the earlier part of the report which talks about the benefits offshore to recipient countries of DIFF. The report goes on to say: Almost all firms surveyed reported that DIFF had been important to their business, with half stating it was either crucial or very important to their operations. Commercial returns from 51 of the 53 projectsinvolving some $285m of AusAID funds-were examined in detail. The 51 projects resulted in expenditure in Australia worth some $709m. Follow-on business already won by companies at the time of the survey, and directly related to the original DIFF project, was estimated at $263m. Firms indicated they expected to achieve further follow-on business, in the order of $400m, by the end of 1994. Companies indicated there was a range of significant, but non-quantifiable, benefits arising from the scheme. For many organisations, a DIFF project was their first overseas contract; several noted that undertaking the project had ""internationalised"" their firm and had changed their focus from solely concentrating on the domestic market to including a significant export orientation in their activities. Other important benefits arising from participation included: establishing credibility in international markets; enabling investments in plant and equipment; fostering new research and development initiatives; gaining international experience for staff; and setting up joint ventures. And so the report goes on. What this government has done is to throw out all those gainsgains which are directly quantifiable in many respects-and also many gains which, while not quantifiable, are clearly contributing and have contributed towards an export culture for Australian enterprises. It is a real tragedy that this has occurred. It has also been very damaging for Australia's international credibility. Media reports last year in the period when Alexander Downer, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, was making a real dill of himself on this issue, make that quite clear. In the Financial Review of 17 May, there is a quote from the Chinese Ambassador which says: ""Should those projects be scrapped off, it would not only cause financial losses on the Chinese side, but also would do no good to the Australian side in terms of its credibility and business interests in China,"" he said. We are all aware that the Prime Minister is visiting China shortly. We wish him success in trying to repair some of the problems and issues that exist in that very vital relationship. But the government's performance in DIFF is undoubtedly one of the significant factors that significantly damaged Australia's position with China. In the same article that I have referred to in the Financial Review, the Philippines Ambassador attacked the government's decision. She said that the abolition of DIFF would be damaging to Australia's image in Asia. It certainly was damaging, and is damaging, in terms of Australia's reputation as a reliable long-term partner in a range of commercial activities. I come back to what, in some respects, is possibly the most important point of all, and that is that this government is putting Australian firms on an increasingly uneven playing field. There is no doubt that the Japanese, German, French, Italian and Spanish companies that will b.e competing for projects throughout Asia, the Pacific and elsewhere, and that are receiving Wednesday, 19 March 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 2517 soft loans or mixed credits from their governments, are going to be in a substantially improved competitive position vis-a-vis Australian companies. That is simply stupidity on the government's part. Foreign Affairs) (11.05 a.m.)-It is my task, in the absence of the minister, to sum up the debate on this bill. It is really rather a small, perhaps technical bill in the greater scheme of things. It has come from a decision made in the process of the 1996-97 budget and it is essentially about improving the efficiency and effectiveness of EPIC, a government business enterprise that is of demonstrated value to our exporters. One of its roles in the past has been to deliver DIFF loans under an agreement with AusAID, the agency that I have some responsibility for. The government announced the scrapping of DIFF last year during the election campaign, a promise that was kept in the budget last year with some adjustment, and formed part of the government's deficit reduction strategy, which is a central plank of our economic policy. An unintended consequence of the use of EPIC in this role was pressure on EPIC's capitalisation, which was adversely affecting its ability to assist exporters in the two markets-Indonesia and China-where DIFF had been concentrating. It is a case perhaps of not wanting to put too many eggs in the one basket. As these loans were very long-term loans-in the case of Indonesia, 25 years-they were tying up a large amount of EPIC's capital. The EPIC board advised the government of this problem, that in effect there were too many eggs in the one basket. As a result, the government decided to remove DIFF's liabilities from EPIC and place them on the government's account. As the government will henceforth be directly assuming some $1.7 billion in liabilities for these loans, it was decided also that EPIC be required to transfer to the government some of the capital that it was holding as a measure against the risk of default on these loans. The figure of $40 million contained in this bill represents less than half the capital tied up by EPIC for these loans. The result is that it will dramatically free up EPIC's ability to provide mediumterm and long-term finance in support of our exporters, and for this reason of course it has the full support of EPIC's board. EPIC will continue to administer these loans and will be paid an administration fee by the government for doing so. The government will, however, be liable to reimburse EPIC for any losses occasioned by loan defaults or other interruptions to payment on the DIFF loans. I have not had perhaps as much opportunity to listen to the arguments put by opposition speakers on this bill, although I welcome their gracious act in supporting it. My friend the member for Chifley( Mr Price) I heard on the monitor as I was preparing to leave my office to make my way to the chamber. I believe he asked whether I had any pride of ownership in Australia's exports-perhaps that is what he meant. I simply ask: does the member for Chifley likewise have pride of ownership in the sort of disruption we see on our waterfronts? Or does he share pride of ownership perhaps in acts such as Mr Kelty's letter to Chubu Electric Power, advising them not to buy Australian coal? If that is the sort of thing that the organisation that supports his party is liable to do, I wonder if he would volunteer that same sort of pride. I have pride in lower interest rates, I have pride in a more flexible labour market, and I have pride in some of those Australian products such as our great wines, for' example. My friend the member for Wakefield ( Mr Andrew) is sitting here beside me and, indeed, I say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, which are the finer wines, those from his electorate or those from yours? This argument could go on-",150,Representatives Main Committee
315,Mr Andrew Thomson (Wentworth,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for2518 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 19 March 1997 but it does illustrate the point that where there is a debate about the quality of this product, it is plain to all of us that our wine is now perhaps the best in the world. It has acquired of its own right and as a matter of its inherent quality a franchise in certain export markets, in particular in Britain and increasingly in Europe and the United States. So in answering some of the arguments that have been put to the committee by members on the other side-such as, 'We have to export more and therefore we have to have some scheme, such as DIFF' I ask, 'Where was the DIFF funding for wine? And if there was no such scheme, why is it that our Australian wines have such a strong grip, such a strong franchise, on their markets?' Did they ever have such assistance? No. them to persuade people to exercise their preference as consumers in other markets and to buildtheir price is comparable to that of products of their competitors from France, California or, lately, Chile-I noticed in Japan that Chilean wines have made a great thrust into the Japanese market-it is on sheer quality, not on some sort of assistance scheme provided by the taxpayer. Frankly, that is about the best example I can draw on to demonstrate the folly of trying to facilitate exports of a product, rather than allowing the conditions to develop whereby its inherent competitive advantage would improve and therefore it would acquire a sustainable grip on an export market, not one that could be dashed by the intervention of another government with a cheque book.

We recognise that is a substantial undertaking for the Food Authority. The opposition also supports the stated intention of the bill to improve the planning and financial management of the Food Authority.

322,Mr Lee (Dobell) (11.12 A.m),"I would like to begin my contribution on the Australia NewWednesday, 19 March 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 2519 The bill enables the government to make substantial savings by cutting funds to the Food Authority. It does so by setting up a process which allows the authority to charge applicants for dealing with their applications. The provisions which give the Food Authority these charging powers are extremely broad. The opposition believes they need to be far more explicit. The basis on which those charges can be levied appears arbitrary and possibly ill thought out. There is certainly not sufficient detail in this bill to demonstrate otherwise. The bill allows the Food Authority to impose charges or to waive them, but it does not provide sufficient information on how or why this will be done. I believe it would be far better if the government had provided explicit criteria for these circumstances. Similarly, it is of concern that there are apparently no guidelines for the Food Authority decisions on which applications will be treated as a priority. There is nothing in the legislation which indicates which particular food groups or applications will be processed free of charge and which will be subject to full cost recovery. I understand that the government might believe that regulations or some other administrative procedures might make that clearer. But, at this stage, the parliament is dealing with this bill unless we can have some draft regulations made available or the government can provide some greater clarity on this. I think that is to be encouraged. It is clearly in the interests of all parties to have a clear and explicit set of rules so that applicants know well in advance what procedures are to be followed and what charges will be involved in any application. It is also important that there be appropriate appeal mechanisms available. My understanding of the bill is that there is no provision for industry to appeal against a decision to impose cost recovery. The government is asking to be taken on trust on this important legislation, and I do not think that is good enough. The opposition has demonstrated in the past that we were prepared to deal constructively with proposals for genuine reform, but we do not look kindly on halfbaked savings schemes, especially not in an industry as important as this, with such enormous potential for future growth in exports. There is a real danger that this legislation, which is being introduced during a period of reform for the Food Authority, will undermine the current reform program-which would be a very unfortunate outcome for the industry and for Australian consumers. Whilst the opposition will not be seeking to oppose the legislation in the House of Representatives, that is on the basis that we understand that the legislation is going to be subject to close scrutiny in the Senate. Of course, the opposition reserves the right to move amendments in the other place. We will be hoping to consult not just with the industry but also with the government, the department and the Food Authority, to try to see if there are some amendments that perhaps in consultation we could put together to try to deal with the concerns that I have raised this morning. Senator Neal, on behalf of the opposition, is certainly willing to sit down with the industry and to see if there are suggestions that can be made for ways to improve the industry'S understanding of how the act will be administered. In my electorate there are two companies which might be known to members of the House and which will be affected by this bill. The Sanitarium Health Food Company and Master Foods have built substantial factories and employ a large number of my constituents. They are members of the Australian Food Council, 2520 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 19 March 1997 which has raised a number of queries about their concerns about the arbitrary powers that are to be given to the authority to fix charges and to place certain levies on applicants. I will quote from one letter from the Chairman of the Australian Food Council, W. Murray Rogers. The letter describes the legislation in these terms: It is extremely disappointing, therefore, that the Government should introduce such broad and one-sided legislation at the very time that the entire industry is seeking to achieve a more cost-effective and efficient system of food regulations which can deliver safer, quality foods to consumers at the most competitive prices. Despite the unfortunate timing of this legislation, the industry will continue to pursue this objective with the Government. And that is certainly the shared objective of the opposition. Before the bill gets to a final vote in the Senate, we hope that we can clarify those concerns. The other issue I want to raise this morning is an issue I am sure some members of this house have heard some of the opposition members raise on many occasions, and that is the issue of chicken meat. I know that this bill does not directly deal with quarantine regulations and imports of chicken meat, but there was a so-called expert on radio this morning stating that he had concerns about the level of antibiotics fed to chickens, and about whether that results in people who consume the chicken meat-and, certainly, people who work with the chickens and are exposed to the antibiotics-having in their bodies viruses which could increase their resistance to these antibiotics. People are aware that there are some very aggressive diseases that are resistant to some of the best antibiotics in the world, and that some of these diseases can cause great distress and illness in some of our hospitals, both public and private. We need to be very careful about how we use antibiotics, in order to make sure that we are not the only century that has the ability to control diseases through the use of antibiotics. I understand that there are probably some industry codes that are followed by the chicken growing industry in Australia, codes that seek to put limits on the levels of antibiotics that are fed to chickens grown in Australia. I would be interested to know the answer to the question I raise in connection with this legislation-even if the minister takes it on notice, as I do not expect an answer off the cuff this morning. If the officials know, I am keen to know whether the Food Authority in Australia does actually set a limit on the level of antibiotics in any of our foods, and in particular, in chicken meat. If we do not do so already, should we have such a limit? In particular, if we do not have any such limits in Australia, what action do we intend to take against the possible importation of Thai chicken meat, which I am informed is subject to much less rigorous standards? Chickens grown in Thailand apparently are fed much larger concentrations of antibiotics. I am sure that means that more chickens survive, but it also means that those of us who consume the chicken meat are ingesting higher levels of antibiotics. In the long term that might mean we have diseases in Australia that are resistant to antibiotics and that may become more common in Australian hospitals. That would be a retrograde step. I know this issue is not directly connected to the bill, but can we get some advice on whether we have any standards on levels of antibiotics? I am not even sure that we can measure these concentrations-because they might be quite low-or whether we simply rely on the practices of various industries to limit their use of antibiotics. As I say, the opposition is generally supportive of the aims of the legislation but we have reservations about the arbitrary powers given to the authority. We would be hopeful that Wednesday, 19 March 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 2521 further consultations with the government and the industry might allow us to clarify, if not resolve, some of those concerns. Food Authority Amendment Bill 1996. This bill will enable the authority to establish a standards review work program which will set priorities for food safety, consumer protection, and international and industry harmonisation issues over the next three years. The bill therefore redresses deficiencies in the current legislation which prevent the authority from having the capacity to plan, manage and prioritise its workload. The amendments change the statutory obligation to finalise applications within 12 months. The authority will no longer have to assess applications on a first come, first serve basis and it will no longer be obliged to assess each application individually. Current requirements have prevented the authority in the past from undertaking comprehensive and thorough reviews of groupings of foods. No-one here would dispute the importance of the Australia-New Zealand food industry. In Australia that industry is worth over $40 billion per year and this figure is, of course, substantially higher when the New Zealand industry is included. We would all agree that Australia enjoys an extremely close relationship with New Zealand, both culturally and geographically. We have no language barriers. We share a common colonial heritage which means that our food, in particular, is similar. It costs less to transfer food between Australia and New Zealand than it often costs to transport it from one side of Australia to the other. Thus this bill, which helps facilitate the food exchanges between the two countries, is of enormous mutual economic advantage to the two countries. New Zealand has a population of 3.64 million and that provides it with a food market in Australia roughly six times that of its own domestic market. New Zealand is our third largest trading partner; the trans-Tasman food trade is now worth more than $1 billion annually. This bill builds on the cooperative and mutually beneficial economic and trade framework first developed under the Australia-New Zealand closer economic relations trade agreement. It is a logical extension of that agreement and it is part of our building on that agreement. We expect that the outcomes of these amendments will provide an even closer model of cooperation, one that other people in this region look to as a model of coordination, cooperation and mutual satisfaction. Already, the closer economic relations trade agreement between Australia and New Zealand has eliminated barriers to trade between the two countries and it has led, in particular, to the creation of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority. In many ways, this authority complements the new Trans-Tasman Mutual Recognition Bill-which was recently in the House and debated in this chamber-which will allow goods legally sold in an Australian jurisdiction to be sold in New Zealand without further testing and vice versa. Producers only have to ensure that their products comply with the laws in the home country in order for them to be available and saleable in the other. The new Trans-Tasman Mutual Recognition Bill, for example, opens up substantially new opportunities in the confectionery and dairy manufacturing areas. We can therefore expect, with the passage of the new Trans-Tasman Mutual Recognition Bill, a substantially greater workload for the Australia New Zealand Food Authority. The amendments contained in this that increased workload. The two bills are a step towards mutual recognition and harmonisation",154,Representatives Main Committee
323,Mrs Stone (Murray) (11.21 A.m.),"I speak today in support of the Australia New Zealand2522 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 19 March 1997 of food standards between Australia and New Zealand and this, of course, has implications for a greater food trade beyond the two countries and into Asia. The National Food Authority-that is, the Australian Food Authority-was formed in 1991, in consultation with industry, governments and the community, to ensure uniformity in food standards across Australia. Australian governments accepted the food standards as recommended by the national authority. In 1995, New Zealand joined and legislation was passed forming the Australia New Zealand Food Authority. This ANZFA initiative allows for a joint food standards setting system for Australia and New Zealand. As I said before, it provides for harmonisation of food standards and consumer information on the ingredients in foods between the two countries. The authority is responsible for developing, varying and reviewing standards for food available in Australia and New Zealand, as well as coordinating national food surveillance and recall systems. The authority is funded by the Australian and New Zealand governments, as well as by industry. In particular, the objectives of the authority in developing or varying standards are, chiefly: the protection of public health and safety; the provision of information to consumers to enable them to make informed choices about foods; to prevent fraud and deception; the promotion of fair trading in food and the promotion of trade and commerce in the food industry. As well, the authority aims to achieve the harmonisation of Australian and New Zealand food standards with international food standards, provided that those standards are not lower than the Australian and New Zealand requirements. At present, we are faced with the unacceptable situation where the Australia New Zealand Food Authority is unable to meet its management objectives, or to effectively develop any comprehensive joint food standard systems or, indeed, to harmonise food standards and consumer information. This situation has arisen due to the current regulatory and legislative framework which, as I mentioned before, places severe restrictions on the authority'S flexibility and ability to control its own targets, priorities and management plans. In particular, the authority needs assistance in achieving its main objectives and targets as it aims to produce a food standards code by March 1998. Given the importance of the growing economic relationship between Australia and New Zealand, it is essential that we address the problems created by the current framework of to be totally efficient are, firstly, that the authority, as I said before, has no control over a number of applications it is legally bound to handle at anyone time. It must accept all applications that meet certain basic criteria. As well, the authority currently has a legal obligation to complete the relevant assessment of each application within 12 months, regardless of the circumstances and where the application fits in relation to public safety or industry priorities. If there is an urgent requirement the authority cannot bend its rules. The authority must assess the applications in order of receipt, effectively on a first come, first served basis, irrespective of any more urgent demands or later applications. The authority also has an obligation to assess each application individually. This leads to a fragmented response and approach to food standards and it undermines the important principle that the National Food Authority has, which is that it should achieve a coordinated, thorough and effective response to assessing food standards throughout Australia and New Zealand. In particular, the authority cannot respond urgently to public health and safety Wednesday, 19 March 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 2523 matters. It must take the products as they come in to it, strictly in order of first in, first to be dealt with. These proposed amendments will help to advance the authority to a position where it will be a leader in the field of setting and monitoring food standards internationally. They will also help, as I said before, to ensure cooperation and the continued advancement of the mutuality between Australia and New Zealand in relation to trade in food products, and in doing so will advance the closer economic ties between the two countries. This new program will be supported by industry, the states, the territories in Australia, and New Zealand. All major stakeholders will be consulted. In terms of setting the new work plans that this amendment makes possible, the industry will be consulted in order to ascertain which priorities are pre-eminent in the industry. The main players will be consulted. They include federal, state and territory governments in Australia, as well as New Zealand. Applications that are given a priority will be assessed within 12 months and without charge. Other applications that do not fall within the new priorities of the three-year work plan will still be accepted and assessed, but on the basis of cost recovery or fee for service. If the relevant charges are not paid, the assessment will be able to be delayed until the charge is paid. This latter amendment is in line with the contemporary approach to cost recovery and with industry cooperation and commitment to their own regulatory regimes. It gives the industry greater flexibility and autonomy. The industry can set its own priorities and it can control its own future. There are a number of recent cases in Australia where the standards of food have caused major community concern. For example, we had a recent scare with Kraft Foods and their peanut products. This is an example where, if you have a more flexible authority, you can have urgent and instant action. We have seen the damage when food safety is allowed to be compromised. In fact, in that case it has cost the industry many millions of dollars both in reclaiming a lost market share and in having to recall their product. Nestle Australia discovered that, under the old regime, if their frozen food is prepared in Australia, New Zealand health standards require that the chicken be cooked for longer than required in Australia, even though in Australia we agree that the cooking times and temperatures are adequate for public health safety. Without harmonisation, Nestle has to have special runs in cooking product that is to be exported to New Zealand. This involves cleaning a line each time and a changeover of production schedules. There is no doubt that food standard harmonisation is essential for costeffective industry. It is also essential for the safety of all consumers. In my electorate, SPC fruit products, the canners, have complained that since New Zealand joined the food authority the time taken to process applications has increased. They have expressed considerable support for these amendments, understanding that under these amendments the times will again be reduced and they can get on with exporting the best possible product with minimum red tape and time required for them to address multiple layers of bureaucracy. As outlined previously, the authority will now be able to charge fee for service for assessments that are not classed as priority issues under their three-year work plan. That is very important for a government which sees industry paying its way. 2524 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 19 March 1997 The national food regulatory framework, and this new ANZFA in particular, underpins consumer confidence in the safety of Australian and New Zealand food supplies. Its maintenance and its standards, its integrity, is therefore of enormous value to both countries and, as I said before, to our exports. As I noted before, industry is one of the main beneficiaries of the work of this authority. Industry will now contribute more substantially to covering the costs but industry will also be a partner in the authority's new ability to be flexible with its work plans. It is a win-win situation all round. The country of origin labelling laws in Australia and New Zealand are a critical part of our food standards, and as we march together to comply with World Trade Organisation standards, new flexible arrangements with the ANZFA bill will make sure that our food labelling is as coherent and transparent as possible, and that our products are immediately recognisable in terms of their contents and their standards of safety. This is a very important bill. The amendments to be introduced will substantially improve our ability as two countries-Australia and New Zealand-to have the world's safest food products. It also means that our products can be seen internationally as being of the highest standard. There is no doubt that, with the markets in Asia burgeoning only a very short distance from us, there is increased emphasis on the quality of the foods that all nations consume. These qualities include being able to identify that there are very few additives, that there are minimum chemical levels, that the food is fresh and absolutely complies with what its labelling states. In fact, this new set of amendments makes sure that, into the future, Australia and New Zealand will be known internationally as countries that produce the best foodstuffs in the world. Dr THEOPHANOUS (Cal well) (11.36 a.m.)-I want to commend some of the positive comments which the member for Murray( Mrs Stone) has made about the National Food Authority. Having been the parliamentary secretary responsible for the authority in the three year period of the last Labor government, and having been involved directly in the negotiation of the treaty which formed the Australia New Zealand Food Authority., I take a keen interest in the development of the authority. It is good to see the officers of the authority here. Having said that, I must say that I am very concerned at a problem which has arisen. The member for Murray was mistaken in her comment that industry is happy with this bill. I do not know where she gets that idea from, because the key industry organisations are very concerned about this bill. I might say thatpay close attention to the comments I am going to make. The situation is that, during the period of the previous Labor government-and certainly when I was parliamentary secretaryall issues concerning the National Food Authority were dealt with in a very consultative way with industry. Indeed, I worked together with representatives from consumer organisations, industry and other stakeholders from state governments. I used to often bring these representatives together, or ask the authority to bring the representatives together, and we would discuss these issues. If a matter arose, as it did, for example, with the country of origin exercise, the labelling exercise which was very long and difficult and where there were significant differences of view, even then we brought people together ..",157,Representatives Main Committee
324,Mr Slipper,Are you opposing the bill?,160,Representatives Main Committee
325,Dr Theophanous,"I will explain what I am doing on the bill-you just keep quiet andWednesday, 19 March 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 2525 Therefore, I was a bit shocked to see that the peak body of the food industry in Australia, the Australian Food Council, has written to the opposition and basically they are so concerned with this bill that they say in their conclusion: Our concerns are so fundamental that the preferred course of action is the withdrawal of the bill pending resolution of the ongoing debate about the imposition of charges in the industry. Simple amendment cannot satisfy these concerns. The industry wrote to the Prime Minister( Mr Howard). We are not just talking about one food industry, we are talking about the Council of Food Industries. They wrote to the Prime Minister expressing their concerns about this bill and the issues that were raised. As I say, what is really puzzling to me is the poor administration in this government which has led to this situation. I do not blame the authority. I do not blame the industry. I blame whoever was responsible in the government-and, of course, it is a bit difficult to determine who was responsible because we have had changes of the relevant parliamentary secretary-but, nevertheless, whoever was responsible has not done his job. A good job has not been done here because you cannot go to the parliament with a bill that is so universally opposed by the major industry with which it is dealing. This is a very reasonable point. As the shadow minister, Michael Lee, has indicated, although we will allow passage of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill 1996, we will be moving amendments in the Senate. Those amendments are intended to take account of the concerns not just of industry but also of others in relation to the issues which have been raised. As I say, I am puzzled that we got to this position because, as someone who was involved so intimatelyvirtually on a daily basis-in matters concerning the National Food Authority, I have been happy to see all the developments in the closer economic relations that have taken place between Australia and New Zealand because of the formation of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority and as a result of the different aspects that we have taken up. It is a unique structure. We are not objecting to the idea that there have to be certain other provisions to deal with the workload of the authority. But the question is: does this bill adequately deal with those? We do not believe that it does. The shadow minister, Michael Lee, indicated that there are certain serious problems because there are not specific regulations put forward. Maybe it is the intention of the government to bring specific regulations to help determine which of these groups are going forward as non fee for service and which are going forward as fee for service. It appears that we do not have any indication of those regulations and that is one of the things that we will be asking to have a look at. One of the concerns raised by the industry is that it is going to give the food authority the ability, as it is presently worded, to charge willy-nilly in relation to the industry. There are two basic concerns. Firstly, because it is unclear which are going to fall within the charged group and which are not-and it is left very much up to the authority-there will be a real risk that the authority increasingly and effectively will, as the letter from the food council says, push applications into the fee for service category and levy charges at any figure it determines, subject to the taxation caveat discussed in the legal opinion which has been presented on this matter. It seems to me that this objection has not been dealt with. No-one is saying that the authority is inefficient, or anything of that sort, but let us assume that under the current administration anything can happen. If we have a situation in the future, there could be an incentive for the 2526 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 19 March 1997 authority, as the food council says, to push applications into this fee for service category when they should have been in the other category, and then impose further burdens on the industry. Already we are saying that one of the reasons we formed the Australia New Zealand Food Authority was that we wanted to streamline the determination of food standards at the state level, at the federal level and with New Zealand into the one body, to have not only uniformity for consumers but also efficiency in terms of the charges which are put on industry. I do not think that it is an unreasonable request from industry to seek clarification of this. One has to ask why the Prime Minister has not responded to these concerns of industry which were raised with him by the chairman of the Australian Food Council on 9 December 1996. I would be interested to see what the minister's answer is to that. The situation is that we are interested in getting this bill through and in getting the main ideas of this bill through, but we are not going to support clauses which effectively are going to totally alienate the very industries that the food authority is supposed to be dealing with. That would be totally counterproductive and I cannot understand why this has taken place. I will now go to the other point, which is this question of the authority having the ability to determine which applications fall within, and which fall without, its predetermined work programs. In principle, that does not sound too bad, and one might say that they can have a look at the work program. But one has got to ask: if the authority is aware of the situation, and it knows that some applicants have a good ability to pay and others do not, then it might be tempted to predetermine its work program on the basis of saying, 'We know that this lot is not going to have the ability to pay, and we know that this group has the ability to pay.' Therefore, an arbitrary selection, or a selection based on the possible ability of the applicant to pay rather than on the merits of the work program, could make a determination. This reinforces the need for some kind of regulation or indication about the work program to be put in the context of this bill. It is true that the industry does have a representative on the committee looking at the work program but, of course, there is no necessity for that representative to be listened to. I think that in dealing with industry-at least this was my experience when I was parliamentary secretary--especially in this regulatory area, it is always good to have them on side about these matters. It is not as if the industry says, 'We will not pay.' One of the things that I certainly achieved, and even my predecessors achieved, was the agreement of industry to pay their fair share in this process for the National Food Authority. But when there are concerns about equity, when there are concerns about the application of the system, it is time for the authority and the minister responsible to talk again to industry and come out with some resolution. That is the general structure of my comments about the bill but I want to say that we can resolve this in a positive way if the minister wishes to discuss it with the industry. We in the opposition are happy to discuss it. In other words, I am talking here about a constructive resolution of the problem. We think that it is possible to bring together industry, other stakeholders and the Food Authority to find a way out of this impasse and achieve the goals of allowing the authority to have certain structured work programs, as well as achieve the goals of equity and of an efficient charging system-and keep the parties quite happy in the process. This is not an impossible job. I can say that there were much more impossible and difficult jobs than this one that the Food Authority and I had to negotiate. The honourable member for Murray referred to one of those. We have to take a grip on ourselves and ask, 'Do we really Wednesday, 19 March 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 2527 want a battle in this situation?' I have indicated very clearly that, if the government persists with this approach, we will move amendments in the Senate and we will seek to gain the support of the minor parties for our amendments so as to be sure that the concerns of industry and of others are met in relation to the comments that I made. I conclude by saying something about the interrelationship between the Food Authority and the recent actions that have been taken to move everything back to state governments. I give a word of warning, now that we are discussing the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill, about the general tendency of the coalition government to push things back onto the states. I hope that we are not going to be tempted to hand back powers that currently exist in the Food Authority to the state governments. One· of the things that came out during the period I was parliamentary secretary was the frustration we had about the fact that far too many of the features that involved ensuring that the rules and the laws were actually met rested on state governments. We should be thinking about a national enforcement regime in food standards if we are really going to try to prevent the sorts of sensational cases that happen, such as when the little girl died in Adelaide because of salami poisoning. That had a dramatic impact on the whole of that industry for a long time. When we look at what happened, the Food Authority had done everything properly. The problem was that the government of South Australia had not, in terms of enforcement of food standards. The minister who is going to be responsible for the Australia New Zealand Food Authority in the future should be aware that we need to look at that issue. It is all very well to set standards, to have consumer protection councils looking at things and to have proper labelling-and that has been one of the big issues on which ANZFA has done a great job-but in the final analysis, you have to look at the enforcement of standards. This is where many of the state governments have starved it of resources, and yet they feel when it suits their interests that perhaps they ought to think about taking back some of the powers that have been given to the Food Authority. I think any such pressure should be totally resisted. We should be looking at the opposite, which is to increase the powers of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority in the enforcement area. (Time expired) my colleagues in this place on the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill, it is obvious that the Australia New Zealand Food Authority is held in fairly high regard. as is the work it has done since it was established in 1995. The aim of this bill is to enable the Food Authority to better manage, plan and prioritise its workload. I suspect that no-one would be opposed to such an idea. It is important that Australia maintains its reputation for clean food. It is eminently sensible, given the closeness of the relationship between this country and New Zealand, that we have cooperative arrangements such as that set up when the National Food Authority became the Australia New Zealand Food Authority in 1995. That legislation enabled the full participation of New Zealand, with the aim of having common food standards and common food quality between the two countries across the Tasman. Increasingly, we are becoming a single market. It has been pointed out that it is wise, wherever possible, that common standards exist. The honourable member for Cal well (Dr Theophanous) stressed the need for a national approach and for national standards. Most people",160,Representatives Main Committee
326,Mr Slipper (Fisher) (11.56 A.m.),"When one listens to many of the comments made by2528 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 19 March 1997 would agree that it would be ridiculous to vary standards but, equally, it would be a nonsense to have differing standards in Australia and in New Zealand. I wish to question, however, the competence of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority in the way in which it seems to be determined to damage the health of Australians by increasing the level of cadmium which is permissible in foods. The Australia New Zealand Food Authority has failed to consult widely with respect to its proposal to increase the level of cadmium from 0.05 milligrams per kilogram to 0.1 milligrams per kilogram. This approach by the Australia New Zealand Food Authority has concerned me greatly. While I support the principles of this legislation, I am worried that within the legislation we find that the Australia New Zealand Food Authority is able to bring forward proposals which will undermine the productivity and incomes of Australian food producers. In addition, it will be placing in jeopardy the health of Australians of various ages. I have received numerous representations from around my electorate from people who are extremely concerned at the proposal to increase the acceptable cadmium levels in foods and, in particular, in peanuts. Until recently it was considered gospel that cadmium is extremely dangerous in foods beyond 0.05 milligrams per kilogram. Research has indicated that long-term exposure to cadmium might lead to considerable accumulation in the liver and kidneys, particularly in the renal cortex, resulting in liver damage. The Australian and New Zealand Food Authority recently decided that cadmium levels could safely be increased to 0.1 milligrams per kilogram without affecting the health of consumers. This appears to run contrary to research done throughout the world which indicates that what we should be doing is seeking to reduce the level of cadmium, rather than increasing it. Yet the Australia New Zealand Food Authority appears to be heading along the direction of increasing the level of cadmium. I see that as being totally unacceptable and I hope that the Food Authority rethinks this proposal. It ought to be noted also that the main argument advanced by the food authority for increasing the level of cadmium, particularly with respect to peanuts, is that this is a non-tariff barrier excluding the importation of peanuts to this country. The simple fact is that every peanut producing country in the world can meet the Australian standards for cadmium and I have to ask: why should the Australian New Zealand Food Authority seek to expose the Australian public to twice the cadmium level when there is simply no need? At present, there is no restriction on the importation into Australia of peanuts which meet the current guidelines as peanut producing countries throughout the world have no difficulty in meeting the standards which we currently have. Australian producers, and particularly those in the South Burnett and Kingaroy areas of my electorate, have worked very hard over many years to ensure that their peanuts are as free as possible from cadmium and other residues. Cadmium is a heavy metal that is possibly a major contributor to kidney disease and it can cause bone disorders. High risk groups include young children, pregnant women, vegetarians and smokers. Given the very real concerns and the fact that there has not been adequate consultation, I think it is important that the Australian New Zealand Food Authority re-considers this matter. There have been some studies done in Sweden and I wish to refer to an article in a publication in August 1996. It says: ... exposure to cadmium can give rise to a tubular kidney dysfunction which may proceed to a more generalised renal damage and bone disease if exposure has been high and prolonged. Recent scientific Wednesday, 19 March 1997 MAIN COMMITfEE 2529 work shows that early renal effects develop at lower levels of exposure than previously anticipated. Previous risk assessments for cadmium were mainly based on studies on healthy male workers. The general population, however, also include particularly susceptible groups such as elderly and individuals with illnesses (e.g. diabetes) that may predispose the cadmium-induced health effects. A significant proportion of the general population displays early signs of toxicity already at urinary cadmium concentrations around 3 mmol creatinine. In addition to early tubular effects, cadmium may exert direct or indirect effects on mineral metabolism and the materialization of the skeleton at relatively low levels of exposure. This may have important health implications as poor and easily fractured bones is a major problem among the elderly in all industrialised countries. It is interesting to note that in Sweden the cadmium content in wheat has increased during the 20th century, but that concentrations in Swedish food are still much lower than in food from, for example, cadmium polluted areas of Japan. The article says: Comparisons between the Cd concentration in human kidneys preserved at anatomical museums in Sweden and in kidney samples obtained in recent decades show that the kidney and body burdens of Cd have increased severalfold during the last century. There is no reason to believe that the situation in Sweden with regard to cadmium pollution is worse than in many other places and clearly cadmium pollution is a global problem. So, in the face of this evidence from Sweden, we find the Australian New Zealand Food Authority is moving to increase the level at which food in this country is able to be riddled with this heavy metal. This is absolutely unacceptable. It is interesting to note, too, that the National Food Authority had a cadmium workshop in Canberra in 1995 where it was considered that all regulatory bodies should work to put in place a strategy to minimise the exposure of the Australian population to cadmium by reducing cadmium in fertilisers and by maintaining maximum permissible content. Therefore, the activities of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority appear to be running contrary to the recommendations from this particular workshop. I believe that the food authority really has a case to answer. The Food Authority ought to be looked at very closely. This legislation currently before the House is legislation which is supported broadly by both sides of politics. Clearly, it is important not to force the authority to divert all of its resources to the handling of applications and that, indeed, it ought to get on with its other work. I have no complaint with any of that but my constituents are extremely concerned that the authority seems determined to double the level of cadmium which is deemed to be acceptable in Australia. There were two proposals to go before the Commonwealth, state, territory and New Zealand ministers for health and these were proposals 148 and 144. Proposal 148 sought to double the permitted levels of cadmium in peanuts from 0.05 milligrams per kilogram to 0.1 and proposal 144 seeks to achieve a general increase in permitted cadmium levels. I have outlined the situation in relation to peanuts and how this could create increased health problems for Australians. It now seems, however, that the Food Authority has said that while it is not going to proceed with proposal 148, which deals with peanuts in isolation, it is going to impose increased cadmium levels on all Australians in relation to all food products. That is clearly unacceptab Ie. It is interesting to note that a very reputable member of the Queensland community, in fact, the president of the Queensland grain growers association, has opposed strongly what is proposed by the Australia New Zealand Food Authority. It is very hard to find supporters out there in the community for the proposal of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority. I have heard it reported that pressure is being imposed on the ANZ Food Authority because 2530 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 19 March 1997 apparently there has been a consignment of condemned peanuts already in the country and the intention is to increase the level of cadmium to permit these condemned peanuts to be inflicted on the Australian community. I think the Australia New Zealand Food Authority needs to answer some questions here. It is unacceptable that the authority should be acting contrary to the health interests of Australians. All of the evidence, both in Australia and elsewhere, shows that we should be moving towards reduced cadmium levels and yet the Australia New Zealand Food Authority seems hell bent on doubling the maximum permissible levels in Australia. As the Swedish studies indicate, such an action by the authority could well impact on the health of not only young Australians but also older Australians. However, the government is to be commended for this legislation. It will improve the procedures of the Food Authority. It will enable the authority to concentrate not on applications but rather on the very major projects at which the Food Authority is looking. I ask at this stage that the government, and particularly the minister, look closely at the authority's advocacy of doubling the levels of acceptable cadmium in Australian food with a view to preserving the present levels which I believe is in the interests of reasonable health standards for Australians. I commend the bill to the Committee. debate on the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Bill, particularly as the standards that apply to Australian food are of such essential importance to every Australian. It is true that we have an image of which we are justly proud, an image as a clean and green producer of Australian food. In fact, we have a reputation as a country which ensures that most Australian consumers can be assured that what they pick up from the shelf of Australian supermarkets, or acquire through their retailers, comes with recommendations that ensure that the health of the consumer will not be put at risk. It is fair to say that so good is our reputation as the provider of clean and green food and foodstuffs that Australians generally take that reputation for granted. The member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) in his participation in this debate referred to the very tragic circum-tances surrounding the Garibaldi case-a case with which I am familiar because the young girl who died as a result of the food poisoning contracted in the Garibaldi case happened to be resident in my electorate. That, mercifully, is very much the exception. Every Australian travelling overseas returns to Australia breathing a sigh of relief that the standards applying here are so much more rigorous than those applying in other countries around the globe. In fact, in order to ensure that the standards are consistent trans-Tasman, that there is a level of cooperation between Australia and New Zealand in policing Australian food standards, we have in place the Australia New Zealand Food Authority. It is the amendments to the act that has set that authority in place that we are dealing with in this debate this afternoon. It is fair to say that Australians, as I indicated earlier, tend to take food standards for granted. It is also fair to say that the focus of this debate has been on the opposition's particular concern about the proposal in the amendments that we are considering in this debate to allow the Australia New Zealand Food Authority to charge for some of the services that it offers. I understand the concerns expressed by the opposition, although I thought it was a little inconsistent for the member for Calwell to say that he was desperately bothered about all of this, but he would not oppose the legislation. I also felt it was a little inconsistent for the",163,Representatives Main Committee
327,Mr Andrew (Wakefield) (12.09 P.m.),"I welcome the opportunity to participate in thisWednesday, 19 March 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 2531 member for Dobell( Mr Lee) to imply that there was some sort of inadequate standard being policed in Australia and that, under existing arrangements in Australia, so far as he knew, it may be possible for higher levels of antibiotics to apply in Australian food than he would find acceptable. In my participation in this debate I want to pick up two points. Firstly, I want to make a comment or two about what I see as the general standard of Australian food and, secondly, to refer specifically to the legislation and the proposal to allow the Australia New Zealand Food Authority to make some charges for some of the services that it is delivering. My background, as most of the parliament knows, has been in the food industry as a fruit grower. I can reassure this chamber and the parliament that standards do apply and that every fruit grower is conscious of that in terms of the fruit supplied to any retail outlet across Australia. The member for Calwell is to be commended, as indeed is the former government, for the work done in bringing state and national standards into some sort of uniformity. That was important. I thought the member for Calwell might have been a little more generous in his remarks, had he recognised that part of the Garibaldi disaster had occurred as much under a Labor Party state administration as any other. But that sort of generous comment was not something that he was volunteering in this debate. Nonetheless, as the parliamentary secretary he played a key role in ensuring that these standards were made uniform. The result of this is that food producers, food processors and food retailers across the nation are obliged to adhere to a standard which ensures that spray residues, antibiotics, and any other things that are seen as deleterious to human health are kept to an absolute minimum; a minimum that is seen as more than adequate by any of the other standards applying around the globe. As a fruit grower, I was obliged to ensure that if any form of spray had been used on the fruit that was being produced then that fruit was not harvested until it had met particular withholding periods. I also knew, as did all of the people who were fruit growers around me-and that includes those people from ethnic backgrounds who were without the same capacity to soak up the immediate information as those with European backgrounds automatically were-that anyone of the deliveries made to, say, a fruit processor or a fruit canner had to meet minimum standards and that there would be random regular selections of processed fruit off the line that would be assessed for its contaminant free status. So Australians, generally, have little to fear from the foods that they consume and from the standards that are applied. Of course there are exceptions. The member for Cal well focused on one of those exceptions. The most recent food scare, which concerned the Amott's biscuit chain, had nothing to do with producers or processors, but very much to do with what was little more than a terrorist attack. Nonetheless, the Australian community and Australian retailers ensured that every step was taken to make sure that Australian consumers could be assured that the food they were consuming was of the very highest possible standard. The Australia New Zealand Food Authority was set up so that we could ensure that the standards that apply across Australia would apply across the Tasman, in New Zealand. The first point of the authority was to develop and maintain an Australia New Zealand food standards code. The second was to develop and implement new hygiene standards for food processing, manufacturing and handling. The third was to ensure that national arrangements were in place for the surveillance and for compliance with the code. This has largely been successful. 2532 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 19 March 1997 But, as a result of the involvement of the New Zealanders in what was once an Australian standard, we now have a situation in which the workload that the authority is facing is larger than it can reasonably process in order to meet the March 1998 deadline originally set down for the authority to have firm trans-Tasman arrangements in place. The authority has come to the government saying that it has no control over the number of applications made to it for compliance with these standards and that it is obliged under the existing legislation to deal with the applications on a first come, first served basis, so it cannot accurately assess the relevant importance of some applications over others-and even if it could, it cannot process them as it would choose to. It also has the problem that every application that comes to it must be individually assessed, even if it parallels another application on which the authority has already made a determination. For those reasons, the authority has asked for these changes. The member for Cal well has said that the changes proposed do not meet with the approval of the Australian Food Industry Council. He indicated that the particular concern the council had was a concern over the charging regime, and the member for Dobell tends to have reinforced that point. What has been overlooked in this debate is that the advice of the Attorney-General( Mr Williams) on the charging regime that is being proposed is that any fee charged under this legislation must be related to the expense incurred. The Attorney-General has indicated that some of the activities cannot be characterised as a service and, consequently, the costs will not be fully recovered, so there is still an obligation on the government to make an input into the way in which the Australia New Zealand Food Authority goes about exercising its important task. Furthermore, the Attorney-General's office has indicated that existing constitutional arrangements mean that we cannot impose a charge which would constitute a tax. So much of the concern expressed, justifiably, by the member for Calwell on behalf of the Australian Food Industry Council is a concern that the government knows is unfounded. This is not a proposal to find a way to tax the industry. In fact, the industry should be aware of that. The government not only indicates that in the second reading speech by the Minister for Family Services( Mrs Moylan), but it is reinforced by the advice gained from the Attorney General's office. I will quote a portion of the minister's second reading speech where she said: The bill: . pennits regulations to set the amount of the charges and to waive, remit and refund charges in whole or in part; and . specifically limits the level of the charge to recovering the authority's expenses in assessing an application. I therefore suggest that much of the concern expressed about this charge regime is unfounded and is, in fact, scaremongering. There is no intent by the authority or the government that these charges should provide a revenue raising measure for the government. I want to pick up a couple of other points that have come out of this debate and reinforce the remarks made by the member for Murray( Mrs Stone) when she said that, in her own electorate, the SPC people had found, following the movemeni of New Zealand into the authority to make the Australia New Zealand Food Authority complete, that there had been delays in their processing applications that they were anxious to have accelerated. The legislation before the House is designed to allow the government to accelerate these applications and, as I said earlier, to meet the 1998 deadline. Wednesday, 19 March 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 2533 This is important, because there is a great number of opportunities for food processors, not only in exports to New Zealand-which are already very important to us-but, furthermore, in exports to other APEC countries. These opportunities will best be resolved when we can maintain our clean and green image through the successful operation of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority. This bill allows the operation of that authority to be enhanced. I am pleased to support it. the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill. The bill amends the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Act 1991 to overcome operational limitations within the current principal act. The proposed amendments to the bill will enable the Australia New Zealand Food Authority to better plan, manage and prioritise its workload. The background to this bill is that the principal act amended by this bill was originally the National Food Authority Act 1991. The main goal of the authority is to provide a national focus within Australia for cooperation between governments, industry and the community in developing a safe and wholesome food supply. It is that topic that I wish to address, because one of the most important things for Australia is that it has enjoyed a very strong reputation overseas for clean, wholesome food products. It indicates how important it is, not only in our relationship with New Zealand but also-as the member for Wakefield ( Mr Andrew) mentioned-with our near Asian neighbours, and the wonderful opportunities that that provides for Australia to provide food to what we now term 'the supermarket to Asia'. I was delighted to hear recently of the move by the Prime Minister( Mr Howard) to create the Supermarket to Asia Council. The Australian food industry is one with tremendous potential to generate wealth, jobs and exports for Australians. It is one of the largest sectors of the Australian economy, with retail sales and exports valued at $64 billion. Exports of food in 1995-96 were $15 billion, with approximately 40 per cent of these exports going to Asia. The industry's potential for further growth is considerable because of the natural production advantages in Australia and its proximity to rapidly growing markets for food in Asia. This Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill ensures that both Australia and New Zealand reach agreement on joint food standards. It is imperative that New Zealand and Australia are in a position to present a united force to the Asian opportunities which are currently available. The diets of Asians are becoming more westernised, and this is creating new opportunities for the export of food products like meat-and I relate that to my own electorate where we produce beef, lamb and pork-dairy products, horticulture and grains, as well as a number of other very important primary products and foods which are suitable for inclusion in the strategy that the Supermarket to Asia Council is embarking on. The Supermarket to Asia Council was established by the Prime Minister and, without having the bill in place that we are dealing with in this House, we cannot ensure that food standards and consumer information on the ingredients in those foods are compatible between Australia and New Zealand. We need to ensure that, if Asian customers are looking at a supplier from within the Australia-New Zealand providers who are emerging in the marketplace and they are looking for food products, obviously they are going to be looking for the standard of quality, ingredients and information that is provided between those two countries to be compatible and",166,Representatives Main Committee
328,Mr Reid (Bendigo) (12.21 P.m.),"I am pleased to have the opportunity to comment on2534 MAIN COMMITIEE Wednesday, 19 March 1997 for there to be closer cooperation between Australia and New Zealand to harmonise those things. That is very important. Under the terms of this legislation, I am delighted to see that we are, in fact, bringing Australia and New Zealand much closer together in the standards that they provide, particularly on their consumer information on the ingredients. This is a complaint that a lot of members, I am sure, would receive in their electorate offices from time to time. People ask what the ingredients are in a lot of the products on the supermarket shelves, and there is no doubt that people who visit a supermarket these days have a pretty close look at the labels to make sure that they know what the ingredients are. It is important because of our close economic relationship with New Zealand that those standards are harmonised and, in fact, that there is close cooperation between the two countries. The proposed amendments will enable the authority to complete the major task of a three year standards review work program. Support and agreement to this program will set priorities for a food standards review and will involve negotiations with the food industry. I think that this is important because I just heard my colleague, the honourable member for Wakefield, who obviously had some discussions with the Food Industry Council of Australia. They have written to me also on this matter. They were concerned about the charges and I just arrived in the chamber in time to hear the honourable member for Wakefield address that question. I know the minister has made a note of that and, no doubt, will respond in the latter part of this debate. I have not had the opportunity of meeting with them but I am sure that those concerns of the Food Industry Council of Australia will be allayed by the minister. But it is important that we have full negotiation and consultation with the food industry, the states and the territories, and New Zealand in the implementation of this bill. I will leave my remarks at that point. I welcome the bill and support the initiative to bring both New Zealand and Australia much closer together. We already enjoy closer cooperation under the economic cooperation which we have between New Zealand and Australia and I welcome this further move. amends the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Act to implement provisions which will enable the Australia New Zealand Food Authority to focus its resources on issues which are of critical importance to both countries. They include: the development, establishment and management of the Australia-New Zealand food standards code; the development and implementation of the new hygiene standards for food processing, manufacturing and handling, and the development of improved and consistent national arrangements for surveillance and compliance. This bill will enhance the authority's ability to undertake these important tasks. It is important that we maintain set standards and that, as a nation that closely competes with New Zealand in a lot of these areas, particularly as far as fresh food is concerned, we maintain close links as far as common standards are concerned. I certainly would like to add my support to the amending bill, the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill, in that regard. It is important that we maintain that close liaison with New Zealand and maintain a high level of standards in this area.

330,Mrs Moylan (Pearce,"Minister for Family Services) (12.30 p.m.)-in reply-As is statedWednesday, 19 March 1997 MAIN COMMITfEE 2535 workload. I know that there have been many compliments paid to the Australia New Zealand Food Authority by colleagues this morning for the work that it does but, as with any authority, from time to time things change and it needs to adjust its practices. It is important for us to have a look at the underlying reasons why we need to address some of the pressures on management and the growing workload on this authority. It is enormously important that Australia's food standards are dealt with in a timely manner so that we can continue to have public confidence and good public health practice in this country. We also cannot overlook the fact that the enhancement of the industry's ability to compete domestically and internationally has a very important economic purpose. We have also heard today from my colleagues just how important the food industry is in Australia and, indeed, it is an industry that is worth $40 billion. The current act requires the authority to assess, within a 12-month time frame, all applications made to it to vary the food standards code. This means that applications have first call on the authority resources regardless of their relative importance or their priority in the whole scheme of things. In practice, this has meant that resources have been diverted from the more important tasks, such as the review of food standards and the development of a joint Australia New Zealand food standard code, in order to deal with the sheer volume of applications that come in. The impact of the new bill will be to enable the authority, firstly, to allocate its resources to an agreed work plan that incorporates public health and industry and, of course, consumer priorities. It is immensely important, as I said, that we have public confidence in the system that we have in place. The second part of the legislation enables the authority to ensure a review of the entire food standard code and that it is completed in a timely manner, not interrupted by perhaps less important code changes. An important part of this legislation will allow for a charge for goods it produces, as well as for the existing power to charge for services and to waive fees, for example, for all work done in relation to the agreed work plan including, and in particular, public health priorities. The member for Dobell( Mr Lee) did raise some points that I would like to cover in the operation of this bill. The first point that he raised was the fact that the detail was not available. I am a little surprised at his comments because we all know in this place that it is hardly unusual for the main bill to come without those detailed principles in the first instance. But the detail will be scrutinised by the House and the Senate in the form of regulations to be introduced. The powers are not arbitrary; they are subject to disallowab1e instruments. The member for Dobell also sought details of priorities for setting out the work plan. I have to say that, again, I am a little surprised at the member's criticism here about not having detail because I understand that in the principal act the three key criteria are clearly set out. They go to issues of importance in terms of public health, consumer information which would prevent fraud and, of course, consistency within the industry and the elements of fair trading. So the three main priorities, or criteria if you like, for work to be progressed are set out clearly in the principal act. In addition to that, we also have a priority for setting a work plan. The first phase of this process has already been advertised in the national press and consultations have commenced with the state and territory governments and with the New Zealand government. Consumers and industry will also be part of that process. The member for Dobell also stressed the 2536 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 19 March 1997 importance of the food standards review. Given that they see this as an important priority, this bilI will ensure that the project can be progressed and it cannot progress in a timely manner without this bill being passed. The member for Dobell raised an issue about the level of antibiotic residues in food and I understand from the department that the food standard code does set limits on residues of antibiotics in foods, whether they be domestic or imported. We can always provide specific detail of that to the member for Dobell, should he wish for that information. The member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) also made some comments, not unlike those from the member for Dobell, about the detail that was necessary. As I said, that will come forward in the regulations. His other concern was about a letter received from the Australian Food Council, a peak industry body. I think it is fair to say that the main concern in that letter revolved around the charging practices and, as I have said, the detail of those practices will come forward in the regulations and be scrutinised by this House and, indeed, by the Senate. It is important to convey to the House that there has been considerable consultation with the industry and, in particular, with the Australian Food Council-as I understand it, as recently as earlier this month. The industry's difficulties have been discussed and wiII be put into context through the associated regulations that will come before the parliament. The concerns raised are important but they can be dealt with properly through the foreshadowed disallowable instruments. The bill ensures that we protect what is a critical program that is important in the interests of public health and public confidence in the system. It also assists our industry to enhance its ability to compete, both domestically and internationally. This bil1 will al10w the authority to work with industry, consumers, the states and territories, and New Zealand in addressing, as a high priority, the food standard changes. Icommend this bill to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

This bill is about removing legislative impediments to the implementation of reforms in the electricity industry.

332,Mr Miles (Braddon,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (12.39 p.m.)-IWednesday, 19 March 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 2537 To do this, the bill will amend part IlIA of the Trade Practices Act 1974, the principal act. Part IlIA includes provisions whereby third parties can seek access to services provided by essential infrastructure facilities of national significance. These provisions are an important feature of Australia's national competition policy reforms. They promote competitive markets in order to improve efficiency and service delivery. The amendments to part IlIA will provide a legislative framework to support reforms in network industries where a co-regulatory approach, as an alternative to direct regulation, is being used to implement pro-competitive market structures. This approach, which is being pursued in the electricity industry, involves the development of a code of conduct by industry participants and governments, setting out market rules, including rules about third party access to network infrastructure. In order to implement the access provisions of the code, it is envisaged that network service providers will offer access undertakings to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, later referred to as the commission, under part IlIA, setting out obligations in relation to network access. These undertakings are enforced by the Federal Court, upon application by the commission. There are, however, a number of shortcomings with the principal act which would prevent the timely implementation of this approach to access regulation. Firstly, the principal act requires the commission to undertake multiple public consultation processes before such arrangements can be established: one in relation to the code, if the code requires authorisation under part VII of the principal act, and others in relation to the access undertakings of individual service providers. This unnecessary duplication of public consultation processes is an inefficient way of processing access undertakings in network industries, and runs the risk of unduly delaying progress towards more competitive infrastructure industries. Also, it may be difficult for the commission to assess whether separate access undertakings will achieve coherent industry-wide access arrangements. Secondly, the principal act requires an undertaking to set out a high level of detail about the terms and conditions of access. Accordingly, an undertaking cannot include a maximum price or a formula with factors which are reset from time to time. Inclusion of highly detailed terms and conditions about access may be undesirable and impractical in certain network industries, such as the electricity industry, where an industry-wide approach to access is to be adopted. Thirdly, the principal act does not enable an access provider to confer power on the commission to make decisions about access issues pursuant to an undertaking. For example, in the case of access to the national electricity grid, it is envisaged that undertakings will provide for the commission to make decisions which will affect the price for access, in accordance with criteria set out in the undertakings. The bill will address these shortcomings by setting out a process whereby the commission can accept industry access codes, following public consultation. Each access code would set out rules about access for the industry. Once the commission has accepted an access code, the commission can accept access undertakings in accordance with the code, without the need for further public consultation. This process allows for the development of coherent access arrangements through a single consultation process. Furthermore, the bill will relax the level of detail required in an access undertaking. The appropriate level of detail will be determined by the commission and access providers, on a case-by-case basis. 2538 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 19 March 1997 The bill will also enable access providers to confer power on the commission to make decisions in connection with access. The undertaking would set out how the commission is to make its decisions, along with other relevant ancillary matters. In this regard, an undertaking could confer on the commission a role that is similar to its role under part IIIA of the principal act in relation to declared services, should an access provider choose to give the commission such a role. In addition, the bill includes a provision to preserve the integrity of the competitive conduct rules and authorisation provisions of the principal act. The bill provides that the access provisions in the principal act will not affect the liability of the relevant parties for contraventions of the competitive conduct rules in the principal act. The cost to revenue of the proposed amendments is expected to be nil. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill and I commend the bill to the House. Braddon( Mr Miles), as parliamentary secretary, has given in this place a very different second reading speech to that delivered by the late and lamented Brian Gibson in the Senate, when he was acting as parliamentary secretary to the Treasurer. best way to progress one's interests in the Howard government. The relevant point for this debate on the Trade Practices Amendment (Industry Access Codes) Bill is that the speech is very different because the government brought into the Senate amendments to its own bill, and they were subsequently carried by the Senate. The parliamentary secretary, the member for Braddon, did not mention that, but the essence of those amendments concerns the level of public -consultation in a determination by the ACCC for further undertakings on the access regime. The Australian Labor Party naturally supports the access regime; we introduced it in the Hilmer package of reforms some two years ago. Mr LA THAM-The member for Corangamite will find, in my case, that consistency is a virtue. I am speaking in favour of the competition reforms we introduced in government and which remain in the national interest. The principle is very sound. In the case of infrastructure characterised by monopoly or oligopoly features you should not need to own an electricity power station to retail electricity and you should not need to own a gas pipeline to retail gas. I would also argue that, in the petrol industry, you should not need to own and have tied access arrangements to a petroleum terminal to be an effective retailer in that particular industry. So the concept of downstream access makes sense. It allows a competitive retail, and even a competitive wholesale, market to be established in industries which are essentially vertically integrated and have monopoly and oligopoly characteristics. These are basically infrastructure industries. The bill brought into the Senate is something that we have no problem with. The idea of an industry-wide access code seems to make some sense. The problem the Labor Party has with the provision concerns the amendments that the government put to its own bill in the Senate. They are amendments which minimise the public consultation process. They allow the",172,Representatives Main Committee

336,Mr Mcarthur,"You still support it, though-you often change your mind.Wednesday, 19 March 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 2539 ACCC, without any amount of public notification or public consultation, to determine undertakings after the industry-wide code has been established. I believe, in principle-and I know I am supported throughout wide sectors of private industry in Australia-that the undertakings power and discretion of the ACCC needs to be treated with caution. It is not necessarily good public policy to expand the undertakings capacity of the ACCC without public consultation when there are, within the boardrooms of Australia and in the public arena, a whole set of concerns about the way in which the ACCC has been exercising those powers in the past. I will offer a few examples. The most pertinent is the decision that was made with regard to the merger between Ampol and Caltex. Ampol was allowed to merge with Caltex on the basis that they would divest certain terminal facilities and would provide certain access undertakings to their terminals, but it left an inconsistency in the industry structure. AmpolCaltex has divested and Ampol-Caltex provides some limited access, but BP, Shell and Mobil do not. Now we have an aggressive campaign by Ampol-Caltex to try to apply those same standards of access to its three main competitors: BP, Shell and Ampol. It is not the role of the competition regulator, like the ACCC, to set one standard of regulations for one company in an industry and have the other three major competitors under a different set of industry rules. But that was the net effect of the ACCC discretionary use of the undertakings power in that industry. This was an instance of industry moulding-industry moulding in the case of petrol, the world according to Pels-rather than strict industry regulation where the regulations apply equally across the entire industry. That has been a concern to participants in the petrol industry. It has been a concern remarked on by academics around Australia and, from my discussions, a concern with members on both sides of this parliament. Why should Ampol-Caltex have a different set of industry regulations and rules applied to it compared with its three major competitors? If undertakings are to be applied, they should be in the name of fair competition. They should be in the name of equal regulation right across all parts of a particular industry. This was a case of industry mOUlding. The ACCC subsequently produced a report on petrol that used the Ampol-Caltex merger as an argument for retail market entry in the industry. You get more competition because Ampol-Caltex has opened up its terminals, and with extra imports of petrol this could facilitate new retail players in the market. This is an instance where, clearly, the ACCC decision or undertakings in terms of the Ampol and Caltex merger were framed to accommodate the matters ACCC had in mind for its petrol report to the federal government. It was an instance where it was moulding this industry according to its own priorities; moulding the industry in its own image, rather than setting regulations across the board that apply equally and fairly to all competitors in the industry. I am an opponent of industry moulding. I am an opponent of the way in which the ACCC used its undertakings power in the AmpolCaltex case. If it was good enough for Ampol-Caltex to have terminal access imposed upon it by the ACCC, it should be good enough for BP and it should be good enough for Shell and Mobil. That is the best way to cleanly regulate an industry, instead of moulding it, knowing that there is a report coming up to be used in a fashion consistent with the dirty regulation of the petrol industry. That is the first instance that has been raised. I noticed recently, again, criticisms of the ACCC in these matters. Mr John David, the executive chairman of the wholesaler and grocery 2540 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 19 March 1997 retailer, Davids, has accused the ACCC of moving the goalposts to allow Woolworths Ltd into the wholesaling market. I will quote from the Australian Financial Review of 12 March: Mr David told reporters yesterday the ACCC had previously ruled that wholesaling and retailing were the one market for the purposes of making a decision on Davids' acquisition of QIW and Composite Buyers, and was now defining the markets as separate. This is another instance where the ACCC inconsistently is trying to mould industry outcomes-in this case to the benefit of Woolworths-instead of operating as a clean and consistent regulator that applies the same standard across time and the same standard to all participants in a particular industry. That is why the Labor Party is concerned about the government's decision to open up further powers of undertaking by the ACCC in this legislation without public consultation. If the industry code is to be altered by way of the ACCC's discretionary use of undertakings, why should the public not be involved in that process? Why should not all those industry players particularly affected by that decision be notified, be able to make submissions and, moreover, beyond that, why should they not have some power of appeal? Why should there not be a third party appeal right in these particular instances? The parliament is placing too much power and authority in the ACCC when on its track record it is not acting as a clean industry regulator, consistent across time and across the board with market participants. It is acting as a dirty regulator, moulding these industries according to its own priorities. I express that concern in relation to the bill. I further point out to the Main Committee, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the Labor Party has amendments to move in detail. Wf>, seek to use this Trade Practices Amendment (Industry Access Codes) Bill 1996 to apply part 3A access-the downstream access regime-to petroleum terminals. These were amendments that were also moved in the Senate and defeated on the casting vote of Senator Colston in that chamber. The Labor Party will be persevering with those amendments, once the consideration in detail is referred to the main chamber of the House of Representatives. It is a debate that is, of course, relevant to this bill but it does not detract from the support that we can lend to the concept of general industry access code approval processes. It uses this bill, and the parliament's consideration of part 3A of the Trade Practices Act, as a vehicle for establishing downstream access in the petroleum industry. I see no difference between the structure of electricity, for instance, an homogenous product with a vertically integrated structure, and downstream access applying there. There is no difference to the way in which downstream access can be applied in petrol-again, an undifferentiated product with a vertical industry structure. It is interesting to note in that earlier decision by the ACCC that, for the purpose of groceries, retailing and wholesaling are part of the one market. If that standard were applied in petrol, why did the ACCC not recommend some vertical separation? Why are they willing to tolerate the situation where the major oil companies in Australia control the exploration, refining, distribution and retailing through the vertical control and ownership structure in this industry? Why did the ACCC not recommend some element of vertical separation? Why did they not recommend in their report last year the amendments that I will be moving in the Main Chamber; that is, to place the petroleum industry on the access regime, to give every single service station operator and distributor in Australia his or her chance to shop around for the cheapest wholesale petrol? Wednesday, 19 March 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 2541 Those particular concepts, that particular use of part 3A of the Trade Practices Act, is becoming more relevant by the day. I refer to the Daily Liberal, the newspaper in Dubbo where Woolworths has entered the industry. This is a report from last week, 14 March. It says that plunging petrol prices have Dubbo's fuel retailers on the brink of turmoil. One couple is netting as little as $300 for a combined total of 140 hours per week's work, slightly more than $2 per hour. Because Woolworths has got access to cheaper wholesale petrol than the oil majors will provide to their retailers, the whole generation of small businesses around country New South Wales-and it will happen right around the country-is being wiped out because of unfair competition. Why should Woolworths have access to cheaper wholesale petrol that is being denied to existing service stations in country towns? There is a real risk right around the country that these country towns will become planet Woolworths. Woolworths will do all the petrol retailing, all the pharmacy work, all the news agency work, and all the groceries. Every country town will become nothing more than a planet W oolworths where all other business interests are orbiting around the main business interest. That is not healthy at all. There is a legitimate argument to place the petrol industry on the access regime so that these retailers in Dubbo and beyond can access the same cheap wholesale petrol. I am getting into National Party language, aren't I? Someone has got to represent them effectively and it will be the Labor Party that says that those retailers in Dubbo should have the same access to cheaper wholesale petrol that Woolworths enjoys. For a government that talks about industry, entrepreneurialism and small business effort, how can they just sit there and grin at the prospect of small business-the Prime Minister's family once ran a business like this-netting as little as $300 for a combined total of 140 hours of work, all because the government will not accept the principle of fair wholesale competition in the petrol industry? All the government needs to do is tick off the Labor Party amendments in the Main Chamber and these people in Dubbo and hundreds like them around New South Wales and, indeed, the entire country, will have fair access to wholesale petrol and a fair chance to compete against Woolworths. deliver a report. You should always wait for the findings of reports and the findings were inadequate. That is why we are acting now and you should support us. That is the truth of it. It is an opportunity for the National Party to do more than just talk platitudes of lower petrol prices and fair competition in the bush. It is their way to write it into the laws of the Commonwealth. I look forward to that debate in the main chamber. We had a very good debate, as I mentioned, in the Senate on these matters. The National Party, particularly the Queenslanders, went missing. Senator Boswell from Queensland, who talks the language of assisting small petrol retailers around his state, voted against the concept of putting the petrol industry on the access regime. He opposed the means by which these small businesses, these small petrol retailers, can have a fair crack at competition with the likes of Woolworths. If this government does not stand for something better than $300 total income for 140 hours of small business work, then something has gone wrong. There is a big gap between its rhetoric and the way in which its policies are playing out around regional Australia. So the Labor Party will be representing the interests of these people. We will be trying to write their interests into the",174,Representatives Main Committee
