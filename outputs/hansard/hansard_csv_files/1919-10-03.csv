We are now asked to dispose of the motion for its second reading in an hour and fifty minutes; to pass it through the Committee stage in three-quarters of an hour, and to deal with its remaining stages in half an 'hour. I object to such a limitation of the debate. I admit, however, that this will serve as a useful precedent. When the Labour party are in power, they will be able to quote it in support of any proposal they may make to hurriedly rush legislation through Parliament. If the Bill were 0 altered in some respects, I should be quite prepared to recommend, that we pass it through all its stages within the next hour, since I recognise that it is absolutely imperative that action should be taken to nationalize those monopolies which to-day are bleeding white the householders of Australia.

Question so resolved in the affirmative. ister and Attorney-General) [11.14] I move That this B ill be now read a second time. The proposed amendment of the Constitution, as provided in this Bill, differs in two particulars from that to which* this House agreed in 1915, and which, speaking from memory, was the same as that proposed in 1913. The words "" assets and good-will"" are inserted in place of the word "" property,"" which appeared in the 1915 version. This alteration meets an objection raised at the time, and makes that which was held to be ambiguous perfectly clear. We take over the assets and good-will. I declared at that time that the word ""property"" included and covered ... ... ... 30 good-will. ... ... ... 10 ' There is a second alteration. Some honourable members objected to the 1915 20 proposal because Parliament was to have power to make laws for the carrying on of an industry or business by or under Lister, J.

8,Mr Hughes (Bendigo,"Prime MinH i g h Courtf o r inquiry and report. Then the matter comes back to Parliament, and Parliament, having the report before it , can decide for itself what it w ill do. There are no limitations on its power. This measure is limited as set out in clause 3 in precisely the same way as the other amendments of the Constitution contained in . the B ill which the House passed yesterday. with the merits of this proposal, because it speaks for itself. Those who believe in it w ill vote for it , and those who do not will vote against it . But I wish to say a few words now, because this is the only chance I shall have to speak, since those who have been the ardent champions of these Constitution amendments from the time. I first introduced them, w ill see to it that I am not allowed to reply to any of their arguments. of free speech that one speech from me is more than enough for them. therefore, take the opportunity now to say something by way of meeting some of their objections. They w ill say that no objection would be taken by them to this measure if it were not for clause 3j which limits its operation. that objection on its merits, although it has very few merits. Their real objection to this measure is that it is introduced at all. Nothing would have suited them better than that it should not have.been introduced. The operations of this amendment of the Constitution are limited to three years, or to the 31st December, 1920, if a Convention is not called in the meanwhile. I should have thought that that would commend itself to a party which, on three successive occasions, endeavoured unsuccessfully to carry amendments of tbe Constitution, including this very one, because, with this limitation, the measure is more likely to receive the assent of the' people than it otherwise would. The best proof of that lies in the fact that many honourable members of this House are prepared to vote for it with this limitation who would not otherwise do so, and they reflect tlie opinions of a considerable number of people outside. There was a certain small majority against the Bills before. What we want is not merely to put a proposition before the people, but to get them to assent to it , to give this Parliament power. What the honourable gentlemen on the other side want is just a placard, and no more. WhatI want is the power, and it was because of that that I was willing, in 1915, to withdraw these measures altogether if the States would give us the necessary power during the war. I emphasize the fact that every one of those gentlemen agreed in 1915, to the withdrawal of these very measures, or something so similar to them. I do not need to deal that ninety-nine out of every one hundred of them, could not tell one from the other. I venture to say now that if you were to take the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) away from the books that I have written he could not tell one amendment from the other. Not one of them could do so. They do not know anything at all about bhese proposals. They could not tell you why the trade and commerce amendment They are such lovers is necessary; they do not know why the corporation amendment is necessary; I shall, they do uot know anything at all about it . They have to t u r n up that book. They were quite willing to withdraw these proposals in 1915 and agree to a limitation infinitely more cramping than the one contained in this B ill . This proposal I shall deal with stipulates that we shall enjoy these powers for three years, and in the meantime we are to call a Convention and the people of -Australia will decide' for themselves. Last night the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney) spoke about the initiative and referendum. The people are going to decide this thingDo my honourable friends object to the people deciding^ Long before these powers will run out the people will have decided what shape this Constitution is to take. It is a most excellent arrangement, and the clause carries on its face its own justification. ThisB ill , therefore, is not merely to enable this Parliament to deal with monopolies, but in* its very nature insures the calling of a great Convention to deal with these important questions. Honourable members have taken exception to the haste with which we are putting these Bills through. They ask, "" W h y rush them through?"" The honourable member for Yarra( Mr Tudor) said that if they were not rushed through he and his party would, no doubt, be a,ble to make very good Bills of them. As I have said, they do not know anything at all about them. They have not the faintest idea of what they mean. I ask any honourable member to ransack Hansard, from the first day I brought these But Mr Speaker said without any more amendments in until now, and see if any one of them has said one word that exhibited the faintest knowledge of what the whole thing was about, except to repeat that whicli I had said. we are told that if they had plenty of time they would do it , and they object to our rushing the thing throughGentlemen., this dreadful book (Hansard) is like the book which will be opened on the last day, wherein we shall see written in letters of fire those things which we thought we had so successfully hidden 1 while we were sojourning on this earth. It u r n to this dreadful volume, and on page 4319, date, 18th. June, 1915, 1 begin to read. I find, inscribed there a record which,, in view of what my honourable friend said last night, is most diverting, a. little pathetic, and calculated to cause tlie electors furiously to think when they compare what he said with what he did. These Bills were brought before tlie Housei n 1915, when the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) . and I were arrayed under the same banner. The horj-. or able member now says, "" Let there be no haste'; give everybody a chance; let free speech pervade this fair land.; letevery man say what isi n his m in d . "" But this is what he did in 1915; that is to say he and I , and the. honourable mem-. ber for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs), the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton), tlie honourable member for East Sydney( Mr West), the honourable member for Newcastle. ( Mr Watkins), the honourable member for South Sydney' ( Mr Riley), and the honourable member for Brisbane( Mr Finlayson), with numbers of other gentlemen, who are not amongst us to-day-som e have lef t us, some are on a journey, and some, peradventure, axe sleeping-ever y one in the party did it . We took* twenty-three successive divisions without debate, and put through six Bills without any observations, excepting that Mr Fisher, our Leader, made this eloquent speech which Demosthenes, at the top of his fame, could not' have equalledI move that'the question be now put. Thequestion was put, and was resolved in the affirmativei Then ah amendment was put, and that was negatived, where : upon my colleague ( Sir. Joseph Cook), who was then opposed to us made this observationOn a point of orderMr Hughes. to-doffhere can be no point of order. Then the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Kelly) saidHowever, Will you, sir, inform the House what is the question ? Whereupon Mr Speaker informed him , and the honourable member, for Wentworth saidWe call for a division."" Thereupon Mr Speaker said,, "" Y o u . shall have one,"" and; they had one-. T n e d i v i r sion was taken, and the question was'resolved in the affirmative. ThenI made a speech. I saidI movethat this Bill be now read a first time. It was read, a first time, and' then. I made another eloquent speech,.: I saidI. move that this BiU, be now read a second! time. It was read a second time. And so it went, o n ; we took twenty-three divisions, and the task was done. found friends walk out of the Chamber, and allow us to take the divisions without opposition ? mention one honourable member's, name. The honourable, member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Mathews) was also among us. I sat cheek by jowl with him, and we stuck together, and voted together all through those troublous times. port of the debate which preceded those divisions, but which the right honourable gentleman has deliberately omitted to mention. were twenty-three divisions. Why should those who all through their political l if e have believed that these alterations to the Constitution are good, object to haste when the party which they tried, b u t failed, to convert,' has now, according to them, been converted to a belief in theseproposals? In 1915 the Bills were p ut -through in the twinkling of an eye. If haste was good in 1915, then they should say, "" Beholdi t is good to-day."" So much for the accusation Of haste! NowI come to another point. Last night the Leader of the Opposition 6aid that honourable memberson the Ministerial side of the Chamber were dumband blind.",23,Second Reading

12,Mr Hughes,"A t any rate, there'MT. TTJDOR I did not say that they were blind. ber had said that they were deaf, I would not have objected. people of this country have a sense of humour. I know where I am in the matter, and X see the humour of the position; but I want the people of the country to understand it, and see the humour' of it. These honourable gentlemen opposite are actually levelling at the party on this side the charge that, having considered a question at a party meeting, we come down here and vote solidly together. The Leader of the Opposition says that if honourable members on this side were free to express their opinions, they would say so-and-so. I never thought that I should live to hear such a charge from the lips of the honourable member. Coming from such a source, what are we to think of it ? I liave not time to turn up the speeches of the Minister for the Navy( Sir Joseph Cook) about myself, or those in which the honourable .member for Parkes( Mr Bruce Smith) referred to the Labour party; but I can recall .them fairly well. They said, in .regard to the Labour party, "" Here is a party that decides what it is going to do, not on the floor of the House, but in another place."" How many times have ionorable members opposite sat .on these benches, some of them wishing that they .could vote in some other way, but not daring to -say "" boo "" ? ,a Caucus party, but they will not 'admit that they are. ever since. they came into politics, have those honourable members done the very thing with which they charge honourable members on this side? They are the very last persons who should level such a charge against any party. Let me explain to the House and the country the difference between the methods of honourable members opposite and our own. In such a time as this, it is really necessary to make the people understand it. There was a time in the history of the Labour party, when it was a united party, when its members did really decide in the Caucus-room what they should do in the Honse, and what policy they should have. As long as they , did that, I remained a member of the party; I took my chance as a free man on the floor of the Caucus, and if I was beaten I was willing to abide by the will of the majority; but there came a day, and that day is still Thank God, the with us, when 'they were no longer free -men to say what they thought, even in Caucus, but were like dumb, driven dogs. In view of the limited time for the discussion of this important measure, I .should like to know whether the Caucus meetings of the Labour party .at the time the Prime Minister was connected with it have any relevancy to the Bill. .Johnson):-Strictly speaking they have not ; but certain charges have been levelled at the Prime Minister associated with the introduction of the Bill to which he is now replying. I cannot in fairness deny him the right of rebuttal, as he will not have another opportunity. I remind the honourable member that a similar discussion was permitted on the previous Bill, which is of the same character as that under discussion. literally true; and it is due to that fact that I am where I .am and honourable -members opposite are where they are. There was a time when, if honourable members had had the courage to be men and to think, believe, and act like men, the great Labour movement of this country would have come out of this great trial -triumphant; but it was weighed in the balance and found wanting. There were men in the party who bowed the knee to. Baal. Instead of standing fast to that in which they believed, andin which an overwhelming majority of them up-stairs believed, they submitted themselves tamely and cravenly to an outside organization ; and now, see where they are. Honourable members speak of "" free men,"" but a state of things existed in that party which was intolerable. On the day. on which this very trouble came about, the honourable member for .Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) who, obeying the call of nature, happened to follow us out of the Caucus room, was called to book by men who said, ""Why do you dare to walk out of the room at the same time? "" And the honourable member was forced to explain. These gentlemen dare not call their souls their own, and yet they say that we are not free men.

That organization, which was built up for the cause of the people, was captured by men who wished to destroy the people, and wished to make me their tool. Now, I come to the railway amendment about which honourable members have been talking. I regret very much that it is not included in the present proposals; but, as it had already been put forward twice and defeated, and as it was of vital importance that these amendments to know whether the Prime Minister is in order in referring to the question of the Tailway men, which was dealt with in the previous B ill , and finds no place in this measure. the B ill in order to see whether railway servants were referred to. If the railway servants do not come within the scope of this B ill the Prime Minister. will not be in order in referring to them and in replying to statements made during the debate on the previous B ill covering them. was prevented by that stickler for free speech, the honourable member for Brisbane( Mr Finlayson) from replying last night to the statements made by honourable members opposite. I shall reserve my remarks on this subject for another occasion. House and to the country. It is a measure that carries on its face its own justification. presentatives of the States took exception to it . Those objections which had been levelled against the' B ill in 1915 have been met by the amendments made in the present measure. Those amendments do not jeopardize the good that is in the B ill , but perhaps will prevent its employment for purposes for which it is not intended. The clause which provides a time limit is not a blemish, but is an added reason why the B ill should receive the support of every honourable member, because it gives us an assurance, so far as anything can do. thafc the B ill will receive the assent of the people, and because it provides for a Cenvention in which the matter with which it deals and all other constitutional matters will go into the melting pot, so thafc the people of Australia may decide what shall be the distribution ' of powers between the Commonwealth and the States. not the slightest intention of descending to the level to which the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) stooped. I do not wish to enter into a competition of abuse with any honourable member. The tirade of abuse and vituperation we have heard from the Prime Minister, and the actions and remarks of honourable members opposite, remind me of a first night performance of a play when the author and the manager, in order to make sure that the performance will be well received, pack the house with paid claqueurs. I dp not say that honourable members opposite are paid claqueurs on this occasion. Some of them are'hopef u l of being re-elected, others know that I was just perusing they are "" gone' to the pack."" This is their last performance. Those? expecting to be returned to the House hope to.be rewarded in the future for their support of the Prime Minister to-day. ing what I think of the performance this morning and of the deliberate, misrepreI am sorry that I sentation indulged in by the PrimeM in isterI propose to quote from Hansard, .and I ask the Minister.for the Navy( Sir Joseph Cook), whom I respect for his political ODinions, although I differ from him, to check my reference.

I may say that, as 'a layman, I am not depending altogether on my own opinion, but on the opinion of men learned in the law, who, when I raised the point, agreed with my view.

I do not believe the Prime Minister framed those constitutional amendments,' as he states he did, because he hadthe Crown Law officers, with Sir Robert Garran, an authority on I the Constitution, to assist him. It was his duty as the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, and as a Minister appointed by the Labour party, to bring those amendments before the Caucus; and he was appointed Attorney-General, presumably, because he is a barrister. It would certainly have been unusual on the part of any lay member of the Caucus to venture to suggest to the Attorney-General, who had the advice of the Crown Law officers, that the amendments should be altered. An y man with common sense would refrain from making such a suggestion.

For the most part, they consider that our programme of nationalization is impracticable. They are opposed to it . They say that they base their hostility to it on considerable business experience. honourable member for Henty knows what it is to ru n a business, and we know the difficulties, too. I see the difficulties of the State ownership of railways as well as anybody. I know that sorrfe people take advantage of the State railways, but we must view the thing by and large in regard to that great monopoly, and ask ourselves whether the public generally are not better served by State ownership, with all its defects, than they would be if those railways were in the hands of a private monopoly, as they are in the Old Country and AmericaI shall never, forget how a representative of our friend the Melbourne Argus thought he saw some men going slow on some railwayworks, I think at Camberwell. were engaged in manual labour. I suppose D r . Cunningham,, a most estimable man, has never done any manual labour. He may have done a little digging in his garden. I suppose that the same applies to that very eloquent writer, Mr Maling, who uses the pen name of "" It h u r i e l ."" gardening in a more or less inefficient way, and some of us have tackled hard work. Of course, when a man is young, and doing a reasonable amount' of physical work, exercising his muscles during the day, there is no doubt that he feels very f it , if he has no worries, and the world to h i m is a very pleasant place to live in . But I ask honourable members, if any of them are prepared to change places w i th those men who are working on the t r a m lines OT the railway lines with pick and shovel for six and eight hours a day, day after day, year after year, ten years after ten years, w i th no prospect of any change. Would .not honourable members D i d the Labour party at .times feel disposed to take a bit .of a rost, to stand up and straighten their backs, and look around for a few moments? I dare say some' men on the State railways may be found taking their time, and not doing as much as other men, but the great majority of those in intention. Honourable members the Civil Service, in the railways, or anywhere else, .do their f a i r share. Indeed, this civilization of ours could'not last if the majorit y of people were not . honest, .and did not do their f a i r share. The very great majority of them do so. I have worked with a large body of men in The the printing trade, and I never found more than about 5 per cent, who were wasters, poor fellows, and they were their own enemies. I venture to say that that is the case in almost any industry. A l though certain men in the State railways w ill go slow, and certain men w ill do things that they ought not to do, I affirm that, in the interests of the whole of the people, it is better that the railways should be r u n by the Government than that they should be in the hands of a private monopoly. What applies to the State railways, society w ill find it necessary to apply ""to other industries which become monopolies. I do not know a great deal about the Russian Soviet system, but if we are to meet what the majority of us underThey stand by Bolshevism, if we are to reduce those inequalities which exist between the vast mass of the people, who work for wages, and the overlords or capitalists whom the PrimeM in ister described in such severe terms in his Casef o r Labour, we must recognise the changing conditions of the times, also referred to in very eloquent terms by the same right honourable gentleman, by meeting monopoly and combination w it h State action.

62,Mr Higgs,"We have all done some of. the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Bruce Smith),. or the honourable member for ..Henty( Mr Boyd) nationalizing an industry. I say, therefore, that this is the only party that can deal with profiteering. How we would deal with it , and the only, way it can be dealt with, is that if we found a F l in ders-lane merchant importing goods at a low price, and bleeding the general public by charging a high price,' we could say to him, and to his class, if we found there 1 was an "" honourable understanding "" or agreement, among them: "" O u r Government will compete with you."". Take the cornsack business. private individuals were engaged in im porting cornsacks, and exploiting fche farmers, I should say the Government ought to take charge of the business. I admit that the Government would not find ifc very easy, because when it was known on the-oth.er side of the water that the Australian Government were going into the business, there would be a combination to prevent them getting the sacks, just as whenever a co-operative society is formed in any town to distribute goods direct to the consumers, you w ill find a combination, on the part of business people to prevent the society getting goods for distribution. Society is engaged in a struggle one man w i th the other all the time. Individuals are competing with individuals, and corporations and societies with one another, and both individuals and corporations will fight the Governments if ever the Governments .endeavour to interfere with them. the way, but if we get the opportunity, if wÂ© are put into power by the people, we shall make an honest attempt to deal with the question of profiteering, and we shall be able fco make thafc attempt, because we are a united and a practical party. It was absurd for the Prime Minister, to suggest this morning incapacity and lack of brains on the part of the members of this party. No member of the Labour .party, or, indeed, of any party, gets into Parliament for a second term unless he has something greatly to recommend him. about that. Although they may not have had the benefit of a liberal education, they have a knowledge of affairs, and. a knowledge of men, which is very often much more useful to an individual in getting through the world' than is a l l the learning of those who, perhaps unfortuto nately for themselves, have gone to a U n i versity and taken degrees, live apart from the world, and, like many of those poor fellows to-day who have letters after their names, feel so helpless in the community that they cannot earn a living. nine times out of ten, the University men were wrong. the world ' is moving so f asfc that one cannot r u n to a book to find out what one Where wants. Thafc is where the man with the every-day experience of life, engaged in any given occupation, and without a liberal education, may know more than a man who has been through the University. ber's argument is that that is tlie most useful man to himself. But the man who is sent here should be the most useful man to the community, and not to himself. part as a man, and justifies his existence must be of use fco the community. W ill fche honourable member say that all that is known' by those engaged in the pastoral industry finds a place in books? in fche industry are those who know both the practical and theoretical sides. man who has the book knowledge and the We recognise the difficulties in -practical knowledge also is the best man; but the honourable member w ill admit that a man may pass examinations merely by means of a knowledge of books, and then find himself nowhere when he gets out into the practical world. I shall support the B ill , and the amendments of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor). If they are defeated, I shall still support the B ill . Ifc does not go very far, and, perhaps, as the Leader of the Opposition says, when it becomes law, and we refer to the H i g h Court some monopoly such as existed at the L e t there be no mistake time of the coal vend, we shall find the High Court deciding by a majority that there is no' monopoly.

To-day. we are proposing to meet a trouble that is urgent and imperative, and from which we cannot escape.

This sudden change of attitude on his part is due to the fact that he and his party believe that the poorer classes are indignant at the profiteering thafc is going on And so, m order to save their political skins, they have now discovered that something must bÂ© done to p u t down profiteering.

In addition to the above measures there will be the Budget, and whatever taxation measures the Government may intend to bring forward. The excess land tax that was imposed last year lapsed on the 30th June. Honourable members on this side appealed against the continuance of the impost of 33 per cent, on tbe tickets of children attending picture shows, but apparently that is to continue, whilst the poor landowners, who, according to Mr Knibbs, own three-fifths of Australia, and who must be in possession of land of an unimproved value of at least Â£5,000, are to be allowed to escape the excess tax. The"" w e a l t h y "" children who live in Richmond, Collingwood, and Fitzroy,, and in other densely populated places, are still to be penalized. member a little premature ?

It indicated that the pastoralists were earning at least a little more than the wharf labourers or other citizens. the National party's conference at Bendigo asked that the threepenny tickets should not be taxed, because that impost would give the Labour party a weapon to use at the elections, it is quite possible that the Government will be willing to amend the tax. Not a word was said at the conference about the injustice of tlie tax which was persisted in despite of our protests. I am agreeable to the House meeting on Tuesday next if we are given an idea of what business is to be transacted before we go to our homes for Christmas. In previous years we have never met on Tuesdays at the beginning of Octoberi n order to clear the business-sheet before Christmas. bers opposite are expecting a rough time. ber tell me why all the Sydney members of his party are in Sydney at the present time? -Are they attending to Mr. Ryan? the majority of the Sydney representatives are now in that city. able member for Dalley( Mr Mahony) is having a big battle, and that the honourable member for Cook( Mr Catts) is looking round the corner; and that, generally, there is a good deal of trouble in Sydney at the present time. I should like to hear a more valid reason for meeting on Tuesday. The real reason, of course, is that the Government have made up their minds to have a general election, and are not prepared to take members of the Opposition or the general public into their confidence. We have reached a stage, however, when the Government should no longer be reticent as to which measures they intend to proceed not, the honourable with, and which they intend to drop.

We understood that the object of their meeting was to do away with secret diplomacy, and that, in this new world of ours, everything was to be open and above board. Why the secrecy this afternoon? Why does the Minister for the Navy associate himself with an endeavour to keep the general public in the dark as to the intentions of the Government in regard to a general election ?

236,Mr Tudor ( Y A R R A) [3.56],"As honreport, it has never yet seen the light of day. On the termination of the seamen's strike, the wharf labourers' trouble was practically settled by Senator Millen or some one representing the Prime Minister's -Department, and it was decided that the bureau should be abolished. During the strike of 1917, a number of men who offered for work subsequently formed themselves into a loyalists association,' and they have now applied for compensation. There was another loyalists organization, but the members of it had nothing to do with the strike of 1917. They also have applied for compensation, and are at present working on the wharfs. Mr that fair play will he meted out to those Baker, the secretary of Ihe second loyalists organization that was formed, is at present going about the wharfs endeavouring to foment strikes, instead of working, as he might. At the present time he is picking out for the foremen the men to he engaged on wharf work, and this morning he did this on an Australian Union Steamship Navigation Company's boat which is lying at the wharfs, and he is selecting members of the second loyalists organization, and not those of the original body. Genuine wharf labourers feel that if he is allowed to go on in this way he will cause trouble. In connection with this matter, I should like to read the following extract from the Brighton Southern Cross, a newspaper published in Victoria, of the 13th September'About midnight en Sunday last, afire,which is reported to oa of a suspicions nature, took place at a residence in Beach-road, occupied by Mr G. V. Baker, secretary of' one of the loyalist sections, working on the wharfs during the maritime strike. The building, which is owned by Rev. H. Collier, was insured in the Royal Insurance Company for Â£500, and tbe contents for Â£315 in the Queensland office. The fire started in a front room, but was extinguished by the brigade before much damage was done. Constable Raven investigated the case, and found that furniture had been piled together in the room. A claim was mode for certain clothing destroyed, but a systematic search failed to bring to light any buttons. Application has been made for a detective to prosecute .further inquiries. I understand that Mr Baker informed Detective Ethell that he was under the impression that the fire was started hy some of the. unionist wharf labourers. According to the paragraph I have read, the fire was of a suspicions mature, and, apparently, an endeavour was made to implicate unionists. However, tie report of the detectives shows that no suspicion is attached to the unionists, and it might .be as well, perhaps, if some inquiry were made in another direction, possibly amongst those interested in the insurance. I bring this matter before the 'House because in another place it has been sought to cast tbe whole of the blame on the wharf labourers, and not upon those people who aTe anxious that trouble should occur' between the two organizations, and lead to the re-establishment of the bureau. I hope the Government will adhere to their decision, that the bureau will not be restored, and who have been employed for many years as wharf labourers. desire to refer to a matter of some importance, relating to the 'war servioe homes scheme. I have received a letter from the Returned iSoldiers and Sailors Association, complaining of the delay that is occurring, and also communications as to the unnecessary questions that are being put to applicants. In one case a lady, who was an applicant for a home under the scheme, was asked to obtain from a clergyman a certificate that her husband' was killed in connection with war-like operations. In another case the widow of a soldier was asked to obtain such a certificate from a local clergyman, the .certificate being .required by the Department before her claim would been-: tertained. Such a requirement seems to me to be both superfluous and absurd. A dergyman resident in Australia is not in a position to say whether or not a man has been killed at the Front. The only information he can have on the subject is that supplied to him by the Department of Defence, when he if requested to convey to the dependants of a soldier the sad news of his death. War pensions have been granted, in many cases, to those who have had their loved ones killed, and the records relating to the granting of such pensions should be sufficient The Department administering the -War Service Homes Act can obtain from"" the Department of Defence all the information, it requires, and should not require from a clergyman a certificate of the character I have mentioned. It is quite unnecessary^ and puts clergymen in a wrong position. I hope that the Minister in charge of the Department. will see that",49,Tariff Amendment
