I have not seen the film. I was unable to be at its premiere in Ballarat last Friday. The honourable member for Ballarat and his wife, who is a prominent member of the Council for the Arts and who knows some of the background to this matter, attended that premiere. I am disturbed to hear the matters raised by the honourable member. I do know that the film has been given a ' M ' rating by the censor which means that children if accompanied by their parents will be able to see it. In view of the matters raised by the honourable member, I certainly will convey his comments to the Chairman of tbe Australian Council for the Arts and the Chairman of the Australian Film Development Corporation.

I ask the Minister: Is there any truth in this allegation? truth whatsoever in the allegation. My predecessor made the decision that this particular school was not a school which should attract Commonwealth support. Tbe Commonwealth does not provide per capita grants to this school. It provides no capital assistance to this school. It does not provide assistance to this school and this sort of information is perhaps typical of the propaganda that is sometimes used in this direction. newer Australians are about to enjoy one of our traditions, namely the Christmas holidays, has the Government at last some Cabinet committee have been looking at the problem of land rights for Australian on Mlonday.

It will take some considerable time to prove the reserves of gas and liquid crude there. In the meantime some discussions have been held and are still continuing between officers of my Department and the companies concerned. The situation is a fairly, complex one because it to the taxpayers of Australia. The conseinvolves not. only the actual development of the field itself but also the situation whereby certain areas are allocated . to different marketers in relation to the subsidy provided by the Commonwealth.

What is the position regarding the inquiries into this matter which his predecessor stated on 11th March last year were being carried out? tleman has every right to be concerned about this matter. I am also concerned about it. There is a difficulty involved here in that the Norfolk Island administration and the Norfolk Island people feel very strongly that companies should set up there because this provides considerable revenue for Norfolk Island. My colleague, the Minister for External Territories, naturally enough is concerned for the interests of the people of Norfolk Island. For my part I am very concerned that Norfolk Island, which already shows promise of becoming a very considerable tax haven, should not be allowed to develop in that way, for if it does it will only enrich some companies and add a considerable burden quence is that I have had a thorough investigation of this matter made by the Taxation Office and Treasury officers. As a consequence I have a paper of considerable size, containing very many pages, which has been submitted to a committee Unfortunately it has not been possible, to consider the report of the investigation within the last week or two, but that committee will be called together as soon as possible, for the purpose of reaching conclusions about it so that it can be recommended for the consideration of the Government.

For day was a very full day, and while I gave the report preliminary consideration I did not entirely agree with the method of presentation. I will have a further look at it today. ARMY: TASMANIA COMMAND »>r addressed to the Minister for Defence. In view of a reported request by the Tasmanian Premier for upgrading the. status of .Tasmania Command and the restoration of the traditional 40th Infantry Battalion in Hobart and the 12th Infantry Battalion in Launceston, can the Minister indicate what progress has been made in this matter? honourable gentleman would realise that this-is a matter of policy. I can assure him sources of capital, put the ciipilal together that it is a matter which is under consideration at the present moment, as we are looking at some possible alterations in the structure of the Army. When a decision is made it will be conveyed through the normal channels from the Prime Minister to the Premier. tion to the Treasurer. In view of the question supp'emantary to that asked of Treasurer's contribution to the debate on him by the honourable member for the motion of no confidence last week Chiefley ahout the Norfolk Island tax when he said that the bulk of capital haven.

I now ask a report from his taxation advisers on the whether Australian companies, either New Hebrides tax haven? I ask him locally owned or substantially owned overseas, have been borrowing overseas in recent years simply because interest rates in Australia are too high? simply because of high interest rates in Australia. In reality interest rates in Austraiia fit about in the middle of the interest rate spectrum of all countries in. the world. Very considerable differences in interest rates are found in other countries between the short-term market and the long-term difference between the low and high rates in other countries than there Is in Australia where interest rates tend to'be in a closer band. But the' level of interest rates may instance the interest rate uV Switzerland is quite low although access to that market is not easy. But inquiries.' .1 have made show'that' it is difficult to obtain money from overseas at a more advantageous interest rate than it can be obtained in Australia. The reason for the. borrowings been a.. greater demand for finance for development projects than we generate ourselves in Australia. The reason : for that is, of course, our rapid rate of growth. I think one of the major reasons for the increase in bor( rowings was that there has developed over the last 2 or 3 years a , very marked improvement in the sophistication of the merchant banking area which has been able to make contacts with, overseas and make it available to projects in Australia which, prior to that event, just did not have the expertise to use or the entrance into those overseas capital markets.

FinallyI ask whether, since the New Hebrides is an Anglo-French condominium, he has asked the Prime Minister, who is still the means of communication with the British Government, or the Foreign Minister, who is the means of communication with the French Government, to study this aspect. which report the honourable gentleman refers in particular. I have seen a number of papers from the Taxation Office in general on tax minimisation including that element which is tax minimisation arising out of the use of havens outside Australian territory. It is a matter which conerns me and indeed it concerns every country in the world, whether the haven is a total not an easy problem to cure, but it is one of which the taxation officers are very well aware and so am 1.1 have decided that we ought first to approach that area upon which we have undoubted legislative power, and that is in relation to our own Territories. Hence the priority of Norfolk Island remains higher. approach to Britain or France? any approach to Britain or France of which I am aware. There may have been an approach at an officer level of which I am not aware. I would like to take the opportunity of saying that that part of the Treasury con-. cerned with tax policy and the Taxation Office are staffed by experts of the highest quality but unfortunately there are not enough of these people who have the expertise to handle all the problems that come up at the same time. Later today I will be introducing some legislation which will move to cure 2 areas of tax minimisation-that is the wrong use of public companies or what purport to be public companies and dividend stripping. When one considers the amount of work that has to be put into the preparation of such measures by expert officers in the Taxation Office and the Treasury and Parliamentary Counsel, I am sure that the honourable gentleman will understand the degree of difficulty we have in these matters. We now have another programme of action which will follow on to other areas. When work on the Norfolk Island situation is finished I will look at the other matter. BEEF ROADS the Minister for National Development. Could the Minister indicate whether the ' beef roads programme of the Federal Government, which has been of such immense value to much of the inland of Australia, will be extended when the current programme has concluded? Would the Minister agree that it is most desirable that if the programme is to continue preliminary planning should commence at the earliest possible date? ber's interest in this matter is made evident not only by his question today but also by the fact that he has written to me recently on a couple .of occasions. 1 can assure honourable members that I agree with him that this is a very important matter. The beef roads programme has provided a very good service in many areas in the northern parts of Australia. The negotiations in relation to this are handled by the Northern Division of my Department. The present programme continues under the existing plan up to 1974. At this point of time. I cannot give an assurance in regard to a further plan. But I can give the assurance that some planning is being done in consultation with the States and the industries concerned. A lot of work is being done to see what further programmes would be required to service this industry. Of course, as the honourable member knows, subsidiary benefits spill over into other industries such as tourism and the programme provides a service to the community generally. We are well aware of the honourable member's interest in the matter. I can assure him that the point he has raised will be given full consideration. question to the Prime Minister.

I pointed out that this was a very complex report and that it was being given close Government examination. FurtherI said that the examination was being carried out by an interdepartmental committee and that we hoped to be able to hand down a decision as soon as possible. I am fully conscious of the difficulties that the delay is causing the shipbuilding industry. I am fully aware of the uncertainty that prevails at the moment as to the industry's future. I give an assurance that we will deal with the report as expeditiously as possible. I would hope that a decision might be made early in the New Year. -to the Treasurer. In view of the indication contained in his answer a few minutes ago to the Leader of the Opposition that the staff resources of the Taxation Office are not sufficient to cope with the great demands upon them. to investigate and endeavour to plug up loopholes in relation to tax avoidance, will the Treasurer reconsider a suggestion I made not very long ago to the effect that the time might be appropriate to appoint another specialist committee like the Ligertwood Committee, which sat in 1960 and 1961, to supplement the activities of the Taxation Office in relation to tax avoidance? consideration to this matter. The elements involved are what sort of issues should be looked at by such a committee and, if a . committee were appointed, lo what degree must it. be serviced by, the very same officers who are doing the work themselves and to what extent, therefore, would it detractfrom the work performance of those officers. Unfortunately, like parliamentary counsel, these experienced officers cannot just be created. They are of a special type, being a combination of ' intellect and character. The other thing which these officers are involved in at present, and this is by chance, is the negotia' tion of a series of double tax agreements. For a number of years we did not have them, but we are now in the course of vigorously achieving Ihetn. We have a list of countries in order of priority, so to speak, and the same sort of officers are used in that pursuit.' I will continue an examination to see whether they can be helped by an oulside committee without detracting from their work performance. aware that the take-home pay of the minimum wage earners in Australia with dependent wives and children is less than 5 per cent of the present total weekly wage of the Prime Minister? Does he consider the differential to be justified? Will his Government undertake to restore wage values to such workers to enable them to live above the poverty line? preferable had this question been directed to my colleague, the Minister for Labour and National Service. As the honourable gentleman will know, or should know, we have in this country an Arbitration Commission which has the function of determining minimum and award wages. Negotiations also take place outside the Commission which involve what is called the wage group, which also encompass a very large section of wage increases. To determine such matters for the Commonwealth Civil Service, there is the Public Service Arbitrator.

Many Speaker, may I draw your attention to General Business, notice No. 9. I think the honourable member for Dawson is speaking about a number of matters that would be dealt with in notice No. 9. Dr PATTERSONI am speaking to the suspension of standing Orders. Mr Jeff BateI think he is speaking on the question of urgency. There is a notice on the notice paper covering most of the matters he has raised. The only new material that the honourable member has introduced relates to the area management scheme. 1 submit, Mr Speaker, that you should rule that the only matter with which he can deal under the Standing Orders is area management. stance in the point of order. The motion before the House is for the suspension of Standing Orders. However, I will take this opportunity to remind the: honourable but, as you will appreciate, it is extremely member for Dawson that it is a motion for difficult always to state a reason here the suspension of Standing Orders. At this stage I think he has gone a little wide of the subject matter. Dr PATTERSONI have tried to of elaborating on the points he wishes to confine myself to the reasons for seeking a make. suspension of Standing Orders in stating the problems that have arisen, not only the problems that have arisen in country areas' but also the problems of Post Office staff Involved in the compulsory transfer. I will now deal with the points that the Postmaster-General made in his last 2 statements on this matter of area management proposals. Apparently the Postmaster-General's Department is ignoring the protests by the staff affected by the proposed compulsory transfers. These transfers mean that the people will have to sell their homes and in many instances in country areas they will not be able to sell their homes except at give-away prices. What should be an inquiry. There is also the area mails centre projand place unreasonable requirements on customers of the Post Office in the capital and large provincial cities. This is yet another reason why there should be a suspension of Standing Orders to allow a postal workers and Commonwealth public servants in rural areas are being subjected to a downgrading of their district allowances. There is another very pressing reason why these matters should be aired now. There are grave allegations being made by postal workers that the centralised office in Melbourne is becoming even more centralised because of the empire building tactics of what is called the engineer lobby. It is significant that under new proposals of the Postmaster-General's Department the number of engineers in the Central office will increase from suggested to the honourable member -for Dawson that this is a very narrow debate.

This is one of the urgent reasons why this matter should be investigated. 1 have moved for the suspension of Standing Orders so that a committee . could be set up to establish the reasons for this move. Another reason for an urgent inquiry is the obvious uncertainty of the Postmaster-General and his Department about the justification of the scheme itself. '-'This is very relevant. It would seem that the centra) office of the Postmaster-Gen'eral's Department is itself now establishing a committee of inquiry. But this is not good enough. I submit that there should be an independent parliamentary inquiry. There should be a suspension of the Standing Orders virtually to countermand this proposal and allow for an independent inquiry, so that we do not simply have a departmental inquiry white washing itself. There are other urgent reasons for an inquiry. There is a need to provide precise figures of the number of people who will be affected by hardship as a result of their having to move. When this matter is put to the vote or gagged it will be interesting to 'see the attitude of the Country Party. I assume Country Party supporters will remain silent as usual although they are always condemning the Postmaster-General's Department member will resume, his seat. second the motion. I believe there is an urgent need for the suspension of Standing Orders and the appointment of a committee of inquiry because of the dissatisfaction and the concern amongst many of the employees of the Postmaster-General's Department.

(11.13)I am. rather surprised that the honourable member for Dawson (Dr Patterson) should raise this matter at this, point in the parliamentary sessional period.. I made a statement on it in September and another in October. Since then 1 have not had one question from honourable members opposite in relation to any aspect of the matters which were included in those statements. 1 believe it is fair to say that there has been no request from the Opposition to the Leader of the House Mr StewartI rise to order. The Postmaster-General is a member of the Government that allows only one question to back benchers on this side of the House every 9 days. no control over the number of questions asked in this House concerning the Po.stmaster-General. Therefore 1 do not uphold the point of order. on the fact there had been no questions directed to me in relation to either of those statements on area management since they were made in September and October. Is this to be an indication of the real interest of honourable members opposite in this matter or are we to remind ourselves that 2 or 3 days ago there were sitting in this House and consulting with a large number of members, as is their right, representatives from the Post Office unions. Representatives on the unions sent to every member large screeds of untruthful comment on area management. These representatives have been consulting with honourable members opposite and it has pleased honourable members to back up what has been said to them by representatives of the unions with a motion for the suspension of Standing Orders.",29,Suspension Of Standing Orders Up With The Department Usually Notifica

The motion, which is deliberately a short the time of the last census in June of this one, would enable any committee which year, the proporlion of the population in the was set up to make fairly wide sweeping metropolitan area of Melbourne had grown inquiries into what is one of the major to 68.1 per cent and the proportion in problems concerning Australia as a nation non-metropolitan areas, including Geelong. at this time and which has confronted had dropped to 31.9 per cent, a drop of Australia .as a nation over a considerable 11 per cent in a period of 38 years. period. The degree of inactivity which exists on this matter is startling, to say the least, 'and is possibly a reflection of self quate evidence of the decline in the activisatisfaction' by those people who believe, as ties in rural areas and the decline in the we heard at question time today, that the importance of provincial areas in Ausproblems of rural communities and provintralia.. Since 1961 statistical divisions have cial areas can be solved, not by developbeen applied to the census so that the ment, not by the increasing and mainteactual areas concerned are absolutely idennance of population of those areas, but tical.

I think that even at this early stage 1 should put .forward one proposition which will, I hope, counter the proposition put forward by the honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull) that the way to get a better deal in the rural areas is. to reduce the size of the rural electorates and thus give better representation in this Parliament. On the last occasion the Electoral Act was altered the allowable ratio between electorates was increased from 10 per ceni to 20 per cent up or down. The application of that redistribution shows that the growth rate in country areas in Victoria has dropped from 3,53 per cent to 0.52 per cent. So the extra members, satisfied thai their seats in Parliament are safe, have dee'ded that . they need do That is not the way to approach the problem' which confronts Australia. It is prob.lem which is shown to exist by growth rate statistics for any State. .1. have here the growth statistics for Victoria, which I think fairly accurately reflect the position in the rest of Au tralia. Because it is not good to fill a speech up with statistics I will deal only with those statistics relative to Victoria. The metropolitan area'of Melbourne, metropolitan areas had 42.17 per cent. AtI would suggest that this is in itself adeof the growth rate of Melbourne. That is",31,Region

101,Mr Scholes (Corio) (11.29),"I move:the real evidence of the problem. It is a growing problem. To indicate how the problem is growing I will quote the growth rates in the non-metropolitan areas in Victoria between censuses. Between 1947 and 1957 there was a 21.8 per cent growth in the non-metropolitan areas of Victoria. In the next inter-census period the growth was 15.45 per cent. In the period between 1961 and 1966-thi s is when the rot really set in-the growth rate, in non-metropolitan areas in Victoria was 3.53 per cent. In the period from 1966 to the last census the growth rale was 0.52 per cent, or half of 1 per cent. In case it may be thought that because of the changes the changing pattern of the metropolitan area resulting from the change in definition has altered the position materially, I point out that for the factory rate with satisfactory employment remainder of the State, leaving but the staopportunities for the full cross-section of tistical division of Melbourne, the growth rate for the period between 1961 and 1966 was 4.61 per cent in non-metropolitan areas, and the growth rate between 1966 and 1971 was 0.94 per cent or less than 1 per cent. That is allowing for the fact that the figures for the metropolitan area of Melbourne relate only to those' areas within Melbourne's fixed boundary, which is in fact an unreal position, because the urban area of Melbourne is growing and thesefiguresdo not reflect the rural population of individual areas which are in the area of Melbourne but outside the statistical division. This is a real problem. We have a current problem which I hope is temporary but which most likely is not. I refer to growing unemployment in rural areas. I think this subject is to be covered in a subsequent debate, and it has no real application to the problems which are the subject of this debate. Unemployment in rural areas is a problem but it is not directly associated with the matter we are now discussing. The question which I believe must be decided, and decided quickly, is whether we are to continue with our present method of dealing with rural and provincial depopulation, that is by amending the Electoral Act, or whether we are to do something about the maintenance of population and the maintenance of population ratios in the areas outside the major capital cities? It is ridiculous to munities which have grown: we are also suggest that in a nation of 3 million square miles we should be doing everything possible to squeeze all the population into a couple of thousand square miles. Is the rest of the nation not fit to be lived in? Some of it is not fit to be lived in by large masses but a great deal of it is and many provincial and rural areas are better equipped than are the metropolitan areas for the growth of population and the maintenance of the way of life we like to think is Australian but which in fact is not Australian. There are many areas of Australia where facilities for population growth already exist and it is necessary to provide the people in those areas with the necessary employment opportunities and the necessary facilities of life to keep these areas as viable population centes. There is hardly a non-metropolitan area in Australia that is at this time growing at a satisour population. I believe that only by Government action designed to encourage the maintenance of population in and the movement of population into provincial and regional centres can the non-metropolitan population of Australia be maintained at a satisfactory level. The stupid and short-sighted proposition which js promoted very often by the Government of Victoria that we should have 5 million people crammed into Melbourne and leave the rest of the Stale bare of people to me is almost akin to genocide. It will result in a population at some future time of absolutely neurotic morons. We cannot put people in cages continually. Without any policies to develop in the capital cities an environment which is comparable with the environment which people are able to enjoy outside the capital cities we are seriously damaging human beings. By economic pressures we are forcing people who are not urban dwellers or who are not psycholigically orientated towards urban living to move out of country areas into urban living, into areas where the basic facilities are not provided. This is a secondary but a very important problem resulting from depopulation of the country areas. Not only are we forcing people to leave facilities which have been developed and destroying comcreating areas of urban population which do not have the basic facilities because the State governments and the municipal coun' cils do not have the funds to provide and maintain them. This Government is creating areas which are not satisfactory living areas and this . roust have the effect of downgrading our population, r would suggest that interdepart,. mental committees and intergovernmental . committees could study these matters. There has been one such committee studying this .subject for so many years that no-one can -remember the last time that it actually did anything, if it ever did anything. Apparently . it has not met for about 3 years. A parliamentary committee would highlight-thi s is very important-the needs and the problems, of non-metropolitan areas and the need for the promotion of future growth. A parliamentary committee would serve to acquaint the members of this Parliament, and 1 would hope it might even acquaint some of those who represent the rural electorates, with the real problems which are developing, problems which have nothing to do with how many members there are in this Parliament but which have a lot to do with what members are prepared to do for these areas. The rate of growth of non-metropolitan areas, as 1 have already said, is totally unsatisfactory. In fact, if it continues to decline at the rate which is shown in the last census we will reach a situation where not much more than 10 per cent of our population will be living outside the capital cities by the year 2000. That is the sort of problem with which we are faced and the sort of problem for which solutions must be found. There are no easy remedies and there are no cheap remedies for this problem. There are some things that the Commonwealth Government could do now. It could decentralise its own departments to a greater extent instead of transferring everyone into a centralised area. With the modern communciations and facilities now available this is quite a practicable step. This Government could deal with the very severe burden which telephone charges place on businesses operating outside metropolitan areas. For instance in Victoria a business operating in Melbourne has access to a very wide area and a unit charge fee for the payment of a very small extra rental. But a business operating in the city of Ballarat, Bendigo, Geelong or Mildura, which is in the electorate of the honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull) is faced with fantastic telephone charges. A person can make a call from Frankston to Newport or Melbourne for 4c and talk all day. A person who makes a call to the same areas from Geelong, which is a shorter distance, will be charged 20c or 25c for every 3 minutes of the conversation. I do not think that this is a realistic approach to a problem. 1 think that the realities of the situation are thai businesses are seriously disadvantaged by this type of costing. The postal services available to businesses in country areas are less than satisfactory. 1 had reason to protest recently about the advertising of jobs with the Commonwealth Department of Works at the Avalon airfield which is just outside Geelong. The jobs were advertised in Melbourne and the applicants had to go to Melbourne to apply for jobs in Geelong. That is the psychology of the Commonwealth Department of Works. The reason why the jobs were not advertised in Geelong, according to tbe Department, was that it had to give a week's notice to country newspapers to insert the advertisement but it had to give -only 1 day's notice to city newspapers. That is not true. The fact is that the Commonwealth Advertising Division was not prepared to place the advertisement unless it had a week's notice, so people living in the area where the employment was needed could apply for these jobs only by going to Melbourne but by the time they got there they had all been taken. There is a very serious lack of facilities in country areas. There is very little reason why businesses would establish themselves in country areas at this stage. Country areas have many disadvantages and the Commonwealth adds tothose disadvantages. These areas have very few advantages other than a better environment and possibly a more stable work force. But the problems arc such that economically the people in these areas are disadvantaged. The Commonwealth, no longer controls payroll tax but this is an area in which the States could take action in order to give advantage to country industries over and above metropolitan industries. In other countries there are means which are used to promote the growth of non-metropolitan industries in certain areas. These are matters which 1 think could well be taken up by this House and could well be put before a committee which could sift out the problems, such a committee should consist of people who are interested in this problem, of people who .have a voice in. this Parliament and who are able to be effective. Public servants are not the people who should be inquiring into human problems which are the, responsibility of the Parliament. -I believe that a parliamentary committee should be set up to investigate this matter. It may be that the terms of reference of the committee would not necessarily be those contained in the motion. Other terms of. reference may be more, desirable but 1 believe, the principle should be established. I will be very interested at the conclusion of this debate to see whether a vote is taken. I was told a few minutes ago that the' debate will be chopped off at 12 o'clock so that some Government business can be brought on. But' if a vote is allowed,-' and I hope it will be, I will' be interested to 'see whether members of this Parliament are prepared to support the appointment of a parliamentary committee to inquire into 1.

Because of the space that would have been required, the table refers only.to one State but ,1 know that the general trend is almost identical in other States. There is a real need, if this population trend is to be reversed., for secondary and manufacturing industries to be established in country area's. Possibly academic institutions including tertiary institutions could also be of the matter is that this country was settled established. But the real solution to the problem is the development of manufacturing industries in country areas. This can largely be done only at the provincial level or the regional centre level but it would provide a basis for employment over a wide area. If we continue in the way that we ar.e now doing without being prepared even to iook at the probldm then we will jeopardise the future of the entire population of this nation. Not only are we jeopardising the future of those people in country areas but we are seriously jeopardising those in the major metropolitan areas which must suffer through unnatural population growth. I commend.the motion to the House and I hope that the House will agree to it. I believe that it is very important that the House does so. Is the motion seconded? Mr KennedyI second the motion and reserve my right to speak later. Dr SOLOMON (Denison) (11.49)-As I understand. the burden of the complaint of the honourable member for Corio( Mr obvious to members of this chamber and Scholes) it is that this Government and various preceding governments of Australia and of the States are responsible for the population distribution of Australia. Unfortunately in the main I believe that is not so although there are certain things which governments might do to try to redistribute the population in some measure. I find myself in the position of being able to commend the honourable member for Corio in,. I think, one respect only and that his proposition, real or implied, that a national cities. This has happened not just in Ausview of this sort of thing is desirable. I agree with that implicitly. However, I the world before it took place in Australia. think that the honourable member fails to Attention was drawn to this phenomenon recognise some very substantial historical in a notable work before the turn of the and geographical underpinnings of the situation which he has described and deplored in his speech this morning. The honourable member suggests that this is a major issue, and that is perfectly correct. He suggests that it is a major issue because of government inactivity. I do not want to traverse at this particular time the longish history of the distribution of population and the extent of urbanisation in Australia, or for that matter anywhere else, because it is a worldwide phenomenon. But the plain fact through 6 port settlements which became towns and cities. Various other developments took place, notably in the economic life of the areas over which the port settlements came to have domination. Therefore population concentrated on those 6 centres. Unlike the United States of America, which ,1 think is the best, comparative example which I can make, we have continued in that way. There has been a concentration, or perhaps an over-concentration and influence on and by 6 port capitals. In the United States there was a population movement westward. . Railways preceded the development of settlements and various centres were, set up so that there was an urban frontier' as well as a rural frontier in the early part of the 19th Century. The population moved on to the west coast and then something approximating the coastal distribution of population in Australia came into being. But in the meantime the middle of the American continent, which was basically settleable, had become settled. That was not the case in -Australia for reasons which are all too to those outside it. So do not let us try to pin. this thing on this Government or any other government. There are other aspects of the matter on which, I hope, 1 will have time to dilate. However, basically what .the honourable member for Corio was talking about is the process of urbanisation, which used to be called the rural-urban drift, by which people have increasingly concentrated in tralia. The process of urbanisation occurred in some ways in other parts of",35,Population Victoria At Each Population Census 1933 To 1971
105,Mr Scholes,The table refers solely,36,Population Victoria At Each Population Census 1933 To 1971
106,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Lucock),"century. This work made considerable -reference to the distrubitiou of population in. this process of urbanisation in Britain, Europe and elsewhere, but notably in Britain and Europe. So, initially, we are not talking really of provincial centres and regional development; we are talking about the process of urbanisation because from that stem any problems that may exist in provincial centres and in regional development. This area was touched on only lightly by the honourable member for Corio. In that sense I would criticise the honourable member's terms of reference, although he fundamentally is trying to do something which is sensible. But I believe that he puts gorward a too narrow term of .City Sydney Melbourne Brisbane Adelaide Penh Hobart Sources: Commonwealth Census 1961: Commonwealth Census of Retail Establishments 1957; New South .Wales Statistical Register I960. shows how certain functions are conoccurred basically because of governmental centrated in the capital cities. I do not influence. wivh fo dilate upon the whole matter. Although the figures are slightly dated, the relativity is roughly the same and we get island of Tasmania was settled simultathe following kind of situation. Firstly 56 neously through 2 centres-Launcesto n in per cent of the population of New South the north and Hobart in the south. TasWales was concentrated in Sydney at the mania even developed one or two other time of the 1961 census. Some 57 per cent coastal centres of reasonable standing. As of the retail activity and 73 per cent of the a result the island developed a decentramanufacturing jobs were concentrated in lisation of various functions, not the least that city. That sort of situation can be manufacturing, which has not been reproreproduced through 4 other capital cities. duced in any other States. This is the basic The only exception is Hobart where, at the reason why we have the situation about same date, 33 per cent of the population, which the honourable member for Corio 40 per cent of the retailing activity and 32 complains. In saying that I do not suggest per cent of the manufacturing jobs were that it is impossible for governments to do concentrated. In other words, there is in anything about the matter, nor that it Australia only one example of actual should be. But I find the honourable memdecentralisation in operation. It has ber somewhat less than factual when he occurred, as it were, naturally. There is makes certain suggestions. In fact, I am reference for the consideration of this problem because the problem stems from the metropolitan situation and only from there, and after that, one may come up with certain rural problems. The extent of urbanisation in Australia is welt known, it is not necessarily well known in degrees of particularity. I would like, if I may, to incorporate in Hansard a small table based on census statistics relating to the 6 State capitals. 1 will draw attention to it later in 2 or 3 sentences. Is leave granted?

108,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Lucock),"surprised that he concentrated on Victoria in this matter. I say that for several reasons, one of them being that the honourable member comes from that State. He suggests that there is a great Victorian Government emphasis on ""Melbourne to the detrimeni of the rural areas. Whether or not that is so 1 cannot prove in the course of the next 5 or so minutes, but the plain fact of the matter is that for governcomparisons, of medium sized towns and mental or other reasons, Victoria has the densest average distribution of population of any Australian State, including Tasmania. It could even be said-fro m some points of view that Victoria has the best population distribution in a balanced fashion which is partly a reflection on the fact that most of the countryside is able to be occupied and worked in some sort of way. I do not think I have found myself in a position before of making a brief for the Bolle Government but I would like to point out that the Liberal government of Victoria for some time have consistently tried all forms of manufacturing and industrial locational incentives to get decentralisation moving in Victoria to a greater extent than already exists. So it is less than fair to suggest that the Government is willy-nilly interested in the promotion of Melbourne to the detriment of the "" rest of Victoria. If we turn to this Government-and taking up the same point made by the honourable member for Corio-w e clearly have example after example of governmental legislation, sometimes fully supported, sometimes supported to a lesser degree and sometimes even opposed in certain respects by those on the opposite side of the chamber, to assist rural industries. A substantia) proportion of our recent sessions has been taken up by measures to .support rural industries. If the honourable member does not think that these measures have been designed to keep people on the land and in country towns I am not sure what he thinks they are designed to do. In the last few months we had a Bill-and other Bills have also been introduceddesigned to keep the Shepparton canneryin operation for the sole purpose, one. assumes, of retaining the population in that centre instead of having it drift in the direction of quite a long period of time in some cases Melbourne or some other capital city. Therefore I think the honourable member does less than justice, to put it mildly, to both Federal and State Governments as I have shown by a couple of examples in relation to this problem. Decentralisation is an important matter. 1 believe that the honourable member who preceded me completely failed to appreciate the difficulties of achieving it. In the first place Australia has a great lack, by world medium sized regional centres for the reasons which I spoke of earlier in reference to the United States. He failed also to take account of the fact that possibly the most against decentralisation is that there is a lack of differential labour costs which is not the situation in the United States. In that country there are regional disparities in costs and one can employ people in the south east for about 70 per cent of the wage than would have to be paid for labour in New York or on the west coast. Clearly this is an incentive to decentralisation. It is an incentive to put industry down in the south east because the wage bill is a good deal less. If an industry is a labour intensive industry such as the textile industry, so much the better. We do not have the advantage, if it is an advantage, of an incentive for decentralisation. 1 think that in a speech delivered on another occasion I drew attention to a small experiment which took place in Townsville about a year ago. That place is probably one of our better examples, and one of our few examples, of significant decentralisation outside the capital cities. A governmentally established industrial estate was set up at the cost of something like $600,000 and a year or so after having been set up it had placed on it one tilemaking industry employing, I think, 3 or 4 people at the time.

112,Mr Whitlam (Werriwa,"Leade r of theand a majority of Government members. I am certain that there would be a great degree and a growing degree of common interest between members from both sides of this House if they were to get down together and consider this subject. I will concede that tbe honourable member for Denison, coming from the smallest of Australia's State capitals and from a State which and no vote had been taken when the does have some other considerable centres of urban development, could contribute to the proceedings of such a committee. A committee is bipartisan. There is a remarkable solidarity among the members of any committee which is set up in this Parliament. I am disappointed that the honourable gentleman did not support the idea. Even if, however, the idea is too novel of Mr Beaton's proposal for this committee for Government members, it is not a new and the subjects which it was to cover. idea. Back in 1961, a former Leader of the Australian Country Party-no t the immeIs leave granted? There being no objection, diate past one or the one before that, but leave is granted. the one before that, Sir Earle Page-move d that there be an expert committee appointed to inquire into and report on the best means of securing effective decentralisation of population, industry, communications and administration. He was supported by the late Mr David Drummond, with whom I worked for nearly 4 years on the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Review. I came to know and to respect and to share Mr Drummond's ideas of decentralisation. I prefer the term 'concentrated' or 'accelerated development'. However one describes it, Mr Drummond showed as Minister for Education in New South Wales in the 1930s that there are fields where governments can accelerate the development of some areas. Where now would the city of Armidale be in New South Wales were is not for the teachers college which Mr v) communications, housing, transport, Drummond sited there and for the university which he initiated there? Education and science is clearly a field where great initiatives can be taken, particularly in the tertiary field-in which, of course, the Australian Labor Party includes, even if the Liberal Party does not, the question of teacher education-and where the Commonwealth can contribute to the accelerated development of centres now. the former honourable member for Bendigo, Minister for Labour and National Service, Mr Beaton, moved an amendment to detail then by the honourable member for Kalfurther matters upon which the expert committee should make recommendations, but he supported the establishment of such a committee. I was the second speaksr on our side. The time for the debate ran out; I was given the right to continue my remarks: the matter remained on the notice paper; the debate was never concluded; Parliament was dissolved for the 1961 elections. On 29th April 1965, Mr Beaton himself moved a motion to set up a joint parliamentary committee-no t an expert committee; a joint parliamentary committee-to investigate this matter. I ask leave of the House to incorporate in Hansard the text (The document read as follows)(a) a joint parliamentary committee consisting of Government and Opposition Members from both Houses be appointed to enquire into and report on the best means by which the Commonwealth, by co-operation with the States and local government, may secure more balanced development of population, industry, communications and administration; (b) the committee make recommendations in regard to(i) those industries which should be established in provincial, country and northern areas; (ii) concessions in individual, company, sales or other taxation to encourage such industries; (iii) other concessions and assistance; (iv) government investment either alone or jointly with private investment to' develop or establish such industries; water, power, light and fuel; (vi) the decentralization of government administration; (vii) education, medical and other facilities in decentralized areas; and (viii) any related matters which in the opinion of the committee will assist in obtaining more balanced develop' ments; and (c) the committee be empowered to call evidence from any person, organization or authority it sees fit.",39,Concentration In Australian Capital Crties

115,Mr Whitlam,"Mr Beaton was folgoorlie ( Mr Collard), and then by the Minister for Primary Industry at the time, Mr Anthony, who said about this proposal: His suggestion""That is Mr Beaton's; that a joint paliamenlary committee should be set up. to deal with this problem is' a bit late, really -for Mr Anthony was headed by Mr Antheny"" His proposal would not fit tbe bill as well as what . the Government has proposed already. At die premiers Conference held in July last year: that is, 1964' it was suggested that there should be joint meetings between Commonwealth . authorities and State departments to go into this problem of ' decentralisation throughout Australia. On 5th and '.6th March this year-that, is, 1965'there was a meeting of representatives of the ' States and the Commonwealth, which shows a positive action to try to do something about this major problem. That was the Commonwealth and State Officials Committee on Decentralisation. It has since met on 3 occasions-o n 30th November 1966, 7th February 1969 and 12th October last. It is because of our exasperation with this Official Committee, which was set up after the Premiers Conference in 1964 and behind which the present -Leader of the Country Party hid in 1965, that we move again for the establishment of a parliamentary committee. It is inconceivable that if there had been.a parliamentary committee it would have taken as long to consider and to recommend measures for decentralisation as this Officials Committee has taken. The Officials Committee has met 4. times in over 7 years. We know that when either House of this Parliament sets up a committee it acts as an amazing catalyst and spur to. official committees. The Nimmo Committee was set up within a month of the Senate setting up, pursuant to a promise I made in the 1967 Senate election that there would, be a Senate select committee to look into medical and hospital costs. People act very, quickly in these circumstances. Let us set up a parliamentary committee; a committee which would have a few advisers; one which would report promptly; and one, above all, which would get members on both sides to tackle these matters. Mr Beaton's motion in 1965 never came to a vote. At 12.30 p.m., which was the cut-off time for General Business at that time, our Whip moved that the time for the discussion be extended to 12.45 p.m. Government supporters voted against this extension of time, although Mr Anthony was on his feet at the time when the debate was interrupted. The list of Government mem1 hers who voted against the extension of lime himself. The 1966 elections Came before the debate could ever be resumed. Then. Mr Beaton again, on 13th April 1967 raised the matter for a third time. As1 say, it is not a new matter, but for the Government it is still a novel one. . I come then to this Officials Committee. I asked the new Prime Minister( Mr McMahon) when he took over what were the names and positions of the Commonwealth members of the Committee. On 6th .May last he gave me the following answer: . .' . it is not the policyof this Government to disclose the type of information for which the honourable member asks. I put a question on this matter on the notice paperfor the Minister for Trade and -Industry, the Leader of the Country Party( Mr Anthony), because he had admitted that his Department was represented on this joint Committee. It transpires, from an answer which he gave on -29th September, recalling a pre-McMahon Government answer, on 14th April last year, that the departments represented on the Committee are the Prime Minister's, Treasury, Trade and Industry, Primary Industry, National Development and Labour and National Service. Firstly, it is remarkable that the Postmaster-General's Department is not represented on the Committee. All the State Committees which have investigated this matter have pointed out that communications in the hands of the Commonwealth are a key cost item in accelerated development. Secondly, the Department of Shipping and Transport is not represented on the Committee. Clearly, the Commonwealth's responsibilities, its sole initiatives in rebuilding country railways, and its responsibilities foT building roads, should be considered. Nor is the Department of Civil Aviation represented on the' Committee; the State committees have pointed out tbe Commonwealth's crucial role in regard to aerodromes. Nor is the Department of Education and Science represented on the Committee, as I have already mentioned. Where wojuldJTjownsville be now but fpr the ComrrTcS'^ealth contributions in tbe field of education and science? A concluding example is that the Department of the Environment, Aborigines and . the Arts, .which is now responsible for tourism, is .not represented on the Committee. If there is any new industry which will give employment in the country and which will earn export income in Australia, it is tourism. The motion refers to provincial cities. I wish that Australians who live outside the State capitals would rid themselves of the idea that the word 'city' is a 4-letter word, a dirty word. The future of decentralisation in Australia depends on building Up cities. It is only in the Australian federation that one would ever use the word 'city' as a synonym for 'State capital'. In the American present position regarding the report of the Comfederation and in the Canadian federation one does not have this colonial definition of yet been received by theof Government. 'city' as a State capital.

The future of Australia, the future comfort of the population of our State capitals, and the future prosperity of the people who still live in the country depend on building up reason why Albury-Wodonga should be built existing centres and creating cities.

(The document read as follows)-^ Dear Mr Whitlam, On 30 November 1971 'you asked me a'question relating to decentralisation and the location of Commonwealth Government Departments. Since the question was asked I have received a report from the Chairman of the Public Service Board on the possible transfer of central offices of Commonwealth departments still located in Melbourne to a mid-point such as Albury-Wodonga Instead of to Canberra. In his advice the Chairman of the Board said: 'It is apparent that there would be significant costs in terms of departmental operating efficiency if the central offices of some departments were transferred to a' country centre outside of Canberra. One major difficulty would be the recruitment and retention of a sufficient number of staff, particularly specialised and senior staff, in such a location. There would also be direct costs, such as additional transport and communication expenses, over those arising if the units were located in Canberra or Melbourne. From the viewpoint of C.P.S. administration, therefore, the Board would have no reason to.recommend the transfer of central offices of Commonwealth Departments to A lbury-Wodonga.'

TheMr MacKELLAR (Warringah) (12.20)I was most interested to hear the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) conclude by reading out some aspects of his Party's policy on decentralisation. This bears very closely on what has been said today because one member of his Party obviously cannot agree with that policy as he has moved for the appointment of a select committee to investigate these aspects of decentralisation. would be operating in the House of RepMembers of the Opposition seem surprised when the Government refuses to countenance the setting up of various select committees. But I wonder whether members of tbe Opposition realise just how many select committees they have proposed establishing in the life of this Parliament. I wonder whether they realise the physical problems associated with setting up and servicing that number of select committees. I think that it might be useful for the Australian people and for members of the Opposition to know the number of select committees that the Opposition has proposed during this Parliament. Proposals by the Opposition have been made to appoint select committees to inquire into the following Bills: The Loan (Qantas Airways Limited) Bill, the Air Navigation Bill, the Social Services Bill, the Superannuation Bill, the Repatriation Bill, the Social Services Bill (No. 2), the New South Wales Grant (Flood Mitigation) Bill, the Post and Telegraph Bill, the Repatriation Bill (No. 2), the Loan (War Service Land Settlement) Bill (1970) and the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Bill .1970. The appointment of select committees has been proposed to deal with airport and harbour development, decentralisation and an amendment to tbe motion that the House take note of the paper-'Servic e Employment, Committee of Inquiry' seeking the appointment of a joint select committee. Not content with that, 6 motions seeking the suspension of Standing Orders to enable motions to be moved proposing the appointment of select committees have been moved by the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron), the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam), the honourable member for Oxley( Mr Hayden), the honourable member for Chifley( Mr Armitage), the honourable member for Bendigo (Mi Kennedy) and the honourable member for Dawson (Dr Patterson). In all, 21 additional select committees have been proposed by the Opposition during the life of this Parliament. Anybody in his right senses would realise that the members of this Parliament have more to do than merely belong to select committees of this Parliament. If. every request for the appointment of a select committee proposed by the Opposition was taken up, 21 select committees resentatives. One wonders why, in this proliferation of requests for select committees, the Opposition is not brave enough to decide policies for itself and to come out and tell the Australian people what its policies are instead of hiding behind requests for the establishment of select committees which would result in other people doing the work of the Opposition for it while its members get on with the internal strife which dogs the Australian Labor Party. The honourable member for Corio( Mr Scholes) has opened up a most interesting area of debate. I agree with quite a number of things that the honourable member has said. This is an area in which we are all tremendously interested not only as members of Parliament but as dwellers in this country. The honourable member seemed surprised that the proportion of people on the land was declining. I cannot understand why this fact comes as such a surprise to members of the Opposition. The historical fact is that, as the economy of a country develops sophistication, a declining proportion of that country's population will be engaged in rural industry. This has happened everywhere in the world. Yet this development seems to come as a bit of a surprise to members of the Opposition and particularly the honourable member for Corio. It is not hard, if one thinks about it -withou t the need to set up a select committee-to find out the reasons for this decline. This decline has occurred not only in the numbers of people with country holdings but also in small country towns and their populations. If one investigates or thinks about this trend, it is not very difficult to come up with an answer as to the reasons for the development. There has heen an accelerating technological change in the carrying on of the business of primary production all over the world. As a country becomes agriculturally more sophisticated, the technical change in the machinery which 'is used to produce primary products inevitably whittles away the number of human beings required to take part in agricultural production. The number of people required to perform rural work inevitably declines as technical change proliferates in country areas. But not only has this occurred but also has the demand for services in small country towns declined. Other changes occur as economic sophistication increases in a country. A most important one which has not been mentioned during this debate is the improvement in transport facilities available to country people. I refer not only to the motor car and light aircraft in more remote areas but also to the quality and extent of the road system. I come from a small country town. T 'can remember very clearly the numbers of horses and sulkies that were to be seen in the country areas of north western New South Wales just after the Second World War. Now, a sulky is virtually a museum piece. It would be unusual to find'a horse and sulky being used anywhere in country areas. The rcsuit is that people not only have the opportunity to travel more widely but also in many cases have the facility to travel and do travel more widely than they did. Where do they go? They go to the larger country areas and they go to the cities more frequently than they did in the past. I can remember when it was really a big effort to travel 330 miles from the north west of New South Wales to Sydney. One thought about this trip for some days and prepared for it most carefully. It could take up to 2 days in an old Morris car. Now one can literally hop into ones car and undertake this trip in 8 hours or less. The reason for the decline in smaller country towns, which is being called into question fnday, is not only that not as much farm work by country citizens is required as was in the past but also that the land owners livwhole series of physical and psychological ing around the small country towns do not need the provision of the back up facilities that they had in the past. In addition, cultural opportunities for that one spends up to 20 per cent of one's people in small country towns are limited waking hours travelling to and from work. when compared with those available in The environmental disturbance occurrng larger country towns and in cities. It is in major cities is something which is quite only to be expected that the brightest sons of people in country areas will look for opportunities in places where they can realise their potential. They will seek opportunities for varied and interesting jobs. In other words, the pressure on them to move from country areas will be very strong. 1 deplore this. I deplore the necessity for it. But we must face the facts-somehVng which the Labor Party is not noted for doing. We must realise that this will occur and we shouid not be surprised when it does. I have been emphasising ma'.nly the situation with respect to the smaller country towns. This pressure for movement is not so great in the larger country towns which have built up a certain amount of industrialisation. Another point is that cit'es of a reasonable size-I.a m not referring to capital cities-offe r considerable attractions for people from the country. This is particularly so with respect to. seaside cities. Those people who have lived in inland Australia, particularly in the hotter area's, will know just how pleasant it is at times lo get away from the physical conditions which obtain in those areas of Australia and go to a seaside town. Job opportunities and the variety of employment offered there are much greater and this is a big incentive for people to go to the cities. In addition the cultural opportunities are much hotter for people in cities than they are in country towns, particularly the small country towns. The honourable member for Corio and other honourable members have quite rightly recognised the disadvantages of city dwelling, particularly in the major cities of Melbourne and Sydney. As we have heard frequently in this chamber, land costs in those cities have rieen quite markedly, forcing people to move further and further out and developing the so-called urban sprawl with all the problems that it engenders. We have overcrowding in many areas of the cities and this again leads to a problems. Transport difficulties in the major cities act as a deterrent to' many people who might otherwise come to the cities, and quite rightly so. It is ridiculous properly becoming much more important. People are realising that if they want to live in circumstances which appear delightful to them they must pay for efforts to overcome environmental disturbance. They are realising also that in blindly building up major cities they are making a rod for their backs. A serious problem in major cities at the moment is the increase in the crime rate. These are just some of the features of city life which act as deterrents to people coming to major cities. But let us face the situation and be city areas-cause d by the drift to the honest about it. At the moment we have cities. I agree that there is a very real not only the historical pressures moving need, and I have said so, to develop people from rural areas to city areas but growth centres in areas outside the major also the rural crisis, the diminution of cities. But I cannot and will not agree that prices and. the loss of viability. of many the way to do this is to set up the 21st rural enterprises.

He has not done this for the very good reason that he knows that as soon as he selects one country town or city he will have the rest of the country areas up in arms. He will gain votes in one place but lose votes in the other rural areas of Australia. Let us be perfectly frank about it. We on this side of the House, and I in the Budget debate this year, have outlined the problems of people in rural areas-and emergence of transport from the primeval of the horse and sulky.

If he will just wait he will hear some comments which may be of value to him. sive. I am pointing out a few facts. The -honourable member for Warringah said: 'We think there are things more urgent than setting up a select committee'. He rubbished the whole idea of a select committee. He said that the Opposition had moved for the establishment of 21 select committees, but what he did not point out was that the Government had knocked back every one of them because it does not want to educate i'self on the problems of the Australian poeple or on the remedies. It has refused to accept advice from outside. It is a typical, complacent Tory government; it could not care less. The honourable member for Warringah said that a select committee is not appropriate because it is an urgent matter but be did not, of course, amend the motion the Opposition has moved. Nor did he explain why, if this problem was being treated so seriously, the Government's committee has been mce'ing with State officials for 7 years. It has met 4 times in 7 years and it still has not produced a report on decentralisation for the Australian people and the Government to study. This shows how urgent decentralisation is to honourable members opposite. There is not enough time left in this debate-onl y 5 minutes remain-for me to go much further. The simple point that the Opposition is making is that there is an urgent need for effective Supply) (12.42)I think that the honourCommonwealth action on decentralisation We all have the chance by accepting this motion to inform ourselves so that we can decide what we can do about it. This is an opportunity for all Par ies to be represented, including the Country Party, whose representatives have been as silent as the grave today. They have nothing to contribute except a request that their dwindling farm vote be made even more secure against population changes in the future. us something There are Liberal members who represent rural areas. The honourable member for Ballaarat ( Mr Erwin) should be concerned about the economic position of the provincial city which he represents. He has nothing to say. He will not support a move in this Parliament today to set up a committee on decentralisation. The honourable member for Ballaarat should at some time, either on the adjournment or during this debate, express his views on decentralisation. prick the honourable member too often either. There are many things which can be clone. We are putting a very simple proposition to the House and to the Government today. It is that there should be a select committee from all parties because unless we accept that there must be Commonwealth participation in decentralisation there will be no decentralisation. There will be a continuing over-centralisation of population in city regions and a continuation of stagnation in rural and provincial areas. That is a simple proposi ion. Does the Government support decentralisation or does it not? If it does it should do something about it and not keep up the delaying action which has now been going on for at least 7 years so far as the State and Commonwealth officials committee is concerned. Because of a shortage of time there is not much more I can say although there is a lot I would like to say. I am particularly concerned about this situation but I have agreed to let the honourable member for Riverina( Mr Grassby) speak briefly on the subject also. able member for Warringah ( Mr MacKellar) made the most powerful point that emerged in this debate when he pointed out that this method of attempting to formulate policy by the Labor Party",45,William Mcmahon

126,Mr Garland (Curtin,"Minister forOpposition is really no policy whatsoever. He pointed out that there were some 22 attempts by the Opposition to set up select committees or the like in order to examine certain aspects of government. It has been,. I think, very plain in the last year or two that the Opposition cannot devise policy with any precision and has to resort to this technique in coming in .here and speaking very superficially and loosely about difficult matters such as social questions, political questions and economic questions and speaking very superficially also upon the motion that a committee ought to be set up. I submit that that is no substitute for policy but only a trick or a device that is used by the Opposition. Obviously honourable members opposite regard it as a good device but it is only a device used to cover up a lack of policy. I suggest that it Would be more appropriate for a Party' which holds itself out to be the alternative government of this country to sit down and do the hard work itself, devise a policy with some precision and bring it into this place, have it debated and not simply run away and suggest that a committee ought to be set up. I will speak further on this matter because I think it is an important one and it is time that it was examined. The honourable member opposite who is looking at me now is a great advocate in this place for the setting up of numbers of committees. I think we have to face fairly and squarely the fact that there is a limit to the part of the overall economy of the nation. number of committees that can be set up. There is a limit to the time which honourable members can spend on committees. They have many other functions and I do not have to tell honourable members that. They have their electoral problems, they have to participate in the debates of this House and they have to write their speeches. Presumably they have to discuss policy-a t least we on this side do-Order! The time allotted for precedence to general business has expired. The Minister for Supply will have leave to continue his speech when the debate is resumed. The resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day under general business for the next sitting.

I think it is probably true to say that we have grown unused to a rapid response to a quickly emerging situation by the huge monolithic, almost amorphous masses that modern day governments have become. It is to the credit of the Ministers and the Government that such rapid action has been taken in this field. The philosophy of the scheme has already been spelt out in a fine statement by the Prime Ministhe risk of being repetitious 1 wish to look briefly at the philosophy behind the scheme. It is true that its implication is a short term one. It aims to take immediate action to help correct a problem that is not It aims to fill a gap before such measures as rural reconstruction, rural retraining, marginal dairying measures and new wool policies emerge, and before any of these longer term and more fundamental schemes start to bite into the rural economy. So we are faced with a hiatus period in which problems exist in certain regional areas. The scheme attempts to deal with the newly emerging problem of those areas so defined. The Government alms to take specific action on a specific problem that applies intensely to specific areas of the economy. It will aid in relieving general hardship that has occurred in provincial centres and areas where the unemployment rate is very much higher than it is In metropolitan areas.

At,"have journeyed from main capital city areas to provincial centres such as Bendigo, Ballarat, Newcastle, Murray Bridge or Renmark, that the squeeze on the rural industries, which has come about 'largely because the failure of prices for agricultural commodities to rise on overseas market has rubbed off on the home markets. It is not only those on rural blocks in these important provincial areas who are feeling the pinch. It is for this sort Of reason that, policies for some time. It is right that, durto^ a degree-and to a degree only-the Government has decided to pour in funds at the rate of $2m a month to these areas. I' think that the added importance of this scheme is that it is no! only the farmers' who are feeling the squeeze but it is aiso the main street traders-the butcher, the baker and the candlestick maker-and all those who are in business in these provincial centres. The schenie probably would not be a good one if it aimed to perpetuate jobs and employment in areas over and above the potential of those areas in The years to come. But it is proper that this investment in the education and'training of people, and the expertise of people there, should not be lost to 'hose areas. It is very important that, to a level, the facilprovided for this purpose. Nobody would ities that are offered in those centres today should continue and increase so !hat.' in time' to come, when economic circumstances may well have changed; those areas of Australia with clean air, with beauty, with trees and with good facilities will have the capacity to at'ract people from some of the overcrowded cities with their sm'Og problems and their diseconomies of scale.

Secondly it has had a look to and their facilities than they otherwise would have. It is worthy of note that this scheme introduced by the Government-it is a completely new piece of thinking-is limited in time to 30th June 1973. It is important that the House take note of this : fact. It is limited-to that time'because we are not going to see or feel much benefit from rural reconstruction, rural retraining, marginal dairying measures or new wool ing the hiatus, the Government should firstly recognise that the problem exists and, secondly, do something about i ' . Having discussed my idea of .'the practical philosophy behind the scheme let me now move on to the administration of it. Only yesterday the Federal Government completed itsdiscussions with the States on ; the administration of this scheme. I believe that certain facts are still .undecided and need further clarification, but the Government has at this point of time tied in the major elements of this scheme with the States. Having nominally accepted the scheme the States now have to-in accordance with their function and their jurisdiction-dra w up proper priorities for the use of the amount of taxpayers' funds doubt that the Slates have more local expertise lo decide whether work should be done on a major bridge at one provincial centre or on a toilet block somewhere else. That is not the sort of priority that we in this Parliament should decide. It is proper that the State governments should look at this and give advice. So the position is quite clearly that the Commonwealth has made available taxpayers' funds for this use, and now the States have to draw up It is to be hoped that most of this capiprovincial cities it will be think it is worth mentioning in passing that see what projects can be worthwhile and what are a waste of money when administered by local government authorities. I hope these lessons are learnt and I hope that perhaps some labour that is skilled rather than unskilled will be available to local government authorities now so that more worthwhile projects can be undertaken. There is, I gather, some area of disagreement in the thinking of the Parliament in general as regards the proportion of these funds that should be used fbr parstatement would be provincial centres. I ticular purposes. The Prime Minister in his statement mentioned the fact thatpreferably no more than 25 per cent of these funds should be used for equipment and like purposes. This assistance is similar to bursement of this capital sum in order to the drought aid given in the past; it is meant for labour intensive projects. I would say in passing that 1 would have though there could well be a need for more than 25 per cent of the funds to be expended on equipment, depending on what projects are undertaken. There are only 2 ways in which funds in addition to 25 per cent of what is provided by the Commonwealth can be found for equipment. Either the States find them or there will be a request to this Government to provide added expenditure for that purpose. I see no problem involved in this. I note the fact that the maximum amount of elasticity has been left, according to the Prime Minister's statement, lo. cope with just this sort of emergency. Although the sum of $2m a month has been mentioned in this statement, it will be adjustable from ment and support it heavily in its ideas time to time according to the requirements of the situation. I have figures to hand which give the the following amendment to the motion proportion of unemployed State by State in that the House take note of the paper: metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas. One quick look at thesefiguresshows quite motion: clearly that New South Wales, with nearly 9,000 unemployed in the metropolitan area, has a far greater number of unemployed. 11,700, in non-metropolitan areas. Different patterns emerge State by State. The situation in South Australia is at the opposite extreme from the figures I have quoted. In South Australia 72 per cent of unemployed are in the metropolitan area and 27 per cent are in the country, which is markedly different from the New South Wales position. I would just say in passing that I believe the Government must look carefully at the reasons for these figures. Not the least of the reasons for these figures is that three-quarters of the population of South Australia lives in Adelaide. In addition, a satellite city such as Elizabeth tends to distort the overall picture. I believe that a special allowance will be made for these circumstances. It certainly should be. In New South Wales, for instance, cities such as Newcastle and Wollongong, which are virtually the size of Adelaide, in terms of the definition in this believe on the one hand that we must look at the statistics and their importance, but on the other hand 1 believe there must obviously be some re-patterning of the disachieve some fairness of distribution. May I finish up my remarks by saying that I give very great credit to the Government for acting so promptly in a specific area of need where assistance is necessary. I cannot remember any other occasion on which such aid has been directed so unerringly to the area where it is necessary. I see this assistance as part of an overall pattern. Not only do I see this as part of the pattern of the economic circumstances of the country and the Government's attempts to control inflation but also I see this as part of the pattern of the resurrection and the promoting of a more healthy rural atmosphere in years to come. It is an integral short term important part of this programme. I congratulate the Governbehind this scheme. That the following words be added to the 'and urge ! the Government to initiate immedi1 ate discussions with the States so that the first grants under this programme can be made before Christmas and further urges the Government, at the some time, lo confer with the Slates lo ensure the resumption of the rural reconstruction scheme now halted by lack of finance in the various Slates. The House regrets that the Government has not made provision to extend unemployment assistance to alleviate problems of growing unemployment in metropolitan areas with particular emphasis on. the problems and placement of school leavers which can be accentuated as a result of poor employment conditions in the country areas'.",47,Unemployment Relief
131,Mr Barnard (Bass) (2.31),"I moveA week ago the Prime Minister( Mr An example is the proposed re-organisaMcMahon) announced in the Parliament a programme to make money available to the Slates for the relief of unemployment in non-metropolitan areas. The Prime .Minister in announcing the grants made the point that much of this non-metropolitan unemployment is of a structural kind. 'For this reason it required specific rather .than general economic measures to deal with it. Undoubtedly, this is correct. But the Prime Minister ignored the fact that these pockets of structural unemployment feel in heightened form the impact of general economic measures to reduce demand across the board. This sort of structural unemployment does not respond .to broad economic stimulus. But it would be foolish to argue from this that these po;kets of rural unemployment do not feel the impact of general economic measures to dampen the economy and reduce demand. The unfortunate people in rural areas are in the invidious position of feeldoes not give any estimate of the size of ing chill winds from both structural unemployment and the general reduction in economic activity. They are cushioned only against the beneficial effects of a revival in of the 1969-70 financial year. It is possible economic activity produced by broad economic policy. For this reason it is unfortunate that the Government should have delayed for so long in applying these grants. The Prime Minister implied that structural unemployment in rural industries is a new phenomenon, that it has emerged in -dramatic form only since the last Budget and that the Government had acted swiftly to crush it. This interpretation just does not square with the facts. Unemployment of this sort has been a factor for several years. It is part of much broader social ' and economic changes in country areas which have occurred in the past 10 years. The scope of these basic changes is beyond this debate, but a majority of small country centres have been so affected that even a small change in the composition of the work force spreads hardship in the community. These changes may take the form of minor changes in the policy of a State Government or a commercial firm, for example a decision to concentrate staff at a larger centre. More sweeping changesmay result from important switches in Commonwealth Government policy. tion of postal services throughout the Commonwealth; this may involve the transfer of only a few personnel and families but it can have a serious impact on economic activity in a small community. These changes of the past few years have increased the difficulties caused by the structural changes in world markets and the Australian rural industries. Now the general downturn in employment and economic activity flowing from deliberate budgetary policy have added to economic hardship in non-rural communities. It is difficult to assess the full magnitude of this sort of unemployment because figures on the size of the work force in rural centres are hard to get. The monthly statistics issued by the Department of Labour and National Service give the raw figures in important rural subdivisions for registered unemployed, registered vacancies and recipients of unemployment benefit. It the work force in these subdivisions. The latest work force figures available from the Department arc estimates made at the end from these to get an idea' of unemployment in key rural centres. Using the September unemployment figures and these work force estimates, unemployment in Dubbo was 2.62 per cent, in Ballarat 2.29 per cent, in Bendigo 1.84 per cent, and Toowoomba 1.78 percent. Admittedly these examples are somewhat crude but they do give an indication of how unemployment in major regional centres is considerably above the long term national average on which the Treasurer ( Mr Snedden) relies. With this sort of structural unempoyment, the first drift is to the major provincial centres. When unemployment builds up in these centres, as it clearly has in the 4 centres I have cited, the next drift is to the major cities. This adds to the pressures on employment in the metropolitan centres. For-this reason remedial action to curb structural unemployment in the country has the effect of alleviating unemployment and economic hardship in the cities. It is not possible to divide unemployment into separate compartments as implied in the Prime Minister's statement. This brings me to the first point contained in the amendment moved by the Opposition. It is designed to clear away the delibdrafted and shepherded through the Parliaerate vagueness which the Government has encouraged ' about the time scale of this programme of grants. These grants cannot be regarded as a measure to stimulate economic activity in areas affected by structural unemployment. At best it is a relief measure in the form of a holding operation to prevent further deterioration in these legislation to authorise, the grants to the areas. The money will go via the States to local government authorities for public works. The point that concerns the Opposition is the lapse of time before the impact of this spending is felt in the communities the grants have been designed to help. The time scale outlined by the Prime Minister is extremely unsatisfactory. He said that the Government envisaged an arrangement providing for grants for employmen creating activities to be made to' the States for the period up to 30th June 1973 subject to review after the end of the 1971-72 financial year. However, legislation for the grants will not be intromunities afflicted by rural unemployment.' duced until the autumn session of Parliament which begins on 22nd February. In the interim, temporary arrangements would be made for financing the scheme. It is the duty of the Government to spell out clearly this extremely vague : pledge of temporary financing. Does it mean that the Commonwealth will underwriteadvance grants made to the States? Alternatively, is it intended to divert some of the funds made available to the States for the rural reconstruction scheme to relief of rural unemployment? If either of these courses is intended by the Government, there has been no sign of action by any of the State governments to get the scheme going. The State Premiers are not to blame for this; presumably they are still waiting for the Commonwealth to elaborate on its proposals. The overwhelming impression to be got member for Dawson (Dr Patterson) has from the way the Government has made the point repeatedly that most of this approached this relief measures is that it assistance is not going to the country areas does not regard them as a matter of where its need is most vital. Far too much urgency. If the Government wanted to get of this assistance has gone back to the legislation through the Parliament to get finance companies and pastoral companies this scheme going before the end of the in the cities. Assistance has gone to sesson it could have done so. It would wealthy graziers at the expense of the have had the full co-operation of the small growers who are in greatest need. Opposition in securing the passing of the But assistance by the Government in this enabling Bills through the Parliament. In form was promptly accepted and translated marked contrast to the speed with which rapidly into effective action. When a legislation to assist the wool industry was ment by the Government, there is a complete lack of urgency about getting this scheme to work. Unless there is evidence of a much greater will on the part of the Government to get the States moving, it will be months before any benefit is felt from these relief grants. At the earliest, States will not clear the Parliament until March. By the time unemployment in rural areas is assessed by the States and the grants transmitted to local government bodies, it will be near the end of the financial year. On the time scale indicated by the Prime Minister, it will be at least 6 months before this so called emergency assistance is transmitted to areas of need. The programme will then be subject to the review referred to in the Prime Minister's statement* This is hardly evidence of swift, decisive and humane action to bolster comFor this reason the Opposition has moved that the House urges on the. Government the importance of getting down with the States to the. task of assessing structural unemployment, selecting the areas of greatest, need and getting the first grants out before the end of the year. Unless this is done this relief scheme .will have no impact whatsoever on the crucial January and February period when ,tens of thousands of school leavers will be looking for jobs. All school leavers will be feeling the crunch of a tighter economy. The plight of country children leaving school will be particularly acute because of the structural unemployment outlined in the Prime Minister's statement. In summary, millions of dollars have been made available in recent months to assist the wool industry.

Is the amendment seconded? Mr GrassbyI second the amendment and reserve my right to speak. statement in this House on 2nd December relating to relief for non-me:ropolitan unemployment. At the end of his statement he said: .Designed as it is to meet the emerging social December, the day before the Prime and economic problem of unemployment in nonmetropolitan areas, the scheme will I believe be warmly welcomed by the House and by the community at large. I support those remarks because this proposal has been warmly welcomed in rural areas. Anyone with a national outlook will give a warm reception to a proposal such as this which will give assistance to rural people. I believe that honourable members should not clutter up the consideration of this matter by speaking about unemployment in metropolitan areas. Yet this is exactly what the Opposition is doing; this is exactly what the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr members of the Australian Country Party Barnard) is doing. The amendment to tbe motion 'That the House take note of the paper' commences with the words: That the following words be added to the motion: 'and urges the Government to initiate immediate discussions with the States. . . . How far is he out of touch with what goes on in this country? of touch. Every time the Government brings something forward a member of the Labor Party nearly always moves that all words after 'that' in the motion 'That the House take note of the paper' be omitted and that certain words be inserted in their place. It does not matter what the Government puts up, although members of the Labor Party had not thought of a proposal before, they think it should be improved. Legislation which was introduced to enable the Commonwealth to make grants for homes for the aged is a perfect example of what I am saying. No Labor government has ever thought of giving grants of a £1 for £1 or a dollar for dollar basis, or a $2 for $1 basis as it is now, for homes for the aged. But the moment the Government Non-Metropolitan REPRESE JTATIVES Unemployment Relief introduced the scheme Labor wanted the grants to be increased and increased. If ihe Labor Party had been in power it would not have thought of this scheme. I would like to show bow far the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is out of touch with his amendment. The fact of the matter is that the meeting of Commonwealth and Stale officials proposed in the Prime Ministers statement' was requested by letters to the Premiers on 1st Minister made the statement. This meeting was held in Canberra yesterday. However, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in his amendment is advocating such a meeting. 1 repeal that the meeting was held yesterday and decided to take certain action. The States are willing, I understand, to cooperate to the fullest extent in regard to using the money that has been made available to overcome, as much as possible, unemployment in rural areas. It is a strange thing that a man who is the Deputy Leader of an Opposition does not keep up to date with events and know what is happening. I put it very definitely that and the Liberal Party-perhap s I should say the coalition Government in order to include both Parties-ar e delighted with the statement. Honourable members who sit behind me and other honourable members who represent rural areas are delighted because, after all, no Country Party man in a State Parliament or the Federal Parliament represents a city or metropolitan constituency. We all represent rural constituencies. Therefore, this statement has been welcomed very warmly indeed. I hope that it will give the best possible deal to people who are unemployed in country areas. The measures outlined in the statement will help to alleviate unemployment in city areas because if we can stop country workers going to the cities there will be more jobs for those people who love to live in the cities. Many people are attracted to the cities by the bright lights. I know of many people who are attracted to cities because of the better amenities offered by them. Many a man in the country says that he has to get work for his boys and girls somewhere and that be will go to a city because of the greater opportunities offered there.

136,Mr Turnbull,"He is hopelessly outwhat we call spoon fed and the country has had to battle for itself over many many years. The Labor Party immediately finds fault with any little thing like this that is done for people in country areas. Members of the Opposition cast suspicion on such a proposal. They ask when the country areas will get the money. At the discussion held yesterday to which I have referred, and which evidently was not known to members of the Opposition and definitely was not known io the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the position was set out and clarified and generally speaking it is likely from all our reservoirs it would be equal that the scheme will be operating at a very early date. As a matter of fact, the scheme could be in operation before Christmas. It is possible that some money will be made available before then, I suggest especially through local government. It has been said that nothing will be done until the end of the financial year. What greater thing could one do to try to damn the whole scheme than to make this sort of statement? It is just ridiculous when an honourable member comes into the House and makes such statements about this great country that has depended so much in the past on its rural development and its rural products. The secondary industries buy their raw materials with money chiefly derived from the sale of primary products overseas. I refer here to our exports of wheat, wool, dried fruit and other primary products of the soil that build up our haiance of payments and our overseas reserves. This money comes back in the form of goods and raw materials without which secondary industry could not operate successfully. Therefore the Government has shown a national outlook in bringing a statement like this forward for the good of the whole community. After all. Australia is still so very, very dependent on its primary industries. I want to say something about how this money is to be spent. We should be able to spend it to a dual advantage. Firstly, I think that the money should be used to relieve unemployment. To be unemployed is one of the most distressing things that can happen to a man, especially if he has a family. Therefore, under this measure we should be able to give him some relief and some employment. But I believe it would be desirable if we could employ him in such a way that a dual advantage can be gained. For instance, men could be employed in building up tourist facilities and for local government projects. This money should be used as much as possible, where appropriate, on the pipelining of water. 1 have said often in this House that in the electorate of Mai lee, which I represent, more than 90 per cent of the water which goes from the reservoirs or the water storages to the consumers is lost through seepage and evaporation and, therefore, pipelining must come. It will come sooner or later. If water is pipelined to duplicating the reservoirs. I have said many times that the priorities that I have proposed should be accepted. The first priority is defence; because what is the good of having anything in this countrya democratic government or parliament-if it cannot be protected? The second priority which I put forward is primary industry with which is associated water conservation in many cases. These are the definitive priorities that I. have suggested, but as soon as I have done so, someone has called out: 'What about education, social services, hospitalisation and all these benefits?' It is from the products of the soil that much of the money comes from with which these things can be purchased and from which the Government can give people who are unable to fend for themselves a better deal. Therefore. I believe that the priorities I have put forward are in the best interests of this nation. The pipelining of water is a definite proposition for attention. interrupt the honourable member who is speaking.

157,Mr Turnbull,"But I have referredasked this morning, namely, that when a redistribution of Federal electorates is proposed the 20 per cent over or 20 per cent under of the quota be implemented. After all, someone said that it does not matter how big an electorate is; it is what the people do in it. Mr Speaker, you, perhaps better than anyone, would know that nothing counts much but votes. A person can advocate anything he likes but it is the vote that determines a matter. My friend the honourable member for Hunter( Mr not reflecting on the Chair. Tames) would agree with that. Mr JamesI am not a numbers man, but I agree with that. member agrees with that because it is the vote that counts. It is the vote that first of all puts a man into Parliament and afterwards, when he gets into Parliament, he soon finds out that the vote determines whether he will get something implemented. In his statement, the Prime Minister said: I may mention also that we would envisage the Christmas. I am unimpressed with the Department of Labour and National Service being closely associated with the scheme at the ground roots level. Of course, in this regard, before this statement was made, Mr Allen, who is the head of the Department of Labour and National Service, said that he envisaged that there would not be much trouble in the employment of school leavers this year. He said that the position was well in hand and he believed that there would be no disruption of employment to any extent. This whole subject calls for great co-operation. We have had the Prime Minister's statement and yesterday there was a meeting of State and Commonwealth representatives in regard to it. But, the harsh note that comes into this is that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Barnard) did not know about yesterday's meeting. member for Riverina says that I did not tell him. I am not in the habit of going around telling him things he should know. He should find out. He is the Deputy Leader of the Opposiiion. member's time has expired. to support the amendment that is before the House of Representatives. Of course, anyone listening to the honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull) would be forgiven for forgetting exactly what we are debating because he debated everything but the issue that is before the Parliament at this time. because I corrected the honourable member for Riverina in one of his errors, he is understand that the obstruseness of some members is difficult to follow. I would not in any way reflect upon the Chair at any honourable time. The amendment, of course, is designed to do one particular thing, namely, to ensure that there is some effective action before the Christmas period. This is the whole intent of this amendment. The Commonwealth Parliament has no business going into recess for 2 i months unless there is a definite assurance of action to stimulate the rural economy before dedication of the Prime Minister( Mr McMahon) to this matter because, although it is his statement we are debating, we have not seen him. Indeed, for the most of this debate there has been one sole survivor of the Liberal Party ministry in the chamber and the most junior Minister, with due respect to my distinguished friend at the table, the Minister for Supply, Mr Garland. Even he was missing from the chamber for most of the time that the honourable member for Mallee was speaking. I do not blame him for that at all. I am pointing out that very little weight is being given to this matter of getting some action in the countryside before Christmas. There have been many interjections which I am quite interested to hear from the members on my left who comprise an interesting tribal rock musical and who say in chorus that there are no problems which honourable are not being tackled and not being taken care of. I do not see it this way, and neither does the Deputy Leader of the Opposition or any other member of the Opposition. Last week in this House the Prime Minister and his team debated a motion that was designed to deal with the economy. We were assured for most of that day that there were no real problems with",55,Unemployment Relief

164,Mr Grassby,"No, Mr Speaker. Ithe economy; that there was nothing which was not being attended to or taken care of. We had question time 2 hours before the Prime Minister came into this chamber to make a statement on rural unemployment. In answer to a question at question time the Treasurer ( Mr Snedden) indicated that there were no real worries and no real indication of any action being necessary. In fact, he specifically indicated that no action would be taken. But2 hours later the Prime Minister sneaked in, unheralded and unannounced after the suspension of the sitting for lunch, and made a statement which, of course, was welcome, provided that it achieves something. But let us also be clear that all it really does is to provide some finance at some time in the futureperhaps in the new year-whic h will give jobs to one in four people who are employed in the country areas. That is all. If honourable members on my left are happy and content with that, then I wish them well when they go home for Christmas. When the statement, was made by the Prime Minister, I immediately sought an assurance that this House would not go into recess without debating the statement. I made it plain that my attitude on leaving the question of unemployment grants as unfinished business until next year was totally unacceptable to me and the colleagues with whom I sit on this side of the chamber. I might say that the only response we received was that perhaps arrangements might be made to debate the statement. So the motion, or the actual amendment, to be more precise, your guidance-.that we are discussing today is the amendment which has come forward from the Opposition. honourable member, might I put position in the right perspective? We now discussing tbe amendment and motion together. Speaker, you are exactly correct. I was referring particularly to the motion. When we come to discuss the motion and the amendment together, let us be quite clear that if it had not been for the demands of members of the Opposition this matter would not have come before the House at all before we adjourned. I want to draw attention to the realities of the situation as they exist at the present time. The Premier of New South Wales has been insistent that there should be a conference before Christmasbefore the Commonwealth : Parliament adjourns and before the State parliaments adjourn-becaus e he has said that in fact there is an urgent need for finance to relieve unemployment in New South Wales rural areas. He made that statement after the wheat crop virtually had failed. He made it as a plea, and he has not apologised for doing so. In this instance .the Premier of New South Wales had the unanimous support of the New South Wales Legislative Asembly-al l members of all Parties; the Liberal Party, the Country Party and the Australian Labor Party. So it is an indisputable fact that they are concerned but, of course, honourable members on the Government side in this Parliament do not seem to be concerned at all. The Premier of New South Wales has indicated that there is an urgent need for this sort of action. Let us just see what the Prime Minister said in his statement. He indicated that in co-operation with the State governments the Commonwealth already had provided massive assistance. Every State government in the Commonwealth has contested the Prime Minister's assessment of the situation. Every Minister in charge of rural reconstruction already has decided that the rural reconstruction scheme is in a hopeless situation and has halted. They have said that we need an urgent conference to get it going again. Do not forget that what we are referring to is rural unemployment. We are referring to a rural situation which is real. Honourable members opposite say that all that the members of the Opposition in the Federal Parliament are doing is drawing attention to difficulties. The the difficulties have already been drawn to the their attention without success at the preare sent time, by every State government and the by all the Ministers responsible for rural reconstruction, but all that honourable wrong and only we are right.' What an incredible situation. Let us refer to the Prime Minister's statement and to what prompted us to move this amendment. This is what the Prime Minister said: On the assumption that these proposals will be acceptable in principle to the Premiers we shall require to bring forward to the House early, in",56,Unemployment Relief

Meanwhile, howcourse, means that, including their famiever, temporary arrangements will be made for the financing of ths scheme in the interim. There is no undertaking as to what is to be ratio of 1 to 4 in terms of producers to the done before the end of the year, before people who serve them and support them Christmas, and of course we are dealing in country areas, the number of people with people and families who are suffering affected will approach 100,000. This is the hardship. Those are not abstractions. This number which the Prime Minister of this is not a sordid political party ploy. We are nation has decided should move out of dealing with the realities of hardship and rural areas. As a matter of fact, I put on difficulty at the present time. The majority the notice paper today a question in which of the Premiers have called for action I asked the Prime Minister whether he before Christmas.

But as far as we are position in New South Wales. The Deputy concerned, we reject the Prime Minister Leader of the Opposition has spoken of and his philosophy. the difficulties in Tasmania. In every State of the Commonweal'h we have these problate. lems, and of course they stem from the rural crisis. The interesting thing is that not only the not yet arrived. The next thing I must say Premiers and the Ministers in charge of is that we are talking of a crisis which is rural reconstruction but also some of the worse than it has been since the depression really en'husiastic long term supporters of days. the Government are concerned about this matter. Let me quote what was said by Sir Norman Giles, who is head of the Elder Smith Goldsbrough Mort complex.

The Prime Minister could not enter into the debate. He is not here. He has been missing. I do not know where he is. But certainly as this is his statement he should be here. you. Mr Clyde Cameron-He is counting his money. sure that the right honourable gentleman will have a pleasant Christmas at home with his family, though he is only temporarily employed. I think that this is a very poor expression of the concern of the national Parliament. It shows that we at this time have little regard for this problem that is a real and harsh one. It seems to me that we live in a world of unreality. Supporters of the Government deny that any of these real problems exist and say that there is no reason why we should express our concern. I would have been ashamed to go home not having expressed my concern and not having asked for some action to be initiated before Christmas and before the end of the year. We will not meet until 22nd February of next year. But the unemployment Mr Clyde shame. league says: 'A wicked shame.' That is right. The people who will be unemployed will be saying just that. We are to be left suspended for 2b months. We have had soothing tones from the Government as to what may or may not be done. But we have had no assurance Mr Clyde Cameron-Why do we not have 3 weeks holiday, the same as the workers get? would be happy to sit the whole of next week to find out exactly what is intended, what we intend to do and what the plans are. Let us discuss them again. During the last 24 months, I have listened to some unholy rubbish debated over a long period in this Parliament. It was rubbish that is irrelevant to the realities of our national situation and the situation in our electorates. I resent the fact that ray time was wasted. I resent the fact that we have not tackled the Teal problems of our community as they exist at the present time. The problem of the unemployed is not a passing one. The problem is not one that we can laugh at, joke about or pass off with little smart comments about what we may have done or we may not have done. I may say that this amendment was not introduced in a sense of carping criticism of the Government Government should be kicked out for what it has done. from Sturt is a very blunt and forthright member. This is what he has said to me personally: ' I regard this proposal as totally inadequate. I do not stand with it at all'. WhatI say to him is this: We have accepted it. He has accepted it.

While the honourable member for Mallee was speaking the honourable member for Riverina took several spurious points of order as to whether the honourable member was debating the motion or the amendment. I fail to remember any real point in the speech of the honourable member for Riverina that was on this subject at all. His speech certainly had nothing to do with the motion or the statement delivered which is what we are really debating. It would appear to me that Opposition members are acting like a lot of spoilt children who have just had their ice creams taken away from them. This subject was to be their calamity howler when they returned home at Christmas time, so that they could really spread the muck around the country areas. in and made this statement amendment? honourable member for Sturt will remain the whole system used in respect of silent.

We have all heard the term 'Calamity Jane'. I could suggest an alternative, but I will not, with respect to the way in which the honourable member for Riverina spoke this afternoon. It would appear, if we listened -to honourable members opposite, that somehow or other they initiated this action. They have had nothing to do with it. The Prime Minister presented this statement. The debate this afternoon is a result of definite Government policy. To show how ill prepared Opposition members are really to grapple with this situation, one has only to listen to the absurd statements that have been made and that have nothing to do with the ministerial statement and the motion. The amendment certainly has nothing to do with the situation. I wish now to look in detail at some of the points mentioned in the amendment moved by the Australian Labor Party, which is supposed to have some knowledge of the situation. The amendment: . . . urges the Government to initiate immediate discussions with the States so that the first grants under this programme can be made before Christmas. . . . Do not members of the Opposition read their newspapers? Cannot what they are told sink into their heads? They have been told several times that the discussions on this matter were held yesterday. Representerday to discuss this situation. I understand that the Prime Minister has written to each State Premier setting out definitely ways in which this programme can be commenced before Christmas. No need exists for any legislative machinery to lie established before this programme can commence. Anyone who reads in detail the statement which has been made by the Prime here.

203,Mr Lloyd,"The Prime Minister camethe procedures that were used during that drought relief programme to see how the present programme can be initiated and commenced immediately. For example this means that in Victoria an interdepartmental committee will co-ordinate these grants and work out which local government, which State government and which semi-government authorities can spend this money in the most useful way in the areas where it is most needed. This work can be commenced immediately. The Commonwealth has the whole scheme under way now. There is no reason why, from the Commonwealth's point of view, this programme cannot commence before Christmas. There is no need to wait for any legislation to be introduced in February. If Opposition members only bothered to read the Prime Minister's statement, the newspapers and the reports of the procedures to be followed, this amendment would have been unnecessary. In another part, the amendment urges the Government to: . . . confer with the Stales to ensure she criticism and making their point about resumption of the rural reconstruction schemerural reconstruction they were talking now hailed by lack of finance in ihe various about the farmers. Surely the whole purSlates. This part of the amendment is most approximately, is not to help the farming curious. In speaking to this amendment, people alone but to help all people in rural the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr areas, cities and towns who may have been Barnard) gave the reasons why it is alleged affected by the rural crisis because of the that not sufficient finance has been drop in purchasing power of farming provided under the rural reconstruction people.

If the Opposition had its way it Commission will alleviate the need for would cut off these grants designed to much of the debt reconstruction proassist the many people who work in gramme. Surely it is better to alleviate the country cities and towns. problems so that huge amounts of funds are not spent on debt reconstruction.

Last week of the House reprepresent all rural people. the Labor Party in criticising this Government initiative for the wool growers said that brokers. tion argues that some of the money will go to the brokers, that it will not stay in the electorates. Now, I make 2 points on this argument: What difference is there between that proposal and the Opposition's amendment which seeks more money for debt reconstruction? If a debt is to be reconstructed, somebody has to be paid off. That 'somebody' is still the same bodiesthe banks and the finance companies-that the Opposition criticised one week ago. If one is at all close to the country people and the problem of debt reconstruction one may be aware of the fact that if we can lower the level of debt payments made by a farmer, whether in respect of wool or in any other way, we will be helping him because a lesser percentage of his net income will be required to service his debts.

209,Mr Lloyd,"The honourable memberIt has also been stated that this money is not enough. If honourable members opposite read the Prime Minister's statement they will see that it is an approximate amount. It is flexible and it can be increased if necessary. If the Government listened to air the statements of the Labor Party that not enough money has been provided for certain projects, and if it were to finance what the Opposition said it would do, the biggest industry in this country would be the money printing industry because of all that would be needed to finance the Opposition's schemes. Honourable members want to look at these matters a little more objectively, decide on their priorities and how they would implement their proposals. It has also been suggested that the allocation of 75 per cent of this money to labour costs and 25 per cent for materials is wrong. This is the same arrangement that was adopted for the drought relief programmes which have proved most successful. If we are to employ people we have to employ them gainfully so that what they do is worthwhile, not only for them but also for tbe community. And, of course, we will need materials. If the States believe need a lead at Commonwealth level in the that 75 per cent of the grant is not sufficient to meet the labour costs it is open to the States to provide the materials and to allocate 100 per cent of the funds to the employment of labour. But there is another factor here. It has been stated that this grant will not cover the employment of everybody in the country who is unemployed. This is agreed but the point is that the amount is flexible and can be increased. One of the things needed in country cities and towns and business areas is a boost of confidence and this grant provides just the boost of confidence that is needed. confidence is to change the Government. have shown for 22 years that they do not share your point of view. The Opposition's amendment states that we should be looking also to provide employment assistance in metropolitan areas. This would mean that there would be less of the $2m a month for the benefit of the people in rural areas. We have 2 types of unemployment; we have metropolitan unemployment which is certainly growing much more rapidly now, but it is not of the same nature or -proportion as it is in rural areas where there is large long-term hard-core unemployment brought about by the structural changes in the rural community which have been, caused by the crisis in rural industries. In New South Wales the October unemployment figures show that 43 per cent of those registered as unemployed were in metropolitan areas and 56 per cent were in country areas. There is an even more startling figure in Queensland where 35 per cent of unemployed are in metropolitan areas and 64 per cent in nonmetropolitan areas. I think honourable members would find that the number of job vacancies is 3 times as high in the metropolitan areas as it is in the non-metropolitan areas. This grant of $2m a month will, give a much needed shot in the arm to employment and confidence in country cities and towns. It is a step in the right direction which has been initiated by the Government, and the Opposition has had nothing to do with it at all. It will do many good things. I would like to make a' few points in conclusion. If we are to' continue to spur employment in non-metropolitan areas we provision of more long-term and definite proposals to assist decentralisation, regional development or whatever we like to call it. The last thing we want is another committee. We have had committees dealing with these matters for 7 years and we have all the knowledge we need on the question of what is required to spur, with incentives, manufacturing and other industry in country towns. I urge the Government to continue with this good work that it has started so that we will have very soon a policy from the Government that will provide real incentives, real initiatives and real long term proposals to assist regional development. This would be to the benefit of both those who live in urban Australia and those who live in non-urban Australia about whom we are now,talking: Dr GUN (Kingston) (3.31)I enter this debate to discuss the last sentence in the Opposition's amendment. It reads: The House regrets that the Government has not made provision to extend unemployment assistance to alleviate problems of growing unemployment in metropolitan areas with particular emphasis on the problems and placement of school leavers which can be accentuated as a result of poor employment conditions in the country areas.",61,Unemployment Relief
210,Mr Martin,The only way to boost,62,Unemployment Relief
211,Mr Lloyd,"The people of Australia1 am particularly concerned that the present measure, which admittedly is better than many of its type,, is based on an inaccurate diagnosis. The treatment is wrong, it is inadequate and the funds will be inappropriately applied. I would like to see a comprehensive programme extending over the whole economy because the problem in cities is a very great one, not just in might be the logical thing to do because at terms of straight-out unemployment but in terms of under-employment. This is a particular problem in my electorate and in many electorates within the Adelaide metropolitan area where tradesmen in the motor vehicle industry and subsidiary industries have been retrenched. Many of them have got jobs back but they are now on the production line, which means a considerable reduction in their earnings. A great deal needs to be done in the metropolitan areas as well as in the rural areas. One instance which supports this view was brought to my attention only fairly recently. I have heard it mentioned by a fairly reliable source in South Australia that next year the engagement of apprentices will be down by about 33£ per cent on the usual intake. This will be due to the stagnation in economy which is the result, of course, of the economic policies of this Government. The Government has made a completely erroneous diagnosis of the causes of the present trouble with the economy. It believed that after the 6 per cent wage increase which was granted last year there would be an increase in demand from which we might get a demand inflation superimposed on a cost-push inflation. It was this potential or latent excessive demand which had to be controlled and the measures to do so were contained in this year's Budget. However, its assessment of the likely situation was completely wrong. The Government is now trying to say that the increase in savings and the fall in demand will be followed by an increase in demand and that this will happen spontaneously. I do not think this is so. I do not think the fall in demand is an accident. It was brought about by inflationary psychology. Business thinks it has to increase prices and the employers to say that wage because it does not know how it will cover increases will affect the exporter, the farmer, costs. So what do business people do? the pensioner and so on and so forth. They do not engage people and this particThe Government is playing the farmer and ularly affects, as I say, apprentices. This is creating a very serious situation. At the same time consumers are frightened about their future employment prospects and so they tend not to spend and everybody tightens up. The Treasurer ( Mr Snedden) thinks everybody is going to overspend because of cost inflation. Perhaps that a time of inflation the value of goods increases relative to the value of money, but the instinctive behaviour of people is not always in their own long term interests. What people are doing at an instinctive reaction is not to spend. As a result we have this stagnation in the economy. It is this psychology that is producing this great increase in savings, and for that reason I believe that the reduction in demand is no accident. I believe that the Government's assessment of the economy was completely incorrect. We might ask what needs to he done in the present context, and 1 certainly would agree with those people who say we need the introduction of a supplementary Budget. But at the same time. I think we must remember that this does not necessarily mean that we are going to restore full confidence in the economy. We have to remember that economics is not a precise mathematical science. It is really nothing more than an empirical study of past human group behaviour. I do not think we can predict exactly what is going to happen. But my feeling is that this reduction in confidence and in consumer demand might continue even if the economy is given a stimulus by the Government. I think the same thing has happened in the United Kingdom where the government is not applying particularly tight monetary or fiscal policies at the moment. In spite of that people are tightening up and nobody is spending. People are banging on to their money and there is a rise in savings. I think we have to get right to the root of the problem and that is to control prices. I do not know why the Government backs away from this. The Government cannot get at the problem unless it controls prices. If prices are not controlled this allows the Government the pensioner off against the wage earner. But if we have a context of fixed prices I believe that this playing off will not occur. What the wage earner is really seeking is to improve his lot against that of the employer-the profit earner. As far as 1 and the Labor Party are concerned, that is a highly desirable thing. We will not control the trouble with the economy, nor will we control unemployment until we get down and control prices because it is this inflationary psychology which is resulting not only in great inflation but also ultimately will increase unemployment. I have men'ioned the problem of apprenticeships. I think that perhaps as an emergency measure we might have to do something to assist the intake of apprentices in the forthcoming year, because if the economy does improve for some reason in the near : future we might find that apprentices will still not be taken in. The reason for this is that there have been retrenchments of tradesmen in the vehicle building industry in South Australia, and if the industry in tip it will be those tradesmen who are taken on first because the apprentices are not immediately productive in the first couple of years of their indentures. SoI would think that the chances are that if many of these boys are not taken on as apprentices in the next couple of months they will lose their opportunity of having a skilled occupation throughout their adult life. I think some emergency programme should be started to help the intake of apprentices. But we must look at the whole cause of the trouble and set about controlling prices because this is what really matters. One other example of this psychology is to look at what people feel about the current wave of school leavers and how they are going to find jobs. About a month ago I visited a technical high school in my electorate. The headmaster said to me: 'How am I going to advise parents who are asking whether they should take their children away from school now?' He also said that everybody is so frightened about whether their sons or daughters are going to find employment in December and January that many of them are foregoing the final important part of their secondary education and leaving school in mid-term so that they can get in on the ground floor of the job market before the new year starts. I think this is a very sad state of affairs, but it is a pretty accurate account of how people feel about the state of the economy. The main point I want to make is that it is just not sufficient-althoug h 1 acknowledge that relatively speaking the problem of unemployment in rural areas is very great, it is still very great in the cities-to say that it is not just a matter of unemployment. There is also under employment, with people not working in the skills for which they have been trained. But these are the things that need to be done: Apart .from the control of commodities and the control of prices, interest rates must be looked at quickly by the Government. I believe that in the present context high interest rates are not deflationary at allthat is if the Government is trying to bring about deflationary policies. I am not sure what the Government' is doing at the moment because all that is happening is that high interest rates are being passed on as another cost, and this helps build up the inflationary psychology. . The final thing that really must be done1 might perhaps even have put this first-is to increase social service benefits, particularly unemployment benefits which are disgracefully low at the present time. I have said that consumer spending is low and this is one of the. things that has caused the Government worry. Surely these are the people who will increase their expenditure if we increase unemployment benefits because it is obligatory for them to spend the increased money that is made available. Many of them are living below the poverty line at the moment and if we give them extra money it will not only help them but also will give a fillip to the economy. I know that there are other honourable members who want to enter this debate so I will conclude by saying that I think some emergency assistance needs to be given to the State governments by the Department of Labour and National Service to assist with this great flow of school leavers who will enter the work force in the next couple of months. But most fundamentally we have to control the whole source of the trouble which is inflation. A Labor government will not shrink from the implementation of a system of Commonwealth price control, which is something that the Government has backed away from. We will give it the in this House last Thursday by the Prime highest possible priority. Mr O'KEEFE (Paterson) (3.43)I rise terms, the Government envisages an to support the measure introduced by the arrangement providing for grants for Government and I oppose most bitterly the employment-creating activities to be made amendment which has been moved by the to the States for the period up to 30th Opposition.

Unemployment figures have been $2m a month, spread right throughout mentioned by the various speakers who Australia. I have been very disappointed have taken part in this debate. I have here with the honourable member for Riverina the various unemployment figures for New( Mr Grassby) because of the calamitous South Wales.

212,Minister ( Mr Mcmahon) On This Very,"force-is the lowest of any country in the world. In the United Kingdom 3.4 per cent of the work force is unemployed, and over 6 per cent of the work force in the United States of America. These figures indicate that despite problems that we have in this country our economy is sound. Our economy is viable. Statements made by any member of the House along the lines of those made by the honourable member for Riverina are most damaging to everybody concerned. The rural reconstruction scheme has important aspects of this legislation is that been mentioned. It has, in the main, been this money will be channelled out in the most successful. The Commonwealth States through the various local governing Government has made money available to authorities. This will ensure that the money the States to assist farmers who are viable is spent wisely, that it is spent on projects and who with financial assistance can get which are worthy ones and not of a out of any troubles that they may be in. temporary nature and that it will bring But when we analyse the rural reconstrucgreat benefit to those local governing areas tion scheme we find that most of the as well as providing employment for the States prior to receiving this grant from people who have been affected by the rural the Commonwealth Government did not recession in that particular sector. have the machinery to implement the rural reconstruction scheme throughout their primary producer areas.

At the same time the money this finance out to the farmers who have will enable them to carry out work which been affected. New South Wales was one will be of everlasting benefit to the of the States that had a rural reconstruction municipalities and the shire areas wherever department set up. I believe that it has those funds are expended on worthwhile been able to get its money out more projects. SoI have very much pleasure quickly than any of the other States. Many indeed in supporting the measure brought statements have been made to the effect down by the Government. For the reasons that the States have run out of money. The which I have very clearly set out, I am Federal Government has made it quite clear certainly disappointed with the amendment in its rural reconstruction legislation that moved by the Opposition. when any of the States have allocated the funds which were made available to them and have made application to the Federal Government, further consideration will be for Paterson( Mr O'Keefe), leaves the given to the allocation of additional funds. chamber let me remind him that there sits I have heard that New South Wales and a man who served in the New South Wales some other States have allocated all their State Parliament under Premier Askin for money and are short of funds.

There certainly are some unemployed. I feel quite sure that, when the necessity arrives for tbe Government to give assistance in this field, it will do so. But I have no hesitation whatsoever in saying that the greatest problems have been in the wool and wheat growing areas. That is why this Government has given those areas assistance along the lines of the measure that we are debating here today. One of the most I know that local government throughout previous speaker, the honourable member is nothing more than a liar.

214,Mr Foster (Sturt) (3.53),"Before thedays a colliery has closed down in his very electorate. Let me also remind the honourable gentleman Mr O'KeefeMr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. No colliery has been closed down in my electorate in the past few days. The information is definitely wrong. whether it is weeks or days? In addition to that let me also say that in the electorate and correctly so-the unemployment figure of the honourable member for Hunter( Mr for the metropolitan area of Adelaide. HowJames), because of the closure of collieries and reduced production by the Broken Hill Pty Company Ltd there is a rising rate of unemployment in the coal fields areas. But the honourable member cannot obtain the figures of unemployment in his own electorate, at the direction, as I understand it, of the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Lynch) who is not even in the chamber at the moment. Let me deal with the amendment that has been moved by the Opposition in this regard. Let us get away from the divisions and the discriminations of this Government in a measure such as this. One would have thought that if the Government had a skerrick of sincerity in its body or a sincere thought in its mind the Prime Minister would not, as he did a couple of days ago, have hastened into the chamber in the midst of a debate, interrupted the debate and made a statement, which I hold aloft here, of a page and a half about what the Government intends to do about the very serious unemployment problem within the rural sector. The Prime Minister, having just returned from overseas, could do no better on a television programme than sit and say that he knew where he was going. He even had to borrow that phrase. Whilst he was overseas he learnt from the 'Economist' newspaper in Great Britain that that was the theme that the Prime Minister of Great Britain had used in a talk to a Conservative Party rally. If honourable members do not believe me let them go into the Library and look up one of the September editions of the 'Economist'. They will see 'This is where we are going'. Is this the type of thing we expect from the Government in the national Parliament of this country, facing the problem of an unemployment figure that can reach in excess of 150,000 in the next 3 or 4 months? The Prime Minister comes into the chamber with a scrap of paper. Has he not sufficient parliamentary draftsmen to draft a Bill so that the Opposition can see what is provided, where the money is. going and what the money is to do? The Government should be condemned forever. The honourable member for Angas( Mr Giles), who spoke initially in this debate on behalf of the Government, pointed outever 1 think the figure he gave of about 70 per cent of the total unemployment in South Australia being in Adelaide was somewhat conservative. conservative because the official figures are more than conservative. What can be expected of a Government. that has been in office for 22 years which has created this monster and which has erected the tombstones of unemployment throughout tbe length and breadth of this country? What can one expect of it when it comes in with a measure .without any degree of seriousness about it but on which it must staud condemned because the problem it seeks to solve is of its own creation? The Government now has to tell the world how ineffective it has been. The few honourable members opposite who are in the chamber ought to be reminded of the statement on full employment that was made by Robert Gordon Menzies back in 1949 when he conned everybody. I have a copy of it here if they want to read it. How can we expect anything from a Government that has been so long in office? The Country Party, which receives only 8 per cent of the votes across the nation, has in this Parliament a number of seats quite out of balance with the number of people who support it. This comes about because of the weighted advantage that the Country Party has in country electorates. What does the honourable member for Patterson expect $2m to do? What does he expect men such as the man who walks into the chamber now, the Prime Minister, to do?

The honourable member will speak through the Chair. challenge the Prime Minister not to scurry into a long recess, as has been the custom of the Parliament and as he did at the end of the autumn session, and leave the problems that he is leaving to the nation today. What plan does the Prime Minister have to arrest' unemployment, outside of a piece of paper such as his statement? What plan has the Prime Minister for the rural reconstruction employment training scheme introduced into this House by the Minister for Labour and National Service on 10th September this year but which was withdrawn because he refused to circulate details shortly after he presented it. There the matter has rested. Not one word has been said about this document that was presented to this House on 10th September. The Prime Minister does not want to discuss it. What he and his Party wan; to do is to wait for somebody to come along with an industrial situation on which they think they can divide the nation. The Government should be cursed for it, if I may use that term. I have just been handed some advice which 1 am prepared to accept. For the benefit of the honourable member for Paterson. I mention the 2 collieries that have been closed. I understand that the him stand in this House now and seek the protection to which he is entitled and say that I was right and that he was wrong. Is it not a factI direct my remarks through you. Mr Deputy Speaker, to the honourable member for Paterson-that the collieries have in fact closed? I repeat the allegation that I made before. The honourable member called his own Premier a liar. The Premier of South Australia is more than concerned. Did he not make some representations to the national Parliament suggesting ways to get the country back on an economic footing? Have his proposals not been ignored? The honourable member for Angas the other week used the procedures of this House for a cheap political trick in seeking to have the wine excise removed? He ought to be condemned for that for ever and a day. great respect might I remind the honourable member through you that we are debating a statement. It is not an overall debate on the state of the economy or the state of the electorate of Sturt. honourable member for Sturt will proceed. the Government and the Cabinet continue to sit in this place and draw up a plan of progress, a plan for the future and a plan to return the people to industry. Let the Prime Minister knock off the high interest rates that he has imposed in both this Budget and the Budget of last year. Let him no longer come into this House as he does-with catch phrases from time to time. What plan has any one of the 3 Ministers I understand none of them has been sacked recently-wh o are sitting in this House at the moment? ment? the amendment.

Does the honourable member for Angas realise that the figure he gave for the high percentage of unemployed for the metropolitan area of Adelaide is brought about by the fact that people have flocked to the metropolitan area because their positions in the country have become redundant? So the honourable member has denied his own people that the Government has sacked. The people who have moved into the metropolitan area are being denied their right. What else do we say in our amendment? The amendment urges the Government to initiate immediate discussion. Why not? this to you: I as a member of this national Parliament have heard no statement made, even by the Minister for Customs and Excise( Mr Chipp), who is sitting at the table newspaper. Mr Deputy Speaker, let me say this to honourable members opposite whom you have not called into line for interjecting: There has been no announcement in this House of any meeting yesterday with anyone from any level in the States dealing with the matter contained in the statement that is now before the House. I am told that we can read about these things in the 'Daily Mirror'. I can read in the daily papers also some things that have been said about the Prime Minister. IfI wanted to do so I could pick out one from amongst all the gear I have here. Here is one which says: 'You'll be all right'. The 'Australian' sets out what ought to be done as far as the leadership of the nation is concerned. A Melbourne newspaper talks about Billy McMahon having big ears, short arms and big pockets. But I do not want to do this. Mr TurnbullI take a point of order. I object to the Prime Minister being called 'Billy McMahon'. The honourable member should say 'the right honourable the Prime Minister'. It shows how much he has to learn about politics. -Order! Tbe point of order is upheld. I ask the honourable member for Sturt to refer to the Prime Minister as the right honourable the Prime Minister. Press reports. I was not being disrespectful to the right honourable gentleman. Let me also say, regarding the position with reports in this House, that it is just a non-event. There is not one member of this House who can stand up and say in fact, in truth and in logic that we have had presented to this Parliament a report stating that following the Prime Minister's statement to the House a meeting was held to put into effect the proposal now before the House. Mr TurnbullI told you about it. The honourable member for Mallee has told us about it. The Deputy Government Whip says he read it in the 'Murray Rag', so it must be right. That is not good enough for me and 1 am quite certain that I speak for members of the Opposition. Mr TurnbullI rise to a point of order. I did not say that I read it in the 'Murray Rag'. There is no such newspaper. 1 object to the remark. that I have not really any proof that the honourable member can read at all, but I have seen him look at a piece of paper when he has been reading speeches in this place. So let us not be hoodwinked. We have seen reports in newspapers, have we not, that this Government said before the last Senate election that it was going to build a string of child minding centres across the metropolitan areas of the Commonwealth. We read this in the newspapers. We did not believe it. It has never come to fruition. So what is wrong in applying that argument on this occasion? The Government has a responsibility to remove the tombstones of unemployment in this country. I do not think there is anything that hurts a person more than to be told, not directly on some occasions by his employer but byfindingin his pay envelope a slip that tells him his services are no longer required.

Another matter I want to refer to is a point made by the honourable member for Kingston (Dr Gun) who said that the Government has given no thought to unemployment relief for those who are unemployed as a result of Government inaction in this field. The Government ought to consider that it does a disservice to the nation. 1 believe and 1 am quite certain that there are older members on the other side who believe that the Government should recognise that it has run its race, it has run its time and it ought to vacate office in the interests of the people of this country generally.

The amount of the additional grants will be S20m of which part will be paid in the remainder of this financial year and part in 1972-73. They will be",70,Pairs
238,Mr Mcmahon (Lowe,"Prime Minister)distributed between the States in proportion to the capital grants presently being received by them, which in turn are distributed in the same way as the States' Loan Council borrowing programmes for works and housing. The additional grants will be amalgamated into the basic capital grants for the purpose of determining the proportion of the works and housing programme that the grants will represent in future years. the prospect of having to cease operations. The amount that each State will receive on the basis indicated is as follows: New South Wales, $6.36m; Victoria, $5.10m; QueensHand, $2.53m: South Australia, S2.74m; Western Australia, $1.87m; and Tasmania, $ 1.40ma total of $20m. 1 have written to the Premiers inviting them to agree to accept these grants on the basis I have outlined. Since 1969 running costs of government schools have risen by at least 30 per cent to 40 per cent and even more in some cases and it is now costing over $300 a year to educate a child in a government primary school and over $500 a year to educate a child in a government secondary school. The general financial assistance grants from the Commonwealth represent about one half of the State's current Budget expenditure and on this basis it can be said that the Commonwealth is supporting approximately one half of the increased expenditure by the States on primary and secondary schools. The independent schools have received additional assistance from the States, but they are facing increasing difficulties in thenefforts to provide adequate facilities for a reasonable proportion of the school-going population. Many of the independent schools have been paying their teachers salaries at rates significantly lower than those paid in government schools. However, there is now a number of awards which require these salaries to be increased to full parity with the operative rates in government schools over a short period. This development has resulted in relatively greater increases in costs in the independent schools than in the government schools. The independent schools have limited capacity to charge higher fees and collect other income, and for boarding schools there are additional difficulties arising from the down$50 in forms 5 and 6. The increased grants turn in rural activity. The combination of these factors has resulted in a continued drift in enrolments to government schools. The need for immediate additional assistance to independent schools is emphasised by the following current developments. The Roman Catholic authorities in Melbourne are considering seriously a proposal not to expand secondary schools but to concentrate resources in primary schools. In Tasmania a number of Roman Catholic and other independent schools are faced with The Government hopes that a contraction would not be necessary in either area. As a further measure of assistance to the independent schools, the Government has decided to increase the rates of the annual per capita grants to both primary and secondary independent schools throughout Australia. These grants were first made available from the beginning of 1970 at annual rates of $35 per head in primary schools and $50 per head in secondary schools. These rates will be increased to $50 per head in primary schools and $68 per head in secondary schools from the beginning of 1972. These additional per capita grants to independent schools in the States are expected to cost $9.7m in 1972 of which half, that is $4,850,000 will be payable during the financial year 1971-72. The amount in each State will be approximately: New South Wales, $3.58m; Victoria, $3.14m; Queensland, $ 1.46m; South Australia, $600,000; Western Austraiia, $700,000; and Tasmania, $220,000a total of $9.7m. Independent schools in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory share in the per capita grants which the Commonwealth makes available to independent schools in the States. They also receive a local component in their per capita grants broadly equivalent to those paid by the State governments to independent schools in the States. In addition to the increases I have already mentioned, the local component in the annual per capita grants to independent schools in the 2 Territories will be increased from the beginning of 1972. The increases will be from $20 to $35 per head in primary schools and in secondary schools from $30 to $45 in forms 1 and 2; from $40 to $45 in forms 3 and 4, and from $45 to to independent schools in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory are expected to cost $347,000 in 1972 of which $173,000 will be payable during the financial year 1971-72. The Government will introduce appropriate legislation covering these measures during the autumn session of the Parliament next year. My Government will continue to cooperate with the States in measures both direct and indirect to expand and improve education services in government schools. Our policy for the independent schools is that, relying on their own efforts and with assistance from governments, they should be able to continue to provide places at a reasonable standard for that proportion of the school population which in the past has Sought education in non-government schools. The action we are now taking is a further. indication of our determination to assist those directly concerned to improve the standards in all types of schools. I present the following paper: Additional Assistance for government and independent schools-ministeria l statement, get approximately $4.37mI think that 9th December 1971. Motion (by Mr Swartz) proposed: That the House take note of the paper. The Opposition welcomes an increase of expenditure on education of $29.7m. We are, unfortunately, not in a position to assess exactly how this will meet the needs in certain key States because the Nationwide Survey of Educational Needs of May 1970 has not yet been conveyed to us in the sense that the 2 biggest States, New South Wales and Victoria, have not tabled their findings. So, we do not know what these additional grants mean in terms of adequacy in relation to the needs of New South Wales and Victoria. The second thing that the Opposition would like to say about this is that it hopes that the States have been sufficiently consulted to be in a position readily to use this money. If honourable members look at the ture. I do not believe that there is any history of science laboratories, of library economist who seriously regards expendigrants and of the finance for teachers ture in this direction where there are such colleges, it will be seen that the Commonneeds as being inflationary in its effect. wealth's action in these respects was quite Expenditure on schools and hospitals is precipitate. It was highly beneficial to those not inflationary expenditure. The Governwho actually had a plan to build science ment already is putting money into areas laboratories or actually had a plan to build where there is a great need, and it is not libraries but there were many who, not getting a luxury surplus to chase scarse knowing that this was going to be availgoods or scarse materials. This action able, had no plan and did not receive the which the Government has taken in probenefit and States, not knowing that the viding $29.7m is really a token addition. grant for teachers colleges was to be available, had no plan and were unable to spend money. The expenditure of these sorts of sums of money requires a degree of preparation. I presume however that if this is just a straight out grant, the State authorities and the private authorities will be able to adjust their systems to use the money to the optimum. However, I want to say something about this system of making per capita grants to private schools. Surely it is not beyond the wit of man to devise in each State a Catholic education authority and an education authority for the other independent schools, to make a grant to them which may be calculated on a per capita basis and for them to be given tbe right to spend the money according to need. The Government may lay down guidelines of need, but a Catholic education authority in Western Australia, shall we say, would is what the grant will be-and that Catholic education authority could spend the $4.37m according to need. It would be a better system than the system of making grants tied to specific schools which may not have a need. The second weakness in the grants system is that it is geared to schools in being, whereas the great problem for independent or church schools, and especially those of the Catholic Church where it tries to provide schools in parishes regardless of their wealth or poverty, is that there is constant development in new areas but a school has to be in being before it can attract a grant. There must be some means of assisting these church authorities to bring a school into being, for which this present system does not. adequately allow. We should remember that expenditure on education is economically valid expendi-",71,Additional Assistance For Government And Independent Schools

246,Ture Of Over $7m Would Result In The Prime Minister ( Mr Mcmahon) Made A,"This conclusion is borne out by the papers subsequently tabled on 10th which it would have been useful to know November in this House which make it earlier. But at least their contents are now quite clear that the Minister had been preknown, and I submit to the House that sented with 2 costings by Mr Coleman of they clearly show that the capital cost of the Interim Council-on e for 60 acres and establishing the school is, as I said, not one for 8 acres-as early, as 1 understand $7.6m but $3.8m and that the number of the papers, as June this year. The papers graduates for whom places can be found is also made it clear beyond doubt that only not 12 or 15 but something at least 8 acres would be required for the film and between 40 and 50 a year. If that has been television school alone. That appears in the established-and I submit that the papers second lot of papers laid on the table of before us do establish that-a t least the this House. The Council still urged that the best course was to purchase land for a number ments might turn out to be. of schools but that only 8 acres was required for the film and television school this school as being most important.

If that was all that was required for part of a 3-pronged programme to improve that school and that school were to go the capacity of the Australian film and ahead, the cost of that area, 1 suggest, is television industry to produce films of high all that should have been charged to that standard or a standard at least equal to the school.

They had then presume, the distributors of films, to be recently come to the Minister's posforced to include in their programmes a session, as I understand it, and their exislarger quota of Australian made drama tence, and I believe their contents, were and for the distributors to be forced to known to the Prime Minister. They give us additional information Parliament has proper facts on which to base its judgments, whatever those judg1 consider the eventual establishment of ment Corporation to finance Australian productions of merit and in the establishby the Corporation would incorporate the the Government. I am disturbed at developments which Crawford and Mr Mauger of Consolidated provide proper outlets for Australian made drama and perhaps, though this is not clear, for subventions to be made to established television producers. It is suggested that this is more important than the setting up of a school. I do not quarrel with those propositions per se. I do not say that actions of this kind are wrong. They will, if implemented, or they should, if implemented, provide more opportunity and more employment for Australians engaged in the television industry and in the film making industry, whether as actors or as producers or as writers or as technicians. But whether or not this is done there will still be an overriding need for us to train to and above world standard our own Australians. If the proposal for tariffs and quotas and for making distributors do something results in an Australian television industry which calls for more actors, gives more opportunity for producers, directors and writers, surely that in itself means that there is a greater need for graduates of excellence of the kind of school we are discussing. If we do not set out to provide this standard of skill and excellence then taking merely the steps proposed on tariffs and quotas could well condemn Australians either to paying much more to see a film or to watch a television programme or to watching second rate productions. And unless we do this we will not get that world wide distribution which we can only expect to get if we turn out first rate productions. When we do have first rate productions we can justifiably require that distributors use them both in Australia and overseas. We can say to overseas distributors: 'If you will not show our productions we will use tariffs and other weapons to stop your productions from coming into our country'. But this can only be properly done if our productions are of a standard equal to or better than those produced abroad. If we do this we will be in a position of strength. (Extension of time granted). I thank the House; I will not trespass upon its patience. If we did this we would be in a position of strength but we will only attain this position of strength by attaining excellence and we are most likely to attain excellence from the establishment of a proper school. 'Make it Australia' is a slogan with which I agree. Make it Australia, yes, but only if it is also made excellent, because it is in that way alone that Australia will be able properly to get into overseas markets and properly to disseminate throughout the world, as films so perfectly do, a picture of Australian life at the same time as we build up what is a necessary Australian industry. The right honourable member for Higgins( Mr Gorton) has touched upon the relevant statistics with regard to the cost of the school and the number of graduates that would ultimately emerge when the school is established. Time, and indeed patience, might well be taxed if I repeated them. I find myself in some difficulty in speaking in this debate and in a state of perplexity and doubt as to the person to whom one should direct one's remarks. Is it to the Minister for the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts( Mr Howson)? Is it to the council of Ministers headed by the Treasurer ( Mr Snedden)? Is it to the Attorney-General (Senator Greenwood), that sensitive gentleman who resides in another place? Is it to the Minister for Social Services( Mr Wentworth), a radical and sensitive man so close to the contemporary trends in our society? This is no easy assignment. This debate has all the ingredients of a second rate film because the question at the moment is: Who really is responsible for this complex and fragmented portfolio? On 24th November the The simple fact is that, because this matter was so sensitive, I thought it was desirable to appoint a group of Ministers to handle it and to receive letters and correspondence direct . . . A very arduous taskso that they would be able to prepare a speech for me and advise me as to the action that should be taken. They did this. Consequently, I divorced myself from the details as completely as 1 could. 1 wanted to rely upon the ministerial commit'.ee which, I think AndI repeat for honourable members, ' I think'is under the chairmanship of my colleague, the Treasurer, and also has the Attorney-General on it. That was the Prime Minister's statement on 24th November. What an extraordinarily simplistic statement it was. This prodigious revelation was made by the right honourable gentleman, but what does itVtean? What is the significance of it? It means that the Minister has been eclipsed. The Minister, appointed only a few months",75,National Film And Television Training School
247,Mr Sherry (Franklin),by leave,77,National Film And Television Training School
248,Prime Minister ( Mr Mcmahon) Said:,"before, was deposed from his own environment by a group of Ministers. This was surely a massive humiliation and 1 extend my sympathy to the Minister for the invidious position in which he now finds himself. A Minisler with a portfolio, but a Minister without authority; a Minister without direction, humiliated and humbled by his own Prime Minister. This is a ministry dismantled by a Prime Minister who has the creative vision of a computer. This, then, is the current situation, a situation almost without precedent, in which we find a' council of Ministers supervising the Minister for the Arts in his first turbulent and confusing months of stewardship. Since 8th September when the Minister made a statement in the House-indeed , one of the few that he has made on this matter-the whole issue has been clouded in secrecy. In that statement the Minister outlined his reasons for the Government's deferment of the film and television project. It was because of the costs involved, that is, $7}m over the next 5 years. Even if one accepts this figure, it would cost 11c or 12c per head of population per annum. This is the nub of the argument: Whether this school is worthwhile, whether it will be established on 60 acres or 8 acres, whether the consultants were right in their recommendation, and whether the Interim Council for a national film and television training school was satisfied with those' recommendations. This is nothing but humbug. One cannot blame the consultants and one should not blame the Interim Council; certainly they have been constricted and inhibited to a very great degree by the shifts and indecisions by the Prime Minister who suddenly emerged on taking office earlier this year as the economic overlord of the arts in this country. One must confess to having some doubts as to the Minister's grasp of the situation which has been outlined precisely and most accurately by the right honourable member for Higgins. On 10th September in answer to a question from the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) about the possibility of losing the services of the eminent Professor Toeplitz, the Minister said, and it is recorded at page 1112 of Hansard: I think that there is a fair chance we may not this year, during the discussion with get the professor to whom the honourable gentlevarious members of the Film Training man referred because he is probably going to London. In fact, he was in residence at the La Trobe University in Victoria, the Minister's own Siate that. to be generous in these matters. The professor was employed at the Latrobe University. On another occasion, in answer to a question I asked, the Minister said he did not know of the opposition of the Federation of Commercial Television Stations to the project. On yet another occasion he did not know the number of graduates which the school would produce. It must be admitted that the Minister was appointed to this portfolio only on 31st May, but even in a moment of excessive charity it could not be said that he has displayed an intimate knowledge or a comprehensive grasp of this portfolio. In response to my ques'ion on 28th October a letter from Mr Peter Coleman to the Minister was at last tabled. It was not tabled on 26th October when the Prime Minister made his s'atement in this House. The letter clearly indicates the Council's unhappiness-indeed , its very justifiable suspicion. To use a colloquialism, it was getting the run around. This then is the brief narrative of the Minister's involvement in 'his needlessly protracted dialogue. What does one hope to achieve? What do we anticipate will be the benefits that will flow from the establishment of the school? The right honourable member for Higgins has already touched briefly on this essen'ial point.

McMahon) set up a special committee of Cabinet and, assisted by the Minister for the Enrivonment, Aborigines and the Arts( Mr Howson), it investigated a number of matters relating to this subject. It is felt that perhaps the best way to deal with the situation today is to provide a statement to the House of a survey which had been provided to the committee of Ministers giving the historical background of tbe Interim Council for the national film and television training school and related matters. I hope this will be accepted as a factual interpretation of the information that is available and that has been provided to the commi'tee of Ministers. The Australian Council for tbe Arts appointed a Film Committee in November 1968 to examine the future of the film industry. It made 4 recommendations: Firstly, that a policy of protection for the film industry was essential, and recommended that the Tariff Board look into the matter fully; secondly, the establishment of a national film and television training school; thirdly, the establishment of an Australian film and television corporation; and fourthly, the establishment of an experimental film and television fund. This report went to the then Prime Minister in May 1969. In a Press statement in August of that year, the then Prime Minister announced that the Government had adopted the second, third and fourth recommendations. According to this earlier report, the proposal for a film school arose from a national conference organised by the United Nations Education, Science and Cultural Organisation. The only estimate of costs that was available at that time was a report to the British Government suggesting that the cost of technical facilities, excluding buildings, would be of the order of $400,000 and the annual running cost would be $200,000. It was oh the basis of this report that the Prime Minister established the Interim Council for the film school. The final paragraph of the report at that time read: The first function of the Interim Council will be to confer with appropriate representatives of the educational and film fields and. to recommend to the Government an appropriate location for matters necessary to bring the School up to uhe Those honourable members who have read the first report of the Interim Council will see that the Council took this paragraph as its first term of reference. The second term of reference was taken from the previous Prime Minister's statement in his speech at the presentation of the Australian Film Institute Awards on 2nd DecemberJ 969. In the course of this speech the then Prime Minister raised the question as to whether the national film and television training school should be part of a university or whether it should be associated with other institutions. He said: Should it, as another alternative, anxl perhaps the best of the lot, should it be a part of same entirely new-no t college of education, not university-som e entirely new centre where not only the national film and television school sets up for its purposes, but where the National Institute of Dramatic Art might perhaps set up for its purposes instead of in the University of New South Wales, where possibly the School of Opera or Ballet might also set up for its purposes, and where all these art forms which have so much in common could perhaps cross-fertilise each other . . . There is no doubt of the importance these proposals had for the Interim Council. For, in its covering letter of 5th November 1970 forwarding the first report of the Interim Council, the Chairman said: You will see that the Interim Council has accepted the suggestion you made in your speech",78,National Film And Television Training School
251,Mr Swartz (Darling Downs,"Minister the School. Tbe Council will then consider theat the presentation of the Australian Film Institute Awards last year, that the Film and Television School be part of a larger Centre embracing A number of Schools of associated studies. The Interim Council has forwarded 2 reports to the Government-the first in November 1970 and the second in March, 1971. The first report recommends, inter alia: (b) That the School be established as a College of Advanced Education with its own Governing Council. . . (c) That the Film and Television School be regarded as the first major School of a Centre to be established in a group of associated studies. From this it will be seen that the national film and television school should have the status of a college of advanced education. In paragraph 12.3, the report goes on to say: 'Past experience in establishing other Colleges of Advanced Education indicates that some 60 acres may well be required.' Taken in conjunction, these 2 statements would seem to indicate that 60 acres was a requirement for a national film and television training school. However, it is necessary also to take into consideration paragraph 11.4, which says: The Interim Council realises that it is not a viable proposition to set up the National Film and Television School on its own, with a student body of only limited numbers. In economic terms, this would be unsound . . . And again, in paragraph 11.5 it says: Therefore, the idea suggested by the Prime Minister of a larger Centre, in which the indepencarefully. However, in spile of these disdent Film and Television School would share the common facilities and services with other similarly cussions, the Chairman of the Council wrote oriented Schools, is supported by the Interim Council. These were the major recommendations in the 2 reports of the Interim Council, the second of which was received by the Government on 25th March 1971. It will be noticed that there is no reference to the estimate of the cost of these proposals in either of the two Reports. The first time that the costs of these proposals were examined was on 22nd June, wnen the Minister for the Environment met the Chairman of the Interim Council in Sydney. For this meeting, the Chairman had asked the executive officer to prepare some draft estimates of costs. This was the first time, apparently, on which the Council had made any attempt to look at the financial implications of their reports, for the Chairman has said: ' I stressed at the same time that they had not yet been considered by the Council'. It was at this meeting that the Minister suggested that the Council should prepare for his consideration a less ambitious programme involving the recommendation to proceed immediately with the least expensive steps and approach the more costly steps over a period of time. It was at this interview that the first mention of an 8-acre site occurred. Nowhere in the first or second reports can there be found any reference to 8 acres. Following these discussions, the Chairman submitted draft estimates of costs to the Interim Council and then forwarded them to the Minister on 30th June. An examination of these estimates shows that the cost of land for 60 acres would be $2.4m and for 8 acres $350,000; the cost of buildings $1,750,000; capital costs (excluding the cost of land and buildings) $1,691,000; and running costs for the first 5 years $1,807,000. The total costs, based on the 60 acre site, were of the order of $7.6m based on a 5-year period. It will be seen from this report that the Minister had endeavoured to ask the Council to recommend a less ambitious programme. The Government was facing a period of financial stringency and all recommendations for increased Government expenditure were being examined on 28th July 1971, saying: The Council also is anxious to make perfectly clear that its recommendation on the purchase of the land, now available in a non-intensive subdivision, is based on the belief that the site should not be confined to the area needed solely for a Film and Television School. Other Schools in associated studies are under active consideration, and their eventual close association and physical location alongside the Film School is considered of great importance to its long-term success. The opportunity to acquire the full site so advantageously will never re-occur. From this letter, it is clear that the Interim Council's proposals involved the purchase of a 60 acre site, together with the other recommendations contained in the estimates of costs referred to above. This was the basis of the statement that the Minister made on this matter in the House on 8th September. It was the first occasion on which the matter had been raised in the House, and, in the course of his statement, tbe Minister said: Whilst the Council's enthusiasm for the project is fully apparent, the continuing economic stringencies and the substantial cost, which is estimated an initial output to the industry of a maxito be over $7m during the first S years, have led to consideration of their proposals being deferred for 12 months. It is clear from the documents that have been tabled that, if the Government had endorsed the reports and proposals of the Council, its recommendations would have involved the Government in an expenditure of over $7.6m over the next 5 years. These recommendations were endorsed by the Chairman of the Interim Council as recently as 25th October 1971, for in his message at that time be said: . . . It is the continued view of the Interim Council that the School would succeed best, and some say only succeed, if it were part of a consortium of Schools. The School should not exist in isolation but should be part of a Centre of Schools of related activities. In other words, the Interim Council has never recommended the Film School being established on 8 acres, although this is tbe area of land suggested if the School were established in isolation. However, the recommendation of the Council always has been, and remains, that the best interests of the School would be to establish it in conjunction with other Schools in related subjects, upon wheh basis tbe recommendation was made for the purchase now, at an advantageous price, of the full area of sixty acres. . . . So far I have dealt with the details of costs of the proposals of the Interim Council. I now turn to examine briefly the estimate of the number of graduates who should be trained at the film school for employment in the industry in Australia. There is no indication in the original report of the film committee that there had been consultation with the industry in Australia or any estimate of the likely requirements of graduates. It is also clear from the first report of the Interim Council that it did not consider itself able to estimate the requirement for graduates. In paragraph 9.3 it states: Because of the difficulties involved in the Council itself making a thorough analysis of the industrial opportunities, as distinct from those in education, P.A. Management Consultants Pty Ltd have been engaged to conduct a survey of employment prospects in tbe film and television industry. In fact, at this stage the Interim Council had put in a report recommending the establishment of a film and television school and the purchase of land before it obtained any estimate of the required number of people to be trained in the school. The consultants, P.A. Management Consultants Pty Ltd, then produced a report in which they say categorically 'the School should plan for mum of 15 graduates per year'. The 15 graduates would be the total requirement of the following categories: producer-director, editor, script writer, film cameraman, and art director. The Interim Council was now in the position of having suggested a large complex of schools including the film school only to find that the experts concluded that the immediate need is for only 15 graduates per year. It was at this stage, that the Council proceeded to examine and evaluate the conclusions of the report. The dialogue that ensued is reported in the attachment to the letter that the Chairman of the Council sent to the Minister on 25th October and which was tabled by the Minister on 10th November. Examination of this discussion shows that a number of estimates were made as to the requirements of graduates-som e relating to a period 20 years hence-ye t there is still only one concrete recommendation available, and that is the conclusion of P.A. Management Consultants Pty Ltd. At this stage, the matters that have been considered relate to the means by which the Interim Council was established and the reports that the Council has made up to this moment. However, it is now necessary to examine the future of this important industry. It will be seen that there are a number of questions to which complete answers have not yet been given. The first refers to the relationship of the proposed film and television school to the film and television industry as a whole. It is important that every effort be made to ensure that the film and television industry is prepared to co-operate with the proposed film and television training school so as to ensure that the graduates emerging from the school would be employed, especially as at present there is some degree of unemployment in the industry in Australia. In order to ensure this co-operation between the industry and the Interim Council of the Film and Television School, the Government has agreed to the appointment to the Interim Council of Mr Hector Crawford and Mr Len Maugher, 2 experienced men recommended to the Government by the Interim Council. The terms of reference for the Interim Council have also been widened. They have been asked to review the relationship of the training already undertaken by the ABC, the commercial television organisations and the film industry to the programme of the proposed school. The Council will now seek the co-operation of those interested in connection with this review, and, as soon as the Government receives its report, it will consider the most appropriate way in which it might act to assist the industry in this important area. The next question relates to the proposal for a multi-school centre, which some members of the Council refer to as a polytechnic of associate disciplines. It has been suggested that this polytechnic could include the Australian Ballet School, the Australian Opera School, the National Institute of Dramatic Art, a post-graduate school of industrial design, a post-graduate Australian conservatorium, and a school of communications. Consideration is being given to asking the Australian Council for the Arts to examine these proposals in greater detail. Finally, however, it is necessary to return problems. They concede this. They feel to the first report of the Film Committee that the industry believes it suffers from of the Australian Council for the Arts, and 2 major drawbacaks. There are insufficient to the recommendation made at that time. volumes of work due to a small home This was that a policy of protection for the market and its inability to supplement this Australian film industry in some form sufficiently in export markets. The next would seem essential in the long-term, and problem is that there is a great shortage the Committee recommended that the of top class people to handle the key Tariff Board, or some specially constituted functions, body, look into this matter for it. The editors, script writers, film cameramen and Prime Minister has announced that this art directors. They then say: recommendation is now to be implemented. (Extension of time granted).

The point tions industry of international quality. is that the whole concept seems to be related Foreign television producers can afford to to the needs of an industry seen in far too sell their programmes at 'dump' prices to narrow a sense, as far as I am concerned. Australian stations, having spent perhaps 10 times on a programme what an Australian company could afford to spend, and selling it for about a quarter of what it would cost to make in Australia, k can be seen that many people believe that this is the first problem that needs to be solved. Until a solution has been found, the Australian film and television industry will not expand. When a solution has been found, expansion will take place. The decision of the Government to refer the industry to the Tariff Board shows that it now sees the whole problem, and that it is determined to assist the industry to expand and to relate all the proposals so that they fit in to this objective. Or CASS (Maribyrnong) (5.30)-The thing I find depressingin this discussion is the timidity of the approach of the Government. It seems that it needs cut and dried answers to every conceivable question; there is not much room for imagination or enthusiasm. IfI may refer to the report by the consultants who drew up all this verbiage, in a summary of their findings they indicate, in discussing the needs of a national film and television training school, that 'there are certain namely, producer-directors, These two factors are seen by the industry to The key to greater volume of work can never the like as the home market is just too small. The greater volume must come from export For instance, this survey indicates that it did not include an assessment of employment opportunity for graduates of the school in educational institutions. It did not consider the possible desire of some graduates for self-employment or to work on a free-lance basis. It did not consider students from overseas who might attend the school and then return to their home countries. In other words, the whole concept appears to be seen in terms of the needs of the film industry, the people who make films that are shown on the commercial screen; but I suggest that there is much more to it than that. T would like to quote from an article written by Phillip Adams in a well known national newspaper recently commenting on the views expressed by the man who took his place when he resigned from the Interim Council, namely, Hector Crawford. Adams says: Hector's gloomy attitude to the employment prospects of graduates The Minisler for National Development ( Mr Swartz) mentioned this. He said there is not much scope, there is not much room for people. That is the view of Hector Crawford who it seems is one of the men who has been given the prime responsibility of reviewing the whole thing. Adams article continues: , . . (who wouldn't make their debut until around 1975) is just as baffling. For a start, film and television are meritocracies-form s of expression that need new people as surely as agriculture need new crops or Parliament needs new members. Perhaps he is being prophetic. He goes on: Docs society stop producing painters, novelists or musicians lo protect the employment prospects of middle-aged practitioners? Of course not. And it would be just as absurd (and cruel) to prevent talented young film-makers studying their craft because of the shadows Hector sees in his crystal. Adams continues: In any case, the Interim Council had carefully researched employment prospects and found that another tertiary institution where these the industry needed more graduates than the people could be produced so that we can school could realistically provide. For that reason get some cross fertilisation as has been we had always thought in quantitative rather than mentioned before. In other words, I think qualitative terms. To get confirmation of that we turn to the cost-whic h I think is nonsense as it is first report of the Interim Council. In parareally a drop in the bucket in terms of the graph 9.2 it states: Graduates can be expected to find employment the ground that there really is not a need in film and television production, whether in because after all it will produce only 15 government and national agencies or in the private graduates and they will not find work anyand commercial sector. A limited number might also find jobs with advertising agencies or in other way is sheer nonsense. It is narrow and it branches of the communications media. In addiis looking with blinkers over your eyes. 23144/71-R-[158 J tion the Interim Council has constantly been made aware that there is a growing demand for graduates This is where a bit of inspiration comes into it of a Film and Television School in education. Universities, Colleges of Advanced Education, Teachers Colleges' and Technical Colleges. . . Let us consider what Professor Toeplitz said about the whole thing-someon e who has world stature as a film maker. He said: I. notice from your Report that the Interim Council has said that graduates of the School will find employment not only in film production but also in educational fields; There were no estimates made as to the demands in these fieldsin the universities, colleges of advanced education, . . . and so on. It is of course unlikely that the supply of experts in educational film and television will ever satisfy the demand. In view of all the pessimistic views that have been expressed by the Government I would like to repeat that. Professor Toeplitz concluded: It is of course unlikely that the supply of experts in educational film and television will ever satisfy the demand. He continues with another bright idea, not that he is just trying to be bright but because he perceives a need in human terms for the community. He said: . . . I think that the National School should be prepared to organise courses of limited duration for scientists and their counterparts in other disciplines, who might wish to use film as an aid to their own research, as a medium for training other people or, perhaps, as a vehicle for the popularisation of their life's work. For such people courses in the fundamentals of film technique would be of immense value. 1 should stress that such courses would be of more value if they were made available to scientists and others at the outset of their careers, rather than to their more senior colleagues. This is a case for having the school near the whole brouhaha about the enormous gross national product of this country-o n That would be a minimum. There are thing that we have not tried before. In any many more avenues of possible employcase for the future health and welfare of ment for these people.

In fact Adams quotes, very interestingly, smart does not mean that they arc any less from a letter written by Hector Crawford important as means of communication. In to the Interim Council just 12 months ago fact there are some who feel that probably in which he said: . . since the purpose of the school is to their capacity for immediacy and their foster the growth of Australian-produced televiscope in combining many of the other art sion programmes and feature films, I consider forms all together clearly visual, auditory thai it should train directors and writers.

That is another good reason for having it what else can exceed the capacity of a film in a larger area associated with other to communicate beyond language barriers schools and next to a university. Adams because one may not understand the lancontinues: AndI would ask both the Prime Minister and understand the image. Mr Howson to zoom in and take a big closc-up of this sentence: 'Ideally, there should be one school established in Melbourne and another in Sydney.' So much for the poppycock about the one we are proposing being too much for Australia already. Crawford himself feels there ought to be 2 envisaged even at this stage. Phillip Adams goes on to indicate how film schools have been around since 1918 in various countries in the world. It is not a novel idea. He suggests that many leading film makers of Russia, Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia have all been graduates of film schools. He indicates that currently in America 100,000 Americans are studying film or television at the tertiary level. The equivalent for Australia would be something like 25,000 and here we are quibbling about whether we can afford to build a school to turn out about 15 people. What utter humbug and nonsense. I would suggest that it is time we recognised that this community is rich enough to afford a little bit of adventure, a little bit of inspiration and a little bit of courage in grappling with something that is new, someBut just because they are young and a bit film and of course television because of not suggesting it displaces anything. It builds upon these things but it is an inteunderstanding between peoples. After all, guage but whatever one's language one can For these reasons I feel that the Government is betraying itself and the whole community is being so timid and so reluctant to proceed with what was in my view a very modest proposal put forward by the Interim Council. When the Council proposed 60 acres of land as against the 8 acres or whatever piddling area it was for just a simple film school, the Council was looking ahead to a broad concept. I think we should accept the recommendation of the Council. We should not at this stage ruin the chances of the whole proposal just because we do not feel we can afford S7m at this stage over 5 years. Of course we can. My guess is that the way the economy is going some time next year the Government will embrace the opportunity to expend the extra money to encourage or to prime the pump of the flagging economy. So let us stop the nonsense about we cannot afford it. Let us stop being frightened. Let us be a bit adventurous. Let us drag ourselves into tbe latter half of the 20th century. proposition which we have before the House is foundering because of Government policy.

256,Mr Hayden,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Ithe Government has closed down debateand this is no secret to any member of the House-thi s matter has been buried in the Notice Paper and will not be resurrected between now and the next election, whenever that happens to be. The issue I want to bring forth in debate is (hat there has been this continuing pattern of what I regard as grave misrepresentation of this issue. point out again to the honourable member that he is transgressing the Standing Orders. If he continues to transgress them in this way I shall have to ask him to resume his seat. Orders be suspended so as to allow me to debate this issue. Perhaps1 could indicate to you honourable member knows that when he seeks the suspension of the Standing Orders he is asking, if the House agrees to the suspension, for an opportunity to discuss the subject matter of the statement made on the national film and television training school. The motion before the Chair is for the suspension of the Standing Orders and is not the substantive matter. the motion to suspend the Standing Orders. I do so for this reason. The House is about to go into recess for 7 or 8 weeks. We have met for, 1 think, 150 days in the last 780 days. There have been continuous misuses of the majority control of this Parliament by the Ministry on every significant issue over the last few months, and one of the significant issues is the establishment of the national film and television training school. This debate has now been pushed right into limbo so that it will never be raised again. Mr Deputy Speaker, the situation is this: This Parliament is the forum of the nation. It can operate as a forum only if there is public debate on (vide page 2523), on the following papers issues of the moment is the film school. We have heard continual remarks from the other side of the House. There has been a misuse of question time. The only way in which the Opposition can put its point of view and the only way in which the honourable member for Oxley can put his point of view is to speak in this House and therefore it is essential that he be permitted to speak. The only way he can be permitted to speak now is to suspend the Standing Orders. The only machinery available to the Opposition in this context is to suspend the Standing Orders-thes e Standing Orders which have been misused continuously by honourable members on the other side, particularly today, so that the Government can have its say and the Opposition can be silenced. We must suspend the Standing Orders so that the most suppressed Opposition in a comparable parliament anywhere in what one might call the Western or parliamentary world can be heard. The honourable member for Oxley, in this instance, represents 50 per cent of the people of Australia and therefore he should be heard. We want to know whether the Minister is afraid to speak. Why is it that be has not been heard in this instance? However, the essential question is whether the Opposition voice is to be heard or whether it is to be silenced, and the only way it can be heard is through suspension of the Standing Orders. It is a disgrace to the parliamentary system that the honourable member for Angas( Mr Giles) and the Ministry, particularly the Leader of the House( Mr Swartz), should continually misuse their majority control to silence us, and we must take every opportunity to ensure that our voice is heard. It is important that the honourable member lor Oxley be heard. I do not know why the honourable members opposite, in particular the Minister, arc continually scuttling for cover.

One Of The Important Public Presented By Mr Mcmahon:,"A copy of a letter dated 28th July 1971 from tbe Chairman to the Minister for the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts, Answer by the Prime Minister to a question by the Leader of the Opposition on 14th October concerning the proposals of the Interim Council for a National Film and Television Training School, 26th October 1971. and on motion by Mr Swartz: That the House take note of the papers. Question resolved in the affirmative. Sitting suspended from 5.58 to 8 p.m. Fourteenth Report of the Publications Committee. Report-by leave-adopted . 1972 Bill presented by Mr Snedden, and read a first time. Second Reading (8.1)I move: That ihc Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to amendments to the income tax law foreshadowed in 2 separate announcements I made earlier this year. Each announcement followed a decision of the High Court which showed a weakness in the present law of which taxpayers were taking advantage amounts of tax which, in accordance with the policy of the legislation as approved by the Parliament, it was intended they should pay. The Bill is therefore one directed wholly against legal tax avoidance. This is a subject about which the Government is generally concerned at the present time and which it is closely examining in various aspects. The Bill is an important one, dealing in part with the most difficult question of providing effective legislative tests which separate the genuine public company from the ostensible public company for taxation purposes. It will not be practicable to debate the Bill in these sittings but the Government considered it should nevertheless be introduced now. There will thus be provided a full opportunity for the terms of the Bill to be considered within the Parliament and outside it before the debate takes place. Before the amending legislation of 1964, based on the recommendations of the Commonwealth Committee on Taxation 1959-1961, there had been considerable legal tax avoidance through essentially private companies masquerading as public companies. The 1964 legislation was intended to put an end to this. Unfortunately, as the High Court has pointed out, the 1964 amendments left a real gap. This gap has been used to obtain the same sort of unintended tax advantages for private companies as were available before the 1964 amending legislation. In broad terms, the general aim of the arrangements is to ensure that the trading profits of private companies remain taxed at the lower rate TAX ASSESSMENT BILL applicable to those companies but that the profits are distributed as dividends to companies that are public in a narrowly technical sense so that there is no incidence of undistributed profits tax or personal tax on shareholders in respect of the dividends. The arrangements strike at the very basis of our company tax system as it was intended by the legislature to apply. Moreover, they are highly artificial and serve no purpose other than tax avoidance. One type of scheme was dealt with by the High Court in the case of Casuarina Pty Ltd and ruled legally effective. Another type is known as the 'chain-of-ten"" scheme and is equally effective. Each type to avoid-quit e legally-larg e requires co-operation between genuine public companies and private companies so that, with the help of the public companies, the private companies can pay dividends to a company which is technically a subsidiary of a public company-and therefore itself a public company-for tax purposes. Of course the arrangements also ensure that the dividends effectively remain the exlusive property of the private company interests, except, perhaps, to a very small extent which is a recompense or fee to the public company for its assistance. In the Casuarina arrangement, the whole essence of the matter is that at the end of the year of income the company receiving private company dividends meets all the technical tests of a subsidiary of a public company. That is to say, at that time more than 50 per cent of the capital, voting",87,National Film And Television Training School
262,Mr Erwin (Ballaarat),I present the,88,Income
263,Mr Snedden (Bruce,"Treasurer )power and the rights to dividends and other distributions are in the hands of a public company shareholder. There co-exist, however, countervailing devices which ensure that any attempt by the public company shareholder to exercise its ostensible rights can easily be defeated by the private company interests so that the public company rights are, in fact, worthless. These devices include such things as the use of shares redeemable at the instance of the private company interests only, but there are many ways in which the desired effects can be achieved. The 'chain-of-ten' scheme takes advantage of the fact that under the present law a sub-subsidiary of a public company, no matter how remote from the head or parent company, must be treated as a public company. If a company is owned as to more than 50 per cent by a public company, and its voting power is controlled by the same company, it is treated as a subsidiary of that one that has operated satisfactorily for public company. If it, in turn, has the same measure of ownership and control in another company, that other company is also treated as a subsidiary and so on. Tn a typical chain a public company listed on the stock exchange provides a specially set up company with subsidiary status and this subsidiary sets up a chain of ten other subsubsidiaries below it. The tenth and last sub-subsidiary is the company to which the private company profits are distributed as dividends. The public company interests could force redistribution of these dividends along the chain-agains t the wishes of the private company interests. This is unlikely, however, because there is a 49 per cent private company ownership of each link in the chain which would result, for example, in only $119 out of $100,000 of private company profits finding its way to the listed public company at the top of the chain. The balance would all go to the private company interests. The Government has decided that, in the face of these arrangements, in all their com29th April 1971, the relevant company will plexity and their shades of organisational and factual differences one from the other, the best plan was to define primarily as a subsidiary of a public company one that is, at all times during the year of income, beneficially owned, in the fullest sense of those words, as to 100 per cent by a genuine public company, including a subsidiary which, on these tests, is itself a public company. This the Bill proposes to do. The Bill also proposes that a company which does not meet the 100 per cent test will not be treated as a subsidiary of a public company unless, at all times during the year of income, it is owned as to more than 50 per cent and its voting power is controlled, again in the fullest sense, by a public company listed on the stock exchange. Both direct and indirect interests will be taken into account for these purposes. These are necessarily stringent tests. As a safety valve against their applying inappropriately, the dispensing discretion vested in the Commissioner by the present law to treat a company as public when, for one reason or another, it fails to meet all the technical tests but should reasonably be treated as public, will remain. This is not a new administrative discretion, but some years now. The tests-stringen t as they are on die face of it-coul d still be met and provide no more than a facade behind which the company is managed or conducted so as to render tbe public shareholding worthless or virtually so. Directors representing private interests, for example, could have the power to do this. This is a substantial difficulty which it has not been found possible to overcome both positively and comprehensively. The legislation therefore permits the Commissioner to deny public status lo a company when, having regard to specified matters relevant to the determination and set out in some detail, he is satisfied that the company's affairs are being conducted to this end. It is proposed by the Bill that the amendments I have so far described should basically apply so that, if the company structure had been fully established by the necessary issue of shares, etc., before remain a public company for the 1970-71 income year by satisfying the existing tests of a public company subsidiary. For subsequent years, however, the company will need to comply with the tests that are proposed in this Bill. Where the structure had not been established until after 28th April 1971, it is proposed that the cpmpany be treated as a private company for 1970-71 and later income years unless, of course, it meets the new tests in relation to tbe later years. These commencement provisions are consistent with what I said In my announcement on the matter on 28th April 1971. The income year 1971-72 is, therefore, the year for which, in the generality of cases, the new tests, required to be met at all times during the year, will apply. A good deal of that year has already elapsed and more will have passed before, if Parliament approves the Bill, royal assent is given to it. In recognition of this, a special transitional provision is proposed whereby a company will, with an exception I shall shortly mention, be taken to have met the tests at all times during 1971-72 if it meets them at all times during the part of that year commencing no later than one month after the date of royal assent. The exception is the case of the company which has performed the public company part in a tax avoidance arrangement of the kind against which the legislation is directed ject to rebate to be ascertained by reference and which received private company dividends in the period of 1971-72 prior to its compilance with the new tests. Where a company remains a public company for the income year 1970-71, distributions made to it by a private company up to tbe end of that year will be treated as dividends paid to a public company. However, it is proposed by the Bill that any such distributions made after 28th April 1971, and before the end of the recipient company's 1970-71 income year, will not be capable of giving rise to an excess distribution to be carried forward by the private company into future years. In other words, a company will not be permitted to generate an excess distribution through excessive dividends declared under the tax avoiding arrangement in the closing stages of 1970-71, and after my announcement of the proposed amendments. The Bill also proposes an amendment to deal with another and different arrangement which involves avoidance of undistributed profits tax without actual distribution of profits. Under this scheme a private company issues shares to a genuine public company in return for a premium equal to the dividends the private company is able to declare. It is proposed that a dividend paid in these circumstances is not to be taken into account in determining whether the paying company has made a sufficient distribution of its profits. This amendment will apply in relation to dividends paid after today. As foreshadowed by my announcement of 31st August 1971, the Bill also proposes amendments to deal with dividendstripping arrangements which take advantage of the way in which the law at present requires the tax rebate on inter-company dividends to be calculated. It is proposed that the amendments will operate in relation to dividends arising out of an arrangement which the Commissioner of Taxation is satisfied is by way of dividend-stripping. The term 'dividend-strippng' has been employed in the courts here and in the United Kingdom and has come to have a widely understood connotation in professional and financial circles. This amendment will apply to dividends paid after 31st August 1971 and, in broad terms, will permit the amount of dividends subto all losses and outgoings incurred in relation to the dividend-stripping arrangement as a whole. in my announcement of 31st August 1971 1 pointed out that, because of the dividend rebate provisions, a company can effectively receive other kinds of income tax-free. In addition to the dividendstripping arrangement, a recognised way of doing this is for a share trading company to take advantage of the trading stock and dividend rebate provisions of the income tax law, operating in combination, so as to reduce tax on share trading profits. The Bill proposes that where the purpose of a valuation of trading stock is to obtain this tax advantage the rebate allowable to the company is to be calculated as though, instead of the valuation of stock adopted by it, the lowest valuation that it could lawfully have chosen had been adopted. This amendment will apply in relation to assessments for the income year 1971-72 and subsequent years. In my announcement of 31st August 1971 1 also mentioned that the rebate is required to be calculated on a basis that can be unduly advantageous to companies not involved in any arrangement for legal tax avoidance. On this aspect of the matter the Government has received a large volume of representations and it has become quite clear that there is no simple way of altering the basis of the rebate without giving rise lo serious anomalies between different company structures. For this reason the Government has considered that it should confine the proposals of this Bill to measures directed against legal tax avoidance. An examination of the other matter will continue, paying particular regard to the exigencies of company organisation. If it is found appropriate, amending legislation to deal with the matter will be brought forward at a later time. A number of the provisions-unavoid ably and, I think, quite appropriatelyturn primarily upon the Commissioner of ence between 'evading' and 'avoiding'.

I hope that an opportunity will be given early in the next sessional period, before the Bill comes on for debate, lo discuss some of the principles involved. I must say that I am at one with the Treasurer on this issue. Legal gentlemen try to draw very fine distinctions between the evading of taxation and the avoiding of taxation.

I would like to see these matters contemplated in some detail before the House considers them. The Treasurer and I are at one on these issues. Part of this legislation deals with the ability of a private company to become a public company simply to accept the taxation advantage involved. The law should not allow such an opportunity. I was interested the other night to hear the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr of the Income Tax (International AgreeBury) ask a question about this matter. I suppose there are some disadvantages as well as advantages in dividend stripping, as it is described. But to most people it is an occult science. It. has overtones of mystery and so on. The Treasurer on occasions has apparently felt that I was hostile, rather than sympathetic, towards him. On this issue 1 am at one with him and I acknowledge the practical difficulties involved when the law takes a certain view. The law tries to set out a code of behaviour. I have often quoted the view of Mr Justice Mansfield of the British courts that an individual is entitled, if he wants to, to drive a coach and horses through the law, but the law is also entitled to block such people. I am on the side of the law in blockTax (International Agreements) Act in ing these activities 1 have been speaking about. One of the difficulties in our system is variations in this regard.

For the purpose of implementing provisions of double taxation agreements which require us to allow tax credits, it is necessary to ascertain the amount of Australian tax payable on the relevant part of a taxpayer's income. Section 15 spells out the method by which this is to be done and refers, among other things, to rebate entitlements under section 46 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. As a consequence of the proposal to have an extra provision-sectio n 46A-in that Act to govern rebates on dividends arising from dividend stripping operations, references to the new provision will need to be incorporated in section 15 of the Income contexts where references to section 46 currently appear.

267,Mr Snedden (Bruce,Treasurer ) (8.23),92,Proposed Legislation On General Insurance
268,Mr Snedden (Bruce,"Treasurer)-b ylegislation in this session. A vast amount of ground has been covered, but a number of details have yet to be settled. In the meantime it will be helpful to all concerned if I outline in some detail the scheme of legislation which the Government has in mind. The essential elements can be summarised quite briefly. General insurance companies would be brought under supervision by requiring I hem to obtain authorities to carry from entering the business and by conon general insurance business. By 'general insurance"" I mean all classes of insurance other than life insurance, which is subject to the Life Insurance Act. To obtain an authority, a company would be required to satisfy standards of financial soundness prescribed in the legislation. After receiving panies which fell below the new requirean authority, the company would be obliged to maintain the prescribed standards and would be subject to continuous supervision to ensure that it did so. An authorised insurer who failed to maintain the standards, or who appeared to be in danger-of falling below the standards, could be subject to inquiry and investigation, which could lead to the company being issued with such directions as were necessary to deal with the situation and, if those measures were unsuccessful, to the withdrawal of the authority. These are the basic features of the proposed scheme of legislation as it would apply permanently to companies wishing to begin insurance business after the commencement date. Existing insurers carrying on business at present would be brought under the same system of supervision by means of transitional provisions in the legislation. Before describing the proposed system of supervision in more detail, I have some comments to make on the purpose and scope of the scheme. Purpose Honourable members will recall that the Government's decision to legislate for the supervision of general insurance companies was prompted by the failure of some insurance companies from mid-1970 onwards, following many years of stability in the insurance industry. The companies which failed were relatively small and of recent origin, but their failure caused some insurance business in Australia is conducted apprehension that other companies may not for the most part by companies which are befinanciallysound. The scheme of legislation proposes to tackle the problem by establishing the minimum standards of financial soundness to which I have referred and by providing a means of identifying and investigating companies which do not measure up to the standards. With a view to their reorganisation or orderly withdrawal from insurance business. In the longer term the scheme aims to prevent weak, inefficient companies tinuing supervision to keep the industry in a healthy condition. It must be emphasised that the introduction of legislation could not transform the financial condition of insurance companies overnight. It would take time for comments to be identified and for their situations to be rectified. The proposals however, open the way for a permanent solution of the problem. Furthermore, regulatory legislation of this kind cannot guarantee that no insolvencies will ever occur. It thus cannot guarantee that claims on insurance companies will always be met in full. If, however, financial stability of general insurance companies is established as a result of the legislation, the public will be given substantial protection in their insurance transactions. In the preparation of the scheme of legislation, consideration was given to the possibility of establishing a fidelity or guarantee fund, to which insurers would contribute and which would be available to meet deficiencies arising from liquidations of insurance companies. However, this proposal would present difficulties, at least in present circumstances in Australia. It would require sound insurers to pay for the mistakes of weak insurers and it could be held to be unreasonable to compel sound insurers to do this at the present time, while doubts continue about the financial soundness of some companies. Furthermore, the creation of such a fund in present circumstances could tend to perpetuate weaknesses in the industry, by underwriting the activities of companies engaged in risky insurance practices. It must be remembered that general sound and efficiently managed. Only a very small percentage of the business is carried on by companies which could be regarded as financially doubtful. In considering ways pf supervising general insurance companies, the Government wants to avoid giving an impression that many insurance companies are weak and also does not wish to bring down legislation which is so restrictive that it would stultify the business of the great majority of insurance companies. Scope of (he Legislation The announced, was that the Commonwealth should legislate for the supervision of general insurance companies. The scheme of legislation which has been prepared accordingly concentrates on setting up a system of supervision and does not enter into other fields, such as the issue of policies, premium rates, the payment of claims and other contractual relationships between insurance companies and policy owners. Insurance Business Turning now to the details of the scheme of legislation, insurance businesswould be defined as at present in section 3 of the Insurance Act 1932-1966 and would continue to exclude the types of business at present excluded, namely, life insurance business and accident insurance business undertaken solely in connection with life insurance business; benefits provided by a friendly society or a trade union for its members or their dependants; employer and employee superannuation schemes; funeral benefits schemes; and the business of insuring exclusively the property of a religious organisation. In addition, business carried on by medical and hospital benefits organisations registered under the National Health Act would be excluded and also self-insurers at present exempt under section 15 of the Insurance Act. Administration The legislation would provide for the appointment of a commissioner, who would Transitional Arrangements be responsible for the administration, subject to the directions of the Treasurer. Authorisation of Insurers The legislation would prohibit the carryto continue to carry on business. It is exing on of insurance business other than by pected that the majority would be able to a company authorised to carry on that comply with the financial requirements business under the Act. Applications would be made to the Commissioner, supported by information about the company and its financial position and prospects. The Treasurer would be empowered to grant or refuse to grant an authority and to attach conditions to an authority, but an authority would not be granted where the Treasurer, on receipt of a report from the Commissioner, was not satisfied as to the applicant's financial soundness as determined by the criteria for financial soundness spelt out in Government's decision, as the legislation. Companies would be required to satisfy the following main requirements: A minimum paid-up capital of the order of $200,000, or the equivalent in capital funds in the case of a company not limited by shares; a solvency margin of assets over all liabilities excluding liabilities to shareholders, equal to 15 per cent of annual premium income or a money amount equal to half the minimum paid-up capital requirements whichever is the greater; a margin of assets in Australia over liabilities in Australia, excluding liabilities to shareholders, calculated in accordance with the solvency formula; satisfactory arrangements for reinsurance; reputable and efficient ownership and management; and capacity to meet obligations. With regard to the solvency requirement, I should mention that this is a test commonly used in insurance legislation overseas. Its effectiveness depends largely on the assets of the company being valued on a conservative basis and its liabilities being accounted for fully. For this reason, it is proposed that there should be a number of supporting provisions relating to assets and liabilities. It is not proposed that the investment policies of insurance companies srhould be controlled, but certain assets would be excluded for the purposes of the margin of solvency calculations and provisions in respect of underwriting liabilities would be placed under close supervision. The transitional arrangements would provide for all insurers who are carrying on business as at the date of this statement and who made application to be authorised which I have outlined, but special arrangements would be necessary to deal with those which could not do so. It is envisaged that an exemption would be provided for companies which could not meet the minimum paid-up capital requirement, but could meet the other requirements. Companies which could not meet the other requirements at the time of application, but which demonstrated a capacity to meet the requirements within 2 years would be given time to comply. In the remaining cases, action would be taken to investigate their affairs, under the inquiry and investigation provisions of the legislation. Where appropriate, directions might be issued for the reorganisation of a company, but if no alternative could be found, steps would be put in train to terminate the business. Continuous Supervision The effectiveness of the proposed system of supervision would depend to a large extent on the range and reliability of the information received by the administration. The information should not only enable the insurer's compliance with the financial stangated. The possibility is that, on receipt dards to be policed, but also provide an early warning of any tendency for a company's financial position to weaken. It is proposed that all authorised insurers should be required to furnish annually in respect of their Australian business a balance sheet, a solvency statement, an underwriting account and a profit and loss and appropriation account, all of which would need to be audited by approved auditors. They would also be required to furnish annually statistical returns showing, by class of busithe situation disclosed, including a direcness, premiums earned, provisions for outstanding claims, claims incurred, underwriting results and reinsurance arrangements, together with a return showing the run-off of claims for selected classes of business. In addition, there would be quarterly returns of selected assets and liabilities and monthly returns of premiums, claims and expenses. The Commissioner would be empowered to require explanations of items in any of Cancellation of Authority the accounts and returns and, if not satisfied, to give directions for variation. Memlation of authorities in particular circumbers of the public would have access on stances, including a voluntary termination request to copies of an authorised insurer's of an insurance business as well as a terbalance sheet, underwriting account, profit mination following an investigation. and loss and appropriation account as submitted to the Commissioner, either at his office or at the principal office of the company. AH other returns would be regarded as confidential. It is proposed, however, that selected information from the returns should be processed and published as aggregates for general statistical purposes. This would be an important by-product of the legislation, providing information which would be valuable to insurers in managing their businesses, as well as being of importance generally within the community. Inquiry and Investigation The scheme of legislation proposes that, if it appeared to the Commissioner that there was cause for concern about a company's financial position, he would be empowered to demand additional information about the position. If it appeared that there was a risk of the company not being able to comply with its obligations under the legislation the Commissioner would be empowered to serve a notice on the company to show cause why the company should not be investiof such a notice, the company would take action lo correct the situation. If the company failed to show cause to the Commissioner's satisfaction, an investigation could be made. Following an investigation, the Commissioner would be required to give the company a summary of the conclusions and he could issue to the company such directions as to its insurance business as he thought necessary and proper to deal with tion that the company should not issue policies in respect of all or part of its insurance business. The intention would be that every effort should be made to avoid failure. Directions given by the Commossioner would be subject to appeal, but it is proposed that, for the protection of the public, a direction not to issue policies should be effective immediately pending completion of the hearing. Provision would be made for the cancelAppeals It is proposed that a special administrative tribunal should be established under the legislation, with a judge as chairman and with 2 members experienced in insurance, but not a director, officer or employee of a company or organisation actively engaged in insurance business. The tribunal would hear appeals on administrative decisions under the legislation which would be largely of a technical nature. Provision would be made for appeal to a court of appropriate jurisdiction on matters involving questions of law in the legislation. The outline I have given summarises in broad terms the provisions which the Government has in mind in respect of the authorisation and continuous supervision of general insurance companies. There arc, however, many other matters that would need to be provided for. Deposit Requirement The deposit requirement is not expected to serve a useful purpose after the proposed system of supervision has become fully established and insurance companies come under continuous observation. Increases in deposits which were large enough to give policy owners a high degree of protection in the event of a company's failure could put some companies out of business, including some small, but sound companies. A large deposit requirement could have the effect of weakening a company's financial position by limiting the availability of its assets for use in its business. Under the proposed new system of supervision there would be no need for large deposits to keep excessively small companies from entering into insurance business. That would be done by the minimum paid-up capital requirement and the solvency margin. It is accordingly proposed that the deposit requirement would carry on under the Insurance Act 1932-1966 until the new system is fully established and that the deposits would be released 2 years after the commencement of the new legislation, or such later date as may be proclaimed. The Insurance Act 1932-1966 contains no provision for a release of deposits of this kind and a legislative amendment would be necessary to implement the proposal. Lloyd's Underwriters The system of supervision which I have outlined relates to companies incorporated in the usual way. Lloyd's of London, who have carried on insurance business in Australia for many years, do not fit easily into that kind of legislation, because Lloyd's underwriters are individuals with unlimited personal liability who form syndicates of varying numbers to undertake insurance transactions in many parts of the world. Discussions are in progress with Lloyd's through the general counsel in Australia for Lloyd's on ways in which Lloyd's underwriters could be brought within the scope of the proposed legislation. State and Territory Legislation There is a wide variety of legislation relating to general insurance in the States and the Commonwealth Territories. Some of it is of a supervisory kind, under which licences are issued for companies to carry on general insurance business, or certain classes of general insurance business. The remainder is for various purposes, such as payment of stamp duties and fire brigade levies, and the insurance provisions in a variety of laws on subjects such as hire purchase, housing and local government. With regard to the supervisory legislation, such as the Queensland Insurance Act, which exercises control over the whole field of general insurance, and legislation in the States and Territories for the supervision of companies carrying on workers' compensation and compulsory third party insurance, the State governments are anxious to keep their controls in being for a period after the proposed Commonwealth legislation came into force. External Territories It is proposed that the legislation should be capable of extension to the external Territories of the Commonwealth by proclamation, but that provision would he made for exemption, on the advice of the Minister for External Territories, of substantially indigenous insurers in the Territory of Papua New Guinea, undertaking insurance business only in the Territory, from some or all of the provisions of the legislation. This is reasonable, because it would take time for the Commonwealth administration to identify companies which are financially unsound and to take whatever action might be needed to rectify matters. Tbe scheme of legislation envisages appropriate provisions being made to safeguard the supervisory legislation in the States and Territories for an interim period. Provisions would also be included to safeguard the remaining State legislation on general insurance. Similar exemption would also be allowed for certain insurance schemes involving some administration sponsorship. State Insurance Insurance business conducted by State governments and their instrumentalities falls largely outside the Commonwealth's constitutional powers, and in any event there is> no question of the financial soundness of the State Government Insurance Offices. However, those Offices form a large part-abou t 20 per cent-of the Australian insurance market. Discussions are going on with the State governments as to the extent to which they would be prepared to cooperate voluntarily in the spirit of the legislation will be ready for introduction early lation, particularly in matters such as the furnishing of information without which Australian insurance statistics would be seriously incomplete. Insurance Brokers Following representations on the need to bring insurance brokers under supervision, The Opposition welcomes the intent of this it is proposed that the Commonwealth legislation which at least spells out for the should legislate for that purpose. As honfuture a code of behaviour as far as what ourable members know, the role of brokers is described as general insurance is conin insurance transactions is to advise memcerned.

The GovernThis amount is getting close to the magniment will be pressing on with the comtude of defence expenditure, but neverthepletion of this work in conjunction with the less up to date it has not been subject to completion of the proposed legislation for the supervision of the general insurance companies. Conclusion I should like to conclude by thanking all the representatives of the State governments and members of the insurance industry who have assisted in various ways in the development of the proposals which I have outlined. It would not have been possible to reach the present stage without the information and advice which they have freely provided. It is a good example of co-operation between government and industry towards a common objective of raising tbe financial standards of all engaged in the large and important business of general insurance. It will be evident to honourable members from the summary I have given of the main provisions which are under consideration that the preparation of this legislation is a substantial task. We shall be going ahead with the work with all possible speed and I hope that the legisin the next session.

Placitum (xiv.) states: Insurance, other than State insurance; also sion. When the honourable member for State insurance extending beyond the limits of Berowra( Mr Hughes), who was in the the State concerned: At least we entered into the field of life assurance and were quite successful in carrying out that responsibility. Many years ago when the Treasurer was in a less distinguished positionI think that he may just have emerged as the Attorney-GeneralI asked why the Government did not appoint a Commissioner to be responsible for this type of insurance. If he looks back in the HansardI think he will find that in the early 1960s or the late 1950s I asked why the Government did not appoint in the field of insurance other than life assurance a commissioner similar to the one who operates in the life assurance field, and I think the Treasurer suggested to me in reply that he did not think it was necessary. At least he has now acknowledged this need. I pay tribute also to one of my colleagues, one of the new members, the honourable member for Hawker( Mr of insurance. Other types are workers' comJacobi), who has had some experience in this field. He has raised this kind of matter also. As recently as the last debate on the Treasury Estimates only a few weeks ago I suggestedI appreciate the difficulties in legislating in thisfield-that we have somebody to examine general insurance; that the Government should appoint a Commissioner who could at least explore the field in advance and indicate the scope of tbe legislation required. It seems to me that the Treasurer has at least now indicated a code. The need for this kind of legislation has hope that the Treasurer and his advisers been brought home to us recently by the will press on in the next 2 or 3 months experience of the sort of straw companies and have the Bill ready for us when we that have operated particularly in the field resume next year. of motor insurance. I think it is a terrible thing in the community when literally anybody with virtually no capital, and not havBill on the table for a few weeks so that ing even to indicate any provision in relathose who are involved can give us the tion to the policies he writes or in relation benefit of their expertise. I had to take part to the risk that may be incurred, does not in a broadcast today, and someone said: have to spell out any kind of ratio. At least 'There is a lack of expertise on the Oppothe Treasurer has now indicated that legissition side'. I said: ' ""Expertise"" is an awful lative action will be taken in this field and word'. I think there is a place for expertise, 1 commend him for it. AgainI thank him for indicating in advance the nature of the proposed legislation. I think we appreciate the difficulties that are involved in bringing this legislation forward, but I hope it will be introduced early in the next seschamber at the beginning of the debate but who is not here now, was AttorneyGeneralI asked him a question at least 12 months ago about whether certain straw companies were using the facilities of registration in Canberra when in fact they were operating in other States. I must say that I was assailed by all sorts of telegrams the day after I raised this matter with the Treasurer's colleague. AH the companies that protested their innocence have since gone broke. At least it was indicative that there was at least a smell in that field. Motor insurance is one type of general insurance. In this country something like 500,000 new motor cars are bought each year. Apart from America and Canada we have almost the highest ratio of motor cars to population of any place in the world. So motor insurance is an important field pensation and fire insurance. Premiums for all these types of insurance add up to something like $ 1,000m annually. At least J welcome the proposition that now, belatedly, the Commonwealth is moving into the general insurance field. The Government having acknowledged the need to go into this field I hope that it will move as quickly as is possible, and I would hope that when we come back, discounting for the moment all the talk about an election later next year, we will be able to consider this legislation on insurance with some degree of tranquillity and some degree of detail. I 1 hope that the Treasurer will lay the but once we start talking about expertise it gets a bit tedious. But at least the expert can tell the not-so-well advised in a field what he thinks should be done, but ultimately it is up to the Ministers to determine the code of operation. At least the Treasurer tonight has spelt out a code in some detail, and I thank him for it. My only regret is that the Commonwealth did not decide to enter into this field much earlier. I am directing my remarks not so much to the Treasurer as to his predecessors. I hope that when we come back here in February ari*d early March this will be one of the first Bills placed before us and that we will have time to look at it in detail and have a proper committee debate on it. Committee debates where we can get down to details are lacking in this House. I would hope that the Treasurer will not think that the only expertise or the only expert information available is on the Government side and that he will give kindly consideration to sympathetic amendments moved from the Opposition side in this field. Debate (on adjourned. a personal explanation. Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented? misrepresented by an article published in the 'Daily News' of 2nd December headed 'MP: Too Many Pauper Migrants'. The report is so abbreviated from the Hansard that it gives the impression that I was criticising the actual migrants themselves when in fact the Hansard shows I was requesting an inquiry into the matter of hardship, housing and employment security and an assurance on these matters to be given to migrants. Further the article indicated that I had said that by bringing these people to Australia the Government was damaging the country's international reputation. In fact the Hansard shows that I said: These are real problems which not only are causing damage to our international reputation. this subject in the wool growing industry. I was referring to comments 1 had previously made in my speech to wrong information given to intending and actual migrants by official Australian sources. In no way did my speech reflect on the actual migrants, who have my complete sympathy and support. Ministerial Statement for Primary Industry) (9.0)-by leave-The Government has decided to accept the recommendation of the Australian Wool Industry Conference that the partial relaxation of the embargo on the export of merino rams be extended for a further 3 years. The limited relaxation will be subject to the same conditions which applied in the past 2 years. On this occasion, however, the Wool Industry Conference has recommended that the partial relaxation be for a period of 3 years instead of being reviewed annually as in the past. The conditions which apply to the 3-year partial relaxation which will commence on 1st February motion by Mr Giles) 1972 are: (i) Not more than 300 merino rams may be sold for export in any one year. (ii) The prohibition on the export of merino ewes, semen and fertilised ova will be continued. (iii) Export approvals will be issued only for merino rams that have been sold at public auction sales nominated by the State member associations of the Australian Association of Stud Merino Breeders. (iv) The partial relaxation will be reviewed before the end of the 3-year period. The current period of relaxation of the embargo does not expire until 31st January 1972. It has been necessary, however, to make an early decision regarding the continuation of the relaxation so that potential overseas buyers would have adequate time to make arrangements to operate at the next Sydney ram sales which will be held early in February 1972. The merino export embargo has been a controversial subject since it was imposed in 1929. Over the years conflicting views have been held on",97,Proposed Legislation On General Insurance

275,Mr Sinclair (New England,"Ministe rIn November 1968 the Australian Wool Industry Conference, after obtaining expert advice on all aspects of the embaro and after thoroughly considering tbe matter, recommended a limited relaxation of the embargo initially for one year. This recommendation was adopted by the Government but was not implemented until 1st February 1970. The reason for the delay in implementing the recommendation was to give the opponents of the relaxation full opportunity to make representations to the Conference, in the event, however, the Conference reaffirmed its original recommendation. Again, on the recommendation of the Conference the limited relaxation of the embargo was extended for another year as from 1st February 1971. The present decision will extend the limited relaxation until 31st December 1975. Of the 300 rams authorised for sale for export in the first year of the relaxation, 222 were sold to various overseas countries. In the second year the number sold to overseas buyers was only 50. For growers there has been some uncertainty and considerable argument on the effects of the partial relaxation of the merino export embargo. There are some important issues which should be kept in mind in any examination of these arguments. Significantly there is the serious financial plight in which many and indeed most merino studs now find themselves. Ram sales have slipped alarmingly in the last 2 years and these sales constitute a major part of the income of these studs. it is important for the maintenance of the Australian wool industry that in particular the parent studs should not suffer such a contraction of income that they should move out of ram breeding altogether. Already most have been forced to diversify where this is possible. Indeed, it is claimed that through the application of the embargo on exports these studs have made a significant contribution to other sections of the wool industry in accepting that there should not be overseas competition for their rams. In the present economic circumstances of of the wool industry and of the ram breeders, it is important that no undue barrier be placed on providing some increased competition at auctions when because of slackness in demand so many of the rams have had to be sold for slaughter instead of breeding purposes. It is often forgotten that Australian merino breeders have been denied for many years the right to export their produce like most other Australians. This has deprived them of a useful source of additional income. Such income has never been needed more by our merino studs than it is today when the critical situation of the wool growing industry has drastically reduced the demand for their rams. The loss of this income plus the depressed wool prices have placed our studs in a very precarious position. It is not my intention to canvass arguments for and against the lifting of the merino export embargo. The arguments have been examined critically by the Australian Wool Industry Conference and it is on its advice that the Government is acting. Since the decisions in February 1970, delivery of the rams has been severely disrupted by the 'black ban* imposed by the Australian Council of Trade Unions on the handling of merino rams sold for export with a view to preventing their export from Australia. This 'black ban' is still maintained by the ACTU and has a demonstrable effect on the confidence with which overseas buyers have operated at auction sales. Indeed, the action of the ACTU has caused great difficulties, expense and inconvenience to both the buyers and sellers of the rams. They have been forced to resort to making private arrangements in order to export the rams and these have been very costly. No doubt the action taken by the ACTU has also discouraged overseas buyers from purchasing rams. man might be interested to know that while I was at a meeting of the Food and Agriculture Organisation I was told that a profit of several thousand per cent was made on the sale of a ram in South America, the ram having been purchased at a sale here, but because of the uncertainty of delivery the buyers were not prepared to operate in Sydney but they were prepared to operate in South America. Such advantage as stud merino breeders could derive under the present partial relaxation of the embargo is thus largely frustrated by the action of the ACTU. The intervention of the unions is all the more deplorable as the export of merino rams is",99,Merino Export Embargo
276,Mr Daly,Ho w does the Minister know?,100,Merino Export Embargo
277,Mr Sinclair,"The honourable gentlein no sense an industrial issue. This is clearly a case of the ACTU interfering for political reasons in a field which is outside its area of industrial responsibility. In doing so it has frustrated legitimate commercial transactions and interfered with Australia's meeting its obligation to overseas trading partners. I sincerely hope that the ACTU will now reconsider its position. I present tbe following paper: Merino Export Embargo-Ministeria l Statement, 9th December 1971. Motion (by Mr Fairbairn) proposed: That the House take note of the paper. Dr PATTERSON (Dawson) (9.6)1 cannot speak on behalf of the Australian Council of Trade Unions but I can assure the Minister for Primary Industry( Mr entirely a matter for the ACTU to make up Sinclair) that the Australian Labor Party has not in any way changed its opposition to the relaxation or the partial relaxation of the merino ram embargo. The views of the Opposition are exactly as they were before and they will stay that way until the Government presents evidence in this Parliament, allows it to be debated and a vote taken both in this House and in the Senate to support the relaxation of the ban. The last time that a vote was taken in the Parliament was in the Senate and the Senate rejected the Government's recommendations. As the Government was not bound by the decision of the Senate, its action being taken by regulation and not by an Act of Parliament or an amendment to an Act, the Government contemptuously ignored the decision of the Senate and despite repeated efforts by the Opposition the Government refused to have the matter debated and a vote taken. I would remind the Parliament that the Government is not consistent in this matter. We recall that when the reserve price scheme for wool was being mooted approximately 6 or 7 years ago-and this was a controversial issue just as the merino embargo is a controversial issue and it has been since 1929 --the Government did not act as it has now acted. It put this controversial issue to the wool growers of Australia to make a decision. The same preamble was applicable in that the Australian Wool Industry Conference had in fact recommended in favour of a reserve price scheme. I want to make it quite clear that the Opposition completely supports a reserve price scheme. A referendum was held but unfortunately, because of tremendous confusion throughout the industry, caused by intensive lobbying and misunderstanding, the wool growers voted against the scheme. This was, I believe, perhaps the biggest blow to the wool growers infinancialterms, in organisation, etc., for a very long time. But we cannot look back. We must look forward. If this Government is to be consistent over this controversial issue of the merino embargo it should allow a referendum to be held, but it has not allowed a referendum. The Opposition has not changed its view. As1 have already said, I am unable to speak on behalf of the ACTU. It is its own mind on this issue. However the ALP is still opposed to any relaxation of the embargo on the export of merino rams until, I repeat, there is a debate in this Parliament and until a vote is taken. In that debate the Government should put forward its evidence, scientific, economic and otherwise, to enable all members of this House to debate it, to weigh it up and to vote upon it. This, I believe, is only fair. It is of no use the Government saying the Opposition can raise it. We cannot raise it. We can raise it as a matter of urgency; we can raise it by way of a notice of motion. But as the Government well knows we cannot bring the matter to a vote unless the Government wants a vote on it. We know from experience that we have never been able to get a vote on matters of this kind. the statement if you wish. of having the vote on the statement. We want a full scale debate on the issue. We have been told tonight that we can have only a limited number of speakers in this debate. The fact is that if the Government had allowed a full scale debate on this matter we would have been ready for it, as is the Government. I am quite certain that there are no members on the Government side other than the Minister ready to debate this question at length tonight. Therefore until we can have a full scale debate and until the views of the large number of small producers throughout",100,Merino Export Embargo

The fact is-and I was present on that occasion-that the issue was debated by members on all sides of the House and there was complete agreement in the Parliament from the Liberal Party, the Country Party and the Labor Party, which was then in government. was unanimous that this ban should be imposed.

If we are not allowed tonight to debate this matter the will of the House, on the only occasion it was ever expressed, is being thwarted. This is the very important reason, Mr Deputy Speaker, why 1 have moved that the Standing Orders be suspended to enable this most important matter to be debated. It is all very well for the Minister for Primary Industry( Mr Sinclair) to rise in his place, make a series of misleading statethat the right of a worker in industry to ments and then have his lieutenant move the adjournment of the debate. Because of the vital interest of the Australian people in this matter, an opportunity should be given for the facts to be stated. The Minister will not deny that the Australian Wool Industry Conference does not speak for all Australian wool growers on (his matter. As the honourable member for Dawson (Dr Patterson) said there are many thousands of wool growers, many of them small growers, who are opposed to the relaxation of the ban. As further evidence that this matter should be debated now in the Parliament I report to you, Sir, that I have taken part in many public debates in the electorate of Eden-Monaro and in the adjoining electorate of Hume against advocates of the relaxation of the ban and never on even one occasion have those largely attended meetings of wool growers agreed that the ban should be relaxed. On the contrary, on most occasions the vote of the wool growers at these meetings against the relaxation of the ban has been overwhelming. Mr Deputy Speaker, it is for these reason* that it is most important that the mattei be debated. I want particularly to refer to the Minister's aspersion on the trade union movement of this country. remind the honourable member for Edenwill ask the honourable member to resume Monaro that the subject matter before the his seat.

Why is the honourable member for Hume, particularly, unwilling to allow a debate and a vote on a matter of vital importance to his electorate? Why cannot I put to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, the case that it is urgent that the House should be allowed to have a debate and a vote because, as the honourable member for Dawson (Dr Patterson) has pointed out, in the only vote ever taken in this Parliament under this Government a vote taken in the Senate -Order!

The honourable member for Eden-Monaro knows that the only matter before this House is the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders. The matter into which the honourable member is proceeding is the subject for a full debate and is not before the House. Speaker, I now see and fully understand your ruling. I should not canvass the merits of whether there should be a ban or a relaxation of the ban. I should and I will confine myself from now on to the question of whether this House should be enabled now to debate this issue and vote upon it. I rest my case upon the fact that this House has never been given an opportunity of casting a vote on a matter which is of vital importance to the whole of the Australian people and that the only vote ever taken on this subject in the Parliament would prevent the carrying on with this was taken in the Senate and it opposed the action which the Government is taking, indicating therefore that the action being taken by the Government may be in defiance of. the will of this Parliament and of the Australian people. That question can be resolved only by giving this Parliament now the opportunity to debate upon the issue. I will not discuss the merits of relaxing or retaining the ban except to say that all the arguments which have been produced on that matter in this House have never yet been would suggest that the honourable member the Riverina there are many great stud may not put forward arguments as to why breeders. They face the dilemma of this certain factors have not been given conParliament, and the dilemma can be sideration. putting forward one of those arguments. would suggest that the honourable member does not transgress either by reminding the House why he is not going to mention certain subjects at this present stage. informing the House that I am not going position of stud breeders. The Leader of the to mention subjects which are not relevant Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) many months to the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders. That is my only reason for mentioning this. remind the honourable member for Eden Monaro that he has been a member of this House for a long time and I also remind him that other members have been in this House for a reasonable amount of time and have learned some of the lessons of being a member of this House. 1 would suggest that the honourable member stays within the Standing Orders. very best to do that. 1 shall conclude by saying that, to my knowledge, none of the arguments which has been advanced against the ban has been in any way changed by the Minister's statement tonight and, therefore, it is the more important that this House should be given an opportunity now of debating and voting upon the issue when, I believe, such arguments would be produced and such a vote would be taken as iniquitous proposal. Deputy Speaker, I rise to second the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders and 1 shall speak to that motion now. I do not intend to canvass the question of whether the ban should be raised or retained. I think I can put my case rather well as more than 50 per cent of all merino studs in the nation are located in the Riverina and 1 want specifically to bring to the attention of the House the dilemma which this Parliament should resolve by agreeing to the suspension of Standing Orders and resolved only by the adoption of this motion to suspend Standing Orders to give matter thoroughly, adequately and in depth. 1 draw attention to one facet of this problem, apart from my own involvement in representing half of all of the merino studs in Australia and namely, to the importance of this motion of the suspen-",103,Merino Export Embargo

The very fine family of Kilien reiterate tonight is that the decision to has said that in no circumstances should rescind this ban which was imposed a this ban be lifted. On other occasions the generation ago was made administratively management of the Uardry stud, which is by the Government. It was rejected by one one of the most distinguished studs in the half of the sovereign Parliament of the nation and a very fine stud, said this ban nation. This half of the Parliament has not should be lifted. yet had an opportunity to debate it or to vote upon it. This is the essential issue as has been pointed out by the dishonourable member for Riverina accepted tinguished and honourable member for the interjection with great glee because by Eden-Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser) who, like replying to it he could transgress the myself, has a deep and vested interest in Standing Orders.

Let us forget all the parties, let us forget all the party politics speech and I have not said that. and let us forget all the normal confrontations in this Parliament. Let us just deal, for example, with the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders. what the honourable member for Riverina forgets as long as he remembers the Standing Orders. understand that the honourable member for Mallee will remind me of them. AllI wanted to say was this: We have a division of opinion in the nation on this question concerning the export of merino rams. We have a division of opinion in the Parliament. That division of opinion has already been enshrined in the resolution of the Senate-one-hal f of the sovereign Parliament of the nation of Australia. In our House we have not yet been able to reach a substantive decision. Of course, I realise that if honourable members opposite do not want to do anything about it, if they do not want to reach a substantive decision, if they want to hide for reasons best known lo themselves, they will not vote for this motion. But the motion before the Parliament is to suspend Standing Orders to enable all of us in this Parliament-whethe r we happen fo be temporarily the Minister for Primary Industry or temporarily the member for Hume or the member for Riverina. it does not really matter Riverina may be temporary. fallibility and exposure lo what might happen in the new year. I think that at this stage it is much more important that honourable members opposite should remember this than we on this side of the chamber. All1 want to say in summation is that here we are asking for one-half of the sovereign Parliament-the House of Representatives-to make a decision on this question concerning the export of merino rams. We have not yet been permitted to do so. We have not yet been permitted to debate the question. We have not yet been permitted to vole on it. This is what my distinguished friend the honourable member for Eden-Monaro says. He has not said that he is for or against the export of merino rams. He did not say that in his Which way would you vote? tolerance, Mr Deputy Speaker, on the eve of the Christmas break, but it is very nice to hear my friend the honourable member for Angas ask which way I would vote. May I say to the honourable member for Angas through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that if he finds his courage for once on behalf of the merino studs, as he did not find it on behalf of the wine grape growers, he can join us and 1 will tell him Mr Deputy Speaker, are protecting him and he needs protection. gest that interjections from my right should cease. It does not make it any easier for the Chair in trying to ask the honourable member for Riverina to stay within the Standing Orders to have interjections coming from the right hand side of the Chair, particularly when the interjections are enabling the honourable member for Riverina to come round on the outside of the Standing Orders. I suggest that the honourable member for Riverina might stay within the Standing Orders, and so might honourable members on my right. the eve of Christmas your erudition is commendable, and 1 bow to it. As a matter of fact, I accept the opportunity to return to the point at issue. May1 suminate. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro has moved that we should suspend Standing Orders to enable the House of Representatives-a t least one-half of the sovereign Parliament of Australia-to come to a resolution on a very important matter. This is the purpose in moving for the suspension of the Standing Orders.

330,Mr Swartz (Darling Downs,"Ministe rcalir) and the response which was made by the honourable member for Dawson (Dr Patterson). As has been requested by the 2 members of the Opposition who have spoken to this motion, we should then proceed to take the vote that they have sought on this matter. I suggest that, as soon as we clear the matter of the suspension of Standing Orders, we shouid proceed to the other matter immediately. uty Speaker, 1 join in the debate on the motion to suspend Standing Orders because the Leader of the House( Mr Swartz) ha> made one or two points concerning ministerial statements to which I wish to respond. It is not very often that I disagree honourable members on this side of the with the Leader of the Hou.e on these matters becatuc it is true that we do have discissions about statements that are to be made in the Houre. But it is also quite clear to ail honourable members that debates on ministerial statements that are made in i hi-; Hotre are not always confined merely to 2 speakers. There are many occasions when a full scale debate is arranged by agreement. I have no objection lo the Leader of the House being adamant about a debate being adjourned after a statement has been delivered and a reply has been made by one member from this side of the House. But the proposition that the Minister is now proposing is entirely different. The circumstances are completely changed The Minister for Primary Industry( Mr Sinclair) has suggested that there ought to be a vote on this issue. T thought that this was the attitude which had been expressed very clearly by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser). It certainly was clearly expressed by the honourable member for Riverina( Mr Grassby). What is the position with regard to a vote on an important issue such as this? I do not want to transgress the rules of the House. But the p'ain fact is that, as J understand the position, the Minister for Primary Industry challenged members of the Opposition (o a debate on this issue. If the circumstances are that the Minister has asked for a debate, has suggested that there ought to be a debate and has challenged members on this side of the House to a debate, the motion moved by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro to suspend the Standing Orders for this purpose is a legitimate request. I direct attention to those honourable members who sit in that corner of the Hoine and who claim to represent the wool growers of this country. They have made this claim despite the fact that they have failed in this respect. But they claim to rcpre.ent wool growers. Again1 know that I miaht be in difficulty if I refer to the crisis in the wool industry, but members of the Country Party cla m to represent those enyasjed in the wool industry. If one of their members, who is the Minister for Primary Indu-rry. has issued a challenge for a debate on this subject w'th House, this motion presents a clear opportunity for a debate to lake place. This issue is an important one. The question is whether this ban ought to be anplied or whether it ought to be lifted. The opinion of honourable members on this side of the House and. indeed. I think -he opinion of some members on the Government side of the House, if not the opinion of those members in the Country Party corner, is that this ban should not be lifted. 1 think tha* this is the general consensus among the wool growers themselves. The Standing Orders do not permit us to debate the issue. We are speaking to a motion for the suspension of the S anding Orders. But the Minister for Primary Industry has had the opportunity to make his statement. The Leader of the House has now sugges'ed that there ought to be a vote on the issue. If there is to be a vote on this important issue, quite clearly the substance of the argument advanced by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, very capably supporled by the honourable member for Riverina who did not transgress the Standing Orders in the debate but who put his case very clearly that there should b; a suspension of Standing Orders which would enable this matter to be debated fully, leads to the question: What has the Government to hide? Sitting on the front bench now is the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Industry( Mr Anthony). He is the former Minister for Primary Industry. 1 think that he was glad to hand the portfolio over to his successor.",107,Merino Export Embargo

Surely he has something to say on the question as to whether this ban ought to be lifted or whether the embargo ought to continue. The Minister for Primary Industry has made a statement in relation to this matter. ference. Certainly, there are differences The opportunity now exists for the Minister to accept our challenge. Tf he issued a challenge to honourable members on this side of the House, we now challenge the Government to allow a full scale debate on this matter. Therefore, I support (he motion for the suspension of Standing Orders. Here is a clear opportunity to undertake a debate in the way proposed. The Leader of the House has acquiesced to the extent that he is now prepared to allow before us is the motion for the suspension the House to vote on the issue. But surely it is not a proper procedure to allow the House to vote on a most important matter before that matter has been considered fully by honourable members who. wish to express their views one way or the other. In these circumstances, if the Leader of would hazard a guess that some honourthe House is prepared to allow a vote, I Biigeesi that he might be prepared to allow are debating.

While the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Barnard) was speaking, I presume to the motion for suspension of Standing Orders,, he suggested ihat I had challenged the shadow Minister for Primary Industry to a debate on the question. In essence what I said-in relation to the suspension of Standing Orders, let me assure you again-is that if we were going to debate the statement it would be necessary to debate the issues. I thought the honourable member for Dawson might well have talked about the issues instead of talking about the fact that he was being denied the right to vote. The point at issue us to discuss the whole of these ramificaat the moment is whether or not we should suspend Standing Orders in order to allow for those matters which the honourable member for Dawson suggested were necessary, a debate and a vote. A debate would originate around the statement made by me relating to a decision taken at the Australian Wool Industry Conference. That statement by me enabled the honourable member for Dawson, representing the Opposition, to make an exposition on what he felt were the issues relative to the statement. If we are going to suspend Standing Orders to allow this House to embark on another debate on the issue, we will be simply extending the debate which has already begun. We had been in the course of a debate on a motion which was previously moved but which the honourable member for Henty( Mr Fox) has suggested he ask leave to withdraw, when the honourable member for Eden-Monaro moved the suspension of Standing Orders. In other words, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro moved the suspension of Standing Orders to allow for a debate on the question of the relaxation of the embargo on the export of merino rams, the subject in relation to which I have just made a statement. 1 set out the decision made by the Australian Wool Industry Conference: I recited the history of the decision. I set down the very grievous circumstances besetting ram breeders in Australia, grievous circumstances which apparently have not been taken account of in the at'itude of members of the Opposition in this House. I set out a statement which was the beginning of the debate which the motion moved by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro suggests should be extended. Before this motion was moved we were in the process of debating the very issues on which the honourable member for Eden-Monaro wanted an extended debate. As I understood his remarks, the honourable member for Dawson felt it was necessary for there to be a debate oh these issues. Mr GrassbyI rise to order. I seek your guidance on this matter. As I understood it, when 1 seconded the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders to debate the whole of the ramifications of the merino ram embargo, I did this to enable tions. Under the Standing Orders, as I understand it, we are a? present discussing only part of this subject and I ask for a ruling from you on this matter. The Minister has said that we can extend the debate which is now in progress, not in relation to the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders but in relation to the previous motion that we take note of the statement. He said that we can extend that despite the limited objectives of the paper and the limited objectives of the Government's motion on this occasion. According to the Minister we can extend this as far as we like. I ask for your ruling. What the Government has done through the Minister for Primary Industry is to move a motion that would extend the existing ban and the debate under the Standing Orders should be related and in fact confined to that extension.",109,Merino Export Embargo

339,Mr Sinclair,"That is exactly what Ito the point of order raised by the honourable member for Riverina, what the Minister for Primary Industry has said is that prior to the moving of the suspension of Standing Orders there was a debate on the statement by the Minister for Primary Industry to which the honourable member for Dawson had made a speech in reply. That question was in the process of being put to the House when the honourable member for Eden-Monaro moved his motion for the suspension of Standing Orders, tbe reason being, I surmise, that the adjournment of the debate had been agreed to and the honourable member wished the debate to continue. In seconding the motion the honourable member for Riverina sought to bring the matter lo a vote and at the time he raised this point of order the Minister for Primary Industry was actually saying that it had been suggested by the Opposition that there should be a vote on this subject. That is the situaHouse is for the suspension of Standing tion at the moment. Dr PattersonI rise to order. I regret that I must disagree with your ruling. given a ruling. 1 have stated to the House what has happened in this debate. Dr PattersonI take a point of order. The only question before the Chair at the present time is the motion for suspension of Standing Orders which was moved by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro and seconded by the honourable member for Riverina. honourable member for Dawson will resume his seat. In regard to the point of order raised by the honourable member I would suggest that the House might listen to what is said by the Chair. A point of order was raised by the honourable member for Riverina and I was ruling on that at the time when I make the comment about what was happening in this House. If the honourable member for Dawson had been listening he would know that I said that the motion before the House was for the suspension of Standing Orders, moved by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro and seconded by the honourable member for Riverina. I said that the Minister in his reply was commenting on what had been said by the honourable member for Riverina in seconding the motion moved by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro that a vote should be taken in the House. Mr Grassby1 rise to order just to clarify the situation. 1 think we ought to understand what we are doing. gest that the honourable member state his point of order immediately. I want an interpretation of exactly what you have said. to the honourable member for Riverina that, a ruling on a point of order is not an interpretation of what has been said. I ask the honourable member for Riverina to resume his seal. Orders. I believe that the Opposition wants a vote on the suspension of Standing Orders and a vote on the motion that the House take note of the paper. Members of the Opposition could canvass, as I suggested to the honourable member for Dawson when he spoke, the whole range of issues so far as the export of merino rams was concerned. That, of course, was the purpose of the statement. Honourable members could move an amendment to the motion that the House take note of the paper if they wished. Honourable members opposite know their rights under the Standing Orders of this House and frequently exercise them, and in a debate on an amendment to the motion that the House take note of the statement they could, of course, canvass the whole range of issues relating to the export of merino rams. Mr GrassbyI rise to order. The Minister has just said that the purpose of the motion that the House take note of the paper is to bring this matter to a resolution. In your remarks, Sir, you said that the matter before the Parliament at the present time was a motion for the adjournment of the debate and that we could not make a decision at this time.

There is no substance in the point of order. the suspension of Standing Orders in order lo allow a debate on a motion relating, I presume, to the relaxation of the export of merino rams. I have suggested that it would be possible, the honourable member for Henty( Mr Fox) already having given an undertaking that he is prepared to withdraw his motion for the adjournment of the debate, that we can then have a vote on the motion to take note of the paper. That in fact is the area within which the honourable member for Dawson was able to canvass the full range of issues relating to the export of merino rams. He was able to canvass anything relating to the circumstances of the wool industry, the stud sheep breeders or anyone else affected. He was in no way inhibited in his remarks, and I believe for that reason there is no need to suspend the Standing Orders. Rather, we should get rid of this motion and then take a vote on the original motion that the House take note of the paper. Question put: That the inotion ( Mr Allan Frascr's) be agreed to.

House of the arrangements that have been made for Australian military training elements to assist with the training in Vietnam of Vietnamese and Cambodian armed forces personnel.

As explained by Ministers earlier in the session, these matters were to be discussed with the other governments concerned. The Army Assistance Group is a matter for Australia and the Republic of Vietnam; the proposals to train Cambodian troops in Vietnam involve the governments of Australia, the Khmer Republic, the Republic of Vietnam and the United States.

This group of instructors will ernment and they will work within the framework of the United States training which, as the Prime Minisler tralian Army Assistance Group, our particiThe Australian Government is firmly of the view that the Australian contribution of instructo; s. though small in number, to train Cambodians wiil provide worthwhile and much needed assistance to meet the critical training requirements of the Cambodian armed forces. Tbe requirements of the Cambodian armed forces for such assistance have long been recognised by the Australian Government, which, as announced earlier, is providing some training in Australia, and it can see added advantages in participating in a scheme for Cambodian training in Vietnam. Australia has been giving material assistance to Cambodia, decisions on which have been announced previously. In June 1.970 the Government made a special grant of $500,000 to Cambodia to purchase logistic and defence support items and to help with economic aid. In September of the same year the then Minister for Foreign Affairs announced an additional $900,000 for aid to Cambodia including economic and logistic support items and, if necessary, Vietnam. This was made clear in the statearms and ammunition. This programme of special aid to Cambodia has continued in 1971-72 when $ 1.35m has been provided including $200,000 for the training of Cambodian servicemen in Australia. The Government believes Australians admire the way in which Cambodians are defending themselves against invading forces of North Vietnam. The Cambodian armed forces are small and not highly trained, and the Cambodian people are accustomed to peace rather than to the need now imposed upon them to defend themselves against military attack by the North Vietnamese. The Australian Government is convinced that Australians will consider that the assignment of some Australian instructors to train Cambodians in Vietnam is a most suitable and practical way of supporting the country in concert with others who are concerned. As I have stated, the instructors will be assisting at training establishments maintained in Phuoc Tuy Province by the United States: there is no intention of sending Australian Service personnel to Cambodia. The Government's policy of not stationing Service personnel in Cambodia (other than the Service Attache at the Australian Embassy) is a long-standing one, and there will be no departure from this. I lay on the table of the House for the information of members 2 Memoranda of Understanding, the first covering the Australian Army Assistance Group in Vietnam, the second on Australian participation in the training of Cambodian military personnel in Vietnam. These documents, signed on behalf of the Governments concerned, set out the agreed arrangements concerning the matters I have just outlined. I present the following paper: Training of Vietnamese and Cambodians in Vietnam-Ministeria l Statement. 9th December 1971. and move: That the House take note of the paper. Minister for Defence( Mr Fairbairn) has announced the commitment of about 150 Australian soldiers to South Vietnam after the withdrawal of the Task Force. There is little new in the statement that an Army assistance group will be retrained in South on the future of Australian forces in Vietnam in this House on 18th August. Nor is there much novelty in the statement that this assistance group will contain a subgroup of 30 instructors to train Cambodians in South Vietnam. This stems from the extraordinarily ham-handed handling of negotiations with the United States Government before and during the Prime Minister's recent overseas trip. It was made clear to the Parliament that this request to train Cambodians had come from the United States Government. The Government went to remarkable lengths to disguise and rationalise this approach. Even staunch supporters of the Government such as the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Kilien) queried the Government's performance. This honourable gentleman has on the notice paper a motion in the following terms: That this House is of the opinion that, until such time as evidence of a request from the Cambodian Government to the Australian Government to provide instructors to train Cambodian troops in South Vietnam is tabled in this House, no Australian servicemen be ordered to instruct Cambodian servicemen in South Vietnam. If the memorandum on the Australian participation in the training of FANK personnel in Vietnam is intended to satisfy the demands of the honourable",115,Speaker Mr Whether Something Is To Be Granted By The
388,Mr Barnard (Bass) (10.43),The,117,Speaker Mr Whether Something Is To Be Granted By The
389,Ment By The Prime Minister ( Mr Mcmahon),"member for Moreton, then 1 suggest that H falls somewhat short of evidence of a request from the Cambodian Government. It is plain that this arrangement resulted from a direct approach by the United States Government to the Department of Defence, although all sorts of vague proclamations have been used -in retrospective justification. It is significant that New Zealand is not a signatory to the memorandum nor is there any indication that New Zealand is to participate in the scheme to train Cambodians in Vietnam. The Prime Minister at one stage committed New Zealand to this training scheme along with the United Slates and South Vietnam. This is an example of the sort of bungling and wrong information given by the Government on this extremely important policy issue. In the event the New Zealand Government has shown much more sense than this Government in getting out of Vietnam and staying out. The attitude of the Labor Party to these two announcements can be stated quite simply: We are opposed to the retention of an Australian assistance team in South Vietnam. We are opposed to the use of Australian servicemen to train Cambodians in South Vietnam. The Government supports the administration of General Lon Noi in Cambodia; the Opposition has very grave reservations about it. These are our attitudes and 1 do not want to elaborate them in any detail. ' The main dangers of commitments of this sort is that they can be so readily used as the springboard for a massive escalation. An American army of more than half a million flowed on directly from the commitment of a modest number of advisers. Australian advisers have been used in Vietnam for just over nine years. With the Task Force out, there will be very little check on where and how these advisers will operate. The Government is quite adamant that it will not commit Australian soldiers to Cambodia, but South Vietnamese units are in and out of Cambodia all the time. No one can say for certain that Australian advisers have not gone into Cambodia or into Laos in the operations earlier this year. These are the 2 dangers of maintaining such a presence; that it can be used as the basis for the re-commitment of Australian units, and it is not possible for proper supervision of their movements and activities. Having stressed the Labor Party's total . opposition to the 2 measures contained in the Minister's statement, 1 want to look at an important matter arising from the Government's policy of training South Vietnamese and Cambodian troops. This is the fate of the proposed jungle training school at Nui Dat. The Minister referred to the Nui Dat project in an oblique reference to the Jungle Warfare Training Centre at its new location in Van Kiep in Phuoc Tuy Province. When the proposal to establish the school was announced by the right honourable member for Higgins( Mr Gorton) in April last year, it was to be in quarters vacated by reduction of the task force from 3 to 2 battalions. In October last year, the former Minister for Defence, the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Malcolm Fraser) said that the school at Nui Dat would be training 400 to 500 junior leaders for the South Vietnamese forces by early 1971. On 30th March in this House, the Prime Minister had just completed its first school. A report appeared in the 'Australian' on 23rd April, by Barry Wain claiming that a total of $600,000 would be spent on building the permanent training school at Nui Dat. This would include 60 married quarters, 5 student company areas, lecture rooms, a 500-man. assembly hall and administration buildings, staff accommodation and mess halls. In his statement on 18th August, the Prime Minister said that the training school at Nui Dat would be retained if wanted and if satisfactory arrangements could be made. On 15th October the Minister announced in the baldest possible terms that the jungle training scheme would be moved to Van Kiep. It was reported in the 'Sydney Morning Herald' of 18th October that Nui Dat base including the training school was being destroyed by the South Vietnamese as the Task Force withdrew. This switch from Nui Dat to Van Kiep which is a major training camp conducted by the United States Army has never been explained in a satisfactory way. The Government intended to maintain a flag force at the traditional Task Force",117,Speaker Mr Whether Something Is To Be Granted By The
390,( Mr Mcmahon) Said The Nui Dat School,"quarters at Nui Dat. This was made quite clear in successive statements by Prime Ministers and Defence Ministers and in statements given to the Press. Now. Nui Dat has been scrapped completely and the jungle training school dismantled. The Government should outline why it was not possible lo maintain the school at Nui Dat and why the training school had to be swiftly shifted under the American umbrella. It should also outline to the House how much was invested in the jungle training camp at Nui Dat and how much of the capital investment and equipment was destroyed when the camp was moved. A figure of $600,000 was reported in the Press and not refuted by the Government. If a sum of this size has been written off in a futile venture of this sort, in South Vietnam, and while we welcome then it adds new dimensions to the folly of the Vietnam commitment. Another mysterious feature of this announcement is that no reference is made to the formation of the mobile army training teams which were to be formed for service in Vietnam as the Task Force withdrew. This was announced by the Former Prime Minister in his statement in April last year. According to the right honourable member for Higgins, these mobile teams would bear the brunt of Australian participation with 130 men formed into mobile training groups to liase with and train regional and popular forces in the field. The next reference I have been able to find to the mobile training team was in an article in the Melbourne 'Age' on 16th October last year when it was claimed that these 130 men would be divided into 15 mobile training teams. There has been no further mention by either Government or Press of these 15 'phantom' mobile training teams. In a total commitment of 150 men with 30 earmarked for training Cambodians, a team at Van Kiep, a cadre providing advisory and training assistance to territorial forces and a number of engineers, it is not possible to get 130 men organised into 15 mobile training teams. These are samples of the way in which this Parliament has been misleading repeatedly about the Government's actions in Vietnam. The history of the jungle training school and the disappearance of me mobile training teams are important matters which the Government is obliged to explain to the Parliament. The Government is practising an act of deception on itself if it believes that these important policy reversals can be allowed to pass without Parliamentary scrutiny. In summing up, I repeat again the Labor Party's complete opposition to any further military participation of any sort in the Indo China wars. The last vestiges of military assistance will be ended immediately by a future Labor Government. But on this issue and on this note may i indicate at once that while we have consistently stated our opposition in this Parliament to the Government's decision to have Australian training teams located in South Vietnam for the purpose of training Cambodians, just as we opposed Australian intervention the Government's belated decision to withdraw Australian forces before the end of this year, we do not believe that this should be the end of Australia's responsibility in Vietnam. 1 am now speaking of the period after the inevitable political settlement, which is the only way in which tbe war in Vietnam can be completed satisfactorily. The Minister and the Government must be fully aware of this. This Government and any Australian government-n o doubt the next government will be a Labor Government-wil l have the continuing responsibility of providing the kind of assistance that will mean something to the people in the devastated areas not only of South Vietnam but also North Vietnam. It is a great pity that, in these ministerial statcmcn s which, of necessity, may be confined to one aspect of Government policy, there is too much emphasis on the Government's attitude in respect of what it will do in relation to its commitments in Vietnam and too little emphasis on the attitude that one would expect the Government lo adopt as a humane approach to the problems of the people of South Vietnam. Irrespective of what attitude it may adopt, if the Government is to be congratulated on any approach it has made in South Vietnam in the past, it should be on the basis of the assistance which it has provided which, J believe, will leave a lasting impression on the people of that country. This is an impression which has been created us a result of the attitude of those who have been in a position to provide projects of a worthwhile nature to the people of South Vietnam. In this way I believe that Australians in South Vietnam-quit e apart from their general conduct as soldiers, to which I have referred on many occasions-hav e made worthwhile contributions. I have inken the opportunity to state in this House tonight the Opposition's continued objection to the Government's decision to leave troops in South Vietnam, whether for training purposes or as advisers. We believe that the Government is wrong in this decision. It should adopt the attitude that New Zealand has adopted and which I mentioned earlier. New Zealand has decided that it will no longer retain troops in South Vietnam. It has made a clear decision in this respect and we believe that Australia should have adopted this same attitude. This Government now is prepared to maintain 130 advisers in South Vietnam to train Cambodian and South Vietnamese troops. I do not want to repeat what I have said on other occasions, but this is the way in which a country can become involved in a conflict that is of no concern to it. I conclude by saying that while I have slated the Opposition's objections, I reiteraction. While we have any troups in the ate that there will be a responsibility on any Australian Government to ensure that whatever assistance is required in the rehabilitation of the people of South Vietnam and of North Vietnam when a peaceful settlement to this problem has been foundI hope this will not be in the too distant future-it will be provided. The Australian Government should recognise that, because of the way in which it has been involved as a result of its commitment in that country, it should accept responsibility foT the great task of rehabiliforum. By failing to use the diplomatic tation. like to emphasise the points that my friend, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Barnard) has placed before the House. As I see it, an important principle is involved. It is not just the question that a small number of Australian soldiers are to be left in South Vietnam. Australian soldiers are not for lease, loan or sale. Australian soldiers are not available to carry out other people's diplomatic or political tasks. That is the principle that is before the House and that is the one which the Government fails to acknowledge. I believe that there is great dissatisfaction in Australia at the continuing location of Australian troops in this area. This has been a long and traumatic experience for the whole nation and one in which the Labor Party was involved right from the beginning in resisting the presence of Australian troops in South Vietnam. The Government has reluctantly at last come to the right decision to withdraw Australian troops from Vietnam but we thought it would be a complete withdrawal from the area. However, that is not to be the case. It may be said that the people of Cambodia are entitled to the kind of support that the Government's decision would give them. I believe they are entitled to support as a people. Like my colleague, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, 1 have serious doubts about the Government and I will say a few words about that in a moment. But the facts are that it is only in the diplomatic field that 1 believe that Australia can effect useful results in this area. I believe that from the very beginning we prejudiced our strongest position in this matter by committing ourselves to military area, nobody will listen to us as a neutral, impartial and objective country. It will only be by our appearing to be neutral, impartial and objective and on the side of humanity that we will mobilise world public opinion on behalf of the Khmer people. With the accession of the People's Republic of China to the United Nations, there is a totally different diplomatic scenario. All of the people and all the forces involved are available to discuss the situation around the tabic in the international initiative, I think we are abdicating our responsibilities to the Australian public. I have a deep feeling for the people of the Khmer Republic-the Cambodian people. They are being overrun in somebody else's war. and therefore the Opposition resents the continuing commitment of Australian troops to this area. We believe that it removes us from the possibility of effective diplomatic initiative. On the other hand, I think we. should be doing something to relieve the physical suffering of the",118,Speaker Mr Whether Something Is To Be Granted By The
391,Mr Bryant (Wills) (10.57),"1 shouldpeople in that area. We should be doing more in this regard. I know from my visit last year that the people were suffering severely, the hospitals were overcrowded, there was a shortage of beds, materials and doctors and hundreds of civilians were accommodated on the floors of the hospitals. We are doing very little about this sitbecome the responsibility of the world uation in Cambodia. 1 personally hold the view that people have the right to defend themselves, and this was the reason for the position which I took last year and which in general I still sustain. But I believe it is colleague the Deputy Leader of the Oppolittle enough that the people will be able to achieve. By some means or other we have to entice the Vietnamese people, the North Vietnamese and the South Vietnamese and the governments of both countries, to leave Laos and Cambodia, and this will happen only as a result of extraordinary pressure being exerted by the people who support either side. We should be trying to get the South Vietnamese to the conference table. We should be trying to get the Russians to exert what influence they can. We should be trying to get other countries, such as Canada, to influence the Chinese to influence the North Vietnamese, and that is the only answer. 1 just want to place on record my disapwhile I am in this place I will sustain that pointment at the collapse of parliamentary view. democracy-wha t there was of it, although it had the basis of a democratic system-in Cambodia. This Government ought to be bility. Honourable members opposite canattempting to convince the Lon Nol Govnot abdicate their responsibilities by leavernment that it must revert to the demoing matters to the Ministers. They have cratic procedures which were part of the very definite personal responsibilities to the Cambodian situation. My friend the honpeople whom they represent, and they ourable member for Bendigo( Mr have definite personal reponsibilities Kennedy) who visited Cambodia earlier because they are a part of the Australian this year has reported to me that the community. The continual silence on issues people at that time were becoming deeply such as this, when ministerial statements concerned about the situation in Camboare made, I believe, is an abdication of our dia. 1 believe that we have a role to play parliamentary responsibility. SoI want to in this part of the world that has nothing place on record my disapproval of the whatsoever to do with a military commitprocedure. I support the view of the Ausment. It is with deep despondency that we tralian Labor Party, that this is a dangernote the Thai situation and the collapse of ous and unacceptable precedent which we the parliamentary system in Thailand, are following in the training of Cambodian meagre as it was. This Government has troops. I only hope that no Australian life been silent about this question. I believe is sacrificed thereby. It is again one of the that we should exert all possible pressure issues before the public that Australian soland influence on the Thai Government in diers are not for sale, lease or loan, and order to restore the meagre parliamentary we cannot commit people to war without system which existed in that country. In losing lives. In this instance not one drop this instance I suppose our Vietnam comof Australian blood should be shed. mitment is a symbol of our inadequacy and our false approach. We have always gone for the military commitment when in fact the best that Australia could do would be to help the people themselves. This goes for the people of Pakistan and the suffering refugees who, more than ever, will community. Earlier tonight I perhaps put the Minister for Defence( Mr Fairbairn) and my sition ( Mr Barnard) in an embarrassing position in this discussion. I believe that it is bad parliamentary practice to produce in this House an important document on defence or anything else that has to do with our associations and international commitments in this part of the world in such a way that it cannot be adequately discussed. One of the weaknesses which have appeared in the last few years has been the inadequate time allowed for the discussion of public affairs. Discussion of foreign affairs and defence matters has been most inadequately treated. That was one of the reasons why I put on what might be termed a demonstration in this chamber a little while ago, and I can give honourable members the assurance that None of us can abdicate his responsiHaving listened with some interest to the \ speeches which have been made from the Opposition benches I cannot restrain myself in silence. Only3 weeks ago 1 was in Saigon and Phnom Penh, and I must say something from personal observation. Let us have a look for a moment at the history of this Khmer Republic. The Khmer people once had an empire ruled from Angkor-Wat which spread throughout the Indo-China peninsula. It has now been constricted into the small country that we call Cambodia. The Thais ate into it in the west and the Vietnamese coming down from the north ate more and more into it along the coastal rivers. So, compressed into the little State where it now is, it was finally brought up against its own Munich, as it were. The North Vietnamese entered into it through the collaboration of Sihanouk and took over large areas of the country adjourning South Vietnam for the purpose of prosecuting the war in South Vietnam. Sihanouk collaborated with the North Vietnamese. These people who once had a large empire spreading throughout lndo-China were then forced to decide whether they would see their whole country gobbled up by their traditional enemies or whether they would stand and fight at the last ditch, and this is what hapwho knew the situation, and what was the pened in the Khmer Republic. The people decided to stand and fight at the last ditch. They had met their Munich. So it was that a soldier and a patriot in Lon Nol decided that they had reached this situation. I had the privilege of meeting Lon Nol, and anybody who has met him-and I think that the honourable member for Wills( Mr Bryant) has met him-wil l know that he is a man who lives in a modest little house. It is no palace. He is not a corrupt man; he is a patriot. He is trying, sick man as he is, to preserve what is left of what was once a great empire. These are the facts. I am told, and believe, that 90 per cent of the people in Cambodia own their own little plot of land. Communism has nothing to offer to them. Now we, miserable creatures that we are, say: 'No, we will give them no assistance whatever. It might mean the shedding of Australian blood'. The only assistance that we are giving is a small cadre of men, professional soldiers who like that profession, who are giving some training in Vietnam to selected Cambodians. We say: 'No, we should have nothing to do with them'. Are we providing them with any equipment? I saw there boys, who I would say were 15 years of age, in a platoon who had been enlisted to fight against their hereditary enemies, the North Vietnamese who are spreading their empire throughout lndoChina. I feel ashamed to think that Australians would say: 'We must extend no help to these people in these circumstances'. Mr BryantI did not say that. ourable member is saying. He is saying that not a drop of Australian blood should be shed. He is saying: 'We will have no training team in South Vietnam. We will give no help to these people. We will give no equipment. Not a drop of Australian blood will be shed. We will wash our hands of it'. This is what the honourable member for Wills said. He also referred to the Thais. May I say a word about them? He regretted the perishing of Thai democracy. I do not know whether there ever was Thai democracy. All countries have democracy. Forms of government go by many names. But it happened that I was also in Bangkok and I spoke with people situation? The honourable member for Wills says that the Government has not told him what the situation is. Well, I will tell him. What happened was that the members of the Thai Parliament wanted to lay their bands on a very substantial sum of money-wha t 1 think would be called in America a pork barrel-and to spend that money in the electorates in order to win their seats at the forthcoming elections. The terrible General Kittikachorn said: 'We will not put up with millions being spent in the pork barrel to enable members to get back in their seats'. These are the plain and simple facts about the perishing of democracy in Thailand, which the honourable member for Wills regrets. I do not want to say any more about the Thais. I have said a little about the Cambodians. I have a high regard for those people. 1 see them fighting for their very survival. I see poor, miserable wretches saying: 'We would not extend a single hand to help them, not even to",120,Speaker Mr Whether Something Is To Be Granted By The

Customs Tariff Validation Bill (No. 2) 1971 OF TELEVISION DEVELOPMENT Ministerial Statement Sir AL AN HULME (Petrie-Postmaster General)-by leaveMr Speaker, in May 1969, I announced the Government's plans for the seventh stage of television development, involving tbe establishment of 38 low-power stations at relatively remote centres throughout the Commonwealth, at a cost of almost $5m. It was generally accepted that the stations would be provided by mid-1973 although it was realised at the time that, in view of the .great amount of work involved, this goal might be difficult of achievement. As honourable members may recall, the stations were to be established on the basis that programmes would be provided by stations utilising, wherever practicable, Post Office broad-band communications systems, either existing or proposed, and that where such links were not available, special minimumtype micro-wave links would be specially provided to carry programmes to the areas concerned. It will be appreciated that the task of establishing the 38 stations concerned in widely separated areas throughout the Commonwealth is one of considerable magnitude, involving not only the planning and establishment of the television stations themselves, but the construction of the various programme relay links required over long distances. In fact, this project virtually doubles the number of stations in the national network bringing the total to 82. The project has involved the carrying out of extensive engineering surveys by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board in conjunction with my Department in each of the 38 areas concerned, in order to obtain the basic information for determining technical operating conditions. In addition, it has been necessary for my Department to conduct detailed field surveys along the lengthy routes over which the micro-wave links are to be established. It has, however, already been possible to bring 5 of the 38 stations into operation, namely those at Cloncurry, Julia Creek, Richmond and Hughenden in Queensland, and Norseman in Western Australia. The Mary Kathleen station will commence service shortly. The earlier establishment of these stations was made possible by the fact that these centres were situated along existing Post Office communication links with television programme relay capabilities. The present position with regard to the remaining 33 stations is that most of the technical specifications for the stations have now been determined by the Board and action is being taken by the Post Office towards obtaining the equipment for the establishment of the stations and associated micro-wave links. It must be pointed out, however, that some of the specialised equipment required for the project must be obtained from overseas. Due to the complexity and great extent of the work involved, together with shortages of key staff, it became apparent earlier this year that the project could not possibly be completed by mid-1973 and that unless special procedures were adopted, a delay of some 2 years on the originally expected completion date for the project might be involved. Accordingly, I directed my Department which, as I have indicated, is responsible for the actual establishment of the stations following receipt of the technical specifications from the Board, to examine the possibilities of reducing any delays to the minimum practicable. The Post Office has now completed its studies and I have received from the Australian Broadcasting Control Board a revised timetable showing the dates by which the various stations are expected to be completed. I seek leave to incorporate the detailed schedule in Hansard. i\Ir SPEAKER-I s leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted.

404,.. October 1973 Mr Collard (Kalgoorlie) (11.25),"IAustralia and, more particularly, to my elecselves no closer to a service today than torate of Kalgoorlie. I do not consider some of the Western Australian areas in the programme to be relatively remote and this is one of the reasons why I am critical of the delay that is being experienced in the provision of a television service in those areas. I must express my disappointment and concern that, with the exception of Carnarvon, the Western Australian stations in the seventh stage will not come into operbroad band equipment from overseas. This ation until June 1973 in the case of the first delay is claimed to be 2 years. While the station lo be completed and until July 1974 in the case of the last station to be completed, that is, at Esperance. The Postmaster-General has informed the House that in regard to Esperance it has been found necessary' to provide a special trunk line and television relay system which has meant a delay well beyond the date first expected. The people at Esperance have become completely confused about what are the real causes of the delays and how far the delays will eventually extend. A public meeting in Esperance in February 1969, if my memory serves me correctly, was told by representatives of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board that a service should be available during 1972. Since that meeting many representations and inquiries have been made to both the Postmaster General and the Control Board in an effort to obtain a firm completion date. The early answers we received soon made it quite clear that the date given in the first instance as a probability was in fact never even a possibility and should never have been suggested as such. It was quite unfair and rather cruel to build up the hopes of the people in that way on something which could not be achieved in the time and which, it would now appear, was never intended to be achieved in the time. Subsequently, further inquiries were made and 1973 was given as the year in which the station could be expected to commence operations. Then at about the middle of this year we were told that it was unlikely that a service would be available before early 1974. Now we are told by the Postmaster-General that the target date is to be July 1974, almost 3 years away. Is it any wonder that the people of Esperance are expressing concern and resentment at the continual extension of the completion date? It is no wonder that they see themthey were led to believe they were over 2 years ago. 1 am far from satisfied that the station will be on the air by July 1974. J hope 1 am wrong. I am not satisfied because I have been told by both the Postmaster General and the Control Board that the main delay in the establishment of this station results from the delay in obtaining delay in the construction is blamed on the 2 year lag between ordering and delivery of equipment, the fact is that the equipment has not yet been ordered and, according to the information I have received, an order will not be placed until early next year at the very best. I have been informed also that there is a 1-year delay in the importation of television station equipment which in turn, I understand, cannot be ordered until it is quite certain what is actually required following the establishment or receipt of the special trunk line or broad band equipment. If this is correct, and 1 have no reason to believe it is not, we have the following situation in relation to Esperance: If the broad band equipment is not ordered until early next year, say March, then delivery cannot be expected until at least March 1974. The distance between the existing microwave Jink at Norseman and the station site at Esperance is approximately 120 miles, and therefore quite a bit of work will be entailed in covering that distance with the building of towers or the laying of cables as required. From what I have noted in relation to other extensions it will take much longer than 3 months to carry out that work. Therefore, because of the continual changes in estimating the completion date and the advice in relation to delays in delivery of equipment, and the fact that that equipment will not be ordered before early next year, I still remain to be convinced that the date given by the Postmaster-General tonight will be met. With regard to the line to which the Minister referred as necessary to serve Esperence, I had hoped he would have given us something definite in regard to what is intended towards providing a television service to those centres along the line between Norseman and Esperance; places such as Salmon Gums and Grass Patch. I had hoped to hear whether the line could or would carry the facilities or equipment required whereby the centres referred to could be connected directly to the line or whereby a separate service could be provided. The station at Esperance will, I understand, be of very low power sufficient only to serve the town area. If this is so, it is a great pity and something needs to be done immediately in the planning stage at least to ensure that outlying areas will not suffer the same delays and frustrations as experienced at Esperance itself. I notice in the statement that Mingenew will not gain a service before May 1974. This seems to be rather ridiculous, as I see it, because Mingenew is situated right alongside the coaxial cable carrying television to Geraldton which has been in operation now for several months. Surely there can be no good reason why a service cannot be established reasonably quickly. We were told 3 or 4 years ago that places like Mingenew, Mullewa and Morawa would have to wait until an experience was gained as to the extent of the signal from the Geraldton station. This was fair enough, but surely it does not take 5 years to gain that experience. If the Postmaster-General, the Australian Broadcasting Control Board or the Government-whicheve r is responsible-reall y wished to establish these stations as quickly as practicable, as the Postmaster-General has told us, they could have done so in a much shorter time than the statement proposes. Wc were told that Morawa, which is approximately 35 miles from Mingenew, would have to await the experience of the Mingenew service in relation to radius. Does this mean that Morawa will have to wait at least 3 or 4 years beyond the middle of 1974? That certainly seems to be the pattern which the Government is following. We were told a booster station would be provided for Mullewa as soon as the Geraldton area of service was known, and yet the Postmaster-General makes no mention of Mullewa at all. Does this mean that Mullewa is to be disregarded until until a person has a television service he after 1974? These delays are just not good enough. In formation contained in some of them. addition, insufficient information is given to Because of this, even' possible action should us in relation to the real causes of the delay. be taken to extend the service as quickly I notice that the Moora and Carnamah services are also in the 1974 period and yet they, as with Mingenew, are situated close by the coaxial cable. Three Springs, which is also on the cable route, will be a 1974 model. I would like to know whether this delay is also due to the delay in delivery following the ordering of equipment. Is that the reason? If so, it would be interesting to know whether, as with Esperance, the necessary equipment has not yet been ordered. Dampier and Port Hedland are not to be served before the middle of 1973, and most likely the end of 1973. I understand that the coaxial cable is all right, and if this is correct, why must there be a 2-year delay in establishing the stations? Is it again because the equipment has not been ordered? If this is so, we are entitled to know why it has not been ordered. I note also that the Southern CrossBullfinch station completion target is not until June 1973. Because that centre is right on the link between Perth and Kalgoorlie it seems quite unreasonable that whatever is required to connect Southern Cross cannot be quickly carried out. Kollyanobbing, an iron ore town some 30 miles from Southern Cross, can apparently, on the information ( have received from the Postmaster-General, forget all about television unless its population, presently about 350, is substantially increased. It is only 30 miles from where a station will be set up, but there is no chance of a service in the foreseeable future under the approach of the present Government. According to what the Postmaster-General told me just recently, no plans, no surveys and no investigations have been made beyond this seventh stage programme, so therefore it is pretty clear that any area which will not be served by this seventh stage can forget its chances for several years to come, and at least until the very late 1970s. Naturally enough, I am delighted that such centres as Kalgoorlie, Kambalda, Norseman and Geraldton now have a station, and that Carnarvon will be serviced by the middle of next year. I know from my own experience that does not realise what he is missing in relation to the several programmes and the inand as widely as possible. I notice that the Postmaster-General does say that he has asked his Department to remain alert to any possibilities of advancing the completion dates of these other stations, and I sincerely ourable member for Oxley( Mr Hayden) hope that this can be attained and that in fact the dates will be advanced very considerably. As I sec it, they should have been and would have been advanced had not it been for the fact that in February this year the Government instructed all departments substantially to reduce their expenditure. 1 believe this was the real cause of the delay and the real reason why orders were not placed. In conclusion, I take the opportunity of pointing out to the Minister that the service which Merredin people receive from Mawson is far from satisfactory resulting, I believe, from a weak signal. T hope that the Postmaster-General will take up this matter in the appropriate quarter to try to bring about a very quick improvement. It may be that the signal from Mawson could be strengthened, but this would perhaps only improve the picture at Merredin and do nothing to ex'end a satisfactory service east and north of Merredin. Therefore, as Southern Cross is to have a station at some time in 1973, if I remember correctly, and as it is 70 miles from Merredin it could well mean that the area between a few miles west of Southern Cross and a few miles east of Merredin would be no man's land. If this is so, then the proper thing to do would be to establish a station at or near Merredin. As I have just said, I hope the Postmaster-General will take some heed of wha I have said in this ! respect and that in addition he will let me know as early as possible what is intended so that I can pass on the information to those people who at present are ruining their eyes trying to look at a picture on a snowedup screen. Dr PATTERSON (Dawson) (11.38)I do not think that anybody will argue with the tremendous benefits which have accrued to those fortunate areas in the country with the advent of television. I can only endorse the remarks made by the when the latest settlement in the Goonyella honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr area can expect to get a booster station or Collard) and try to emphasise to the Posttranslator service. There is a town growing master-General( Sir Alan Hulme) that the rapidly there. I believe that there is a need various problems associated with delays to give television to the people in these should be solved because there are still areas as quickly as possible. I would like many areas in Australia that deserve, qualto ask the Postmaster-General about the ify for and should get television as soon as standard of television services in the possible. In regard to the 38 stations of which the Postmaster-General has given details tonight, 23 of them are in Queensland. I am sure that my colleague the honwould agree that that is a very good proportion. On the other hand there is a great need for television in the areas of Western Australia to which the honourable member for Kalgoorlie referred. While I am on my feet I would like to pay a tribute to the work force of engineers and other staff of the Postmaster-General's Department who have worked continuously, one might say, over the years on the installation of television stations in the remote areas of Australia. These men are a dedicated band. I have met many of them in the north. I think they deserve commendation. I know that these men, particularly the engineers working in remote areas, are often frustrated by the lack of services and the delays in providing equipment from overseas. It is not the work force that is the problem, but the delays in providing equipment. Let me refer to the target completion dates mentioned by the Postmaster-General. 1 assume that the list of television facilities he mentioned is not the complete list. 1 want to refer specifically to Queensland and to those areas in central Queensland that J would call the missing link. AH of the areas mentioned by the Postmaster General follow railway lines, such as the Townsville-Mount Isa line, the Toowoomba-Charleville-Cunnamulla line with links to Goondiwindi, Dirranhandi and St George, and the Rockhampton-Longreach line. I want to refer to the area north of Clermont, which is one of the stations mentioned. The area between Clermont and Charters Towers is what one might call a missing link. A lot of people-smal l cattle producers, big cattle producers and coal miners-liv e in this area. It is an area which is growing with tremendous rapidity. I want lo ask the Postmaster-General remote areas. As h* well knows, many of provided. I give the Minister credit for the existing stations are not satisfactory. having given us this information as early There are still bugs in them. 1 hope that as it was possible for him to do so, under some consideration will be given to ironing the pressure that was put on him for the out these bugs. The Postmaster-General will recall that on several occasions I have written to him I have heard very little credit given to the about the Proserpine area. There seems to Government for the fact that these 38 be some technical problem in that area stations are to be provided. As the Minister which is causing very poor reception. 1 said, this virtually doubles the number of think that the Australian Broadcasting stations in the national network, bringing Control Board carried out a survey there the total to 82. It is a very big step forward. approximately 12 months ago to try to I appreciate very much, and I am sure that iron out the technicalities that were causthose people who have been advocating thus ing the rather poor reception, particularly in have appreciated the fact that these places like Shute Harbour, Airlie Beach, stations are to be provided in those areas Bloomsbury and Proserpine. The question where lelevision is very sorely needed, and is one not only of continuous construction where this benefit will be of much more to provide these facilities for people in the importance than it is in areas which are remoter areas of Australia but also of provided with a number of channels and improving the existing facilities. I hope which have alternative means of entertainthat consideration is given in the works ment and education. I will continue to ask programme to some , of these missing links the Postmaster-General to expedite this and particularly lo the area, between Clerprogramme.

One of the reasons why this is important and why we appreciate it is that there are The need for television is very great. I",125,Seventh Stage Television Development Programme
405,Mr Corbett (Maranoa) (11.44),"Ifact that the Postmaster-General has taken this step to promote this programme and to do all in his power and that of the Government to bring it to a conclusion and to provide these stations. In my area there has been agitation for a high-power station at Roma. Quite a number of representations have been made to the Minister along these lines. But the argument has been the cost related to the number of people that would be served. These 38 low-power stations are to be provided at a cost of some S5m. The cost per person has been pointed out by the Postmaster-General to be relatively high in comparison with the cost of providing television in the more closely settled areas and in the provincial and capital cities of the Commonwealth. At the same time. I believe that there is a responsibility which the Government and the Postmaster-General have accepted, to carry that cost and to bring television to all towns of reasonable size right throughout this country. This is a very big step forward. The thing that was worrying us was the amount of delay that could occur. I think it can be understood that because of the difficulty of surveying and the amount of time that was taken a delay would have been possible, and that with the manpower problems that have been met with it would be quite understandable that a programme could get a bit behind. Those of us concerned with this matter have been striving very hard to get a programme completion date. Once again 1 express my appreciation for the fact that a target completion date has now been provided, and we will look forward to seeing that that target completion date is met if possible. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie suggested that he had some doubts about whether this would be met. I think all the Postmaster General can do in this direction is set a programme and endeavour to do the best he can to expedite it. It is true that the honourable member for Dawson and I mentioned places that do not have television reception, but we know that the percentage of people who are being served by television Commonwealth-wide is very high. I welcome the statement by the Postmaster-General. I am sure it will be welcomed by all those people who will benefit, and I hope that we will see a further programme on the completion of this one to provide those services which are not included in this programme. I congratulate the Postmaster-General and the Government on the steps that they have made, and 1 trust that the programme completion date set out by the Postmaster-General now will be achieved. wish to keep the House for very long, but as the 2 stations that are proposed to be erected in South Australia are both in my electorate there are a few words 1 would like to say. Unfortunately, when the Postmaster-General( Sir Alan Hulme) made a statement about the Ceduna area in 1969 the statement was in some way distorted and the people in the area were informed by the local Press that they were getting a powerful station which was to serve a pretty wide radius. Of course this was not the effect of the statement at all. A lot of people bought television sets because they expected that in the near future they would have a strong television station. Of course that was not so. Since that statement. I have asked the Postmaster-General on a number of occasions when we can expect the station to come into operation. It is good to know that at least a completion date has been set which the people in this area can be told. When it was discovered that the announcement by the Postmaster-General, to the effect that there was to be a large station in this area, was not correct, there was extreme disappointment. It is still a very hot question in this area and it is one on which I receive numerous letters. Everytime I visited the area I am approached by various people to see what can be done about it. A reply I received about providing a larger station in this area to cover a wider radius indicated that there were no suitable topographical features from which a high power station could operate. People at places such as Elleston. Streaky Bay and towns on the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia will still be without television. If this programme finishes in 1974 it will probably be 1976 or 1977 before those people can hope to get television in this area. Although it has been stated that the stations at Ceduna and Woomera will be in operation in October 1973, some further thinking and planning should be done on the pretty vast areas on the Eyre Peninsula",129,Seventh Stage Television Development Programme

WORK BOOKS Ministerial Statement toms and Excise)-by leave-Honourabl e members will recall that in reply to a recent question in the Parliament I indicated that in accordance with a decision of the Customs Co-operation Council in Brussels as to the appropriate tariff classification of certhe taking of lengthy submissions and evitain work books the Department of .Customs and Excise was obliged to classify these books in a category that carried 574 per cent duty. At the same time. I said I would fake up the question of the level of duties appropriate to such books with my colleague the Minister for Trade and Industry( Mr Government should reconsider the means Anthony). He has agreed with me that such a rate of duty is inappropriate to books that are, in effect, extensions of conventional text books-a t least until the Tariff Board has presented its report on printed books and other products of the printing industry and the Government has had an opportunity to examine the whole question in depth. We are agreed it will be appropriate that 1 use the reserve powers of the Customs Tariff and make such work books a substitute for ordinary text books and thus free of import duty. They will qualify for bounty if printed in Australia subject to the usual conditions governing the grant of bounty. I have today signed a substitute notice to this effect. Motion (by Mr Swartz) proposed: That the House lake note of the paper. Debate (on adjourned. Ministerial Statement Interior)-by leave I would like to draw honourable members' attention to the report tabled recently by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works dealing with the proposed construction of She central zone sewerage scheme at Darwin, Northern Territory. Honourable members will recall that the proposal was examined and endorsed by the Committee in mid 1969. Subsequently there was particularly strong public criticism of the scheme and I felt it would be helpful for the people concerned to be given a further opportunity of putting forward their views and being questioned by members of this Parliament. The Parliament decided on 25th August, 1971 to refer the proposal back to the Committee for further investigation and report. After extensive inquiries involving dence from government officers and private organisation and individuals, the Committee has concluded that it is not expedient to proceed with the proposal as submitted and has recommended to Parliament accordingly, with the further recommendation that the of treating and disposing of sewage from the central zone. Several possible alternatives were suggested as warranting consideration. In accordance with the Committee's recommendation that alternative schemes be looked at the Department of Works is now proceeding with further investigation. When these are completed the Government will again refer the matter io the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for investigation and report. Present indications are that this will be proposed during the 1972 autumn session of Parliament. Dr PATTERSON (Dawson)-by leaveThis project has been one which 1 suppose can best be described as a most tin fortunate one. It has a relatively long history. motion by Mr Daly) As the Minister for the Interior( Mr Hunt) has stated, after the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works had made the decision to accept the proposal put forward to it originally there was in effect some strong criticism by people living in Darwin.

Subsequently,",130,Seventh Stage Television Development Programme

408,Mr Hunt (Gwydir,"Minister for theas we know, as the Minister said, the matter was referred to in the Parliament, it was sent back to the Committee and the Committee after lengthy evidence rejected the proposal. It is obvious that something has to be done. It is essential to provide a plant which will satisfactorily treat and dispose of the sewage from the central zone. This is of the utmost importance particularly in a Federal Territory where it is essential that every detail in relation to pollution control and with respect to sewage is given priority. I am pleased to say that the Opposition supports the decision of the Government to give this project the priority which it deserves to enable the construction of a first class treatment and disposal plant. leave1 also support the proposal to refer this proposed scheme to the Department of Works so that it can produce a new plan. As one who originally had been concerned to a considerable degree in having this matter referred lo the Department I feel I should say something on this subject. It was the opinion of the Darwin Port Authority, the opinion of some 30-odd doctors as well as the towns people which convinced me that the Government should have another look at this project. In regard to future schemes of this sort, I would urge the planners to look very carefully into the possible effects of effluent being dissecondment to the Department of Supply charged into tropical waters because we really do nol know very much about this. I think that this is something which should be very carefully studied. It is suggested the outflow from this sewage plant will go into the Leanyer Swamp area situated on the north side of Darwin. This area at present is an open swamp but later it may well become a residential area. SoI warn the Government against taking what could be an easy way out of this problem; it may find itself in quite a lot of trouble later on. The only other matter I would urge the Government to look at is the venting system which may be put in. In tropical areas we get very heavy pollution out of these vents which I think were included in one of the original proposals for this project. They are the points I wanted to refer to the Government. Motion (by Mr Swartz) agreed to: That the House, at its rising, adjourn until a dale and hour to be fixed by Mr Speaker, which time of meeting shall be notified by Mr Speaker to each member by telegram or letter. LEAVE OF ABSENCE Motion (by Mr Swartz) proposed: That leave of absence be given to every member of the House of Representatives from the determination of this sitting of the House to the date of its next sitting. (Quorum formed.) Question resolved in the affirmative. CBE., CLERK OF THE HOUSE OF will be aware that Mr Alan Turner, the Clerk of the House, will retire today and that this is the last sitting of the House at which he will be officiating at the table. Mr Turner's retirement will bring to a close a notable and lengthy career associated with the working of the Commonwealth Parliament and particularly with this House. Mr Turner joined the staff of the House as a young man in Melbourne in 1924 and early in his career was Speaker's Secretary, having served Speakers Watt, Groom and Makin in that capacity. Apart from a period of and Shipping between 1942 and 1945 during the War years. Mr Turner has served the House continuously over a period of 47 years. He has been a Chamber officer since 1946, having been Serjeant-at-Arms and Clerk of Committees from 1946 to 1949, Second Clerk Assistant from 1949 to 1955, Clerk Assistant from 1955 to 1958, and Clerk of the House from 1st January 1959. His Clerkship has been a notable one. Features of it were the major revision of the Standing Orders of the House which was undertaken between 1960 and 1963 and the re-organization of the staff of the House of Representatives to meet the greatly expanded and developing requirements of the House. He was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Her Majesty the Queen in 1965.

Honourable members would wish me to refer to the extra-parliamentary services which Mr Turner has rendered to this Parliament. In 1958 he was the Secretary of the Australian delegation which attended the Inter-Parliamentary Union conference held in Rio de Janeiro. From 1958 to 1971 he has been the Honorary Secretary/Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia Branch of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and in that capacity has served the Branch with great dedication and has achieved much in furthering Australia's interests and reputaright sort of information and keeps us on tion in the affairs of that Association. As Secretary of the Commonwealth Branch delegation he has attended many Commonwealth Parliamentary Association conferences. As Branch Secretary he played a major role in the organisation of the highly successful conferences which were held in Australia in 1959 and 1970. Also as Secretary of the Commonwealth Branch delegation he has attended Australian Area Conferences of the Association which are held every second year. No tribute to Mr Turner's services would be complete without reference to the wonderful support he has received from his wife, Mrs Turner. Mrs Turner, herself the daughter of a former member of this House, Mr G. A. Maxwell, KC., has on many occasions over the years spared no effort in graciously receiving and entertaining visitalways been a key one in our parliamentary ing parliamentarians and Clerks and thenwives and for so doing deserves our very warm and grateful appreciation. Mr Turner has served this House and this Parliament with great distinction. A great many members over a very lengthy period will recall with gratitude his courteous help and assistance, not only as Clerk of the House, but also as honorary secretary of the Commonwealth Branch of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. May I as Speaker say that I have greatly appreciated working with Mr Turner, that I have always respected his wise judgment and experienced counsel, and I thank him very sincerely for the ready assistance and support which he has always given me and all members of this House. In saying our official farewell to Alan Turner after a lifetime of service to this House, I assure him that he leaves with our sincere respect and gratitude and we wish him and Mrs Turner health and happiness for the future. (12.11 a.m.)-The greatest compliment that I could pay to Mr Turner is to say that many of us, perhaps all of us, treat him as a personal friend. We have great personal regard for him, for his integrity and for the fact that he is a person that is so easily liked and continuously courteous. He is always willing to give us assistance no matter what time of the day or night we approach him and he always gives us the the right track. Mr Speaker, as you have so well said, Mr Turner has bad a long and distinguished association with this Parliament. Incredible though it may seem, his parliamentary experience extends over 47 years. During that time he has served the House as you have so well said, Mr Speaker, in many capacities and has been involved in many, many areas of its operations. When therefore he attained his present position some 12 years ago, he brought as we all know a wealth of experience which has proved invaluable in the exercise of his duties and enabled him to exert a considerable degree of influence on tbe workings of the House. The role of the Clerk of the House has system of government because upon it devolves responsibilities for the procedures that enable Parliament as an institution to ner has upheld the finest traditions of his office.

In this Parliament we are greatly in his debt-al l of us are. He is a most competent and thoroughly professional servant of the institution.

The Leader of the Opposition mentioned-qui' e rightly so-that probably all of us have been to see Mr Turner in his office and have come away wiser men. Probably we should have gone more often. However, being one of the deputy chairmen, I appreciate the fact that Mr Turner has always exhibited complete non-partisanship in his position.

You have contributed great service to the Parliament and added much to tbe history of this country'. Mr Turner's career has indeed been a magnificent one, reaching back to his appointment as an officer of the House of Representatives 47 years ago and, finally, recognised by Her tomorrow. He leaves a service that he has worked for since he was 18 except for 4 years during the war. He can look back on a great career ranging through various offices in the House. He can also look back on his work in revising the Standing Orders, in the Inter-Parliamentary Union conferences, Commonwealth Parliamentary Association meetings and conferences of presiding officers and clerks. It has been a magnificent career forged in the only place where the essential specialised knowledge can be gained-that is, the Parliament itself. Add to this a personal good humour and an innate friendliness and we have Alan Turner the professional and Alan Turner the man. I can assure Mr Turner that each and every honourable member of this House has the greatest admiration for him. We have a great appreciation of the 12 years valuable service he has rendered retirement will bring. (12.27 a.m.)-As one who came into the",134,Representatives

422,Mr Clyde Cameron (Hindmarsh),"has enjoyed the help which Mr Turner has given me from time to time, I should like to say something about Mr Turner. One thing about him that 1 think should be placed on record is that at no time would any member of the Parliament from either side have cause to feel that a conversation in confidence with Mr Turner as to tactics -sinc e 1 have been here my tactics have been devoted entirely towards defeating the Gos'ernment-woul d ever reach the ears of the other side. This was proved on many occasions by the fact that the Prime Minister was so often taken by surprise when clever moves by myself and my colleagues were implemented as a consequence not of partisan advice but of straight advice from the Clerk as to what the law was and what the Standing Orders provided. 1 will never forget the look of amazement on the face of the present Prime Minister once when I moved a motion that was designed to throw him off guard. He has not really recovered from it. 1 do not think the Prime Minister should blame Mr Turner for this because I was the one who originated the idea. He simply told me how to do it. in any event, there is nothing much that the Prime Minister can do about the matter now. I hope that Mr Turner will feel free to visit the House and to be in the precincts of the House as often as he likes-no t to come occasionally or in the distant future, as somebody suggested we might be fortunate enough to see him. I hope that his good lady will come here quite often and not feci that she has to wait to be asked to visit us as was suggested, not by intent, by some speaker. Mr Turner looks very young because he only has to count votes and does not have to win them. I congratu. late him for succeeding in getting in on the salary rises before tbe rises start to go down. His timing was excellent. 1 cannot think of a belter way of doing it .than the way he has done it. I am sure that he will be the envy of many First Division officers in the future. O'f course, as an honourable member interjects, he will be the envy of many back benchers. I am pleased that we have following Mr mentary Association. I think we can say Turner our good friend Mr Parkes. I never felt free to speak to either Mr Turner or Mr Parkes on Christian name terms. I never got to the point which my friend Mr parliamentarians everywhere, and his Cope has reached but he, of course, being a Deputy Chairman of Committees has an advantage over we lesser mortals. But I am pleased that Mr Turner is being succeeded by Mr Parkes because I will feel free to go to him with clever little plans to deal with the Government, just as 1 felt free to go to Mr Turner. I know that next year when the Opposition tries to put clever little plans over the Government we on the Government side will not have been given the slightest inkling of the plans that are afoot. But that will not worry us because most of us have been brought up in the hard school of union politics, and plans which appear to be clever to the present Government will not appear to be clever to the future Government. I hope that Mr Turner will have a happy retirement, I hope that he will come along here often and that he will be as ftee with his advice in the future as he has been in the past because I will be ready to accept it. should like to be associated with the remarks that have been made this evening by the various speakers before me, and should also like to associate with my remarks my Deputy Chairmen. Mr Speaker, I am delighted, as I am sure you are, to be forewarned by the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) of his plans for next year. We will really appreciate that innocent look that he sometimes has on his face when we, with the advice of the Clerk, gis'e certain rulings and he looks as though it is not possible that we could give such rulings against him. I should like to say how greatly indebted I am for the advice, assistance and friendship that have been given to me and to all members by Mr Turner. In the period that it has been my privilege to be a Deputy Chairman and now Chairman of Committees and Deputy SpeakerI have always found that the advice given by Mr Turner has been in the best interest of this House of Parliament.

When one remembers that he has ours and to our parliamentary way of given almost 50 years of service to the life. I do not want to repeat many of the Parliament, that in itself is a remarkable things that have been said by other record. In that time he has built up a perspeakers regarding Mr Turner's capacity sonal record of friendship with those who and ability. AllI can say is that I heart ly have been associated with him.

424,Mr Daly (Grayndler) (12.36 A.m.),,137,Representatives
425,Mr Hayden (Oxley) (12.39 A.m.),"Iwarm and sincere best wishes to Mr and Mrs Turner on this occasion. 1 owe a debt of gratitude to Mr Turner for many courtesies and for the many occasions on which he has been helpful to me, but most of all, for his discretion and confidence. As other honourable members have observed, he has given long and loyal service and, more particularly, he has left his mark here because as Clerk of the House he has given a particular style of service. It is difficult to define, to explain or discuss. But, nevertheless, it is obvious to all of us who have watched himin the Chair. I have been a member of this Parliament for 10 years now, and the time seems to go very fast. 1 note that Mr Turner has been here for nearly half a century. But1 recollect that in the first week I was here I was invited round to his office with quite a number of new members to share a convivial drink. In those days 1 was rather insufferable with my political prejudices and probably I was becoming somewhat intolerable to him in explaining and trying to impress upon him how heaven resided on this side of the chamber alone and how all biases, unfairness and so on existed on the other side of the chamber, especially on the part of a certain burly member named Menzies who was around here in those days. Rather discreetly-and I have always appreciated this because it helped to give me some balanceMr Turner retold to me a story about Ben Chifley who, of course, is quite revered in my Party. He told me of an occasion when Ben Chifley was having difficulty at a Premiers Conference. The6 Premiers were disagreeing strongly with him. Ben Chifley said: 'All right. We will put it to the vote'. After the vote had been counted, Ben Chifley said: 'Six ayes and one no-the noes have it'. That was a small lesson to me. T often sit in this House and wonder what goes through the mind of the Clerk of the House. This thought has occurred to other people. That member of whom 1 spoke earlier, who has now quite an illustrious position of Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, once wrote this poem about the role of the Clerk of the House: Two wise old owls sat on the table; Their wigs were grey; their gowns were sable; They looked so sad, so melancholy, As if depressed by the human folly. Around them, carelessly displayed, Were all their dreadful tools of trade The standing orders, votes, and motions, The statutes, May, and such like notions. It all sounds very dreadful and makes these people look as though they are men of extreme dedication in the face of what must be great trials and tribulations and not a little bit of distress. Frank Green, as Clerk of the House, put the position nicely in perspective when he wrote in retort: If we look glum and vacant stare, When wigged and seated 'neath the Chair, J'lease do not think 'tis Nature's way, it's rather service for our pay. For if some thoughts we dare repeat, We'd find ourselves out in the street. 1 think that that is an eminently practical expression of feeling. I extend to Mr and Mrs Turner every good wish in their retirement. (12.41. a.m.)-Having known Mr Turner since the first day that he came into the service of the House of Representatives in Melbourne in 1924, I wish to join very heartily in and to endorse every word of tribute that has been paid to him tonight and to support the wishes that have been expressed to him and to Mrs Turner for their retirement. a member of the lower deck, I wish to say a few words of appreciation and thanks to Mr Turner on my own behalf and, I am certain, on behalf of those new members of the Parliament who came here in October 1969. The aspect that impressed me when I came into the Parliament was its extreme efficiency. It is a saying-and I think a true saying-that it is the captain who runs the ship. It is true to say also that any ship will founder when going through troubled waters unless it has good and skilled captain. In my experience in the Parliament since I have been here-it is only a short timeI have noticed that the parliamentary institution itself has had a few holes put in it but that they seemed to have been plugged effectively, no doubt because of the skill of the captain. By 'captain' I refer to the Clerk, Mr Alan Turner. On behalf of the newer members",137,Representatives

He organised training classes for us. He organised classes of instruction on how the Parliament operates. I can truly say that, without that training and without that assistance, we could not possibly have done the job for which we were e.ected. On behalf of the newer members o! the Parliament, 1 say thank you. I think that 1 can also say thank you on benalf of the often unsung section of the parliamentary staff, that is, the attendants and the other lower ranked members of the stall of this Parliament. I had fairly clo-e association with these people when 1 discussed with Mr Turner some problems relating to the wages and conditions of House attendants. 1 received very good advice from Mr Turner in this regard, and 1 appreciate it. As a result of that advice, certain action was taken. The attendants of this House and the lower paid section of the statl of this House did receive justified salary increases. On their behalf, Mr 2.) The amendment made by this Act to the Turner, I say thank you. I also express appreciation for a few well chosen words of advice that I received from Mrs Turner very early in the piece, d iring a function when Her Majesty the Queen was here.

The Government takes this action to ensure that the salaries of those statutory officers which are included in the Bill and which would terminate at a specified time unless this Bill is passed will continue. The Government accepts the amendments on the basis of ensuring that these statutory offices covered by the Bill will continue. The question of the flow-on following Ihe recent award by the Public Service Arbitrator is a matter that will be taken into account by the Government. (12.47 a.m.)-The Opposition supports the amendments. We agree with the remarks of the Leader of the House( Mr Swartz). Unless these amendments by the Senate are accepted there will be no salaries at all for certain statutory officers. The Senate has rejected the increased salaries that were proposed in the Bill, which was passed by us *and which was sent to the Senate. Those salaries have been rejected overwhelmingly and decisively. Unless these amendments are adopted, certain statutory officers will not receive even the salaries that they were receiving previously. They will receive no salary at all. For that reason, we accept and agree with the motion moved by the Leader of the House. the Opposition) (12.49 a.m.)-There are a couple of matters that I wish to raise on this Bill. Firstly, the 'Canberra News' this afternoon states: . . . Labor Caucus decided to try to cancel increases recenUy granted to Second Division officers of the Commonwealth Public Service, but is still considering how to go about this unprecedented move. I can only presume that the author of this report has misunderstood what the Labor caucus did decide on this matter last Wednesday evening. The Opposition decided to reconsider its attitude to this Bill in the light of the comments which the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Lynch) made about salary and wage restraint. It decided that it would now oppose the increases in this Bill when it was considered in the Senate. As we know, the Senate has accepted the Opposition's attitude. At no time did the Opposition consider the position of second division officers of the Commonwealth Public Service; in any case, increases in their salaries do not come before the Parliament by way of legislation. There was no reference made to their situation at all by caucus. The only reference made was to the holders of statutory offices. The remaining matter I want to state is this: Of all the Bills dealing with salaries of the highest paid persons in Commonwealth employment, this is the only one which has proceeded. Since there have been remarks outside the House as lo the attitude that the House should take on such matters, I recall-and it is appropriate that I should because the author of the recommendations, Sir Frank Richardson, was in the Speaker's Gallery earlier-that there was an occasion in 1959 when a committee made recommendations concerning' increases in salaries, allowances and pensions for everybody in the Parliament and also for persons who hold better remunerated positions in the Parliament. On that occasion the Government abandoned some of the recommendations with regard to the better remunerated persons in the Parliament. It has not been the unvarying practice to take recommendations as a whole and accept them as a whole. In the only conversation I have had on this matter with the Prime Minister1 pointed out this precedent. Relying on his memory pose, on Wednesday night behind the Speaker's chair. take. You were not there and neither was 1.1 spoke to you about 2.30. House saw us go behind the Speaker's chair with the Leader of the House( Mr Swartz) so everybody here has, from his own observation, an instance of the Prime Minister's accuracy or his phenomenal memory. I quoted this precedent and the right honourable gentleman, relying on his memory, doubted it. I checked and my memory was accurate. I merely point this out.

But the altitude of my Party is, I should tell the Parliament, that the amounts accepted by the Government in respect of all members of Parliament we thought were proper. Those which were accepted by the Government for the more highly remunerated persons in the Parliament were regarded as inappropriate. I take it that that is why the Salaries Bill for first divithat after question time. sion people has been abandoned and why, of course, the Senate accepted the attitude of the Opposition in respect of the holders of statutory offices. The Opposition thought it singularly inappropriate that on Tuesday night we should all be adjured to show restraint and that before dinner the following night there should be very large increases proposed for the persons who are most highly remunerated by the Commonwealth. (12.54 a.m.)-We on this side of the House feel that it is regrettable that in another place some of the salaries of statutory offices should be reduced. They were legitimately granted in accordance with proper work value appreciations. However, we feel that the Bill should go through because unless it becomes law the officers presently payable to them. The Australian Labor Party must, of course, take responsibility for the failure to permit these people Ministers of State Bill (No. 2). Those Bills to obtain the money to which they are justly entitled. I now refer to what has been said by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam). What he has said about speaking to me behind the Speaker's chair is totally untrue, and this can be verified by my colleague, the Leader of the House( Mr Swartz). It so happened that I spoke to him immediately before question time and not in the evening. I never feel it is appropriate to refer to what has happened behind the Speaker's chair Mr Clyde Cameron-Hear, hear! the Leader of the Opposition took this liberty himself. Mr Clyde Cameron-Speeches are all right but we do not want to hear the other things. hear the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) too much either.

That was the actual conversation I had with him. time. I will not go any further. The Leader of the Opposition referred to one or two details.

I can merely confirm that to the best of my knowledge that was the time. think that this i.s a farcical situation. It is who have to try to maintain a familj on beneath the dignity of the Committee to be discussing it at this time but I think the facts should be put before the Parliament. Leader of the House( Mr Swartz) and the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) were behind and slightly to the right of the Chair at between 8.5 and 8.10 last night within 10 minutes of the Opposition Party meeting adjourning. I could not say what they were d.scussing, but they were there and they discussed certain matters. Anyone who says they were not there was either nol in the House or is deliberately trying to mislead the Committee. marsh) (1.2 a.m.)1 want to say something about the remarks made by the Prime to defend the extraordinarily high salaries that had been set for certain statutory officers at a time when the Government was calling upon the ordinary wage plug in the community for restraint. Here we have a government which is telling the man getting $50, $60 or $70 a week that he has to be content to accept that wage and no more and telling the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission that it cannot increase the minimum national wage of $47 a week because the country cannot afford it, while at the same time he is recommending increases in salaries amounting to several thousand dollars a year. This is just the kind of thing that this county is complaining about. The Government has no right to stand up in this place and fix salaries as high as $29,000 a year for certain statutory officers and certain other people employed by the Commonwealth who are indicated in this Bill, with increases ranging as high as $6,000 a year or $120 a week, and then have the check to tell the Arbitral on Commission that the ordinary family man has to try to maintain a wife and family on a miserable $47 a week. Why, the average weekly earnings in Australia over the last quarter were oniy $89 a week. That is an average arrived at by lumping together the salary thai the Prime M.nisler himself geis, about 5>80O a week, plus the salaries of the pcopie he is now proposing to increase to $29,000 a year with the salaries of the poor dels $50 or $60 a week. It is a disgrace. I'he Government has no right to come into tnis place and talk about restraint on the part of the poor devil getting $50 or St.O a week with a family to maintain, educate, feed and clothe while in the same breath it has the hide to come into this place and ask us to approve of salaries as high as $29,000 a year for other people. These people who are already getting $22,000 a year are well able to meet the Government's demand for restraint. They are letter able to respond to the Government's call for restraint than are the poor d -vi'.s on $50 or 160 a week. It is the height of hypocrisy for the Prime Minister to sit The honourable member for Hinr* -arsh will restrain himself. when there are people on $50 or $60 a week trying to maintain a family while this man is on $800 a week and telling others to restrain themselves and keep down their wage demands.

I asked him to respect them. the word. honourable member withdrew it, but I remind him of what I said. had had another look at him and 1 was wondering whether I should withdraw. When the Prime Minister goes to a certain place one night not so long ago with Sir Frank Packer and 7 other big business men and the bill amounted to something like $200you said. $50 a head, it is nothing for these people. Yet they expect the poor devil on $50 or $60 a week to exercise some restraint. No wonder the 3 million people who arc getting less than the average weekly wage are feed up with this Government. No wonder we have reached the stage where people arc beginning to question the Government's sincerity when in one breath it asks the man on $50 or $60 a week to excerise restraint and then gives other people $29,000 a year. It is an absolute disgrace and I hope that the Prime Minister enjoys the same kind of Christmas as will those people on $50 a week and the pensioners. a.m.)-The attitude of the Opposition to this particular Bill is quite extraordinary. This Bill was introduced to give increases of salary to those statutory officers who are ference to its relationship with the unions equated with the Second Division of the Commonwealth Public Service. A month or so ago the Commonwealth Public Service Arbitrator considered the matter and granted a 15 per cent wage increase to Second Division officers, all of whom are members of unions. At the time that increase was granted the spokesman for the Opposition on industrial matters the honourmember for Hindmarsh acknowledged able member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) who has just finished his contribuGovernment's constantly asserted claim tion, welcomed that decision by the Arbitrathat the economic management probtor. That decision was then applied by the Government by way of regulation, which is the normal way in which it is done, because the Government accepted the Arbitrator's decision on the matter. As a consequence the increased wage flowed to Second Division officers. The Government decided that it was incumbent upon it, out of justice to these statutory officers who are equated with Second Division officers, to give them the same increases. The Bill passed this House. It went to the Senate, and in the Senate there was a discrimination against members of the wage earning sector of the community who are equated with the Second Division and who historically have received the same increase as was awarded by the Arbitrator to the Second Division. Tonight, by. an extraordinary course of events, the Opposition in the Senate decided to reject something which it has consistently supported in the past. It is open to any observer to conclude why that was done. There could be only 2 alternatives. One alternative is that Opposition members acted out of pique because they tried to play politics on a matter of parliamentary salaries which has historically been approached in a bipartisan attitude. In playing politics they found that the Government was not prepared to subordinate this matter to party politics. It had to be above that. And that has been the Government's action in relation to this matter. It could only be one of two choices. The Government has been saying that the present problems of economic management in tbe country today are inflationary pressures which arise out of wage-push pressures mainly-no t wholly I have never said wholly, but I have said mainly. That is the principal cause of it. The Opposition, up to this day, in dewhich have been relentlessly pushing wage claims, has been unwilling to acknowledge the fact that the inflationary pressures' flow from these ruthlessly, relentlessly pushed wage claims. Tonight we have heard the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam). supported by the Opposition's spokesman on industrial matters, the honourable for the first time the reality of the lem today of inflationary pressures is the wage-push pressure.

If the Opposition wishes to choose restraint I congratulate it for doing so and 1 can assure honourable members of the Opposition that if it comes to a competition in restraint the Government will be more successful and will have more to offer than they have. The honourable member for Hindmarsh, in a characteristic distortion of arguments speaks of the poor devils, as he described them, on S50 to $60 a week. There can be no doubt that a person receiving an income of' $50 or $60 a week is in a much less advantageous position than a person who is, for instance, a member of Parliament. Mr Clyde Cameron-O r on $29,000 like you. myself. One does not need to be a Rhodes scholar to know the difference between $50 or $60 a week and $9,500 and $29,000 a year. What the Government needs is to have compassion for the man on the small income and do what it can as a government to adopt policies which will benefit him. The Government is adopting policies to benefit him, because the person who is the most defenceless against inflation is the very poor devil of whom the honourable member talks. What can he do to defend himself when inflation is forced by relentlessly pursued wage claims by those who possess power? Those who possess power are the ones who are able to protect themselves against inflation. The people who cannot do so are the poor devils on $50 to $60 a week, more especially if their $50 or $60 a week comes from a fixed income. So the Government will pursue its policy of economic management directed towards arresting the inflationary pressures. The Government will continue to assert as strongly as it can, and give what leadership it can, in exercising restraint in this field. For by so doing it will be serving the interests of the people of Australia. Mr Chairman, I have been misrepresented. I want to make a personal explanation. The Treasurer ( Mr Snedden) has stated that I applauded the Government's decision to bring in regulations in line with the Public Service Arbitrator's decision in respect of the Second Division officers. Lei me tell. the Treasurer, who has already served one term at least as Minister for Labour and National Service, that no law requires the Government to bring in a regulation !o give effect to a determination of the Public Service Arbitrator. He ought to read his books. At no time-neve r since this Parliament has been assembled-ha s it been necessary for a government to bring in a regulation to give effect to the Public Service Arbitrator's determination. A determination is issued by the Arbitrator in the form of a determination, and it becomes operative in that form. I repeat, no regulation is needed. have just listened to a remarkable speech from the Treasurer ( Mr Snedden), the man who lectures on wage restraint and arbitration. J have here a report on the Parliamentary Salaries and Allowances Act. It shows that the Treasurer receives $29.100 per annum. It was recommended to be increased, in the report of Mr Justice Kerr, to $34,650, $5,550 extra. The Leader of the Opposition thought that the man who preaches wage restraint would have given up that $5,550 and struggled along on his $29,100. We thought he might have had a little compassion. But, no. He is one of the men who said: ' I want my extra $5,550. I cannot live on my $29,100.' Next year he will be going into the national wage case to argue against the workers receiving any increase. What hypocrisy at the highest level. What contemptible conduct by the Treasurer of this country. The honourable member for Grayndler knows, as I pointed out to the honourable member for Hindmarsh, that under the Standing Orders he should not make any reflection on any member of the House in regard to his motives. I suggest to the honourable member for Grayndler that he should withdraw the remark. Treasurer speaks of wage restraint and of arbitration. Let us look at this Government's approach to arbitration and at the conduct of the Treasurer on the matter he raised a few moments ago in relation to the Opposition.

467,Mr Dalyi Withdraw The Remark. The,"down a report. This arbitration was emasculated by a slight majority of a docile Cabinet, of which the Treasurer is one. Then, after not accepting the report of the Treasurer, without bringing anything to the notice of the Opposition whilst it was deliberating, not knowing any of the details, the Treasurer almost hammered down the door of the room of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) and said: Take it or leave it.' He said: 'In5 minutes time the Prime Minister is to introduce the Bill. Take it or leave it, or he will not introduce it.' The honourable member for Grayndler is developing this into a full scale debate on a subject that was presented to the House and on which the House has not proceeded. I suggest that the honourable member for Grayndler should not make a full scale speech on this matter at this stage of the proceedings. Chairman, but I point out to the Treasurer that he accused this Party of playing politics with Parliamentary salaries. SurelyI am entitled to reply to that and say to this House today reference to it. The Treasurer and the Deputy Prime Minister of this country threatened 3 members of the Opposition and said: 'Take it or leave it' in relation to an arbitration report that they had emasculated and sought to ram down our necks. But look at them struggling along on their $29,000 and $30,000. They are the wage restraint party. They say that the worker on his $50 is disturbing the economy. But these great men, these men of high principle-the Treasurer who lectures us will lead the Government into the courts to argue against the national wage case for workers-thes e are the men who refuse to give up a few thousand dollars and live on their $30,000 and yet they clamour for people in this country to accept wage restraint. The very day that they refused people in this country wage increases, in another place they introduced a measure to give $6,000 and $7,000 per annum increase in salaries to people who are struggling along on $22,000 and $23,000. This is the situation we face today and this is the Government that seeks to lead this country. I have never seen in all my years in this Parliament such a docile and incompetent Prime Minister, a hand picked Ministry, yes men to the core, prepared to sacrifice completely all the interests of the people of this country. I again remind the honourable member for Grayndler that the subject matter before the Committee is the Salaries (Statutory Officers) Adjustment Bill 1971, and the Committee at the moment is cosidering the Senate's amendments. 1 point out to the Committee that there has been sufficient discussion on the matters that are outside the amendments before the Committee. to the $6,000 and the $7,000. I think the people will be interested to know that if they re-elect the GovernmentI understand they may have an opportunity early in the new year-whos e members people in another place, the Prime Minister will want $51,000 per annum as a salary and will expect workers to take $5 or $6 a month or a year, as the case may be. They will think we will want a Treasurer who cannot live on $29,000 per annum and run the country. able member for Grayndler knows that this has no relevance to the subject matter we are discussing. sion is remarkable in view of the fact that the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Leader of the Opposition all discussed this, and if you persist in your attitude I will have to move dissent from your ruling. to the honourable member for Graydler that I considered there had been sufficient discussion on these matters. I would suggest that there has been sufficient discussion on these matters from both sides.

We are indebted not only to the members of the House but also to the people inside and outside it who play an active part in the operations of the House for their patience, hard work and continued courtesy. First of all, I believe that our thanks should go to you, Mr Speaker, for the manner in which you have managed the affairs of the House. I believe it is true to say that you are respected, that you arc unfailingly courteous in your attitude to all members and that whenever we feel that it is necessary or desirable to come to you to seek your advice you are only too willing to give it. We always find that the advice you give us turns out to be right. Above all, I believe that every one of us can credit congratulate the Minister for Foreign you with living up to the highest traditions of your office with both integrity and with dignity. BeforeI move oh to mention members of the House, may I mention how fortunate we are that Mr Norm Parkes will succeed the present Clerk of the House. Mr Parkes has had a lifetime of experience in the House and we hope that he will be a very worthy successor to the present Clerk and will serve just as long as he has and in just as pleasant <t capacity. I now refer to the Chairman of Committees, a man well known and favourably regarded by all of us. He is always couteous, affable and, again, a person who is only too willing to give advice of the very best kind. IfI can make one personal commentI do not like making too many on an occasion such as this-o n many of the occasions when I have felt that help was desirable, I found that instead of having to go to him, he was only too happy to come to me and I have been able to publish what he felt was not only in my interest but in the best interests of the Parliament as well. I say a word of apprecia'ion loo for the assistance rendered by the Clerks Assistant and the officers of the House. I also want to refer to the large quantity of work that has been done.over the course of the last year. About 134 Bills have been passed by the House. Therefore, I think that a great degree of credit must be given for the very arduous work that has been done by the Leader of the House( Mr Finally, Sir, I wish you and all other memSwartz) and the Deputy Leader of the House( Mr Chipp), and for the work that on the other side of the House. I think that we can reflect with some degree of satisfaction on the improved working of the legislative programme. It will be remembered that not so long ago we had a great deal of difficulty because of the pileup of Bills at the end of the session. I then advised the House that the Government had appointed a legislative programming committee of the Cabinet, headed by my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs( Mr N. H. Bowen). It had the task not only of sensible programming but also of preventing a banking up of work at the end of the session, with the consequent rush and all of the difficulties that this creates. I think, therefore, that we should Affairs on the work that he has done and for the success that has been achieved, particularly in regard to the objectives of the Government. In my first year as the Prime MinisterI should like to thank especially my ministerial and parliamentary colleagues for their support and co-operation. AlsoI should like to record my appreciation for the way in which the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam), the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Barnard) and their parliamentary colleagues have frequently discharged their obligations and helped to maintain an efficient and dignified working of the institution of Parliament.' I pay a tribute also to the Whips who are here to keep us in order and who also have made their contribution towards the efficient functioning of Parliament. I now turn to those who are behind the scenes and to whom we are indebted. I refer to the Hansard writers, members of research services of the Parliamentary Library, the telephonists and the general office staffs as well as the attendants and amenities staff who put in such long hours when the House is sitting. 1 should also like to make special mention of members of the Press who in their own fashion contribute to the democratic processes of Parliament. We may not always agree with what they say or how they interpret our remarks, but I respect their right to do so. bers of the House, the staffs and those people who have given assistance in the running of the House, a very very happy Christmas and a succesful year. Above all, Sir, I say that honourable members on this side of the House who make up the Government will do all that we can to make certain that the Government is successful whenever an election might be held. the Opposition) (1.42 a.m.)I join with seasonal good wishes. I agree with every thing he said, except the last sentence. I would like to comment first on the amount of business with which we have dealt this session. I have taken a quick look at the figures and I do not think that there has been a sessional period in which the Hansard record has had so many pages. The number of pages for this session is nearer 5,000 than 4,000. f just went out of the chamber to look at the Hansard records on my shelves and found that the number of pages this session is about 1.000 more than the number for previous sessions.

You have to be here when we meet and you have to be here when we rise. may be taken down and used against you. greater precaution, that this is without preany other persons. judice. I must concede that my colleagues and I try your patience at times, but I hope that you will not mind if I say that I believe your patience is tried on a bi-partisan basis. It is unfortunate that in your position the more you are tried on your right the more you have to take it out on your left. In this Parliament the Speaker is not immune from opposition in his electorate. You. Sir, have to tread a very difficult path. You have to try to keep your electorate and at the same time to preside over the House. I am not ready to assert that any member of the House would be willing to take your job who could do it better. There are many personal reasons why, whilst we disagree politically with vigour, we do respect each other as men. Your deputy has great experience. He has had to preside over, I think, probably an exceptionally great number of debates. There have been some occasions, as you know, when we have preferred his rulings even to yours. May I specify also what the House owesI certainly feel that I owe a great deal-to the Leader of the House( Mr Swartz) and to my Deputy. Each has to do all he can to see that the business of the House-the legitimate business raised on each side-is given a satisfactory debate and resolution. It is impossible to reconcile all the pressures in this way. I am certain that there are no 2 men in this place who could so well resolve those differences, and this applies to both. I have never had a closer association in any activity in my life than I have had with my Deputy and I know that he appreciates the way that the Leader of the House works with him. As I have said before, the Leader of the House has an extraordinary capacity to take the heat out of any Equation. tions though. all, I suppose, mock his prolixity. There is, in fact, no Minister who does give more information than the Leader of the House in his capacity as Minister for National Development. I have never known him to give an inaccurate reply and there is always as least some information in his replies. At any rate, this is not the occasion to specify However, from my side we extend in a personal sense to all those who sit on the other side the season's greetings. Members of Parliament, whatever else may be said about them, do, ex officio, see less of their families than anybody else and it is impossible really to carry on in this occupation unless one has a fairly tolerant wife. Their patience is sorely tried by our occupation. I think I know most of the wives of members of the Government parties and without exception they are of great assistance to their husbands. However we may find our opponents from time to time politically obnoxious, their wives are very gracious, nice women and that applies to the Prime Minister, to his Ministry and to those who sit behind him.

It has not been a dull year. There has been sufficient activity in the Parliament to allow our feature writers to fill more than a few columns with news. I am not sure which side of the House has provided the more arresting news, but this side has certainly provided quite a bit. One of the most unusual features of the yearit was an experience I had never had before nor had any present member of this Parliament-wa s the counting out of the Parliament. Nobody would think it was funny. In fact most of us feel a little ashamed that it happened. I hope we never see it again, but it was an unusual feature of the year. I would like to say to you, Mr Speaker, how much I. appreciate the way in which you have carried out your most onerous job. You have performed it in a very effective way and with a great deal of dignity. I pay a similar tribute to the people who support you, particularly my colleague the Chairman of Committees ( Mr Lucock). I am very proud of the way he fills that office. I think he does an excellent job and has great command when he is in the chair. He Has had to take control of this House on many occasions when you have been away, Sir, either overseas or through ill health. On those occasions he has certainly done an excellent job. Many people provide the services in the Parliament. I would not like to run through them all because I might fail to mention one or two of them. I have in mind all the people who work behind the Clerks of the House; the staff of Hansard and the Library staff; the attendants and the door staff. I have not had an opportunity before to mention Gordon Pike. He is an exceptional person. I have no doubt that he has been mentioned on previous occasions but I wish to mention him now because I remember very clearly how important he was when I was a private member, in getting me to Canberra and away again. He is a man who never complains, ho matter what is asked of him. I wish to mention another person. 1 do not know whether it is appropriate on this occasion, but he was associated with this Parliament for a very long time in connection with the Cabinet Secretariat. I refer to the late Les McSpeerin who died during the week. Les McSpeerin was in the Office of the Cabinet for a period of 21 years. He retired a fortnight ago and died a week after retiring. He was a most courteous and attentive man. Anybody who was associated with him will feel very sad at his passing and because he was robbed of the opportunity of a happy retirement. I would also like to thank the Leader of the Opposition for mentioning the wives of members of Parliament.

I join withmembers of the House of Representatives-bot h on the Government side and on the Opposition side-wh o are not always aware of the arrangements that must be made if the business of the House is to be dealt with effectively and expeditiously. In this respect I have endeavoured to work with the Leader of the House as he has endeavoured to work with me to achieve this objective. I believe that it has been done during this session reasonably well. Therefore I join with the Leader of the Opposition and those who have spoken tonight to express my own personal good wishes to all those people who have contributed in this way, and to wish all members of the House of Representatives the compliments of the season. Speaker, I will make my comments brief. I wished to speak through you to the Prime here I do so through the Deputy Prime Minister( Mr Anthony) and I hope that he will give my remarks some consideration. In this gentle season when men remember they are brothers I want to make a request that we give special consideration to that young man, Geoffrey Mullen who is at present in Emu Plains. Geoff Mullen is a young man who has defied the National Service Act. He is due to be released from prison in February. I am asking the Government to give special consideration to releasing him by Christmans. I do this because he is a man of great moral courage. He has made his stand and I think he is prepared to take his medicine. He would not want me to make any special request on his behalf alone, but I think that he is an only son and that we should give some consideration to bis mother. Geoffrey Mullen is a young man who defied the National Service Act. He has been in many gaols in the State of New South Wales. He has been in Long Bay Gaol. He was transferred from Long Bay Gaol to Berrima. I visited him in Berrima last Easter Saturday. He was transferred from there to Newnes at a later stage. From there he went to Silverwater. He was then transferred from Silverwater to Cooma. Recently, upon representations mission being made by myself and other honourliquor, a station able members he was transferred to Emu day. Plains. I might say in fairness to the New South Wales authorities that it is a far better prison for him to be in than Cooma. This is a special problem. The Government is bringing home from Vietnam its combat troops by Christmas. I wish it was bringing all its troops home. I will not make any criticism of past policy. This is not the time to critisice the Government. I am putting a special case to the Government and I hope that it will give it special consideration. Election policies are being talked about. The Government should treat this case sympathetically. It has been said that the Government may introduce its election policy by next March. If special consideration is given to Mullen, J will be grateful. At least I will see evidence of some human blood running through the Anyone, who knows Mullen recognises that he is a boy with great moral courage. I admire him personally. We all know that mothers feel for their sons and I want to see the boy home. I hope that not only will the Government give special consideration to Mullen but also that it will give special consideration to the others-ther e are not a great many because it is not the Government's policy to arrest many of these young people-wh o are in gaol. I hope that the Government will give special consideration to them too. But I ask particularly in respect of Mullen. I have kept a close eye on him. I have kept in touch with him and with his mother. I will not detain the House. I thank the Prime Minister for coming into the House. Many members have said many things for many hours. I hope that I will not be begrudged 10 minutes to raise a serious matter. It is not a matter of interest, probably, to the Press or to many members in this House. But it is a human tragedy and I wish to have it recorded in the pages of Hansard, even if it stains the pages of our history. I said that it was a human tragedy. Let me read this article as an indication of what it is about. This is not the exact case but it is an analogous one. In the 'Sydney Morning Herald' of 18th September 1971 there appeared this article: An Aboriginal tribe on a Northern Territory was slowly being 'massacred' by Professor of anthropology claimed yester-",152,Pairs

495,Mr Turner (Bradfield) (2.6 A.m.),"Professor Ronald Berndt, of the University of Western Australia, said in the three years since he last visited the mission the Aborigines had become apathetic and disillusioned. During these three years-in late 1969a liquor store was set up on a mining lease at the edge of the reserve, he said. Unles action was taken immediately, the 500 or so Aborigines on the mission would be destroyed. Professor Berndt was talking about the Oenpelli Mission, about 150 miles east of Darwin. Before the coming of the store, the Aborigines -primaril y from the Gunwinggu tribe-were well on their way to adapting themselves to the 'tremendous changes' going on around them; at the same time retaining something of their cultural heritage, he said. A good school was available at Oenpelli-and so was employment. Mining in the area, with potential for greater Aboriginal participation, heralded a new economy. But, under present conditions, the bright prospects would not be realised. Professor Berndt claimed almost half of Aboriginal wages, pensions, endowment and trainee payments passed into the hands of the store's proprietor. Family life was disrupted, children neglected, ther was an emotional vacuum and many of the adults were well on their way to becoming alcoholics. 'The continuation of the present state of affairs spells genocide-jus t as surely as if the people were being massacred,' he said. 'The only difference is that, in this case, it will be slower-bu t it will have the same result.' The Aborigines did not know how to cope with the problem. They had no tradition of drinking; it was not part of their culture. Most of tbe people were powerless to react against it themselves because they did not see the implications. In his statement, Professor Berndt spoke of Aboriginal men and women 'dazed and staggering, lying inert, yelling, quarrelling and fighting.' The scene at the East Alligator Crossing almost defied description-wit h about half the adult male population of the mission in various stages of drunkenness. The secretary for Aborigines of the Church Missionary Society, the Rev. Stanley Giltrap, said in Sydney that the liquor Licence was granted by the Northern Territory licensing authority over the objections of both the mission and the Aborigines themselves. 1 said that this was not the case that I wished to raise, but it is precisely analogous. It refers to an area on one side of Arnhem Land. The case about which I am That is, to issue a permit for the purpose concerned is on the other side of Arnhem of allowing liquor to be taken into Arnhem Land. If that is what happened in the area Landjust described, this is what will happen in was vested in you primarily as a protection for the other case to which 1 refer specifically. I raised this matter in the House. It is recorded in Hansard of 6th and 7th May 1971 at page 2839. The Minister for the Interior( Mr Hunt), in reply to what I had to say, said: Is it realistic that the Nhulunbuy community should not hare access to the same social amenities as other Northern Territory towns of the same size? There is a need for public accommodation for business and other visitors to the Gove project. The Aboriginals' preference for a club licence would nol be appropirate as it would undoubtedly limit the availability of the facilities to club members. Residents and visitors to the town would be excluded unless they joined the club. Unless a discriminatory club rule prevent it, Aboriginals would be able to join the club and have access to liquor. Moreover, restricted availability of liquor through the club would lead to black marketing, especially in respect to Aboriginal drinkers not wishing to join the club. Those are very cool words when one considers that the issue of this licence is the prelude to precisely what I have read about having already happened in the last couple of years on the other side of Arnhem Land. I shall ask, before I sit down, that the transcript of the case before the licensing magistrate be laid on the table. I would anticipate no objection to that as the transscript was given to me by the Minister himself. This will allow members of this House or of the public to refer to it themselves. In the brief amount of time. I have at my disposal I want to refer to one or two of the points raised in the transcript. First of all, an officer of the Welfare Department of the NT Administration is responsible to decide whether liquor shall or shall not come onto an Aboriginal reserve. That is his duty. 1 would like to quote part of the transcript relating to the officer who has this responsibility. His name is Cyril Cecil Allom, a Regional Welfare Officer with the NT Administration. This witness was the person who, following the earlier application by Walkabout Holdings which was refused on the basis that the company did not have a permit to take liquor into Arnhem Land, issued such a permit. Crossexamined by Mr Elliott, counsel for the Aborigines, he was asked: Did you understand that this discretionthe Aboriginal people? He answered: 'Yes, Sir'. On the same page of the transcript the witness also admitted that on the earlier application he had stated that before issuing a permit he would consult all parties concerned. The witness was asked by Mr Elliott whether or not he should have consulted the Aborigines before issuing the permit, He replied: I have not consulted them, sir. I would have considered it an impertinance to consult them because their views are being expressed before this Court. In relation to his earlier statement that he would have consulted all parties before issuing a permit, the witness stated in relation to the Aborigines: They are parties, sir, but as I say they are already represented. When asked a question in relation to bis powers to issue a permit under section 140E specifically having regard to the interests of the Aborigines, the witness replied: No, I think I have to have regard to the intersituation where the welfare officer gave ests of other people as well. I will not read any more of his evidence. This man was supposed to be looking after the interests of the Aborigines but he did not consult them because they were before the court. The court might have liked to hear from somebody who had expertise in this field and whose duty it was to look after them what was his attitude, being presumably also the attitude of the Government. But I do not have time to go into this matter in detail. Let me pass on the attitude of Walkabout to the club licence. Evidence was given by Mr Graeme James Robertson, Chairman of Walkabout Hotel. He was asked whether he had considered the disadvantages of a club licence as opposed to hotel licence. His answer was: We would have to break the law; that was the only disadvantage. That indicates that the witness supposed a club licence could not be enforced. The witness said: We are not looking for a way over it. He was referring to the disadvantages of a club licence. They were interested only in an hotel licence. So the question of a club licence was never before the court. Walkabout was not interested in it and it never came before the court as to whether a club licence might be the right answer. Evidence as to the provision of amenities such as a canteen and provision for the families there in a community centre was given by the Site Administration Officer at Nabalco. This was highly satisfactory. I cannot go into all this but there was talk about a need to accommodate visitors. Yet when one reads on through the evidence one finds it admitted that the mining company does not encourage visitors. Of course it does not. It wants to get on with mining. Nevertheless there was talk before the magistrate about the accommodation of visitors. Even a trade union organiser said that the union wanted a hotel so that the workers in the mine could have their families there. It came out in evidence that this would cost about $20 a night exclusive, of course, of the costs of flying the families to this place and back home again. of the Licensing Ordinance, I have not time to go into all these matters and I will lay on the table the transcript of evidence. It disclosed a disgraceful no evidence to assist the court, where the applicant had no concern whatsoever for the Aborigines-h e merely wanted a hotel licence to do what a storekeeper did on the other side of Arnhem Land-wher e there was talk about the accommodation of visitors whereas the mine discourages visitors and where every point of view was taken into account except the interests of the Aborigines. This is a human tragedy and T want it recorded in Hansard. member's time has expired. heartily congratulate the honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr Turner) on what he has said.

I am not trying to denigrate the administration of Aboriginal affairs. This is a problem with which all of us should be concerned.

What the honourable member for Bradfield has said is true and I hope the Parliament and the Minister for the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts( Mr Howson) will read what he said and do something about the intoxication of Aborigines and tbe profit motive behind the sale of liquor to Aborigines.

Mr Thorpe has been living with the Gurindjis there in early March under sponsorship of 10 national unions. In Darwin to buy stores yesterday, Mr Thorpe said he was 'quite disillusioned' about the unions which has sponsored him, and about 'several other organisations' which claimed to be helping the Gurindjis. 'Most of them are simply using the situation for political gain, without any real knowledge of the situation, or any real regard for the real wishes of the Gurindjis,' he said. T have no political affiliations at all.

'This is on Wave Hill station, and Vestey's, the controlling company, has said it would not resist any Government move to excise the area and give it to the Gurindjis. 'The Gurindjis decided they could gain control over the land within existing laws, by seeking the lease, while leaving their application for the land to be granted to them for future consideration. 'But Abschol and the other organisations decided the lease application should not be made. 'They say it would admit Government ownership of the land claimed by the Aboriginals. 'They believe the lease application would cut across the principle of Aboriginal land rights. 'The Gurindjis themselves do not admit this' Mr Thorpe said. 'They regard the lease as a first step and one which would give them undisputed control of the land now, while the principle is still being argued. 'Yet the southern organisations are attempting to dictate what the Gurindjis should do. 'They are refusing to let the people think or speak for themselves. 'Right now, the Gurindjis want to seek a lease for the land '1 believe the Government will quite soon agree to grant Ihem a small sit-down area at Wattie Creek, but they still want a lease over the whole 500 square miles. 'They want permission and help to establish a small cattle station operation on the land. This would not be to supply all the Gurindjis-jus t some of the older people.

'Some of the Territory people who have spoken recently on the question have also shown a complete lack of understanding of the real problem.

""Their public argument recently about conditions and leadership at Wattie Creek is based on the situation as it was years ago-no t on what is happening now,' Mr Thorpe said.

511,Mr Peacock,"The answer to theThe survey conducted in the PuckapunyalSeymour area required considerable starling effort to collect and collate the data, however, because the Seymour-Puckapunyal area is relatively concentrated and the number of servicemen with children of secondary school age comparatively few, it was possible for this survey to be conducted. To undertake a similar survey in the HolsworlhyIngleburn area, winch is such a large geographic area and where a great number of servicemen are located, would be a very costly exercise and I am not disposed to authorise the necessary expenditure. In addition, the turbulence' arising frnn the return of servicemen' from Vietnam would cast doubt upon the accuracy of any statistics col'ected at this time.

(2) Do Commonwealth officers make checks of petrol at the point of sale to the public to guard against dilution and selling of standard grade as and beer in hotels. able member's question is as follows: (1) The octane rating of petrol has no bearing on the rate of duty or on any other requirement of Customs or Excise legislation and consequently, no direct checks are made of this facet of oil company operations. (2) Petrol sold at retail outlets has passed from Customs control and consequently any checks in respect of quality or quantity at the point of sale would be a matter for State or Local Authorities. No quality checks are required to be made by officers of the Department of Customs and Excise in respect to potable spirits and beer after duty has been paid and the liquors have passed from Customs control.

515,Mr Chipp,"The answer to the honourown initiative after considering evidence that travel costs are reducing or was the reduction part of the Government's economy drive to reduce expenditure. able member's question is as follows: (1) The rate of the allowance payable to repatriation pensioners who use their own transport to attend for medical treatment or other authorised purposes was revised in May 1971. The allowance previously authorised where public transport was available, and the pensioner's incapacity did not prevent its use, was an amount equal to the cost that would have been incurred by using public transport. In any other circumstances an allowance, based on mileage travelled, was paid at the following rates: 4 cylinder vehicle-9.5 c a mile 6 cylinder vehicle-11.4 c a mile 8 cylinder vehicle-16.5 c a mile Those rates were based on the rates approved under Public Service Regulation 90 for officers of the Public Service who used their own vehicles for authorised official purposes, and incorporated elements for standing expenses such as insurance, registration, depreciation, etc., as well as the cost of petrol, oil, etc. During the review of these rates which commenced in mid-1970 the Repatriation Commission considered that tbe rates payable under Public Service Reg. 90A for officers of the public service who used a private vehicle for specified purposes on irregular occasions, would be more appropriate for repatriation pensioners. Accordingly, the new rates authorised were: (a) where public transport is available but the pensioner, of his own choice, prefers to use his private vehicle, he is paid at a rate of 6c a mile irrespective of the size of the motor: (b) where public transport is not available, or the pensioner's incapacity will not allow for its use, payment is made at the following rates: 4 cylinder vehicle-7 c a mile 6 cylinder vehicle-8.2 c a mile 8 cylinder vehicle-12.1 c a mile. The current rates are designed to cover actual running costs, so that ex-servicemen would not be out of pocket, but they do not cover fixed costs of owning a motor vehicle, such as insurance, registration, depreciation, etc. (2) Neither.

Advanced Education Scholarships (Question No. 4581) Dr Cass asked the Minister for Education and Science, upon notice: (1) Why are 70 per cent of Commonwealth Advanced Education Scholarships declined (question No. 3645, Hansard, 12th October 1971, page 2226). (2) Why are declined scholarships nol reallocated. (3) What is the comparable figure for university scholarships. Mr Malcolm Fraser-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Students who receive the offer of a scholarship but who decide not to accept it are asked to indicate in their reply to the offer their reasons for not accepting. Information for 1971 Commonwealth Advanced Education scholarships is available for 3 States, New South Wales (including the Australian Capital Territory), Victoria and South Australia. Out of the 6,030 students throughout Australia whorejectedan offer, 5,219 were in the 3 States mentioned. The reasons given by students in those States for rejection of the offer were: Per cent (a) Accepted State Teaching Scholarship 41 (b) Attending university .. .. 19 (c) Accepted other award ... 6 (d) Other miscellaneous reasons given .. 11 In addition, 4 per cent gave no reason, and 19 per cent did not reply to the offer. (2) The full quota of Commonwealth Advanced Education scholarships is used each year. As a general rule, scholarships which are declined are immediately re-offered to candidates placed next in order of merit. In some circumstances, however, where the proportion of students who will reject the offer of an Advanced Education scholarship can be forecast, the initial offer is increased beyond the quota, and rejected scholarships are not re-offered. .(3) In 1971, 19 per cent of the students offered a Commonwealth University scholarship rejected the offer. For this scheme also the number of scholarships available was fully used. The number of offers made was in excess of the quota in order to make allowance for those students not accepting awards.

(11) The answer to this part of the honourable member's question was given on 17th August 1971 in answer to his Question No. 2592 (Hansard, pace 156). 12 ((a) and (b)) The following table shows the number and percentage of applicants who failed to gain entry into the faculty of their first choice where an entry quota was applied. However, many of these applicants would have been successful in gaining admission lo a faculty of an alternative choice. Moreover, as experience has shown that not all successful applicants take up an offer of a place in a faculty of their first choice, it is likely that many who did not receive such an offer, because they gained insufficient marks at the matriculation accepted an offer had it been made. I would also invite the honourable member's attention to my recent answer to his question No. 3642 in which I pointed out that the fact that a proportion of the applicants for university places is unable to be accommodated is not in itself proof that the number of university places is inadequate.

(2) How many have been admitted to Australia for employment in each of the last 5 years? (3) What were their (a) occupational classifications, (b). wages or salaries, (c) industries of employment (d) terms of employment and (e) locations? (4) How many of those admitted in the last 5 years and still in Australia are (a) in their original occupational classifications, (b) in the industry in which they were 'first employed and (c) at iheir original locations? Dr Forbes'-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The majority of persons coining here from Japan to engage in employment seek to come here for limited stay. The policy and procedures which apply to such applications for temporary residence are Ihe same for nationals of all countries subject to visa requirements and apply equally to Japanese nationals. Generally, Japanese nationals seeking to enter Australia for temporary residence to engage in employment, are in one of the following broad categories: Estimated annual (a) Senior Management Personnel appointed to Paramedical scheme cost provide managerial direction in a branch i company in Australia or to undertake similar duties with a joint venture may be Physiotherapy service based on granted visas authorising stays up to an Murray Bridge Soldiers' War initial period of 4 years.

Where overseas-based personnel are introduced under these provisions the policy adopted is that every reasonable opportunity must be given to locally-engaged workers lo enjoy the benefits to be derived from work on developmental and other projects carried out in this country. Similarly it is generally a condition of their entry that the employer take steps to ensure that workers recruited in Australia be given.. an opportunity to learn the specialist skills possessed by the expatriate workers. This envisages the introduction of suitable training arrangements by the employer. Such conditions are directed to ensuring that Australia will not need continually to rely on the importation of short-term labour to obtain the benefit of these skills and so that, in appropriate cases, expatriate personnel may progressively be repatriated as locally-engaged workers become competent to carry out their functions. A standard condition of entry is always that the personnel admitted to Australia must receive wages and work under conditions noless favourable than those applying to Australian workers engaged on comparable work and that all relevant Australian industrial laws, awards and agreements apply in respect of the expatriate personnel. Applications within this group are normally the subject of consultations with the Department of Labour and National Service which advises on industrial relations and employment aspects. (c) Entertainers and Sportsmen may be granted short-term entry in order to fulfil specific engagements. They need to be sponsored by a reputable entrepreneur who is required to guarantee their maintenance and return bookings. In the case of entertainers the Department of Labour and National Service is consulted as to any industrial relations or employment aspects posed by the proposed entry. This latter procedure does not apply in the case of performers of international repute. The requirements to be met by persons whose entry for temporary residence has been approved Managerial staff..

It is currently expected that the Australian Government will reserve its decision with respect to the application of Convention No. 47 to Papua New Guinea. In the view of the the Administrator's Executive Council it would be inappropriate to accept the principle of a 40-hour week for Papua at this stage of the country's development. As advised in my reply to the honourable member's question No. 3399, there is close conformity between the law and practice of Papua New Professor Berndt, a Western Australian anthropolGuinea and Convention No. 112.

The Administrator, on the advice of the Ministerial Member for Agriculture, Stock and Fisheries, has provided the following information: The Ministerial Member 'regrets that he is unable to supply the information requested rn. this question.

(2) If so, what action has been taken in the matter. (3) Will he confer with native spokesmen and the Minister for External Territories and take steps to ensure that liquor is not introduced to populations where it is clearly more damaging than other drugs at present restricted or banned in Australia. (4) Will the Government ensure that all estimanumbers of Oenpelii Aboriginals. ted revenue proceeds of liquor sales to native peoples, or at least equivalent amounts, are devoted to (a) education of native peoples in the dangers and values of alcohol as a food, drug and poison and (b) medical and social help and rehabilitation for the victims of alcoholism and their dependants. able member's question is as follows: (1) I have read Professor Berndt's report. The text of a statement issued recently on the matter by the Bishop of the Northern Territory, the Right Reverend K. Mason and the Church Missionary, Society Field Superintendent, Mr P. Leske, is given at the end of the answer as it puts the Church and Mission views on the effects of drinking on the Oenpelii community. (2) There has been continuing and close consultation between the Mission authorities and the Administration about the incidence of drinking by Aborigines from Oenpelii at the store concerned. I also spoke to the Oenpelii community about this matter earlier this year when I visited there. among Mission staff and Aboriginals have been There has been increased supervision by police of the area. The mission authorities have also had talks with the licensee and these are referred to in the statement quoted below. (3) The report of the Commission appointed by the Administrator of Papua and New Guinea to inquire into drinking of intoxicating liquors in that Territory will be studied when available to see if the recommendations of that Commission have any application to particular communities in the Northern Territory. The Advisory Council on Northern Territory Aboriginal Affairs which includes 12 Aborigines representing communities throughout the Territory will be given every opportunity, to consider the effects of the introduction of liquor in Aboriginal communities and to advise on action which might be taken in this regard. (4) Part of the continuing work of Welfare officers is Instruction on the need for moderation in the consumption of alcohol with individual counselling given in problem cases. The Board of the Methodist Mission has been informed that the Government is prepared to subsidise the salary of a social worker whose duties would include education programmes on drinking and family counselling in particular cases. Similar recent happenings and are determined to exercise assistance fbr other mission authorities would be considered if requested. Funds for health and social services for Aborigines in the Territory are provided under appropriations in the Budget of the responsible Departments. Text of statement by the Bishop of the Northern Territory, the Right Reverend K. Mason, and Mr P. Leske. 'Recent controversy has focused on the Border Store, situated on the western side of the East Alligator River, which is the Arnhem Land border. Mr Terry Robinson began to operate the store towards the end of 1966, to cater for the needs of tourists who come in considerable numbers to the area. As well, the store has attracted In 1969 Mr Robinson applied for a liquor licence. This application was opposed by the Oenpelii Aboriginals and Mission authorities-none theless the licence was granted in August, 1969. Mr Robinson undertook lo sell beer only and not ""hard"" spirits, but over the last 2 years the availability of liquor so close to Oenpelii has led to considerable breakdown in the life of the Aboriginals. Drunkenness and fighting resulted in frequent damage to life and properly. Family, life for many was disrupted and social and moral problems began to increase. A large proportion of the wages of many workers went on beer at the Border Store, and with more vehicles operating in the area. Aboriginals were also able to go further afield for liquor. Professor Ronald Berndt, during a recent visit to Oenpelii, was dismayed at the position and spoke of alcohol leading to genocide. His remarks led to a good deal of publicity. Conferences held, and Mr Robinson attended discussions on 13th October. All present were deeply concerned about the problems and there was a full sharing of difficulties with the desire to find a way forward. The Aboriginal people have now expressed the following wishes: 1. It is essential for a policeman to be resident in the area. 2. No alcohol should be made available to the Oenpelii side of the East Alligator Riveri.e. a ""wet"" canteen is not wanted. 3. The fact that the Border Store sells only beer is appreciated. This licence should not be withdrawn, as this would aggravate matters by leading to a search for liquor from further away. 4. Much better facilities should be provided at the Border Store for leisurely drinking, with no beer to be taken away from the store. Mr Robinson fully recognises the gravity of the position and wants to do all in his power to improve and control matters. The Oenpeili Aboriginals have been stirred by whatever controls are possible among their own people.",172,Comparison Of New Bachelor Degree Enrolments By Sex 197 1
520,Mr Hunt,"The answer to the honourThe outcome of recent discussions has been welcomed by Church and Mission authorities in the Diocese, and the desire of all involved to cooperate in improving the situation is cause for thankfulness. We appreciate the concern of Church people about these problems, and hope that the above will lead to continuing informed prayer.' Australian Capital Territory: Water Rates (Question No. 4555) Mr Enderby asked the Ministerf o r the Interior, upon notice: (1) What principles and tests are applied to determine how water rates are charged in the Australian Capital Territory. (2) Does the system require flat dwellers without gardens to pay a minimum sum of $20 for water used up to 100,000 gallons which is the same as that required of householders with gardens. (3) What percentage of (a) householders and (b) flat dwellers used (i) less than 20,000 gallons, (ii) less than 40,000 gallons, (iii) less than 60,000 gallons, (iv) less than 80,000 gallons, (v) less than 100,000 gallons and (vi) more than 100,000 gallons in the last year. (4) Are householders permitted the free use of 25,000 gallons per annum for the purpose of watering nature strips irrespective of the size of those nature strips. (5) Do householders occupying corner blocks of land often have twice the area of nature strips surrounding their house than other householders. (6) Will he change the present system of imposing water rates to give greater equity to householders occupying corner blocks and to flat dwellers; if not, why not. member's question is as follows: (1), (2) and (4) The principle underlying the system of water charging in the Australian Capiljl Territory is that all consumers should contribute to the cost incurred in providing for the storage of sufficient water to meet all consumers nefils and in treating and reticulating it to their properties. The minimum charge (currently $20 per annum) therefore represents a contribution b} each consumer towards the capital, maintenance and operating costs of the system. In setting the minimum charge of $20 for 100,000 gallons of water the contribution of consumers to the development of Canberra as a garden city continued to be recognised. Instead of setting 75,000 gallons as the quantity allowable before excess was charged, 25,000 gallons was added to encourage consumers to continue to maintain nature strips. Flat dwellers pay only the minimum charge irrespective of the amount of water consumed. (3) Consumption statistics are not available in the form requested by the honourable member. However, consumption by all consumers in 1968, the latest year for which these figures are available, was: Number of Consumption consumers 025,000 gallons .. 5,199(19%) 26,00050,000 gallons .. 1,501 ( 5%) 51.00075.000 gallons .. 2,992 (I I %> 76,000-100,000 gallons .. 4.254(15%) Over 100,000 gallons .: 14,106(50%) 28,052 Based on current charges the 35 per cent of consumers who used less than 75,000 gallons would have contributed 19 per cent of the water revenue. The 50 per cent who used more than 100,000 gallons would have contributed 72 per cent. (5) Even ignoring comparisons between corner blocks and others, there are wide variations in 'he sizes of nature strips adjacent to houses. (6) The distribution of water charges between consumers is considered to be equitable and no changes are proposed at present. Repatriation: Australian Servicemen in Vietnam (Question No. 4693) Mr Whitlam asked the Minister for the Army, upon notice: (1) How many (a) regular and (b) national servicemen in Vietnam have incurred disabilities described in successive lines of the first column of the Fourth and Fifth Schedules of the Repatriation Act between June 1965 when the first Australian Battalion arrived in that country and Novemocr 1971 when Australian Forces withdrew from operations. (2) How many (a) regular and (b) national servicemen have been killed (i) in action and (ii) in accidents in that country between those dates. able member's question is as follows: (1) The Army holds medical statistics, in the form sought, only from August 1969 to > 1st October 1971. To obtain the information in this form prior to August 1969 would involve detailed examination by medical officers of thousands of medical records. In view of this, and as the records are held in nine different locations, this is considered impracticable.

Centurion Tanks (Question No. 4704) Mr Kennedy asked the Minister for the Army, upon notice: (1) When was the Centurion tank first acquired for the Australian Army. (2) How many have been purchased since that ARA NS date. (3) In which overseas theatres have they been used and when. 2 (4) How many are still fully operational. (5) Where are the operational tanks located, 34 22 and how many are located at each place. 2 3 (6) What was the average purchase price. (7) What is the crew of a tank, and how many are there of each rank. 1 -7 3 ourable member's question is as follows: 1 3 (1) Centurion tanks were first acquired in 1952. (2) Within the period 1952-1961, a total of 127 tanks of all configurations were received. In 1969 67 46 one further tank and three hulls were purchased from New Zealand and in 1970 a further 15 tanks from the United Kingdom (ex Hong Kong). These latter purchases were made to sustain the repair/rebuild cycle supporting tanks deployed in South Vietnam. Total acquisition since 1952 has thus covered 143 complete tanks of various configurations. (3) The only, overseas theatre where Centurion tanks have been deployed by the Australian Army is Vietnam. (4) At present 80 of the total fleet are fully operational, of which 18 are in depot stock. Repair programmes for the remainder of the fleet are in hand. (5) It would not be in the public interest to provide this information. (6) The average price of the tanks initially procured was $120,000. Later procurement of used tanks was at an average price of $14,000 from the United Kingdom and $8,000 from New Zealand. These acquisition costs do not reflect the cost of modifications and rebuilds, which cannot be fully established. 22 16 (7) The crew of the Centurion tank is 4, comprising Commander, gunner, radio operator and driver. The Commander could be an officer, the crew are troopers. casualties Canberra: Transport Services (Question No. 4712) 227 43 Mr Enderby asked the Minister for the 187 15 Interior, upon notice: (1) In relation to his answer to question No. 4390 (Hansard, 2nd November 1971, page 2888) regarding public transport services in Canberra, how is the majority demand assessed to enable his Department to determine the peak hour services to be provided. (2) If no meaningful comparisons can be made with other cities, what standard has been chosen as being appropriate to meet the needs of the people of Canberra and how was this standard selected.",174,Comparison Of New Bachelor Degree Enrolments By Sex 197 1
523,8 6 Mr Peacock,"The answer to the hon(3) Can he say whether the people of Canberra are as well provided with public transport as the people living in other Australian capital cities. (4) Has a decision ever been made to encourage or permit the transport requirements of Canberra to be satisfied more by private transport than by public transport; if so, when and why was this decision made. able member's question is as follows: (1) The majority demand is assessed by passenger counts and reports by inspectors and bus drivers. Requests by the public are also taken into account. Loadings are kept under observation and additional services are provided when required. The established pattern of peak hour services is varied to meet changes in points of passenger concentration. Before new centres of employment open the likely patronage, based on the estimated number of workers to be engaged, is assessed in order to determine the need for additional peak hour services. (2) Arising from the 1967 study of the Canberra bus service the method of operation was modified to meet the needs of the growing city more satisfactorily. The operating of the service was determined having regard to route coverage and directness, road design, bus stop spacing, loading, speed, service frequency and capacity to adhere to timetable. The service is designed to achieve the following standards: No residents further than one half mile walking distance from a bus stop. Stops at 2/10ths of a mile intervals (except on express services). Thirty minute service during business hours. Peak hour services to meet demand. Ratio of route length to shortest road distance not to exceed 1.2. In the operation of the service the aims also include the achievement of minimum journey times and avoidance of overloading. Buses are sold after approximately 10 years or approximately 200,000 miles and the new buses offer high standards of comfort and cleanliness. (3) As stated in answer to question No. 4390 (Hansard, 2nd November 1971, page 2888) it is (1) and (2) 1969-70 State (a) FOR HOME CARE SERVICES New South Wales Victoria Queensland South Australia . . Western Australia Tasmania Total doubtful whether there is any basis on which meaningful comparisons can be made. However, related to demand the service provided in Canberra is considered to be of a satisfactory standard. (4) There were privately operated bus services in Canberra until 1926. Tenders were invited for the private operation of the city bus service in 1927 and 1932 but no satisfactory contracts could be arranged. There were no later attempts to engage private operators. A i r c r a ft Industry (Question No. 4724) Mr Scholes asked the Ministerf o r Supply, upon notice: Will any proposals for a merger of the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation and the Government Aircraft Factories be presented to Parliament for ratification before any agreement is signed. ourable member's question is as follows: An in-depth study of the practicability of a merger of the 2 organisations is now in progress. The study is a complex one however and it is not expected that any firm recommendations will be made to the Government until the early months of 1972. At this stage it is too early to say how the matter will be dealt with following Government consideration. Home Care Services (Question No. 4732) Mr Cohen asked the Minister for Social Services, upon notice: (1) What moneys have been allocated to the States under the Stales Grants (Home Care) Act 1969 in each of the Budgets for 1969-70, 1970-71 and 1971-727 (2) How much of this allocation has been taken up by the States and for what purposes? honourable member's question is as follows: 1970-71 1971-72 Appropriated Expended Appropriated Expended Appropriated ? $ s s s 181.000 238,000 234.100 181,000 137,000 * 137,000 « 137,000 72,000 81,000 80,202 172,000 47,000 16,000 47.000 47,000 38,000 38,000 3,500 38,000 25.000 25,000 25,000 500,000 16,000 566,000 317,802 600,000",175,Comparison Of New Bachelor Degree Enrolments By Sex 197 1

Under the Convention, Australia's financial obligations are limited to the cost of the grain f.o.b., i.e. stored on the ship. Control of Mergers (Question No. 4761) Mr Whitlam asked the Minister representing the Attorney-General, upon notice: (1) Did Attorney-General Barwick propose that mergers should be investigated under restrictive trade practices legislation and should be held up for a certain period if more than half a million dollars is involved. (2) How many of these mergers have taken place in each year since then. MrN . H . Bowen-The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Proposals for the control of such mergers were made on behalf of Sir Garfield Barwick on 6th December 1962 (Hansard pages 3102-3113). In having the proposals put forward Sir Garfield Barwick made it clear that he was seeking the views of interested parties and of members of the public generally so us* to enable the Government to make its final decisions on the matter. In the light of the representations received the proposals were not proceeded with for the reasons stated on 19th' May 1965 by the then Attorney-General when introducing the Trade Practices Bill 196.1 (Hansard page 1656). (2) Statistical information about such mergers is not available.

(2) Into what areas has the research been directed, by whom was it undertaken and what research projects (a) are still current, (b) have been completed and (c) have been cancelled or suspended. (3) Have any papers been published pertaining to this research. provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1), (2) and (3) The health services field is extensive, covering such areas as hospitals, nursing homes, mental health institutions, medical services, community health, environmental health and quarantine. Research in these fields is being undertaken in universities, government departments and agencies, voluntary health and welfare agencies and private commercial organisations, as well as by private individuals. I am not aware of the full extent of the research being undertaken throughout Australia in all these fields and am therefore unable to provide details of the projects being undertaken or the allocation of finance. Overdosage of Drugs (Question No. 4603) MrM c l v o r asked the Minister representing ihe Ministerf o r Health, upon notice: (1) Has the Minister's attention been drawn' to the great concern expressed by doctors at the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children, Sydney, and at the Melbourne Royal Children's Hospital, due to the sharp increase in tbe incidence of accidental drug overdosage with anti-depressants among children. (2) Can the Minister say whether anti-depressants are the most common reason for the admission of children to these institutions due to drug overdose and whether admissions trebled over the past year resulting in the death of 2 children with others coming close to death from this cause.

529,Dr Forbes,"The Minister for Health has(2) An article in the Medical Journal of Australia of 23rd October 1971, contributed by the Director of the Intensive Care Unit of the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, stated that tricyclic anti-depressant overdosage is now the most common cause of admission of children to hospital for drug overdosage and that admissions from that cause have trebled. Information on this aspect from the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children, Sydney, is not readily available but it is understood that there is an impression that there has been an increase in drug overdosage from anti-depressants among children admitted to that hospital. (3) The medical profession is expected to be familiar with the potential hazards of all drugs and to issue appropriate warnings to their patients, particularly where there is a possibility that children could have access to the drugs. Poisoning of children with drugs is related principally to the careless storage of drugs in the home and is not a new problem. Changes in the incidence of poisoning with a particular drug can be related to changes in prescribing habits of doctories, the aids are fitted with batteries. However, tors. (4) In I960, the Commonwealth established the National Poisons Service. The Commonwealth also issues the National Poisons Register Manual, which contains details of the toxic constituents of a wide variety of chemical compounds, together with advice on appropriate diagnosis and treatment of poisoning. There is a close liaison between the National Poisons Service and Poisons Information Centres in the States and Territories. Particular attention has also been given to the part which safety containers may play in preventing the poisoning of children. In August 1970, the Director-General of Health wrote to all approved chemists, drawing their attention to a statement by the National Health and Medical Research Council at its 70th Session, in April 1970. At that session, Council expressed its concern at the incidence of poisoning in young children and commended the use of tablet containers that cannot readily be opened by young children. The Director-General of Health drew attention to the fact that there are containers of a type which was referred to by Council available in Australia and that, insofar as pharmaceutical benefit prescriptions are concerned, such containers come within the allowance provided by the Commonwealth for reimbursement of container costs. The Director General urged chemists to give serious consideration to the problem of poisoning in childhood and to the feasibility of implementing the recommendation, of the National Health and Medical Research Council concerning the use of safety closures for dispensed medicines. (5) (a) and (b) In the year ended 31st October sultation, a doctor collects a blood specimen from 1971, 666,715 prescriptions for anti-depressants the patient for forwarding to another doctor for a were provided as pharmaceutical benefits for pensioners and their dependants at no cost to the pathology patient. In the same period 1,502,291 prescriptions of were dispensed as pharmaceutical benefits to perthe sons other than pensioners and their dependants attendance only. at a cost of 50 cents patient contribution per prescription. Figures relating to the usage of anti-depessant been reminded that separate benefits are not paydrugs provided in public hospitals and on nonable for this service in such circumstances. pharmaceutical benefit prescriptions are not available to my Department. (c) Figures relating to production costs of antidepressant drugs are not available to my Department. Hearing Aids (Question No. 4836) Mr Wallis asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health, upon notice: In cases where hearing aids are provided to age pensioners by the Commonwealth Acoustic Laboratories, are free replacement batteries provided to the pensioners by the Laboratories. provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: No. When age pensioners are issued with hearing aids by the Commonwealth Acoustic Laborathe replacement of batteries is the responsibility of the recipient of the hearing aid. Blood Tests (Question No. 4639) Mr Grassby asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health, upon notice: (1) Was it the usual practice in many centres in New South Wales for patients requiring blood tests to be charged $4 for the doctor's consultation and $2.50 for the blood test. (2) Was it the usual practice for both charges to be recouped from medical benefit funds. (3) Are charges for the blood tests themselves now being disallowed by funds. (4) Has the change been made by, Government direction; if so, why. (5) If the change was not made at Government direction will the Minister inquire into the present changed practice of the funds. provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5). Commonwealth and fund medical benefits are payable for both a consultation and a blood test where both services are performed on the one occasion. However, it is assumed that the honourable member is concerned with the situation where, in the course of a contest. In such a situation, the collection the blood specimen is deemed to form part of consultation and benefits are payable for the While some doctors have followed a practice of making a separate charge for the collection of a blood specimen, medical benefit organisations have",178,Comparison Of New Bachelor Degree Enrolments By Sex 197 1

(2) If the position is as stated, were these restrictions designed as a deterrent to the over use of National Health Scheme prescribing although employees of the Bank of New South Wales may claim a 73 per cent rebate of medical and hospital charges beyond insurance fund rebates. (3) Will the Government extend the right of patients lo choose their type and degree of health insurance cover not only for hospital and medical costs but also for pharmaceutical costs. (4) Will he state the degree of over use of pharmaceutical, medical and hospital services by those eligible for rebate. (5) Will he explain why the Government enforces a restrictive trade practice selectively on co-operative enterprise and for pharmaceutical services but not on medical or hospital services. provided the following answer to Ihe honourable member's question: (1) (a) and (b) Yes. (2) and (5) When the patient contribution towards the cost of pharmaceutical benefits was introduced in 1960, it was intended that all persons, except pensioners, would pay the 50c charge. However, members of Friendly Societies paying membership contributions to cover the cost of their medicines were allowed to receive a rebate on all or part of the patient contribution, depending upon the particular Society's rules. Between 1960 and 1964, it became apparent lo the Government that its policy of patient participation in the cost of the Scheme was in jeopardy. The Government therefore introduced the 1964 amendments to provide that rebate provisions would be restricted to persons receiving them immediately prior to 24th April 1964. (3) In 1964, it was decided not to allow new insurance against the patient contribution towards the cost of pharmaceutical benefits. This remains the Government's policy.

(2) The first session of the NH & MRC was held in February 1937. The Council has since met at least twice a year, with advice and recommendations on a wide range of matters affecting ihe health of the community flowing from these sessions to both Commonwealth and Stale Governments. A complete record of recommendation? made by the Council is available in the form of sessional reports, but the magnitude of the task of extracting details of each individual recommendation from these reports makes it impracticable to provide a complete answer to the honourable member's question. Recent sessional reports of Council are available in the Parliamentary Library. Specific information on any particular subject of the Council's recommendations could be made available to the honourable member if he so requested. Listed below, under broad headings, are the main subjects on which the Council has considered it necessary or desirable to provide advice or recommendations. controls over the possession, use, storage and labelling of drugs and poisons; industrial hygiene and occupational health; maternal and child health; dental health;",179,Comparison Of New Bachelor Degree Enrolments By Sex 197 1

(2) When will Australia abandon its practice of using the United Kingdom to undertake our quarantine work and provide a similar establishment to New Zealand's off-shore quarantine station on Somes Island in Wellington Harbour. (3) Is it a fact that adherence to outmoded practices is denying Australia access to urgently required new genetic material to improve our crop and stock production. provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) No. (2) and (3) Consideration is being given to the establishment of an Australian high security animal quarantine station, one of Ihe purposes of which would be to facilitate the importation of new strainij of animal genetic material without risk of introducing exotic animal diseases. Jn present circumstances, the current animal and plant quarantine restrictions arc essential to prevent the entry of exotic animal and plant diseases. However, they do not preclude the importation with safety of new animal and plant genetic material on a limited basis. Cigarettes: Television Advertising (Question Nn. 4544) Dr Everingham asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health, upon notice: (1) Can Ihe Minisler say whether a one per cent levy on cigarettes would finance (a) equal time on television to combat cigarette advertising or (b) commercial television stations to compensate for loss of cigarette advertising. (2) Will the Minister discuss the possibility of such a levy with the Postmaster-General and report his conclusions to the Parliament. provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Information available to my Department indicates that such a levy would not be sufficient for either of these purposes. (2) Any such levy would primarily involve my colleague, the Treasurer. However, it should be noted that any levy or tax through which revenue derived from a particular source would be hypothecated for a particular purpose would be contrary to the essential requirements and objectives of national budgeting. Medical Benefits Organisations: Reserves (Question No. 3684) Mr Whitlam asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health, upon notice: (1) What have been the aggregate reserves of the medical benefits organisations in 1970-71. (2) What percentage of contributions did the increase in reserves represent. D r Forbes-The Ministerf o r Health has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The aggregate reserves of the medical benefits organisations as at 30th June 1971 totalled $32,397,043. (2) The aggregate reserves decreased, rather than increased, during 1970-71. The amount by which they decreased during 1970-71 was equivalent to 1.5 per cent of the total amount of contributions received by medical benefits organisations during that year. (Note: The above figures are subject to confirmation). The above figures relate to 'free' reserves, i.e., they exclude amounts set aside in respect of unpresented claims and contributions paid in advance. The Government has adopted a policy under which larger organisations' 'free' reserves will generally be limited to the equivalent of three months' contribution income. In the case of smaller organisations, more flexibility is being allowed and their 'free' reserves may be permitted to exceed that level in appropriate circumstances. This policy was implemented for medical benefits organisations in conjunction with the introduction of the Health Benefits Plan on I July, 1970. The contribution rates set at that time were designed to reduce or, if necessary, increase each organisation's 'free' reserve level to an amount equivalent to three months' contribution income in the case of the larger organisations and equivalent to six months' contribution income in the case of the smaller organisations. These reductions or increases are expected to occur gradually. Cigarettes: Radio and Television Advertising (Question No. 4526) Mr Hayden asked tbe Minister representing the Minister for Health, upon notice: (1) Can the Minister say whether Canada's four major cigarette makers have announced an industry-wide agreement to stop radio and television advertising from 1st January 1972.

(8) If consideration is not to be given, will he explain the Government's attitude to the matter. (9) Has the Government considered the desirability of requiring endorsements on cigarette and tobacco containers similar to those proposed in the Canadian House of Commons Bill; if not, will the Government consider the matter. HO) If the Government will not consider the matter, will he indicate why, (11) If the Government is not prepared to ban radio and television advertising, will it consider the imposition of a special tax on all radio and television advertising of cigarettes and tobacco aimed at raising in total an amount equal to that expended on this form of advertising by cigarette and tobacco companies with the proceeds from this tax to be allocated to an education programme through radio and television which will point out the dangers to health directly related to cigarette smoking; if not, why not. provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1), (2) and (3) Yes. (4) No. 1 understand that the industry will not cease the manufacture of any particular brands of cigarettes. However, the industry has set for itself senting the Minister for Health, upon maximum levels of tar and nicotine content in notice: cigarettes, and 1 am informed that all brands of cigarettes will be within those levels. (5) The Canadian Minister for National Health and Welfare announced an increase in tbe budget for the 'Smoking and Health Programme'. This expenses represent. Programme covers research into the effects of smoking on health and the dissemination of information about those effects. The 1971-72 budget provided the following answer to the which has been approved for these purposes is honourable member's question: $350,000 (Canadian), compared with $173,000 (Canadian) previously. (6) Yes. (7) and (8) During 1970, the Government undertook a review of cigarette advertising on radio and television. Arising out of this review, it was decided that lo reinforce health education programmes on the hazards of smoking, the voluntary code governing the advertising of cigarettes should be revised. The Government therefore undertook discussions with representatives of the cigarette manufacturing industry, media representatives and the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. The resultantrevisedcode became effective on 1st October 1971, and is basically an attempt to move the emphasis of cigarette advertising on television and radio away from children. (9) and (10) Tbe Government is guided in these matters by the advice of the National Health and Medical Research Council. The Council has recommended that cigarette packets should bear warning labels. The Government has indicated that when all State Governments have introduced legislation requiring such labels, similar legislation will be introduced in Ihe Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory.

Subsidised Health Insurance Scheme (Question No. 4136) Mr Kennedy asked the Minister representing the Ministerf o r Health, upon notice: (1) On what date did the subsidised health insurance scheme for low income earners, migrants, etc., come into effect. (2) What methods have been used to advertise the scheme. (3) How much has been spent on advertising the scheme. (4) In what ways have procedures of the scheme been simplified, as reported in the 'Age' of 12th March 1971. provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The Subsidised Health Benefits Plan commenced operation on 1st January 1970. As from 1st July 1970, the Plan was extended to provide graduated assistance with health insurance contributions to low income families whose weekly income slightly exceeds the eligibility limit for full assistance. (2) and (3) When the Plan was introduced, a special advertising campaign was carried out in January, February and March 1970. The campaign -utilised major metropolitan and country newspapers and the foreign language press. There was also extensive radio advertising. The cost of this campaign was $43,000. In January 1970, 500,000 copies ot a pamphlet titled 'Subsidised Medical Services' were distributed to health insurance organisations, hospitals and doctors. In July 1970, 500,000 copies of a revised pamphlet containing details of the new income eligibility limits were distributed through the same channels. The cost of producing each issue of these pamphlets was approximately $2,000. In April 1971, 750,000 copies of a pamphlet titled 'Help with Health Insurance' were issued when income eligibility limits for assistance under the Plan were again revised. The cost of producing these pamphlets was $3,025. In addition to publicity directed solely at the Subsidised Health Benefits Plan, this assistance has been outlined in material publicising health benefits generally. In July and August 1970, an advertising campaign was carried out through Press, radio and television following the introduction of the new Health Benefits Plan. Details of the system of graduated eligibility for subsidised benefits were included in this 'campaign, the cost of which was $83,000. Similarly, during July and September 1970, 4,500,000 copies of a booklet titled 'A Guide to the Health Benefits Plan' were issued and 4.000.000 copies of a pamphlet titled 'Your Guide to Medical Insurance' were distributed. A prominent section on subsidised health benefits was included in both the booklet and the pamphlets. (4) The entitlement certificates have been simplified, with the aim of explaining to the beneficiary, in as simple language as possible, how the assistance available under the plan may be obtained. A simplified application form has also been introduced, for use by low income families when applying for assistance. The new form may be completed and signed by a person other than the applicant, for example, the applicant's family doctor. In these cases, the entitlement certificate would be sent, not to the applicant himself, but to the person who assisted him by completing the application form. I have also instructed my Department to examine more effective ways of encouraging eligible persons to participate in the Plan. It is envisaged that the examination will encompass wider use of social workers, charitable organisations and other appropriate welfare groups in the community. Civil Aviation: Qantas Boeing 747 Services (Question No. 3468) Mr Lionel Bowen asked the Minister representing the Minister for Civil Aviation, upon notice: (1) Did the Government make any objection to the covenant in section 8 (d) of the agreement with the Boeing company and Eximbank for the purchase of four Boeing 747 aircraft.

The demands of the Parliament, however, are growing and some further attention to this pressing problem is . clearly necessary. 1 am sure this is engaging the attention of the Presiding Officers.

However, if the Honourable Member has any specific statutory bodies in mind on which he requires information then I will examine the matter and see what can be provided. Chinese Fabrics (Question No. 4640) Mr Grassby asked the Minister for Customs and Excise, upon notice: (1) Has his attention been drawn to the statement in the newsletter 'So I'm Told', circulated under the name of John Burgess, Director. Textile Council of Australia, that fabrics being imported from China and purporting to be woollen piecegoods do not contain any wool at all but in fact, comprise 60 per cent viscose and 40 per cent polyamide.",186,Comparison Of New Bachelor Degree Enrolments By Sex 197 1
548,Mr Mcmahon,"The answer to the hon(2) If so will he examine the correctness of the also a continuing function of the Department of Customs declarations accompanying the samples Customs and Excise to ensure by, every means and the duty charged. (3) If he has not seen the article, will he call goods imported. for the newsletter, examine the charges and report to the Parliament the result of his examination. able member's question is as follows: (1) I had not previously seen the newsletter mentioned, but a copy has been obtained and examined, particularly as to the textile sample card reproduced in the letter. The heading of the card is 'Wollen Piece Goods' but the composition stated in the body of the card is viscose 60 per cent and polyamide 40 per cent. I have ascertained that this card was one of a number forwarded from Mainland China to a Melbourne importer, all similarly headed but with varying compositions shown on tbe cards. Some samples were alleged to contain wool, others not. Customs analyses of the very small samples available have confirmed the actual composition as shown in the body of the cards. (2) The Customs Declaration accompanying the package of samples described the contents e.s 'Samples of Woollen Piece Goods'. As samples of negligible value, the package was released without payment of duty and most probably without examination. (3) It has been ascertained that the company receiving the samples in question has not made any commercial importations as a result of these samples. However, an examination of entries made during the last twelve months for piece goods alleged to be of wool or containing wool, from Mainland China, has shown only four such importations, these from the exporter supplying the samples in question. Two of the importations were properly, invoiced as 45 per cent wool and 55 per cent polyester. Both were imported by manufacturers, who were fully aware of the composition. The other two importations were to Sydney over nine months ago. In these instances the shipments were invoiced as woollen piece goods but recent analysis has confirmed that each contained 52 per cent polyester and 48 per cent wool. This composition docs not alter the rate of duty paid. The piece goods were correctly marked and have been offered by the importer under the correct composition. I might add for the honourable member's information that opportunity is regularly taken to confirm the application of the required marking to piece goods. No such goods from Mainland China have been detected as unmarked or incorrectly marked in the past twelve months. It is (5) As at end October 1971: 6 Coy RAASC 6 Coy RAASC Workshop. . . . available, that the correct duty is paid upon all Citizen Military Forces: Bendigo Unit (Question No. 4664) Mr Kennedy asked the Minister for the Army, upon notice: (1) In what year was the Citizen Military Forces unit located at Bendigo established.

(6) Do plans exist for new buildings, new facilities and a new location. (7) If so, when were the plans drawn up, and when will they be implemented. able member's question is as follows: (1) The Citizen Military Forces (CMF) unit located in Bendigo, 6th Company, Royal Australian Army Service Corps (RAASC), was originally raised in 1923 in Melbourne. It was relocated in Bendigo in 1962. (2) The structure of the unit has not basically changed since its location in Bendigo.

A r m y: Enlistments and Service (Question No. 4813) Mr Barnard asked the Ministerf o r the Army, upon notice: (1) How many men enlisted in (a) the first A IF and (b) the second AIF. (2) How many saw active service overseas in each case. (3) Of those who saw active service overseas, how many were married at the time of enlistment. able member's question is as follows: (1) Statistics held show that 416,809 men and women enlisted in the first AIF. A total of 727,703 enlisted in the second AIF. (2) The number who served overseas in the first AIF was 331,781 and in the second AIF was 396,661. (3) No statistics are held on the marital status Department of Defence, expended the following of those enlisted and to obtain these statistics would involve a manual search of well over a million service dossiers. Industrial Relations (Question No. 3S42) Mr Clyde Cameron asked the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice: (1) Has he considered the suggestion made by the Industrial Registrar, Dr Ian Sharp, that a commission of inquiry constituted on a Commonwealth State basis and including management, unions, lawyers, economists, academics and representatives of both Commonwealth and State Governments be instituted to consider such matters as trade union law, over-award payments, penal sanctions, the need for constitutional amendments and other problems that have arisen in recent years. (2) If so, what action does the Government propose to take in the matter. able member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The Government considered this suggestion in connection with its general review of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Although that review did not entail the formal trappings of a commission of inquiry, there was available to the Government a broad spectrum of views as to what changes should be made to the Act. Also, in my statement to the House on December7 on the outcome of that review, I said that the Government was taking the opportunity to outline its proposals to the entire community to enable responsible consideration to be given to what is intended by the Government. Australian A r m y: Expenditure . on Recruitment Activities (Question No. 3613) Mr Whitlam asked the Minister for the A r m y, upon notice: What amount was spent on Army recruiting in 1969-70 and 1970-71 (Hansard, 19th August 1970, page 215). able member's question is as follows: Expenditure Percentage of Financial by Army on total ATmy year recruiting expenditure s 1969-70 . . 143,000 0.04 1970-71 . , 172,000 0.04 In addition, the Director General of Recruiting. amounts on advertising through all media on Army recruiting: Financial year Amount 1969-70 715,978 1970-71 661.428 Industrial Relations (Question Nu. 3954) Mr Clyde Cameron asked the Minisler for Labour and National Service, upon notice: (1) Has his attention been drawn to a paper published in March 1971 in the Journal of Industrial Relations, Sydney, by Mr Ian Macphee, then of the New South Wales Chamber of Manufactures and now of the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures, condemning those who believe that the ACTU President, Mr R. J. Hawke, is responsible for the present industrial turbulence and stating that those who see Mr Hawke as a bogyman are becoming engaged in an exercise of self-delusion.

555,Mr Peacock,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) I have noted the article referred to by the honourable member. The facets are that in 1970 industrial stoppages of ten days or more, workers involved and working days and wages lost in those stoppages were 36 per cent, 6.4 per cent, 22 per cent and 34 per cent respectively higher than in 1969. Preliminary statistics show that working days and wages lost in the first nine months of this year, 2,612,700 and $38,804,200 respectively, exceed the total for the whole of 1970. These facts speak for themselves. Social Services: Reciprocal Agreements (Question No. 4145) Mr Whitlam asked the Minister for Social Services, upon notice: (1) With which countries other than Malta (Hansard, 22nd September 1970, page 1497, and 10th September 1971, page 1147) have discussions been held on a reciprocal social services agreement. (2) When were discussions first held with Malta and each other country. honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) Within the past five years there have been discussions relating to the possibility of reciprocity in social security with representatives of the countries listed below. The date on which . these discussions were commenced is also shown: July 1967-Yugoslavi a May 1967-Italy January 1968-Malt a May 1968-Federa l Republic of Germany March 1970-Turkey. In day to day discussions with other countries on immigration matters it is not unusual for passing reference to be made to social security. In general, such references have arisen from a desire on the part of the countries concerned to keep in touch with changes in social security provisions. Australian Industries: Production Costs (Question No. 4247) Mr Bryant asked the Minister for Trade and Industry, upon notice: What Australian industries, primary and secondary, have lower production costs than any other major producer. able member's question is as follows: A comparative study which would establish which Australian primary and secondary industries have lower production costs than any other producer has not been undertaken. Such a study would be a task of considerable magnitude requiring extensive research. Australian Paper Industry (Question No. 4440) Mr Allan Fraser asked the Ministerf o r Trade and Industry, upon notice: In view of the very difficult position facing Australian paper manufacturers, and particularly in view of the situation at Wiggins Teape Shoalhaven Pty Ltd paper mill at Bomaderry, will the Government direct that, where private contracts are let for Government printing work, the contract specifies that paper produced in Australia must be used. able member's question is as follows: The long-standing policy on Commonwealth Government purchasing is that, where overseas goods are in competition with local supplies, ordering authorities are required to add the cost of freight and insurance, and the appropriate amount of any duties and primage which would apply if the goods were being imported commercially. In this way, Australian manufacturers are afforded the protection to which they are normally entitled under the Tariff. (The Australian paper industry is accorded protection under the Tariff.) Exceptions may be made, and higher priced Australian goods favoured, such as when the goods are of strategic importance or the industry is depressed. Consistent with this policy, special consideration may be given to the use of Australian-made paper in private contracts for Government printing work. Brandy (Question No. 4583) Mr Grassby asked the Ministerf o r Trade and Industry, upon notice: (1) Have brandy imports into Australia since June 1968 exceeded 800,000 proof gallons representing a loss lo Australian growers of $1.3m. (2) Is the Australian taxpayer subsidising overseas grape growers to the extent of $3 per gallon. (3) Has the quantity of brandy held in bond increased from 4.2 million gallons in June 1970 to S.8 million gallons in 1971; if so, is this situation a threat to the Australian wine grape industry. (4) Has he ordered a tariff inquiry into the 15 per cent of the Australian brandy market which is represented by imports. (5) If so, when will tbe inquiry commence and when can the report be expected. able member's question is as follows: (1) Imports of brandy in the financial years 1968-69, 1969-70 and 1970-71 totalled 665,925 proof gallons. Most imports were in bulk at strengths exceeding proof. (2) The excise duty on brandy is $8.00 per proof gallon. The customs duty on most imported brandy is $8.50 per proof gallon.

560,Mr Anthony,"The answer to the honourthe Tariff at a level of $0.50 per proof gallon. There are no subsidies or import restrictions applicable to brandy. (3), (4) and (5) Stocks of Australian grape brandy held in bond increased from 5.3 million gallons at 30th June 1970 to 5.8 million gallons at 30th June 1971. On 13th October 1971, the Tariff Board was asked to inquire into the question of assistance to the Australian brandy industry. It can be expected that the Board will receive evidence on both the build up of stocks and the level of imports of brandy. The questions of whether the stock and import situations present a threat to the Australian wine grape industry are issues on which it would be appropriate for the Tariff Board to furnish advice. The Tariff Board has not as yet announced the date of commencement of its public inquiry and I am unable, at this stage, to forecast when the Board's report may be expected. Butter Fat and Vegetable Oils: Market in Japan (Question No. 4584) Mr Grassby asked the Minister for Trade and Industry, upon notice: (1) Has his Department made an assessment of tbe extent of the market for a combined butterfatvegetable oil spread in Japan. (2) Can he say whether New Zealand already has exported successfully 100 tons of this combination. (3) Have any Australian initiatives been taken; survey of all nursing homes in all States. It should if so, when. (4) If no initiatives have been taken, when can benefit, which is additional to any pension entitlethey he expected in view of New Zealand enterprise. able member's question is as follows: (1) The Department of Trade and Industry is aware of a potential market in Japan for products made from a combination of butter fat and vegetable oils. Japanese authorities have indicated their concern at the possible inflow of targe quantities of such products. It would therefore appear that the actual size of the market in Japan for these products will be determined by other than purely commercial factors and it is therefore impossible to estimate the size of the market at this time with any degree of accuracy. (2) I understand that New Zealand has prepared some samples of these products, but I am not aware of any commercial shipments made to Japan by New Zealand. (3) The possible export to Japan of a combined butter fat/vegetable oil mixture described as shortenings for use in the manufacture of foodstuffs has been tbe subject of discussions between the Australian Dairy Produce Board and commercial interests. The Department of Trade has arranged a series of Food Missions to Japan over the past 12 months. These Missions consisted of leading Australian food processors, some of whom have closely examined the Japanese market potential for these products. (4) See (3) above. Nursing Homes (Question No. 4600) Mr Kennedy asked the Minister for Social Services, upon notice: (1) Can he say what proportion of a pension is taken for care and accommodation by nursing homes run by (a) State government authorities, (b) charitable and voluntary bodies and (c) private enterprise in each State and Territory. (2) Will he provide an account of charges imposed on pensioners in public nursing homes in each State and Territory for purposes other than hospital and medical care and accommodation. (3) Will he direct his Department to undertake a sample survey of the income left to pensioners in private nursing homes after they have paid for care and accommodation; if so, will he publish the results of this survey. honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (2) and (3) Information in the detail required by the honourable member's question is not available. However, the table below compiled by the Department of Health, shows the average weekly fees which pensioner patients in nursing homes were charged during June 1971, as revealed by a be noted that the Commonwealth nursing home ment, was increased to the equivalent of $45.50 a week for intensive care patients and $24.50 for ordinary care patients (an increase of $10.50 a week in each case) with effect from 21st October 1971.

Official statistics do not provide any further breakdown of this figure. However, it is understood that the bulk of these imports consisted of grapefruit juice. Shipbuilding: Tariff Board Report (Question No. 4713) Mr Hansen asked the Ministerf o r Trade and Industry, upon notice: When does he expect to present to the Parliament the Tariff Board Report on Shipbuilding? able member's question is as follows: The Tariff Board report on the Australian shippolicy of the Government lo give information on building industry was forwarded to me by the Chairman of the Board on 12lh July 1971. The Government will release the report with the minimum of delay, consistent with a full and careful study of all aspects of the Board's findings. Decentralisation ' Mr Grassby asked the Minister for Trade and Industry, upon notice: (1) Did he tell the National Press Club in Canberra on 1st November 1971 that the delay in the work of the Federal-States officials' committee on decentralisation established 6 years ago, which has yet to produce a definitive report, was not all the fault of the Commonwealth. (2) Did he blame the relaxed attitude of some of the State governments for the delay. (3) If so, which State governments are at fault and what have they failed to do. able member's question is as follows: (1), (2) and (3) My remarks were in general terms, having in mind the time it has taken to complete the range of studies being co-ordinated by the Committee, some of which were carried out by the Commonwealth and some by the States. Details of these studies were given to the honourable member in answer to Question No. 3117 (Hansard, 6th May 1971, page 2866). I would point out however, that on the occasion referred to by the honourable member I went on to state: T think there have been difficulties in having common interests, as to how they ought to pursue decentralisation, and I am sure that in the future we are going to see more activity*. Handicapped Persons: Interdepartmental Committee (Question No. 4758) Mr Whitlam asked the Minister for Social Services, upon notice: (1) On what dates have reports been made by the interdepartmental committee established to make a survey of handicapped children and the facilities available for their use (Hansard, 28th September 1971, page 1602, and 11th November 1971, page 3440). (2) When will the reports be presented to the House. (3) What consideration has his Department given to the recommendation on physically and mentally handicapped persons by the Senate Select Committee on Medical and Hospital Costs in its report tabled on 2nd June and by the Senate Standing Committee on Mentally and Physically Handicapped Persons in its report tabled on 5th May 1971 (Hansard, 7th September 1971, page 887 and 28th October 1971, page 2792). honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) As indicated in my reply to Question No. 3718 asked by the honourable member (Hansard, 28th September 1971, page 1602) it is not the these matters which concern advice to Ministers and arrangements between Ministers and their advisers. Similarly it is not the practice to publish reports prepared for the information of Cabinet. (3) An interdepartmental committee has heen established to examine in detail the recommendations made by the Senate Standing Committee on Health and Welfare in its Report on Mentally and Physically Handicapped Persons in Australia."" This examination will encompass the more general recommendation on the physically and mentally handicapped made by the Senate Select Committee on Medical and Hospital Costs. I also refer the Honourable Member to the reply given by the Minister for Health on 23rd November 1971 (see Senate Hansard at page 1960). Superannuation (Question No. 4778) Mr FitzPatrick asked the Minister for Social Services, upon notice: As a result of the recent amendment to the Superannuation Act, what was the number of (a) age, invalid and widow pensioners in the Commonwealth whose pensions were reduced as a result of the superannuation increases, (b) cases where his Department cancelled the medical benefits entitlements and (c) pensioners whose pensions were cancelled. honourable member's question is as follows: Precise figures are not available but it is estimated that the effect of the recent increases provided under the Superannuation Act and the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act in each of the categories mentioned, was as follows: (a) 9,100, (b) 1,100, (c) 1,200.",193,Pensioner Patients In Ni Rsino Homes Average Weekly Pees Paid 1un E 1971

(2) If it was due to other reasons, what were they. (3) What was the percentage increase in total payments between the years 1966-67 and 1970-71, and what were the reasons for Uie large increase. (4) Were any of the total amounts paid between the years 1966-67 and 1970-71 used for the alleviation of financial hardship in respect of high rents, overcrowding, inability to find suitable housing, Interior, upon notice: unmarried mothers having to seek private accommodation and inability to maintain hire purchase payments and payments on motor cars which constructed were given as some of the most common reasons tion (a) on by by persons applying for distress housing in Canelsewhere forsettlements, berra as indicated in his answer to Question No. 1969-70 and 1970-71 4408 (Hansard, 2nd November 1971, pages 2889-90). (5) If so, what sum was spent for each of these reasons. (6) Can he give details of how the sum of $53,226 paid out as Welfare benefits in Canberra in 1970-71 was spent. member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The number of claims for Social able member's question is as follows: Welfare Benefits received in the Australian Capital Territory In 1970-71 (1,749) as compared with 1966-67 (1,352) had increased by 29.4 per cent. the N.T.A. or by Missions using funds supplied During the same period the mean population of the through votes of the Department of the Interior. Territory increased by 37.6 per cent. It might be assumed, therefore, that the increase in the number of claims for benefit was attributable to population increase. (3) The increase in total Social Welfare Benefit ($53,226) amounted to 223.3 per cent. As well as accounting for the higher number of benefits paid in each succeeding year, the increases in the annual amounts paid were due to various upward adjustments in the scale of benefits. In 1966 a typical recipient, a deserted wife with dependent children, received cash assistance at the rate of $26.50 per fortnight irrespective of the number of children. From July 1968 the benefit scale was aligned with the rates of pensions and benefits paid by the Department of Social Services. In June 1971 the benefit rate in respect of, for example, a deserted wife with four children and no other income was $70.00 per fortnight. (4) and (5) Social Welfare Benefits are intended primarily to help people awaiting statutory aid, who are unable to qualify for Commonwealth pensions or benefits and for various reasons cannot support themselves and their families. The payments are meant to meet subsistence!needs and are not specifically designed to cover costs such as payments, etc. (6) The total amount of $53,226 paid in Social tory in 1970-71 was distributed as follows: $ Cash assistance .. .. 47,184 Food orders .. .. .. 1,734 Spectacles for pensioners .. 3,652 Fares, medical aids and clothing 656 Total .. .. 53,226 Aborigines: Housing in Northern Territory (Question No. 4498) Mr Morrison asked the Minister for the (1) How many houses for Aborigines have been the Northern Territory Administra(b) on missions and (c) each of the years 1967-68, 1968-69, 7 (2) What was the total expenditure on Aboriginal housing within the categories mentioned for each of those years?

The appointment of Distribution Commissioners, the carrying out of the Commissioners of Commonwealth departments to functions, the preparation of the reports relating to a proposed distribution of a State and the passage of resolutions by Parliament are factors which could prevent a redistribution being effected before May 1972. Following a redistribution, the electoral rolls must be reprinted in respect of those Subdivisions and Divisions where the boundaries have been altered. (3) See Table below.

Nine reprints have been published so far this year and the total number available is about 120. (2) 311 (to 30th June 1971). (3) No. (4) Any further general reprint of the Laws of the Australian Capital Territory is a matter for determination between the Minister for the Interior and the Attorney-General. Judiciary Act: Examination by Committee (Question No. 4513) Mr Whitlam asked the Minister representing the Attorney-General, upon notice: (1) On what dates since 18th September 1969 (Hansard, 26th September 1969, page 2140) have there been meetings of the committee appointed in September 1968 to consider the provisions of the Judiciary Act (Hansard, 22nd October 1968, page 2217, 24th October 1968, page 2392, 25th February 1969, pages 66 and 107, 26th September 1969, page 2140 and 16th September 1970. page 1250). (2) When is the committee now expected to report. MrN . H . Bowen-The Attorney-General has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The Judiciary Act Review Committee has met on the following dates since 18th September 1969-24t h March 1970, 18th May 1970, 23rd June 1970, 30th June 1970, 2nd September !970, 16th September 1970, 10th November 1970, 9th December 1970, 17 December 1970, 2nd February 1971, 19ih February 1971, 11th March 1971, 30th September 1971, 10th November 1971. (2) The matter is a complex, one. The Committee hopes, however, that its report will be ready by the end of 1972. Australian Authors (Question No. 4742) Mr Les Johnson asked the Minister representing the Attorney-General, upon notice: ll) Has the Government received a proposal from the Australian Society of Authors for the introduction of a public lending right system similar to that already operating in Denmark and Sweden and at present receiving consideration by the Governments of Finland, Norway, Holland and the United Kingdom. (2) Can the Attorney-General say what are the main features of the Danish legislation. (3) What are the main features of the proposal submitted by the Australian Society of Authors. (4) Does the Government favour any other system of ensuring that Australian authors are compensated for their work, and is any legislation under consideration to achieve this end. (5) In respect of each of the last 5 years, what results in wasted time, wasted work and increased funds have been allocated to the Commonwealth Literary Fund for disbursement to authors, snd what are the names of the beneficiaries and tbe amounts paid in each case. Mr N. H. Bowen-The Attorney-General has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The Australian Society of Authors has proposed to the Government that a public lending right scheme be introduced in Australia. Schemes that are frequently referred to as public lending right schemes are in operation or under consideration in the countries mentioned in the honourable member's question. Since there are, however, significant differences between the schemes in operation in the countries mentioned, it cannot be said that tbe scheme proposed by the Australian Society of Authors is similar to the schemes in all of those countries. One of the alternative proposals put forward by the Australian Society of Authors is for the introduction of a scheme that bears a marked resemblance to the scheme in operation in Denmark. (2) The Danish legislation gives an entitlement to authors who are Danish nationals to claim from a Government fund an annual payment based on the numbers of copies of books written by them held on the shelves of public lending libraries in Denmark. (3) The Australian Society of Authors has made two alternative proposals. One alternative is for the amendment of tbe Copyright Act 1968 to give authors, as part of the copyright in their books, the right to authorize the lending of their books. The other alternative is for the establishment of a fund for the making of payments to Australian authors on a basis similar to that under which payments arc made in Denmark. (4) An investigation of the proposal made by the Australian Society of Authors is being undertaken at present. The question of other possible systems of payment to authors would only arise in the event of a decision being made not to adopt one of the schemes proposed by the Australian Society of Authors. (5) This part of the honourable member's question refers to matters falling within the ministerial responsibility of the Minister for the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts. The Minister has been asked to supply the honourable member with a written answer to this part of the honourable member's question. Commonwealth Acts: Consolidation (Question No. 4678) Mr Enderby asked the Minister representing the Attorney-General, upon notice: (1) Is it a fact that a consolidation of Commonwealth Acts has not been published since 31st December 1950, nearly 21 years ago. (2) If so, how many, Commonwealth statutes have been enacted since that date. (3) Can the Attorney-General say whether the 21-year delay in the publication pf a consolidation legal costs. (4) When will an up-to-date consolidation of Commonwealth Acts be published. (5) If the problem is one that has been handedover to outside contractors or publishers and the neglect is theirs, will the Attorney-General take immediate steps to make other arrangements. MrN . H. Bowen-The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The last bound general reprint of Commonwealth Acts was published as at 31st December 1950. Since then, however, reprints in pamphlet form incorporating all amendments to the date of reprinting have been issued from time to time for most Acts in common use. Twenty-eight reprints of Acts have been published so far this year and the total number available is about 170. If a complete set of reprints of Acts is maintained in alphabetical order, there is little occasion to refer to the 1901-1950 bound reprint. It is thought by some members of the legal profession that pamphlet reprints are more useful than complete reprints in the form of bound volumes, since the pamphlet reprints can more easily be kept up-todate than complete bound reprints, which necessarily can only be produced at intervals. (2) 2,218 (to 30th June 1971). (3) No. (4) On 9th November last, I gave the following answer to a similar question asked in the Senate: ' I have recently considered the question . whether a general reprint of Commonwealth Acts should be undertaken, and have determined that work should be put in hand towards the production of such a reprint. 'The drafting and enactment of a Statute Law Revision Bill, which reduces considerably the overall size of a reprint by, repealing Acts and portions of Acts the operation of which is exhausted and makes necessary amendments of a non-contentious nature, is desirable before a general reprint is undertaken. Such a Bill is usually enacted towards the end of a year's sittings and becomes the last Act of the year, so that Acts passed earlier in the year can if necessary be dealt with in the Bill. An officer of the Office of Parliamentary Counsel is already engaged in the preparation of a Statute Law Revision Bill, but Ihe drafting and settlement of such a Bill in consultation with the departments that administer Commonwealth Acts will necessarily take a substantial period.' (5) The problem has not been so handed over. Crimes of Violence: Compensation for Victims (Question No. 4256) Mr Whitlam asked the Minister representing the Attorney-General, upon notice: As the Commonwealth is now considering legislation to compensate the victims of crimes of violence in the mainland Territories (Hansard. 20th August 1971, page 468), is it proposed to have the Standing Committee of Commonwealth and State Attorneys-General again discuss the question of uniform legislation in the States (Hansard. 10th October 1968, page 1902). MrN . H . Bowen-The AttoroneyGeneral has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: No. As was indicated in the answer in Hansard, 10th October 1968, page 1902. the question of the introduction of any such legislation is felt to be a matter for each Stale to decide. ' Adult Rights (Question No. 3621) Mr Whitlam asked the Minister representing the Attorney-General, upon notice: On what matters and what dates (a) has each State Parliament enacted, and (b) has each State Government proclaimed or will it proclaim legislation giving adult rights lo persons under 21 years of age. MrN . H . Bowen-The AttoroneyGeneral has provided the following answer the honourable member's question: New South Wales On 13th November 1970, the Minors (Property and Contracts) Bill was assented to and on 4th June 1971 the Act was proclaimed to commence on 1st July 1971. The Act provides that persons who have attained the age of 18 years have full legal capacity and adult rights in relation to, among other things, matters of contract and property. A full list of matters in which persons over 18 are relieved of the disability of infancy is set out in s. 6(1) of the Act. South Australia On 8th April 1971, the 'Age of Majority (Reduction) Kill"" was assented in and on 15th \pril 1971, the Act was. proclaimed to commence on that day. This Act provides that persons who have attained the age of 18 years shall be of full age and capacity except for certain specified matters including conditions, rights and obligations of employment. The Constitution Act Amendment Act (No. 2) 1970-1971, which is expressed to come into force on a date to be fixed, or at the latest on ""HUh June 1972, reduces the voting age under State law lo 18 years. Western Australia The Mousing Advances (Contracts with Infants) Act 1968 enables minors in the age group 18-21 years to enter into valid and enforceable mortgages to secure repayment of housing loans made to them. The Electoral Act Amendment Act (No. 2) 1970 which came into force on 5th December 1970 reduced the voting age under State law to 18 years. Victoria The Properly Law (Loans to Minors) Act 1961, us amended, enables minors in the age group 18-21 years to enter into valid and enforceable mortgages to secure repayment of housing loans made to them. Queensland The Real Property Acts Amendment .Act 1963 enables minors in the age group 18-21 years to enter into valid and enforceable, mortgages to secure repayment of housing loans made to them. Future Legislation A Bill to reduce the age of majority from 21 years to 18 years of age was introduced in the Tasmanian House of Assembly on 25th November 1971. by the State Attorney-General. Clause .1 of the Bill provides that upon the legislation coming into operation persons who have attained or who attain the age of 18 years shall be deemed to attain full age and full capacity for the purposes of the laws of the State, except for certain specified matters including conditions, rights and obligations of employment. Dual Nationality (Question No. 4807) Mr Hurford asked the Minister for Immigration, upon notice: (1) Is it a fact that Australia will not allow a citizen enjoying Australian nationality to also hold the nationality of another nation; if not, why not. (2) Is it also a fact that many migrants in Australia are deterred from becoming naturalised because dual nationality is not permitted. (3) Can he say which countries allow their citiable member's question is as follows: zens to hold dual nationality. able member's question is as follows: (!) No. Australia does not favour dual nationgeographically only by the exclusion of certain ality, but recognises it where it occurs. Whether a person loses his original nationality the Iron Curtain countries. upon becoming an Australian citizen depends entirely upon the nationality law of the country travelling under the Special Passage Assistance of his original nationality. Australia does not Programme come from the countries of western require that an applicant for Australian citizenEurope and the Americas. ship should divest himself of any other citizenship he may possess before he is granted Australian citizenship. (2) No. (3) 1 am unable to provide a complete list of countries which allow their citizens to hold dual nationality. However it is known that migrants from some countries retain their original nationality, upon becoming Australian citizens. These include migrants from Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, France, Greece, Hungary, Poland, Roumania, Switzerland, Turkey, the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics and Yugoslavia.

Immigration: Special Passage Assistance Programme (Question No. 4057) Mr Whitlam asked the Minister for Immigration, upon notice: (1) In which countries does the Special Passage Assistance Programme operate. (2) How many persons of (a) European, (b) partly European and (c) non-European descent migrated from each of these countries to Australia in the latest year for which statistics are available. (3) How many applications affecting persons in each category in each country were (a) received, (b) approved and (c) rejected under the programme in that year. (1) The Special Assitance Programme was introduced to provide unilateral passage-cost assistance could not be assisted under other migration agreements or arrangements.

United Stales of America South America South Africa It will be appreciated that many applications lapse through loss of interest or are withdrawn before determination and that enquiries in some cases are protracted. These are some of the factors which account for the gap between the totals of the approval and rejection figures and those for applications received. Since, as mentioned above, assisted passages are available only to migrants of European origin, these .figures would not include any non-Europeans or people of mixed descent. Rural Reconstruction (Question No -4871) "" Mr Kennedy asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice: (1) What (a) number and (b) percentage of ourable member's questions are as follows: -applications for assistance under the ruralreconstruction scheme for (i) farm build-up and (ii) debt reconstruction have been (A) received, (B) struction) Act 1971, does not provide for grants accep'.ed"" and (C) rejected in (1) each State and to finance reconstruction of farms in CommonTerritory and (II) the Commonwealth.

580,Mr Sinclair,"The . answers to the hon(3) Under the States. Grants (Rural Reconstruction) Acl the States are required to utilise any funds available to the State from balances arising from tbe operation of the Commonwealth Loan (Farmers' Debt Adjustment) Act before any financial assistance is provided by the Commonwealth tinder the rural reconstruction scheme. Up to 7th December only N.S.W. and WA. had requested advances from the funds available under die Rural Reconstruction Scheme. $10m has been advanced, to N.S.W. and $3m to WA. The States did not specify how much of these advances were to be used for farm build-up and how much for debt reconstruction. At this time a disection of expenditure on farm build-up and debt reconstruction is not available. Total expenditure by the States on rural recon-. struction, from the inception of the scheme to 30th November has been: N.S.W. 94.4m, United Nations Agencies: East Pakistan (Question No. 4745) Mr Enderby asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice: (1) What agencies of the United Nations are operating in East Pakistan; (2) Which of the agencies are providing food aid; (3) What is the nature and extent of the food aid. M t N . H . Bowen-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The United Nations Secretary-General has established in East Pakistan a United Nations East Pakistan co-ordinate United Nations and other international emergency aid. The following organisations connected with the United Nations normally operate in East Pakistan: United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF); World Food Programme (WFP): World Health Organisation (WHO); Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO): United Nations Development Programme (UNDP); International Labour Organisation (ILO); United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the World Bank Group. Normal aid activities undertaken by these organisations have been temporarily halted. (2) UNEPRO; UNICEF; WFP. (3) The following food aid has been pledged: (f) through UNEPRO: Australia: 4,780 tons rice-US$557,75 0 Japan: 3,650 tons rice-$US500,000 Federal Republic of Germany: 27,000 tons food grains-$US3,000,00 0 Netherlands: food grains and dairy products-$US 1,500,000 United States: 100,000 tons wheat and 75,000 tons rice-JUS32,625,00 0 (ii) through UNICEF: United States: 35,000 tons of corn, soy, milk and wheat/soy blend$USl0,772,OO0 (iii) through WFP: Canada: 80,000 tons wheat$US7,000,000 United States: 50,000 tons food grains-$US7,7OO,O0 O These supplies can be regarded as responses to the current emergency situation. The WFP has also completed plans for three food aid projects valued at $US3 million for quasi-emergency rehabilitation purposes. East Pakistani Refugees (Question No. 462V) Vie. Old S.A. WA. TBS. Mr Hayden asked the Ministerf o r 11.3m. *1.8m. SO. 3m. $0.1 m. Nil. Foreign Affairs, upon notice: (1) Does the Government, regard the sustenance of the East Pakistani refugees presently in India as the primary responsibility of the (a) Indian Government, (b) Pakistan Government or (c) international community. (2) Can he say what proportion of the current cost of feeding and housing the East Pakistani refugees in India is currently being borne by (a), the Indian Government, (b) the Australian Government, (c) other Governments and (d) international organisations and charities. (3) What long-term strategy for the maintenance of the East Pakistani refugees does the Government support. (4) What positive steps has the Government taken to encourage political conditions favourable to the return of the refugees to their homeland. MrN . H . Bowen-The answer to the Relief Operation (UNEPRO) to honourable member's question is as follows: (1) In my statement to the House on 27th October, 1 referred lo the fact that the question of providing relief for the refugees has been recognised as an international one and noted that the Government acknowledges its obligation to make a significant contribution to the international effort. (2) The most recent information available to the Government is that the cost of refugee relief to the end of Mareh 1972 is estimated to be $US700m. The Government of India has made budgetary provision for Rs2.6 billion ($US35lm) up to the end of December 1971. The value of foreign assistance so far is estimated at $US235m of which $USI87m has been pledged by governments and $US48m by non-governmental oriHi-isations. The Australian Government's pledges to the area total $A5.5m of which $4.5m is for the refugees in India, (n addition, Australian volunt try organisations have provided about $A2m for the refugees. (3) The Government supports the attainment of a political settlement which would enable the refugees lo return to their homeland. (4) The situation in East Pakistan is the primary responsibility of the Government of Pakistan. The Australian Government has been active, however, in confidential diplomatic exchanges directed towards reaching a political settlement Oysters (Question No. 4919) Mr Wallis asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice: (J) Did the Standing Committee on Fisheries, at a recent meeting, discuss the possibility of an import licence being granted to the firm of Oyster Farmers ColTun Bay Ply Ltd for the import of live oyster spat from Japan. (2) If so, what (a) decision was reached and (b) reasons were given for the decision by the committee on this matter. able member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. . (2) (a) A report was prepared for submission to the Australian Fisheries Council which will meet in Hobart in March 1972 and (b) The committee is not a decision making body nor is the Council, but its recommendation will be submitted to the Minister for Customs and Excise who has the administrative responsibility. Meat Exports (Question No. 4791) Mr Grassby asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice: (1) Has the Australian Meat Board announced that the 1971 meat quota for the United States of America was 15,000 tons short. (2) If so, can he say whether this quota has been re-allocated to other countries including Ireland' and New Zealand. (3) Have cattle prices dropped in some instances by as much as $25 a head as a result of this short-fall in exports to the United States of America. (4) Has the short-fall been the result of poor trading by Australia and inadequate initiative by the Meat Board. (5) Has an inquiry been carried out as a result of the short-fall; if so, with what results. (6) If an inquiry has not been carried out, will he initiate one immediately. able member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Yes. (3) An examination of auction prices at the Sydney and Melbourne selling centres shows that prices for slaughter cattle in November declined hy aproximately $1 per 100 lb on October levels. This decline is considerably less than $25 per bead and cannot be specifically related to any angle course. (4) No. (5) and (6) No. The reasons for the shortfall, which are already known 'to both tbe Government and the Australian Meat Board, arise from the dock strike in the United States, the economic measures imposed in that country and tbe international currency crises arising from those economic measures. Poultry Industry: Stabilisation (Question No. 4847) Mr Kennedy asked the Ministerf o r Primary Industry, upon notice: (1) Is there an increasing tide of bankruptcy in the poultry industry and is the incidence of bankruptcies growing daily. (2) If so. will he ask the Prime Minister to bring personal pressure to bear on the Victorian Government to agree to industry stabilisation now so desperately needed and agreed to by all States except Victoria. able member's question is as follows: (1) Enquiries made through the respective State Egg Marketing Boards show that there has been no increase this year in the number of bankruptcies in the egg industry. In fact bankruptcies have been fewer in 1971 than they were last year. However, this is not an indication that the industry's profitability is increasing. There are many producers who are experiencing financial difficulties because of the effect on returns of excessive production. (2) The Commonwealth Government has made it clear on a number of occasions that it would support any constitutional scheme acceptable to a majority of egg producers to regulate egg production. However production control is the prerogative of the States and following the decision of the Victorian Government not to join with the other mainland States in a co-ordinated scheme of control the Victorian Minister of Agriculture stated he could see no useful purpose in the suggestion made by the South Australian Minister of Agriculture that a special meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council be held to consider the matter. In the circumstances there appears to be no alternative but to await the next meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council in February when the subject has been listed for discussion. War Service Land Settlement (Question No. 4416) Mr Kirwan asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice: (1) How many farms allocated in Western Australia to War Service Land Settlement were (a) established, (b) project and (c) single unit. (2) How many 600-700 acre pasture project area farms are west of Mount Barker. (3) What is the average rental for (a) a wheat and sheep farm and (b) a 600-700 acre pasture project farm west of Mount Barker. (4) What has been the average gross return per annum for the period 1960-1968 from (a) wheat and sheep farm and (b) a project farm west ol Mount Barker.",204,Settler Arrivals 1970 71

583,Mr Sinclair,"The answer to the honour(5) How many settlers failed for financial reasons in (a) wheat arid sheep area and (b) the project areas of Mount Barker. (6) If a larger percentage of the failures was from the project areas, can he say why this occurred when all settlers were selected on the basis of eligibility, suitability and qualifications as settlers. (7) Was it the policy of die War Service Land Settlement to force settlers on project farms west of Mount Barker to breed fat lambs on oestrogen dominant clover pasture, e.g. yarloop, and did the Rural and Industries Bank also adopt this policy. (8) During the assessment period on project farms west of Mount Barker, was it the administration or the settler who was responsible for tbe farm policy on individual farms in regard to type of stock carried. (9) Are the 600-700 acre pasture project area farms west of Mount 'Barker still considered a viable am) economic unit. (10) If so, why is the Rural Reconstruction Committee allocating extra adjoining farms to some settlers. able member's question is as follows: War Service Land Settlement in Weslern Australia was conducted initially under an agreement between the Commonwealth and the State and subsequently through grants of financial assistance to the Slate subject to defined conditions. Under these arrangements the Commonwealth's role was mainly concerned with policy formation and the provision of finance. The detailed administration of the scheme was carried out by the State through a Land Settlement Board. This Board ceased to function as from 31 August, 1966. Commonwealth records, therefore, are not as detailed as would be necessary to answer all the questions asked. The State, at the present time, is unable to assist. In these circumstances the best information available in answer to the honourable member's question is: The Australian Wool Board has paid for the following overseas visits by Sir William Gunn during the past five years: Countries Year 1966-67 . .

(b) Rocky Gully Project-$40 4 per half year. Perillup Project-$41 4 per half year. Denbarker Project-$43 6 per half year. (4) -(6) Information not available. (7) Pastures were seeded to plant species laid down by the Stale Department of Agriculture. The seeding of the farms west of Mount Barker took place years before Yarloop clover was suspected of causing infertility problems. Only the low wet areas were seeded to a mixture containing Yarloop and on an average would involve only 50 or 60 acres with a few up to 150 to 200 acres of a 50 per cent mixture. Settlers were not forced to breed fat. lambs but were actively encouraged to diversify by both the Board and the Bank. (8) The settler, but availability frequently dictated the type of stock carried. (9) Commonwealth officers have not the information as to the present carrying capacity of each farm and so are unable to express an opinion. (10) The Rural Reconstruction Committee does not allocate farms. It provides financial assistance under certain circumstances to those who require to expand for various reasons. I have been informed that no settlers in the Rocky Gully, Perillup or Denbarker projects have been assisted to purchase adjoining farms.

585,Mr Sinclair,"The answer to the honourHealth: Cigarette Smoking (Question No. 4527) Mr Hayden asked the Postmaster-General, upon notice: (1) Did the recent Annual Report of the Department of Health stale that during the past 25 years it has become increasingly apparent that cigarette smoking is a major cause of ill health. (2) Has his attention been drawn to a claim in the recent Annual Report of the Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria that control of lung cancer now requires Government intervention to remove cigarette smoking on the one hand and to increase smoking education programmes on the other. (3) Can he say whether cigarette manufacturers in Canada have agreed lo cease all radio and television advertising after 1st January, 1972, as a result of concern expressed by the Canadian Government and the serious threat lo public health caused by smoking. . (4) Has television and radio advertising of cigarettes and smoking in the United Slates ceased for similar reasons. (5) Can he say in what other countries of the world radio and television advertising of cigarette and tobacco smoking has been stopped (A) voluntarily and (B) compulsorily. (6) Does he still defend and uphold the right ol television and radio advertising of cigarette and tobacco smoking on the basis that it is profitable to these media of communication: if so, why docs he enshrine die right of profit-making ahead of the interests of public health. Sir Alan Hulme-The answer to the honourable member's ques'ion is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Tbe Chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board has informed me that this claim was made in the recent Annual Report of the Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria, although the actual reference in the report was to the removal of cigarette promotion rather than the removal of cigarette smoking. (3) I understand that the Canadian Government has decided to prohibit all advertising and promotion of cigarettes from January next year. (4) The United States of America have already banned cigarette advertising on radio and television. (5) The ban which has been placed on cigarette advertising in certain overseas countries appears to vary somewhat from country to country. From information available to me there are currently some 13 countries in which a ban on cigarette advertising has been imposed to some degree; in some cases the ban applies only to television advertising, in other cases to television and radio and in a few cases to all advertising media. AlthoughI am aware of only 13 countries applying a ban, the honourable member has no doubt noticed that the most recent Annual Report of the Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria suggests that cigarette advertising on television is now banned in 17 countries, including Britain, America and Canada; the ban in the case of Canada is, of course, to apply after 1st January, 1972. I am not in a position to provide any accurate information on whether the ban on cigarette advertising in the countries concerned was applied voluntarily or compulsorily, although 1 understand (hat in the case of Denmark the ban on cigarette adverting on radio, television and in the cinema, was voluntarily applied. (6) This portion of the honourable member's question presents an opportunity for me to correct a wrong impression which seems to have been gained from an answer I gave reccntlv at Question time on this subject. Initially it mu-i be understood that the question of any controls on cigarette advertising or distribution is basically one for my colleague, the Minisler for Health, and his department. The matter has been considered several times by the National Health and Medical Research Council, and the implementation of some of the recommendations made by that body is a matter for Slate Government* \s far as the Federal Government is concerned, the Cabinet has carefully considered the submissions made to it, and has firmly decided that the situation is best handled by an education canr-. i""ti regarding the hazards of smoking, and by a voluntary agreement regarding some forms nf advertising. It follows therefore that the production and marketing of cigarettes is an entirely legal operation, and to ban their advertising on radio and television only would be an act of discrimination against some media, to ihe very great advantage of others. In the United Stales, for instance, two surveys have recently been published showing the startling increase in the advertising of cigarettes in magazines since such advertisements were banned in the broadcast media. Such advertising in most leading magazines increased by well over 100 per cent compared with the same period the previous year, and in one case the increase was 533 per cent. In the light of this information it is apparent, that any action to ban cigarette advertising on radio and television would only have the effect of very substantially redistributing advertising income among the media, which depend on that revenue for existence, without bringing about any change in the total volume of such advertising I should add that the voluntary code governing the advertising of cigarettes, recently revised by the industry, in consultation wilh the Department of Health and the Control Board, appears to have achieved its object in that no advertising of this nature is now broadcast or televised in proximity to programmes which are addressed to young people. It is not for me, of course, as Postmaster General to determine the matter of any health hazards which may accompany the smoking of cigarettes. WhatI am attempting to do is to put forward the argument that discrimination in respect of one section of the advertising media-because it is one over the which the Federal Government can exercise some controls-canno t bo justified.

The aim is to obtain the best value for the money spent by accepting the lowest suitable tender. To place tenderers from different States on an equal footing, however, tenderers are invited to quote on the basis of delivery only to their capital city. N.S.W.

Woomera (Question No. 4775) Mr Wains asked the Minister for Supply the following question: (1) Have the staff and equipment at Woomera Village, required for maintaining town services such as rubbish disposal and drain cleaning, been drastically reduced since 1967. (2) If so, has this reduction caused a large accumulation of uncleared rubbish throughout the Woomera Village area, resulting in health hazards from flies. (3) Have there been any recent outbreaks of hepatitis in the Woomera Village. (4) If so, were investigations carried out by medical officers at Woomera as' to the cause of the outbreaks. (5) If investigations were carried out, what were the findings and recommendations relating to the outbreaks. ourable member's question is as follows: (1) The staff and equipment at Woomera Village required for maintaining town services such as rubbish disposal and drain cleaning has not been drastically reduced since 1967. In answer to a previous question related to this subject (Question on Notice, No. 887, Hansard3 June 1970, Page 2903) it was indicated that there had been a decrease in staff, partly as a planned reduction and partly due to difficulty in recruiting labour. No further planned reductions have taken place since then but difficulty in recruitment has been experienced. When necessary, assistance to the Section concerned is provided from other sections of the Woomera work force. (2) No. (3) There have been 12 cases of hepatitis in Woomera since 1 July 1971, 6 in September and 6 in October.

(5) The report of the Senior Medical Officer did not establish the cause of the original infection but indicated that the subsequent spread of the Pakistan but has not yet delvoleped. According disease was most probably due to close personal contaci. All residents in the Woomera Village were advised to pay particular attention to personal hygiene. East Pakistani Refugees (Question No. 4559) Mr Jacobi asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs on notice: (1) Will the Government propose to the United Nations Assembly that the pitiful conditions of the nine million refugees now in West Bengal, and the situation in East Pakistan, pose a threat to peace and international security and that consequently the United Nations Organisation should endeavour to bring about a peaceful settlement that will meet the already democratically expressed wishes of the people of East Pakistan. (2) Will he take appropriate steps for Australia to initiate or support moves at the United Nations for the supply of large quantities of food grain to East Pakistan to meet the expected shortfall of two million tons in the next six months and to ensure that distribution is carried out under the supervision of United Nations agencies. (3) Will the Government ascertain from the Government of Pakistan (a) the present whereabouts and state of health of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, President of the Awami League and (b) whether or not Sheikh Mujibur Rahman has been charged with any offences and, if so, whether he had been tried, by what tribunal or court was he tried and what was the result of the trial. (4) Will the Government offer permanent residence to at least 1,000 refugees from East Pakistan who are considered to have suitable qualifications for permanent settlement In Australia. (5) Docs the Government have a commitment to provide military aid to Pakistan in 1971/72 under the South-East Asia Collective Defence Treaty or any other agreement; if so, what form of assistance will be provided. (6) Was Australian military aid provided to Pakistan in 1970-71 under this Treaty or any other agreement: if so, is any of that aid still unsatisfied. Mr N. H. Bowen-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Australian Government has exercised and will continue to exercist Its influence in whatever way it can to reduce tension in the Indian sob-continent. (2) Australia's relief aid for East Pakistan is being provided through the United Nations in response to appeals by the Secretary-General cn 16 June, 16 July and 13 August. Details of this humanitarian aid, amounting to $1 million and including a shipment of rice worth $485,000, were announced in the House by the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs on 5 October. Australia's aid is intended to meet priority needs as assessed by the United Nations authorities who are arranging its distribution in consultation with local authorities. A food shortage has been expected in East to the latest assessments a food shortage might be felt by next March.

595,Mr Sinclair,"The answer to the honourEast Pakistani Refugees (Question No. 4620) Mr Hayden asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice: (1) Has his attention ben drawn to a report in The Australian Financial Review of 20th October 1971 of a statement by the Chief of Public Affair; of the United Nations High Commissions for Refugees that the Australian Government asked the United Nations to pay for transportation ctv-.ts incurred in shipping medical and food supplies ti> the refugee disaster area in India. (2) If so, and if the Government has made ihe request, why did the Government take this unusual step. (3) Can he say whether any estimates have been made by the Indian Government, the United Nations or other responsible organisations as lo the current monthly food and medical requirements needed to sustain the refugees in India. (4) . Has the Government communicated with the Indian Government on the nature and extent of the aid which Australia can provide to relieve the suffering of the Pakistani refugees. Mr N. H. Bowen-The answer to the houourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. Australia offered rice to India on f.o.b. terms as provided under the Food Aid Convention for gifts of food aid. The Government also informed the United Nations authorities nf the offer. India asked the UN.H.C.R. whether the High Commission could pay for the freight. The UN.H.C.R. said that it would and the lice was then formally provided to India through the UN.H.C.R. Australia is making a cash contribution to the UN.H.C.R. of $500,000 which is more than sufficient to cover the freight costs on rice estimated at $140,000. Australia has paid the freight costs of all other supplies provided far the refugees. The following is the full text of a statement made by Mr Ole Volfing, Head of Fund-raising Activities of the UN.H.C.R. on 24th October (forwarded to the Government by the UN.H.CR. Representative for Australia and New Zealand): ' I hereby wish to state that I have not, at any stage of my meetings with journalists during my visits to Australia or New Zealand, criticised the Australian Government for the size of its contribution or for the freight arrangements made in connection with their generous gift of $Alm worth of rice. On Thursday, October 21. the 'Australian Financial Review' quoted me incorrectly, including quoting me as having said that I am surprised Australia has asked the UN.H.C.R. to pay the transport costs of the rice. On Thursday afternoon, October 21, when 1 arrived in Wellington"" I was asked by the Wellington Correspondent of 'The Australian' if I would give a statement, in the light of the quotation in (he 'Australian Financial Review' It was at that moment I learned the quotation in the 'Australian Financial Review' of the same day. 1 dictated a statement to the Wellington Correspondent of the 'Australian' on one condition-namely , that it would be published in the 'Australian' in full and without any changes. If this could not be promised I had no comments as I did not want to be misquoted once more. The Wellington Correspondent promised that tbe statement would either be published in full or not published at all, based on which I then dictated my statement. I therefore deeply regret to see on passing through Sydney Airport today. Sunday. October 24, a copy of the 'Australian' of Friday, October 22, which does not publish my statement at all but Mislead publishes quotations of something I have never said-suc h as the UN.H.C.R. has to go to Sweden or some other country for the money. I wish to make it clear that it is the usual privilege of any government to decide if, how and under what conditions it wishes to contribute to the humanitarian programme of the United Nations and that I , as a United Nations civil servant, could not comment on or question the decision of the Australian Government in this respect. AndI find it most unfortunate that Australian newspapers have misquoted me as part of their domestic disagreement with the Government."" (2) See answer to (1) above. (3) The Government of India has estimated food and medical requirements for a refugee population of eight million for a period of 6 months as follows: FOOD Rice .. .. . . 388,800 metric tons Wheat. . .. . . 129,600 metric tons Edible oil .. .. 32,284 metric tons Sugar. . .. .. 67,676 metric tons Pulses. . .. . . 129,600 metric tons Salt .. .. .. 25,920 metric tons Milk powder .. .. 23,000 metric tons Baby food .. . . . 32,400 metric tons Semolina .. .. 1,350 metric tons Butter oil .. .. 1,080 metric tons Construction of stores, hospitals, dispensaries, etc. .. 160 camps Hospital size community tents 660 units Initial hospital equipment . . SUS8.4I5.999 Medicines .. SUS9.I41.333 Hospital maintenance .. 16,000 beds Medical personnel .. $US5,290,666 (4) Yes. The Government's policy in providing relief assistance is to concentrate on those items which have been given priority by the Indian and UN. authorities. To this end the Government has been in continuing contact with the Indian Government. The Australian High Commissioner in New Delhi, Mr Patrick Shaw, has just completed a series of briefings in Australia during which he advised the Government as to the current thinking of Indian authorities in regard to the ways of best assisting the refugees. Telephone and Teleprinter Charges (Question No. 4754) Mr Whitlam asked the Postmaster General, upon notice: (1) What is the estimated cost of extending the telephone and teleprinter charges in the Melbourne metropolitan area to each of the places which on 26th September 1967, the Victorian Decentralisation Advisory Committee recommended for accelerated development. (2) Has he received the report from his Department on the possibility of having a single charge covering local calls and trmii calls throughout Australia (Hansard, 8th September 1971, Page 904); if so, when will the report be presented to Ihe House. Sir Alan Hulme-The answer to the honourable follows: (1) Some limit has to be placed on the distance over which local calls be allowed, having regard to the economics of plant provision and the costs of operating and maintaining the telephone network as a whole. Adoption of the proposal recommended by the Victorian Decentralisation Advisory Committee to include Ballarat, Bendigo. Wodonpa/Alhury in the Melbourne metropolitan area for call charging purposes would entail an extension of the limits of the existing Melbourne local call area which simply could not be justified on economic grounds It .would also entail a heavy iprrrase on the rentals 'or telephone services in those country areas, which, although offset Government initiated discussions between Comto some degree-by a reduction in call fees, would be objected to strongly by those subscribers who did not have a marked community of interest with the metropolitan area and therefore did not call Melbourne subscribers very often. Moreover, the granting of any preferential treatment to. the centres mentioned would have far reaching repercussions so far as the Post Office is concerned »ince other centres-no t only in Victoria,'but also in the other States-woul d seek similar treatment in respect of telephone calls to their capital city. Simi'ar comments also apply in the case of telex charges except that the charging districts are somewhat larger. Ballarat, Bendigo and Latrobe Valley telex subscribers are already included jin the Melbourne charging district and, consequently, calls between these subscribers and Melbourne are at the minimun rate. Calls from Portland and Wodonga.'Alhury te'ex subscribers to Melbourne fall within the 101-20 0 miles category and because of the distance involved their inclusion in die Melbourne district could not be justified. In any case, such action hardly be taken without due cognizance being given to the claims of other centres. (2) No. ihe many implications of the proposal to introduce uniform charge for all telephones are still under examination by my Department. Educational Television Mr Barnard asked the Posmaster-General, upon notice: What steps have been taken by the Government to implement the recommendations of the Weeden Committee on Educational Television whose report was completed in 1964. Sir Alan Hulme-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The basic policy of the Government in relation to educational television, following its consideration of the report of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board's Advisory Committee on Educational Television Services (the Weeden Committee), was outlined in a statement which I made in Parliament on 11th May, 1966. Whilst the Government supported the Committee s views that instructional television programmes ought to be developed as an integral part of the Australian education system, and agreed that education was primarily a matter for State Authorities member's question is as the Government did not accept the proposal of the advisory Committee that' a separate network of educational television stations was necessary. It considered that the facilities of the Australian Broadcasting Commission and those of commercial stations, if required, were adequate for the forseeable future to provide satisfactory educational television services. It was considered by the Government, that, as Latrobe Vaaey, Portland and education was a sovereign responsibility of the States, an essential first step in assessing the requirements for educational television was to first obtain from State Governments details of their needs and priorities, and the extent to which they would be prepared to incur expenditure on educational television services. For this purpose, the monwealth and State Ministers at a conference held in 1966 and the State Governments have since been examining their individual positions in this matter, bearing in mind' their heavy commitments in the field of education generally. The Commonwealth had previously indicated that it was prepared to provide some additional finance for expanding instructional television programmes If such expansion were desired by the States, and if the States were also prepared to contribute resources for the purpose. . A further conference took place on 17th November, 1969. by which time it had become apparent that overseas development of new techniques in electronic aids to teaching, particularly advances in television recording and renlav requirements, had become a significant consideration in relation to any planning for the future development of educational television services. Accordingly, it was agreed at the 1969 Conference that a Special Committee comprising Commonwealth and State representatives should be established for the purpose of investigating technological developments with a view to reporting back to a further meeting of Federal and State Ministers. Whilst the committee's investigations are still continuing, they have been complicated by the fact hat a system for the recording and replaying of educational television programmes, to be effective, must meet the every-dav educational requirements of simplicity in operation, interchangeability between reproducing units and maximum reliability with minimum technical maintenance. On present indications, it would seem possible that the use of recorded programmes and playback machines may be the answer rather than the use of a transmitted system of educational television programmes; this bears out the wisdom of the Government's original decision not to proceed with the establishment of a transmitted system of educational television services. Whilst it was recognised that a study of the technology developments would not be a short term project, it is essential, nevertheless, to have an informed view on the various issues relating to educational television prior to any decision being taken as to the manner in which educational television services might most appropriately be developed. The position is therefore that the whole question of educational television is still under consideration Department, entitled 'Fees at non-government both from a technological viewpoint and from the aspect of the needs and priorities ot State governments in this field. As the Honourable member will be aware, the Australian Broadcasting Commission is* continuing to provide a considerable number of hours of educational television programmes. Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (Question No. 4184) Mr Barnard asked the Minister for Eduto indicate the relative urgency of the capital cation and Science, upon notice: (1) Is Australia a member of. the Organisation which they released on 1st September 1970 for Economic Co-operation and Development. (2) If so, will the OECD make a review of October 1970, page 2090; 7th April 1971, page Australia's national science policy on the lines of 1638). reviews made of Sweden, Greece, Belgium, France, the United -.Kingdom and Germany government schools been collected. (together), Japan, the United States of America, Italy, Canada and Norway? Mr Malcolm Fraser-The answer to .the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes, Australia became a member of the follows: Organisationfor Economic Co-operation and Development in June 1971. (2) OECD has under review the directions that anil my own Department since 8th October 1970. its future activities should take in relation to My predecessor, however, attended a meeting of science and technology. No request by OECD for the Australian Education Council in Brisbane at review of the kind referred to has been made.

Mr Malcolm Fraser-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) Governmentschools do not charge tuitition fees. In some schools fees such as sport, library and textbook fees are levied but information on the extent to which these charges are made is not available. (b) and (c) Because of the differences which exist between schools in the level of fees charged, and the variations in fees for different grades within schools it is not possible to derive average annual fees for non-government schools. Information about fees charged as at June 1970 at nongovernment schools offering courses up to and including the final year of secondary schooling can be obtained from a -1970 publication by my schools'. . Education: Survey and Department (Question No. 3655) Mr Whitlam asked the Minister for Education and Science, upon notice: (1) When and where have representatives of State Education Departments and his own Department consulted since 8th October, 1970 on his predecessor's letter to the State Education Ministers on 11th September 1970 requesting them works mentioned in the summary of the findings of the Nation-wide Survey of Educational Needs (Hansard, 15th October 1970. page 2198; 29tb (2) To what extent has information from non(3) To what extent has the information from government and non-government schools been analysed. Mr Malcolm Fraser-The answer to the honourable member's question is as (1) There has been no formal meeting between representatives of State Education Departments the end of May 1971 when one of the topics for discussion was the Nation-wide. Survey of Educational Needs, and there has of course been contact at Departmental level. All States supplied information to the Commonwealth by March 1971. (2) On 16th December 1970 my Department State and to all other non-government schools requesting details of their educational requireOctober 1971. (3) Information provided by government and non-government schools was brought together by officers of my Department and examined in detail before the 1971 Premiers' Conference and Loan Council meetings.

(2) If so, on what date and by what means did the Commonwealth have prior consultations with the States on the 1967 Act. Mr Malcolm Fraser-The answer to the 1971 Open Entrance Commonwealth University honourable member's question is as scholarships. This is set out in the following follows: (1.) Yes. (2) The Australian Education Council met in February 1966 and was attended for the first time, at the invitation of the Council, by the Minister in Charge of Commonwealth Activities School in Education and Research. During the meeting, Immantiel College, Novar Gardens the. State Ministers put forward a proposal for Sacred Heart College, Somerton Commonwealth assistance with capital expenditure on teacher training.

He underMarymount took after consideration of the additional material to discuss tbe Proposal with his colleagues. The Dover Gardens Girls' Technical information requested by the Commonwealth Seacombe High School. . Minister was received on 18th May, 1966. After Cbriities Bcacb High School considering the information supplied by the States, and holding discussions with some States at the Departmental level, a detailed questionnaire was sent at the end of May, 1966, to all States with a view to obtaining an assessment of needs on a basis more comparable from State to State. The information requested was received by my Department between June and September, 1966. After consideration of the material supplied by States, a further letter requesting clarification of certain points was sent to all 6 States on 30th. September, 1966. Following an examination of this information, the Minister for Education and Science had discussions with each State Minister during late January and early February, 1967. On the 28th February, 1967, all States were informed that the Commonwealth would support an unmatched capital program for teacher training and that it was proposed to bring down legislation in the autumn session of the Parliament to achieve this purpose. On the-3rd May, 1967, the States Grants (Teachers Colleges) Bill 1967 was introduced into the House of Representatives.

SydneyA i r p o rt Control: Line-up Clearance Cancellation (Question No. 4851) Mr Charles Jones asked the Minister representing the Ministerf o r Civil Aviation the following question upon notice: (1) Did the aerodrome controller at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport advise East-West Airlines F27 aircraft VH-EWJ lo cancel line-up clearance hold position on 29th January, 1971 at 2135:54 hours. (2) If so, at what time did this aircraft take-off and from which runway. ation has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes.

At that time the aerodrome controller anticipated that there would be sufficient lime between the landing of the Canadian DC8-63 aircraft, CF-CPQ, and that of the succeeding arriving aircraft, a TAA DC9 aircraft VH-TJN, to permit him to clear both VH-TJA and VH-EWJ for their respective take-offs. Subsequently the aerodrome controller discerned, as a result of the slow movement of CF-CPQ on the runway after landing, that there would not be sufficient time for both of the departing aircraft to safely completed their take-offs prior to the landing of VH-TJN. Thus, at 2135 : 54 hours the aerodrome controller cancelled the line-up clearance previously issued to VH-EWJ and instructed it to remain in its position on the taxiway leading to the threshold of Runway 16. (2) The aircraft, VH-EWJ, received a further clearance to line-up and hold position on Runway 16 at 2145:45 hours. At 2146:06 hours this aircraft was cleared for take-off on Runway 16.",223,Commonwealth Secondary Scholarship Scheme Applicants And Winners 1969 1971 Selected Schools Ne W South Wales

The essence of these procedures is set down in conclusions Nos7 and 8 on page 36 of the report. The relevant portions of these conclusions are: 7. The flight crew of VH-TJA state that, at the commencement of their take-off, they did not observe CF-CPQ on the runway as an obstruction. Nevertheless, CF-CPQ was observed at a time when the take-off could have been abandoned with safety.

If so, what is the runway using the data produced under the superGovernment's attitude in the matter. vision of the Federal Aviation Administration in the USA. by the aircraft manufacture fo rthe purpose of proving its performance capacity for certification purposes it has been calculated that, the honourable member's question: from the point on the runway where the Captain of VH-TJA said 'How far ahead is he' the requirement for cockpit audio recorders and aircraft could have been brought it a halt at a recorders were firs; installed in 1964. point some 2,140 feet short of the position on the runway of the nose of CF-CPQ at the time of the collision. This calculation adopts reaction delays proposed by the manufacturer and accepted by F.A.A. as being valid for airline pilots. It also makes due allowance for the conditions of gross weight, air temperature, runway slope and headwind component experienced by VH-TJA on the night of this take-off. Nevertheless, at the time this type of aircraft received its certificate of approval, there was no F.A.A. requirements for evaluation of stopping distance on wet runways and so there is no basic data upon which an entirely reliable allowance for extension of the stopping distance under wet runway conditions could be made. Performance data under wet runway conditions is available however, in respect of the Boeing 727-200 series aircraft recently certificated in the'USA. and for which our domestic airlines are currently seeking Government approval to 1972. This data has been studied and. so far as the stopping performance of a Boeing 727-200 series aircraft can be considered relevant to the ability of VH-TJA to stop, it indicates that the extension of stopping distance under wet runway conditions would have been of the order of 1,250 ft. Thus it can be said with confidence that the calculation that the aircraft could have been an adequate margin to account for any extension of the stopping distance under wet runway condiVariation: Cockpit Audio Recorders (Question No. 4861) Mr Berinson asked the Minister repre(1) When were cockpit audio recorders lirst installed in Australian airline aircraft.

(1) It is possible that Fitzroy Crossing could be upgraded to meet the requirements of Fokker Fellowship aircraft but a final assessment could only be made after a most detailed survey and engineering study. It would cost several hundred thousand dollars to so upgrade Fitzroy Crossing and within the current and foreseeable pattern of Fokker Fellowship operations in that area thai expenditure of public funds would not be justified in the light of other aerodromes which are available for this role. (2) No estimate has been made of the cost. (3) There is no proposal to carry out that work. Over-award Payments (Question No. 3551) Mr Clyde Cameron asked the Ministerf o r Labour and National Service, upon notice: It is a fact that the incidence of over-award payment is increasing each year; if so, what was the increase in each of the last 5 years? able members question is as follows: No direct comprehensive measure of the incidence of over-award payments over this period is available. The Commonwealth Statistician publishes a statistical scries on average weekly earnings per employed male unit and another series showing the weighted average minimum weekly wage rate index for adult males. Figures for the last 5 years are set out below: Increase Average weekly Year Per cent 1966 1967 J968 1969 1970 These2 series have different coverages and comparisons between them should be treated with reserve, but it is reasonable to infer from the figures that over-award payments have increased faster than minimum wage rates, especially in the last 2 years. National Service (Question No. 3925) Mr Uren asked the Ministerf o r Labour and National Service, upon notice: .(1) Are Charles Martin and Geoff Mullens at present in gaol for refusing to comply with the National Service Act. (2) Have summonses been served on conscription resisters Paul Fox, Ian Turner, Tony Dalton, Michael Hamel Green, Karl Armstrong and Laurie Carmichael from Victoria, Peter Hornby, Jerrimy Gilling and Mike Matteson from New South Wales, Robert Hall from South Australia, Gary Cook from Western Australia and Steve Padghan from the Australian Capital Territory for refusing to obey call-up notices. (3) If so, is it possible that within a few months there could be 14 young men held as political prisoners in Australian prisons because of their moral stand against conscription. able member's question is as follows: (1) Charles Martin, who was convicted of failing to report for service with the Military Forces and sentenced to imprisonment, was released on 8th October, the day that the National Service Act, 1971 received the Royal assent. Geoffrey Mullen, convicted and sentenced for the same offence, is serving out his period of sentence. (2) The cases of the men named are at various stages. Gary Cook, convicted and sentenced on 27lh August, 1971 for failure to report for national service, is in gaol. Laurence Carmichael and Jeremy Gilling applied for and were granted, by a court, total exemption from the liability to render service as conscientious objectors to any form of military service. Action is proceeding in the other cases. Five of the men having failed to answer summonses to appear in court in respect of their failure to report for service are now the subjects of warrants of apprehension issued by the courts. One is awaiting determination by a court of his conscientious objector status. (3) The 14 men mentioned by the honourable member breached the law of the land.

635,Mr Snedden,"The answer to the hon. . Year 1970-71 (h) State Authorities-The available information on advances made by various State and semi-government authorities to enable eligible persons to acquire a house is given below. Wherever possible, advances made by State authorities to financial institutions which provide loans, e.g. advances made to building societies from monies provided by the Commonwealth under the terms of the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreements, have been excluded from thefiguresshown below. New South WalesIn 1969-70 the Rural Bank of . New South under each of these schemes in die Territory in Wales, through its Sale of Homes Agency, 1970-71 was: advanced $17.5m. In addition, the bank provided $0.5m, through its Building Society Agency, direct to applicants in areas where no building societies existed. VictoriaIn 1969-70 the State Housing Commission advanced SI8.6m for the term sale of houses while a further 83.1m was advanced from the Home Finance Trust QueenslandIn 1969-70 the Queensland Housing Commission advanced $7.1m in housing loans. Sooth AustraliaIn 1969-70 tbe State Bank of South Australia advanced 814.0m in housing loans and $0.9m was advanced by the South Australian Housing Trust on second mortgages. Western AustraliaIn 1969-70 the State Housing Commission advanced $9.7m in housing loans. TasmaniaIn 1969-70 tbe Agricultural Bank of Tasmania advanced $2.3m in housing loans. <i) The information currently available on housing loans by government housing authorities in the mainland Territories is as follows. Australian Capital Territory-The total of new advances made and secured by mortgage by the Commissioner of Housing in the Australian Capital Territory on privately built dwellings in 197071 was S9.6m. In addition, in the Australian Capital Territory, provision is made for tenants of government built houses to purchase their homes, the balance of moneys unpaid on the purchase being covered by a mortgage to the Commonwealth. The amounts of new mortgages raised in this way in 1970-71 amounted to $6.6m. Northern TewiJosy-In the Northern Territory there are three government agencies which make loans for housing purposes.

This' latter scheme is financed with advances obtained from financial institutions. The total value of new loans made Northern Territory Housing Commission$2.1m Northern Territory Administration-$2.25 m Home Finance Trustee-$0.2m . Australian Exports (Question No. 4291) Mr Grassby asked the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) What Australian exports were covered in the pay-roll tax rebates which amounted to $49.356m in the lastfinancialyear. '(2) What were the values of these exports. (3) What were the percentages of export income represented by these exports which attracted these rebates. ourable member's question is as follows: (1), (2) and (3) Rebates of pay-roll tax allowed in 1970-71 related to increases in exports in the years 1963-64 to 1969-70 inclusive over exports in the relevant base periods. The yearly break-up was as follows: Amount of pay-roll tax rebates allowed Year of export in 1970-71 $'00 0 1963-64 4 1964-65 24 1965-66 77 1966-67 620 1967-68 1,664 1968-69 12,357 1969-70 34,613 Total49,356",246,Table 4
636,Mr Snedden,"The answer to the hon(The Might discrepancy between the sum of the amounts' for each year of export and the total is due to rounding and adjustments in respect of earlier year rebate determinations) It is nol practicable to provide a year-by-year dissection of rebates by commodities but the folNature of goods, etc.. exported(a) Foodstuffs of animal origin, not including live animals Foodstuffs of vegetable origin; non-alcoholic beverages, and substances used in making . .

Chemicals, medicinal and pharmaceutical products, essential oils and fertilisers .. Miscellaneous . . Gold and silver: bronze specie and ships' stores Total (a) Rebates allowed to a supplier who received export certificates are classified generally to the commodity group appropriate to the goods produced by the supplier. During the period to which the table refers, two formulae were used to calculate rebate entitlements. For the years 1968-69 and 1969-70, the rebate entitlement of a producer for export was, in the general case. 10.5 per cent of his increase in exports in the rebate year over his base period exports. A more complex formula applied in earlier years. Because the rebates allowed in 1970-71 represent only part of the total rebates allowed or allowable in respect of increases in exports in each of the several years involved, it would be misleading to attempt to relate to total exports in any of the relevant years the increase in exports in that year in respect of which rebates were allowed in 1970-71. Decentralisation: Concessions (Question No. 4110) Mr Whitlam asked the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) What action has been taken on the recommendations which the Decentralisation Advisory on the Selection of Places outside the Metropolis Committee on the Selection of Places outside the of Melbourne for Accelerated Development was Metropolis of Melbourne for Accelerated Develappointed by the Victorian Government. After the opment made on 26th September 1967 that (a) ""Committee had reported, the Victorian Governdepreciation on factory' buildings in the country ment drew the attention of the Commonwealth to be allowed as a deduction from taxable incomes the Committee's report, including the recommenand (b) income from industrial undertakings in dations mentioned.

637,Mr Snedden,"The answer to the honrecommendations. In. view of the requirement of Section SI (ii) of . the Constitution, which specifically prohibits the Commonwealth from discriminating in its-taxation laws between States or parts of States, it would in fact be unconstitutional for it to do so. (2) Yes. Payroll Tax Rebates: Papua New Guinea' . (Question No. 3726) Mr Whitlam asked the Treasuref, upon notice: (1) What was the' value of the rebate of payroll tax allowed in respect of export sales in the latest year for which figures are available. (2) ""What amount artd percentage of the rebates were allowed in respect of export sales to the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. (3) What' benefits has this tax concession conferred on (a) Australia and (b) the Territory of Papua New Guinea. ourable member's question is as follows: (!) Payroll tax export rebates allowed in the financial year. 1970-71 amounted to $49,356,000. (2) No statistics are available on pay-roll tax export rebates classified by country of destination of exports. (3) (a) Since the introduction of the pay-roll tax rebate scheme for exporters, there have been considerable increases in the value and range of Australian exports. It is not possible to say, however, to what extent these increases would not have occurred in the absence of the rebate scheme, (b) Any benefits to Papua New Guinea from the pay-roll tax rebates scheme would depend on its being able to import a wider range of goods from Australia, perhaps at lower prices, than would otherwise have been the case. It is not possible to quantify the value of any such benefits. Rural Finance Insurance Corporation (Question No. 3892) Mr Whitlam asked the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) On what dates have Treasury officials held discussions with financial institutions on setting up the Rural Finance Insurance Corporation promised by the former Prime Minister on 4th November 1970. (2) With which institutions have discussions been held (Hansard, 18th August 1971, page 199). ourable member's question is as follows: Proposals for setting up a rural finance insurance corporation have been the subject of continuing consultation between officers of relevant Commonwealth Departments and also with officers of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation, the Reserve Bank and the Commonwealth Banking Corporation. Such consultation has taken place over a lengthy period and has not yet been completed.' As for the generality of the honourable member's question, 1 should add that the Minister for Primary Industry announced in the House on 20th August last that studies were being undertaken by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics on the adequacy'of existing rurai credit facilities. The outcome of 'those studies will no doubt have a bearing on the question of setting up' a rural finance insurance corporation and its manner of operation. Superannuation Funds' Profits Taxation Exemptions --' (Question No. 4680) Mr Barnard asked the Treasurer, upon notice: What has been the cost to revenue of tax .' exemptions granted on profits made by (a) private superannuation funds and (b) superannuation funds operated by life insurance companies, where these funds have met the requirement that they invest 30 per' Cent of their annual increase in asse.s in public securities, for each year since 1961. ourable member's question is as follows: Sections 23 (ja) and 23F of the Income Tax Assessment Act exempt from income tax the. income of certain private superannuation funds. The exemption of these funds, however, is generally conditional on their complying with the ' requirements of the '30/20 rule' that' each fund's assets include public securities the cost of which was not less than 30 per cent of the cost of all the assets of the fund, and that its assets include Commonweal.h securiUes, the cost of which was not less than 20 per cent of the cost bf all the' fund's assets. Certain other superannuation funds which are not subject to the '30/20 rule' may be non-taxable as a result of the special deduction allowed under sec.ion 79. A life assurance company that complies. with the '30/20 . rule' is exempt from tax on that part of its .income that is reierrable to policies issued in connection with certain exempt superannuation funds'. (a) Income tax s'.atislics of private superannuation funds exempted under sections 23 (ja) and 23P are available only in respect of the income years 1961-62, 1965-66 and 1,966-67. These statistics are incomplete as certain exempt .funds are not required to lodge income tax returns every year. However, it is estimated, on the basis of these and other published statistics of superannuation funds, that the cost to income tax revenue of the exemption of such funds (i.e., ,the tax that would have been assessed if these funds had been taxed at the rates that apply to. section 23 (ja) as section 23P funds that do not comply with the '30/20 rule') would have been approximately as follows: Income Year §m 1961-62 ' ..' 8.5 . . . i 1965-66 14.0 1966-67 16.0",248,Estimated Dissection Of Pay Roll Tax Rebates Allowed Iq70 7i Financial Year

640,Mr Snedden,"The answer to the hon(b) No income tax statistics are available of superannuation thmds operated through life insurance companies. However, from the available statistics relating to the superannuation funds of life insurance companies it has been, estimated that for the 1969-70 income year the cost to income tax revenue of exempting, in respect of section 23 (ja) and section 23? funds, the income of the companies referable to these funds is an amount of the order of $7m per annum. Cost of Living Index (Question No. 4602) . Mr Berinson asked the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) What effect can be anticipated on the next quarterly cost of living index as a result of increased (a) charges on pharmaceutical benefit prescriptions, (b) telephone charges and (c) postal .charges. (2) Whal is ihe estimated effect on the weekly cost of living as a result of each .of these increases. ourable member's question is as follows: The Commonwealth Statistician has supplied the following information in reply to the honourable member's question. (1) Quarterly Consumer Price .Index numbers are compiled and published at the earliest passible date following collection of prices al various specified points of lime throughout each quar.er. No official estimates of anticipated changes. in index numbers arc prepared and published in advance of the regular collection, calculation and publication of Ihe index numbers. . . . Index numbers and 'index points' contributions to the total index tor the sub-group 'Postal and Telephone Services' are published regularly in the quarterly Consumer Price Index bulletin (reference no 9.1). The bulletin for December Quarter 1971, which is expected lo he published on approximately 20th January 1972, will show the effect on the index of changes in postal and telephone charges. Pharmaceutical benefit prescrip .toils are not included in the list of items of tbe Consumer Price Index. (2) The Statistician does not make any calculations or estimates of the cost of living. i Question upon Notice (Question No. 4672) Dr Klugman aiked the Treasurer, upon notice: When may 1 expect an answer to question No. 3495 which I placed on the Notice Paper on 17th August 1971. ourable member's question is as follows: See answer to question No. 3495. Road Accidents: Insurance Companies (Question No. 4770) Mr Whitlam asked the Treasurer, upon notice: When legislation on general insurance is introduced, as Prime Minister Gorton promised to do as a matter of urgency and with all possible speed on 8th September, will steps be taken to include questions on (a) compensation and damages, (b) legal expenses and (c) medical and hospital expenses on the statistical forms submitted annually by insurance companies (Hansard, 26th September 1968. page 1629 and 13th October 1970, page 2065). . ourable member's question is as follows: The provisions which' the Government has under consideration for inclusion in the proposed legislation on general insurance are concerned primarily with the establishment of a system of supervising the financial soundness of general insurance companies. The scheme of legislation . accordingly does not envisage requiring insurers to honfurnish information on matters such as those referred to in this question which are not directly relevant to a company's financial soundness. Teachers Colleges: Commonwealth Grants (Question No. 4598) Mr Kennedy asked the Minister for Education and Science, upon no'ice: (1) What amounts were (a) allocated or (b) scheduled for allocation in Commonwealth grants < to each State for teachers colleges in the (i) 196770 and (ii) 1970-73 triermiums.

(3) What amounts and percentages were allocated to (a) metropolitan and (b) non-metropolitan colleges in (i) each State and (ii) ell States in each triennium. (4) Can he say what (a) numbers and (b) percentages of students enrolled in teachers colleges in the last year for which figures are available were enrolled in (i) metropolitan and (ii) nonmetropolitan colleges. (5) In approving allocations of Commonwealth money by Slate Governments for teachers colleges, did he and his predecessors call for adjustments to State building programmes in the interests of balanced development ir> metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas: if so, in what instances has this adjustment been called for.

The reduction of an estimated $22.4m in the amounts to be deducted from the Commonwealth's financial assistance grants to the States will also apply to the 'base' used to determine the financial assistance grants for 1972-73 and the 3 subsequent years; and the States will therefore continue to benefit, to an increasing degree, from that reduction in those years. The amount of the benefit in years subsequent to 1971-72 cannot be estimated precisely, as it will depend on the annual increase in each State's population and on the annual increase in average wages in Australia as a whole, these being two of the elements in the formula under which the financial assistance grants increase each year. As an indication of the approximate effect of the above mentioned reduced deduction, however, it is estimated that the totalbenefit to the States over the 4 years 1971-72 to 1974-75 could be of the order of JlOOm. It should be explained that the figures mentioned above do not include the costs lo the Commonwealth, and the gains, to local government authorities, arising from the Commonwealth's' offer 4o meet the cost of exempting the non-business activities of local government authorities . from payment of pay-roll tax at the 2.5 per cent rate as from the date of transfer of the lax. The cost to the Commonwealth of thai offer is estimated to amount to ""about $6m iri' 1971-72 something over $8m in' 1972-73, 'and will 'ihcrease further in subsequent years'. Secondly, the Commonwealth .will, pay the States additional, non-recurring . special 'revenue assistance of S40m in 1971-72, to be distributed between ihe Slates in proportion to their financial assistance grants. The approximate amounts estimated to be payable to each State' are shown' in Table 39 in the Budget paper 'Commonwealth Payments lo or for the States 1971-72' Thirdly, following .the pay-roll tax transfer decision, all the Slates acted to increase the rate of the tax by I per cent from 2i pet cent to' 3 i per cent, as from the transfer date (1st September benefit lo the 1971-72 budgets of the 6 Stales '' cannot, therefore, be predicted. (2) This is a hypothetical question .and, if only becacse of die considerations referred to in the answer lo (I), I am in no position to answerit. However, I can inform the honourable ^member that, on ' the basis of figures published in -the December 1970 Supplement to the Treasury Information Bulletin on National Accounting Estimates of Public Authority Receipts and Expenditures-, it has been calculated thai recurrent expenditures by the State Governments in 1969-70' on' education (comprising net current expenditure on goods and sen-ices and transfer payments) represented about 36 per cent of total State budgetary expenditures of a current nature in that year. (3) See answer to (2). I add that on 5tb October last, in the course of a statement on the Commonwealth Education Programme for 197172, die Minister for Education and Science expressed strong reservations about accepting the figures presented by State Ministers on the needs of government schools. Even if a more precise response were capable of being given to the earlier parts of the question, I would be reluctant to compound the shortcomings to which the Minister referred in that statement by attempting the arithmetical exercises which the honourable member invites me to undertake.",258,Railway Rolling Stock Import S Cleared For Home Consumption 1070 71

However, I understand from the President of the Superannuation Board that statistics will be prepared of the numbers of pensioners and the range of increases paid as a consequence of the recent Superannuation (Pensions Increases) Act 1971. I will arrange for this information to. be forwarded to the honourable member. Housing Loans: Interest (Question No. 4266) Mr Whitlam asked the Treasurer, upon notice: In the light of subsequent increases in interest rates, will he supplement and bring up to date the figures which his predecessors gave me on 24lh December 1969 (Hansard, page 1919) and 3rd June 1970 (Hansard, page 2879) on interest rates and monthly repayments for housing loans. ourable member's question is as follows: ' The following tables up-date the information .provided by my predecessor on 3rd June 1970 concerning interest rates and monthly repayments for housing loans.

These companies usually provide a broad range of financial services including accepting and/or funds and providing or arranging short or medium-term finance. They may also underwrite, Ranue or sub-underwrite and arrange issues of securities for typical other clients; they may provide advice to companloan ies on re-organisations, takeovers, and reconstrucperiods tions; some may also provide portfolio management services. However, it should be noted that some of the companies which provide the full 43 t.nax.) 30-45 range of activities described above do not call 26-32 themselves merchant banks and this adds to the 20-25 difficulty of collecting meaningful statistics. 15-25 0 -5 These problems of definition were outlined by . . 71-81 20-25 the Deputy, Governor of the Reserve Bank in the 1971 G.

Government Printer (Question No. 4653) Mr Berinson asked the Treasurer, upon notice: ' }) Does his Department dispute the evidence given before, ihe Joint Committee on Publications (First Special Report, of the Joii't Committee on Publications, 1971, page 7) that new equipment for the Government Printer estimated to cost $755,000 would probably pay for itself in the first 2 years of operation; if so, what is his Departinenrmeol's estimate. (2) If not. can the granting of the Commonwealth Government Printer's application be anticipated in the near future; if it cannot be anticipated, why not. ourable member's question is as follows: Although ihe Government Printer has, on two occasions, sought funds to purchase new computer-controller photo-typesetting equipment, on neither occasion was it possible to prepare firm estimates of like'y savings because of the lack of detailed information about the operational characteristics of the equipment under Australian conditions. The estimate given in evidence before the Joint Committee on Publications has not yet heen submitted to the Treasury for examination.

(3) in view of the possibility in cases of urgency, such as deportation, where this authority may not be obtained in time or at all., will he consider appropriate amendments to the Regulations to exempt legal services. ourable member's question is as follows: (1) Amongst other things, regulation 8(1) of the Banking (Foreign Exchange) Regulations provides that a person shall not, without the authority of the Reserve Bank, enter into any contract or agreement (not being a contract or agreement for the purchase of goods) so that a right to the performance of any service, whether in Australia or elsewhere, is created in favour of a person resident out nf Australia. However, under regulation 38 of the Reserve Bank has, subject to any directions of tbe Treasurer, powers to grant exemptions from the regulations. The Bank has exempted transactions, coming within regulation 8 (1), with persons resident in the Sterling Area (excluding Hong Kong). (2) it would not be possible to reply to this part of the question without expressing a legal opinion. I mention for the information of the honourable member that the question of the effects of regulation 8 is raised in legal proceedings initiated in the Supreme Court of Western Australia and currently before the High Court. .(3) Consideration will be given to the question of exempting legal services after the outcome of the legal proceedings referred to in (2) above is known.

Income Tax Assessment Act: Section 120 Deductions (Question No. 4789) Mr Drury asked the Treasurer, upon notice: (t) Has any"" review of taxation deductions allowable to co-operative companies under section 120 of the Income Tax Assessment Act been made during the last 3 financial years; if so, what was the result. (2) What has been the loss in revenue .to the Commonwealth as a result of section 120 of the Income Tax Assessment Act during, each, of the. last S financial years. ourable member's question is as follows: (1) Following the receipt of representations both for their extension and for their restriction or abolition, the provisions of section 120 of the Income Tax Assessment Act were examined several times during the last five financial years. These examinations did not lead to the formulation of proposals for amendment of the provisions in either direction. (2) No statistics are available that would enable . a reliable estimate to be made of the increased income tax revenue that would have resulted it deductions under section 120 had not been allowable to co-operative companies.

Natural Disaster Relief Schemes (Question No, 2316) Mr Whitlam asked the Treasurer, upon notice: What progress has been made with the examination of natural disaster relief schemes operating ' in the United States, Canada and New Zealand. (Hansard, 12th June 1970, page 3686) ourable member's question is as follows: Completion of the examination of information relating to natural disaster relief schemes operating in United States, Canada and New Zealand has been delayed by pressure of work and staff shortages in the relevant part of the Treasury. However, a considerable amount of work has already been done on the project, and every effort will be made to expedite its completion.

PtyL t d (Question No. 4441) Mr Calwell asked the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) Is it a fact that the Mutual Life and Citizens Fire and General Insurance Company Pty Ltd (a) is not a mutually owned and controlled company and (b). pays its shareholders a 10 per cent dividend each year out of its profits. (2) Will he furnish (a) the name of, (b) the assets value of, (c) the profit made by, (d) the amount paid in dividends by and (e) the number of shareholders in each of the private companies which deal in life assurance business for the latest year for which figures are available. (3) Will the Government take action to increase substantially the deposit of all companies, which deal in life, accident, marine, fire, motor car or any other form of insurance and in which foreign interests have shares or are otherwise financially involved. (4) Will the Government take appropriate steps for a referendum to be held to increase the powers of the Commonwealth Parliament so that valid laws can be' enacted to protect the victims of bushfires, floods, droughts and other natural disasters that are exercisable under the defence power in time of war and are described in legal terminology as being due to acts of God. honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) The MLC Fire and General Insurance Company Pty Limited is a proprietary company and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Mutual Life and Citizens' Assurance Company Limited. The latter company, whose main business is life insurance, is in turn a subsidiary of The MLC Limited, which is a public, and not a mutual, company, (b) It would appear that the last dividend provided for' by The MLC Fire and General Insurance Company Pty Limited was in the year ended 30th June 1968 and that this dividend was at a rate of 6 per cent on paid-up capital. Allocations of profit for the year ended 31st December 1970 from the life insurance and other operations of The Mutual Life and Citizens' Assurance Company Limited were $3.9,020,455 to policyowners and $1,310,000 to shareholders. The allocation to shareholders represented a dividend of 65.5 per cent on paid-up capital. The MLC Limited has declared total dividends of $1,301,438, which represented 18 per cent on paid-up capital, for the year ended 30th April 1971. (2) The Insurance Commissioner has advised that none of tbe companies registered under the Life Insurance Act 1945-1965 is a. private company as defined in section 103A of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936-1970, or a proprietary company as defined in section 15 of the Australian Capital Territory Companies Ordinance 1962-1969. The number of shareholders in each registered life insurance company is not known but extensive information in regard to the other aspects' referred to in the question is contained in the -annual reports of the Insurance Commissioner, the last of which, for the year ended 31st December 1970. was tabled in the House on 6lh May 1971. (3) Tbe Life Insurance Act 1945-1965 provides for close supervision of companies carrying on the business of life insurance and a substantial increase in the deposits to. be lodged by such companies in accordance with the Act is not seen as. necessary to protect the interests of policy owners. . In respect of companies carrying on general (non-life) insurance, ..the Government intends to introduce legislation for the supervision of their activities. The question of whether any change should be made in the deposit requirements applicable to such companies under the present Insurance Act 1932-1966 is under consideration in conjunction with the proposed legislation. (4) The provision of assistance to those adversely affected by natural disasters such as bushfires, floods and droughts is primarily the responsibility of State Governments which are in the best position to assess the need for, and provide, such assistance. However, in the case of major disasters requiring expenditure judged to be beyond the means of a State, the Commonwealth has always been prepared to assist the State concerned in financing relief and restoration measures. In addition, the Commonwealth has always been prepared tp assist, on humanitarian ground, in financing' expenditure on emergency relief of personal hardship and distress even where relatively small .amounts have been involved. Commonwealth assistance to the States for this purpose, which amounted to more than $127m in the 6 years ending 30th June 1971, does not normally extend to the ' cost of restoring private assets damaged by natural disasters, it being regarded as the responsibility of the individual to provide against such losses by way of insurance. These arrangements have worked, and are working, effectively and the Government sees no need to propose a referendum concerning them. Monetary Control (Question No. 4450) Mr Grassby asked the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) Did he slate on 30th September 1971 (Hansard, page 1723) that the Government has no right to dictate to the Reserve Bank how it should act and it would be impudent of the Government to attempt to do so. (2) Does section 11 of the Reserve Bank Act provide that the Federal Executive Council may, by order, determine the policy to be adopted by the Bank. (3) Did the Royal Commission on Monetary and .Banking Systems (Parliamentary Paper No. 74 of 1937, page 206) find that the Federal Parliament is ultimately, responsible for monetary policy and the Government of the day is the executive of Parliament, and it is the duty of the Bank to carry out the policy of the Government",268,Increase On Preceding Year
671,Mr Snedden,"The answer to the right(4) If so. doesha reject these powers and abdicate responsibility fo* their use in the national interest or was he unaware of theni. (5) If he was unaware of the powers, will he now tree them when necessary in the community interest. ourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Acting Treasurer's reply on 30th September related lo loans to Goulburn Valley canneries from the Rural Credits Department of the Reserve Bank of Australia. The Government has no statutory power to direct the Bank on the Administration of loans made to particular customers of that Department. (2) Section II of the Reserve Bank Act requires the Reserve Bank Board to keep the Government informed of the monetary and banking policy of ihe Reserve Bank. In the eveni of a difference of opinion between the Government and the Bourd whether that policy, is directed to the greatest advantage of the people of Australia, section II gives the Government subject to the observance of certain procedures, power to recommend to the Governor General in Council that he determine the policy to be adopted by the Bank. However, thin section does not empower the Government to make a determination or give a direction to the Reserve Bank with respect to a loan to a particular person. (3) Yes. but the Commission went on to say that this tftd not imply that there should at any time be interference by the Government in the administration of the (then) Commonwealth Bank. (4) The power conferred on the Government. by section 11 of th; Reserve Bank Act to determine, in certain circumstances, the monetary and banking policy of the Reserve Bank is an important power which 'rs available for nse should the circtinistatmes envisaged. in that provision ever arise (see alsi) answer fr> (I))To date the power has not been invoked.

Each Slate has expressed support for the Commonwealth legislating, in this field and is cooperating fully in the formulation of the legislation. (6) See (5) above. (7) A paper was submitted m January this year by representatives of die insurance companies. However, tbe paper comprised only an outline of tentative views and has been largely superseded as a result of subsequent extensive discussions that have laken place between Commonwealth officers and representatives of insurance organisations.

' .', the substantia] growth which has occurred over recent years not only in the non-official money market but throughout' the whole of' the Australian money .and capital markets. There has -> been substantial growth in both the number'and size of financial institutions; a variety of new institutionshas been., established and many existing oneshave expanded rapidly; the range and diversity of financial claims issued and actively traded in financial, markets have, also been, considerably enlarged. These various developments may be regarded as a natural accompaniment to Australia's economic expansion paralleling -the increase iri the size and range of our industrial and commercial structure. It is of course important that the infra-structure of the financial system should not lag in adapting to growth and development throughout the economy generally.

The fuel is subsequently sold to companies' customers at either the dutyinclusive price, or duty-free in the case of holders of certificates exempting them from payment of duty. -The Department of Customs and Excise, therefore, has no information on amounts of diesel fuel duty paid by local authorities or -other individual customers supp'ied by oil companies: (2) The excise tltuy on diesel fuel was first imposed' in 1957 and was designed specifically to remove an anomaly in that fuel'used indieselpowered road vehicles was then ""tax free' whereas operators of petrol-driven vehicles were required to pay tax on the fuel they used.

Examples of such receipts are Reserve Bank and Commonwealth Banking Corporation profits paid to the consolidated Revenue Fund,' and repayment of principal from the Australian National Airlines Commission and Qantas. In view of a degree of centralisation of such revenue collections, there would be little meaning in a breakdown of these receipts by the States in which the amounts are collected.
