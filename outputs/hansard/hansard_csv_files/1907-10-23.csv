13,Mr Joseph Cook,"The Prime Minutterances in the Conference were different from some which he made outside, notably at Sheffield. While a member of the Conference, he seemed, for the time being, to recognise the judicial character of the procannot too clearly realize that those great ceedings, and, instead of roaring as he generally does, and gyrating along the Council table, he indulged in these mildmannered statements as to the intention of the Australian protectionist Ministry in retouch as we like to apply to the operation. spect to the trade of the Mother Country. member will read the whole of my speech, he will find that I was very definite in everything that I said. definite statement that I can find regarding the intention of the Government to impose duties on the goods of the Mother Country. The Prime Minister told us last night that the relations of the Empire need The trend of events-of recent years, together with the development of other and possibly competitive nations, have made if impossible to longer continue in our old groove. We must re-adjust our relationship to the Empire in order that the relationship of the Empire may be re-adjusted to the surrounding countries of the world. In what respect does our Empire need re-adjustment internally? There never was a time when our Empire was so' powerful, so prosperous, so rich, so contented, so peaceful, in every quarter of it, as at the present time. In an Empire of this kind, and uncier such conditions, we must attempt the re-adjustment of internal relations in the most delicate ancl tentative way. We must not. talk of radical re-adjustment in the manner indulged in by the Prime Minister last night. There must, of course, always be more or less adjustment proceeding, both in the internal affairs of the Empire and in . ourrelations to other countries; but when we find conditions unparalleled in the world, and certainly unparalleled in the saidhistory of our own Empire, there must not be radical re-adjustment, but re-adjustment in the most careful and delicate way, susceptible of easy and safe treatment. Our Empire is not held together like a piece of machinery; we cannot take out a part and put in ""another, as we may take but ancl replace a small wheel in a huge machine. The Empire is not a piece of machinery, but an organisma pulsating organism-and we must not interfere with that organism by mere mechanical means and methods. I made the same statement in reference to some observations of the leader of the Labour Party the other night; and I say again that we entities, which we call nations, are not' mere cold pieces of machinery, parts of which may be adjusted as often as we choose, and with as much rudeness of These nations are organisms, and, as If the honourable such, can be guided, moulded, and treated only in the most careful way. That leads, me to a criticism which I ventured, interjectionally, to offer last night in reference to the Prime Minister's attitude-in London, which I described as a coldblooded one. I had no intention of making the interjection apply to the whole of the Prime Minister's speeches in Londonvery far from it. I was referring then to a very radical adjustment. his detailed statement, in which he laid -down hia definition of the term "" preference ""-of the underlying principleas applying to the Mother Country, without reference to outside countries. Those concerned were adjusting the internal affairs of the Empire-the y were not shaping an attitude towards outside countries, but adjusting the internal affairs of a mighty organism, which to-day is throbbing with sympathy in every part. I characterized the Prime Minister's definition of preference as decidedly a coldblooded one. WhatI mean is that I find the honourable gentleman's definition to be such a one as would be applied to the formation of a syndicate-on e that would be adopted if we were unfolding a business proposition before ""a Board which eschewedsympathy and put aside all considerations except those which are represented by cold calculations and balance-sheets.' I'desire it to be understood that-we are speaking now of preference within the Empire, and not of preference without the Empire, with foreign countries. The Prime Minister The question of preference comes ,in only after you have considered your own interests, your own social system, your own financial system, your own industrial system, and whatever else you think fit to take into a c c o u n t . . . . . . . . Before closing this argument, may I say that a good deal appears to us to depend upon what you make the'unit of.your consideration. . ' . . After the United Kingdom has studied its individual interests; after Canada, and the Commonwealth, and South Africa have studied their individual interests within themselves, and in their dealings with e'ach other, necessarily the greater question presents itself as to the mutual possibilities which those units possess to-day. 1",15,Conciliation And Arbitration Court
14,Sir William Lyne,,16,Conciliation And Arbitration Court
15,Mr Joseph Cook,"That is the onlyTheir fortunes are bound up together, their trade and commerce are mostly with each other. You come, then, to the next stage of the question, which is quite separate from the first, be-Â» out df that war than did financiers in any -cause you have a great political motive for inquiring how far it is possible for these units lo assist each other by interchange. That interchange must be mutually profitable in itself. A little later on the honourable gentleman recurs to the same definitionFor the last time. I repeat our realization that preference begins as a business operation 'to be conducted for business ends. That is the preliminary of it all. I take exception to that doctrine of preference as applying to our Empire. may .be a correct .enough attitude as to the relations of the Empire with outside countries, but, as it is applied to the internal adjustment of our Empire, I say that the definition is too cold blooded and mechanical. Andi t does not meet the facts of the situation. I should like here to say that that has never been the attitude of Great Britain throughout the long course of our history. Has Great Britain -ever considered her own interests first in connection with the process of Empire building? Had she done so, she would have avoided many situations which have cost scores of thousands of lives and hundreds of millions of money. She has not stopped to consider her own selfish interests as a self-contained country. has considered the relationship which she holds, the trusteeship which she holds for -the whole of the Empire-the bonds of relationship between herself and'the whole of the Empire. She has gone outside those ordinary mechanical considerations-thos e -cold-blooded considerations of finance and business-and has poured out her l if e and her treasure in the endeavour to do something for those outside, seeking nothing in return. D i d she proceed as a mere matter of business when the slaves were emancipated? D i d she consider her -own selfish interests before the interests of ,the slaves themselves? recent instance, what occurred in the BoerAvar? for her own selfish ends ? What did Great Britain get out of that war, except a heap of trouble, a mountain of expense, and much resultant labour? . powers that be^-go t something out of the -war. ciers ? say that the British financiers got no more other part of the Empire, or the world. I decline to believe that Great Britain went to war, as I know it is often said she did, for the sake of the magnates of South Africa. I have no such belief. member about to connect his remarks with the question before the Committee? out, to the best of my ability, that the attiIt tude of Great Britain in the case of the Boer war was prompted by pure patriotic motives-that thatwar was undertaken with the sole view of doing the best that Great Britain could do for the dependencies of the Empire, and for the consolidation of the Empire as a whole, having particularly in view the interests of the outlying colonies. I know that ill considered statements are often made as. to the justification and the outcome of that war. speaking of the. motives which induced Great Britain to enter upon that war, and endeavouring to show that those motives had no relation to mere matters of business, She but to far higher considerations. Chinamen! all these troubles will be_ overcome. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports is talking a little too early about the final settlement of matters in South Africa. panned out too clean up to the present. prehend, has nothing to do with the motive with which Great Britain entered on the war. D i d England undertake that war mistake at all, they are errors of statesmanship. allow the honourable member to go into the details of the South African war. to go into details. member appears to be following the interjections of honourable members. into details, but simply ' pointing out that.",16,Conciliation And Arbitration Court

Mr W. H . IRVINE -Surely the honourable member for Parramatta is in order? Will you, sir, permit me to suggest that, on the question whether we are to give unasked a boon to the Mother Country, no observations are irrelevant that concern the relations of any part of the Empire. I submit, with the greatest respect, that it is impossible to discuss fairly such a subject as this, unless every kind of question in connection with the past conduct of the Mother Country to portions of her dominions, is held to be in order. member for Parramatta was quite in order in making, and I took no exception to, general statements, but if the honourable member were permitted to deal with details, there would be no finality to the discussion, because almost every subject under the sun might be discussed in the same way. is that the Empire cannot be administered on purely mechanical lines-o n purely business considerations-bu t that, over and above those' there are other considerations which must be borne in mind. I submit that I am clearly in order in showing what theattitude of Great Britain has been throughout the course of her historv in relation to the proposition I am'submitting. I am now referring to the simple example of the attitude of Great Britain in relation to South Africa. I am showing how Great Britain spent her money and sacrificed her men for the sake of others, without any selfish consideration of her own interests. What followed the war? A simple grant of selfgovernmenta simple unrestricted, unconditioned grant of self-government. Surely there were no cold business considerations in that. To-day, those people, who were yesterday a conquered race, are living ih the enjovment of a grant of power unconditioned in any way, leaving' them', so far -as the franchise _ is concerned, to do precisely what they will. They have had given to them, as we have had, the power freely to tax the goods of the Mother Country. There has been no mere cool calculation of business results ire the grants and conferments of power whicb the Mother Country has made from time toÂ» time to her out-lying Dependencies. She has always acted unselfishly, .and, as we sometimes think, without due consideration, to her own purely business interests. same concession to the Irish nation? two cases is the difference between a concession to a son and a divorce between man. and wife. fhat the present relations between Great Britain and her outlying Dependencies ever* touch the question of the relationship of England to Ireland. grant Ireland self-government? terjections must cease. replyi to the honourable member's interjection. member would be out of order in' doing so. from the apparently very delicate subject of the Boer. war, let me ask what is the object of preference as Ave broadly understand it? Preference, asan ideal to be aimed at by the constituent parts of the Empire, seems to be a simple effort to cement the Empire, in every way that may be open to us, so that we may, if need be, unitedly maintain and defend our position abroad; so that we may pursue the paths of peace and prosperity, and trade unrestrictedly in any legitimate channels which may be open to us; so that we may stand together-fou r square to all winds that blow-in an effort to show to the world the spectacle of an Empire which pursues by righteous and reasonable means her methods of advance, ment and progression, while seeking to secure the peace, amity and concord of the world. That is my idea of what our Empire stands for. that. the honourable member will endorse that statement of what our object really is. The British Empire to-day is a great world power. It cannot be looked at by itself and for itself, nor even as a group of allied nations bound together in the closest ties.

45,Mr Joseph Cook,"I am sure thafrelation to the civilized world. The British Empire to-day is the great winning force of civilization the world over, and the one thing that the rest of the world could not do without. All this bears upon what ought to be our attitude and -our relationship to the Mother Country in making these arrangements for preferential trade and in .our desire to draw the Empire closer together. We shall hold our Empire only as we realize this mission and this ideal: The .soul of a nation is something more than business, something above a bargain, however righteous that bargain may be. When we get into the higher region of the relationships of the nations of the world to each other, and of the relationships of the various parts of our' Empire to each other, we reach the region of moral ideas and pass altogether beyond those cold business calculations which relate to balance-sheets and trade. We must not judge by mechanical standards, the supreme and ultimate objective which we all profess to have in view. That being so the question is: How may we best secure it? I subscribe entirely to the following statement by that brilliant young Britisher, Mr Winston ChurchillThe British Empire exists on the principle of a family, and not on those of a syndicate. He went on to say that it would be wrong to force the casting up of balances in connection with the fixing up. of the relations of the Empire. I cannot conceive any process better calculated to create an anti-colonial party than subjecting to a profit and loss basis the relations of Great Britain and her Dominions and Dependencies. That is exactly my point of view. Believing, as I do, every word of that statement, I ""repeat that I think the Prime Minister's' definition of preference within the Empire is based upon a cold-blooded mechanical consideration of what is really in question. The question arises : What is it possible to do in the dircumstances ? Hitherto those who have given most consideration to this problem and stand at the head of the movement have never taken this cold business view of the matter. Mr Chamberlain has always put his ideal upon far higher ground. Even in his most rabid declarations concerning the possibility of increasing our trade by means of preference he has always kept steadilv in view a higher aim. -No man has realized more keenlv and clearlv than he has done that our Empire can hang together only upon the basis of mutual sacrifice and not on mere cold business considerations. In proof of that assertion let me quote from a letter which, he wrote only the other day in reply to a welcome home which Sir Oliver Lodge, the great scientist, addressed to him on behalf of the Birmingham University. Amongst other things,, he saidI think people generally have been induced by the recent Conference to see what I have long seen-the necessity of drawing closer to the Colonies, unless we would drift apart j and probably by the next Conference in 1911 they will be prepared to make whatever sacrifice is necessary"" Sacrifice is necessary !"" I emphasize those words because they contrast strongly with the Prime Minister's clictum. that this is a mere bargain of preference, for the mutual advantage of each party in lain went on to say that he hoped to see sacrifices on the part of the various parts of the Empire for the purpose of bringing about a closer miion which "" will make for our common prosperity and for the peace of the world.'' That is a view which does not find expression in the statements of the Prime Minister' and the Treasurer: believes in trade reciprocity. shall show in a moment what he means by the term ""trade reciprocity."" I do not know whether the Committee will permit me to tell a simple little story which 1 heard the other day, and which seems to me to aptly hit off the present relationship between the Mother Country and the Colonies. point of view? rs a little story of Tommy and his mother. Tommy was accustomed to see his mother receive week by week her various tradesmen's bills, and it struck him that it would be well to make'out a bill showing his mother's indebtedness to him. Accordingly he stole away one day and made out a bill for presentation to his mother. It contained a statement of the usual duties about the house which a boy performs, and Tommy having made up'the bill by appraising his services in a business spirit, put it by his mother's plate. Mother took the bill, looked at it, and saving nothing, stole away and made out a little bill for Tommy.

57,Mr Toseph Cook,"It is Mr ChamChamberlain clearly told the delegates that his object was to find a readier entrance into'the Colonies' for the manufactures of the Mother Country. Whilst recognising all the difficulties which they experienced in establishing infant industries in face of the competitive conditions of the world, he declared that his supreme object was to get the products of Great Britain into closer relationship with the markets of the Empire. That is his view of the matter definitely and clearly expressed. our view ? Are we. to take the Tariff schedule as expressing it ? Are we to judge the -statements of our Prime Minister and Treasurer both at Home and here in the light of. their actions ? If so, we must take the Tariff schedule as embodying their idea of preference as between various parts of the Empire. Accepting the schedule as such-and it is the .only concrete expression that we have of the intentions of the Government-w e are forced to admit that their idea of preference is simply to give to the Mother Country the crumbs which f a l l from the table of effective -protection. That is really what the schedule amounts to : effective protection for Australian industries as against their most powerful and dangerous competitor, Great Britain. Theni f there be anything left, Great Britain may take the.crumbs of comfort that we distribute to her in our generosity. about that. Mr ""JOSEPH COOK -There is not very much preference about that. In view of the high duties levied under this Tariff and having regard to the proportion and scale of these duties, the preference schedule is neither more nor less than a mere make believe. That is the view of the people of the old country, notwithstanding the glowing statements which were read last night by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. I should like to ask the Treasurer what the second column of this schedule means? Perhaps the Postmaster-General-wh o takes a deep interest in fiscal matters-in the absence of the Treasurer, will say!? Is the second column of this schedule, or is the first, to be taken as the standard of effective protection? It is all important that we should know the stand-point of the Government in dealing with the question of preference to the old country. honourable member vote? I have already voted upon one column, and the other remains to be voted upon.

71,Mr Joseph Cook,"The land quesseriously with the re-adjusting of the relations of the Empire, its position will be seen to be of the supremest importance, and will require the most delicate treatment. It cannot be disposed of in tlie easy and ready way in which the popular propagandist of preference treats it to-day. When Great Britain considers her relations with her Dependencies, she must remember that her best customers are India, Germany, Australia, and New .Zealand, in the order named. While this fact may not have much concern for us, it is of supreme .moment to the Mother Country. One might imagine, after listening to the eloquent periods and marvellous language of the Prime Minister, that MrI have already pointed out, Ave could not, Lloyd George is almost a convinced preferentialist, whereas he is. perhaps, the most determined opponent of preference in the Empire. No one has done more in the way of popular crusading against preference. Therefore it was idle for the Prime Minister the Committee to believe that there is anv hope of a serious modification of Mr ditional policy' of most of the States of Lloyd George's views on the preference question within the early future. treme that I quoted a passage which seemed to me to indicate clearly that, under certain circumstances, he would be prepared to reconsider the position. Minister stopped when . he should have gone on. He should have read the next passage in the speech of Mr Lloyd George, from which he quoted. You .ire asking us to clo what no protectionist country in the world would think of doing. You are asking us to tax the necessaries of either life or livelihood, which we cannot produce ourselves, and of which you cannot, for many a long year, supply us with a sufficiency. That is why we cannot see our way to agree to this particular method of drawing the Empire closer together in bonds of preference. That statement shows Mr Lloyd George to be a determined opponent of British preference, and, so far as one can judge, he will be so in the future ; at any rate, until we can supply Great Britain with all the raw products which she requires,' and which she has now to get largely from other countries. It was idle for the Prime Minister, amid the plaudits of his party, to tell the Committee that Mr Lloyd George would, in a little while, be with them. There is no ground for such a supposition, either in the statement which I have read, or in any other speech of that able man, so far as I have been able to follow his utterances in the old country. Our position, and that of the Mother Country, may be summed up in this way : we wish her to put her duties up, while she wishes us to put our duties down. She wishes us to lower our duties for the benefit of her manufacturers, while Ave Avish her to .impose duties to the disadvantage of the foreigner, to benefit our producers. Mr. Chamberlain started out to persuade us to agree to free-trade Avithin the Empire, ancl he having failed in his crusade, the Prime Minister, when in London, tried to persuade the Mother Country that protection .would better future Empire relations. As for many years to come, supply the deficiencies in grain, butter., timber, cotton, silk and flax, goods Avhich are so vital to her existence, if , iby taxation, she prohibited their importation from foreign countries. Therefore, she is dependent on foreign countries in respect to the supply to try to get of such commodities.

75,Mr Joseph Cook,"The membersproud position. When one begins to disturb the traditional policies of nations, particularly their fiscal policies, a pandemonium is stirred up. with so many elements of discord as does the fiscal question. That is seen by looking at the position of Australia and of Great Britain -to-day. Once you interfere in fiscal matters, you seem to provoke all. the warring elements in a community, and create discomfort and discord. No subject is so' thorny. That was seen in the Conference itself. The one thing which disturbed it was the fiscal question. On all other questions the members threshed out their differences-som e of them very marked-in the best of good temper and good spirit. But when they began to deal with the fiscal question, friction occurred, which extended beyond the Conference meetings to the public platforms of Great Britain. We are 'asking the United Kingdom to protect us from competition in her markets, but when, in return, she asks us what we are prepared to clo for her, we offer this schedule, providing for the raising, instead of the lowering, of duties, and checking, blocking, and. barring, instead of increasing and facilitating, trade and intercourse with her. We ask the Urfited Kingdom to do for us whatwe are not prepared to do for her. We are not ready to ""do as we desire to be done by. It is that which is causing the trouble. The people of the old country are not under any delusion. Last night the Treasurer and Prime Ministerread many newspaper statements, which showed acknowledge, and are grateful for, the small amount of preference for which the schedule provides. But the newspapers quoted from were, first, the Birmingham lain, ancl, next, the Daily Graphic, the Westminster Gasette, and Telegraph, three Tc-Ty London papers. Those newspapers have practically no influence outside London. Telegraph has .very little influence outside to-dayLondon.

88,Mr Joseph Cook,"I should like the price he pays for' his advantage over the foreigner is an increase in his disability as against the native Australian. Thus, the new duty on English mining machinery is double the old duty. Woollen apparel has increased 15 per cent., silk 20 per cent. Woollen goods from the United Kingdom are charged an additional 10 per cent. The result will be that the competition from Australia will develop more and' more rapidly. Those opponents who are not seriously to be feared are put at a disadvantage, while our formidable competitors are made much stronger. The Commonwealth Ministry has attempted to be Protectionist and Preferentialist at the same moment. Protection is the defence of the home market against all competitors, and the essence of Preference is greater freedom of trade within the Empire. The Colony tries to combine these two irreconcilable policies, and is forced to take away with one hand what it gives with the other. Tariff Reformers in this country are at war' with one another on .this point. Dr. Robertson Nicoll then goes on to quote the Morning Post, which, it may be remembered, was also quoted by the Prime Minister last nightThe Morning Post, the stoutest advocate of TarilT Reform, says : "" If Tariff Reform is to be a means of solving the revenue difficulty, it will not be possible to refrain from making colonial produce dutiable-althoug h at a lower rate than the foreign produce which competes with it . "" If honourable members are under the impression that we shall get into the foreign markets on easy terms when preference becomes an accomplished fact, they may be reminded that the great advocates of preference in the old country say that there .must be duties against us if we continue to impose duties against Great Britain. "" I shall not read further from the British Weekly', but I have here another quotation which shows the opinions of people at Home, in opposition to the statements read by Ministers last night. The Shipping World, dealing with preference, as it finds embodiment in the schedule before us, saysBut when we come to the tariff established in the new schedules we haye some facts to go upon. When Mr Deakin, the Australian Premier, and Sir William Lyne, the present Treasurer of the Commonwealth, were amongst us, they not infrequently sought to enlighten and admonish us, and they sometimes found it necessary to lecture the people of these islands, who are, at all events,'deeply interested in the subject, because they were not prepared to join hands and hearts with the legislators of the Commonwealth and make ""sacrifices"" for the sake of the Empire. But now that the proposed Australian ""sacrifices"" have been unfolded to the world our mental vision continues to be opaque, and we entirely fail to appreciate the bountiful and beneficent intentions of OUT fellow citizens, in charge of Australian affairs. We have been at some trouble to compare the new tariff with the old, and, while we have not gone through all the published items, we are in a position to say that in only a few instances have we discovered that articles manufactured by. us and formerly imported into Australia have been put upon the free list; in not a single other case has a British product had the duty imposed upon it reduced; and so far as our inquiry has gone this duty has been increased along the entire schedule of British goods entering Australian ports. The article goes on to give a list of the items, with which I shall not weary the CommitteeTo be sure, the Reuter dispatch informs us that there is a preference of between 5 and 10 per cent, accorded to British manufactures; whether any conditions are laid down under' . which this preference is to be enjoyed we do not at present know. We are thankful for small ' mercies, and for big ones in proportion;' but, unfortunately, while we are in doubt about a great many things in connection with the fiscal policy of our fellow citizens, which seems to us at this distance a somewhat bewildering policy, there is no room left for doubt concerning 'our position under the new tariff. We are a great deal worse off since last Friday than we were before. The innocent representative of Reuter informs us, no doubt on the authority' of the author of the Budget, that the preference given to British"" products entering Australia will amount to something like Â£1,500,000 a year. Wonderful ! The Tariff wall has been elevated from 10 to 30 per cent., aiid from 5 to 10 per cent, is to be taken off it ; and we are to be beneficiaries to the extent of Â£1,500,000 a year! It .is a small comfort to the athlete who enters for the handicap hurdle race to be told that he has been favoured, and that the hurdles against all his competitors are higher than his, when, unfortunately, his hurdle is so high that he cannot clear it. The Lyne schedules have been prepared, and will in future be prepared, while the protectionists and sophists remain in power, after the fashion of those of the United States, with a view to killing oversea competition, and making things easy for combinations that will send prices and profits up. While we may have opinions regarding the fiscal policy of any country or any Colony, we certainly have no right or disposition to complain or protest against the duties imposed against imports, British or foreign, by the Australian Commonwealth. The Mother Country and the Colonies are self governing, and may adopt any fiscal policy they . may fancy. But we' could do with a little less cant in respect of the alleged Australian "" sacrifices."" In a subsequent issue the same journal refers to the outcry in Birmingham, of all other places, against the Australian duties on bicycles and other articles manufactured thereSuch is Birmingham's experience under the new Australian tariff, and the losses, misfortunes, and 'possible disasters will not be "" made good "" by Mr Deakin's proclamation issued through The Times correspondent at Sydney to "" British merchants and supporters of Preference.""

Further details have since been cabled; and they remind us in a confused sort of way of the old economic adage concerning people whp were getting on very nicely "" by taking in each other's washing."" We have already published some of the particulars of the new Tariff, which provides a much higher wall against imports from Britain and other countries than the old Tariff; preferentialists saving their face by taking off much less There are two more quotations which I than they put on-for the "" Motherland."" These are statements which to me clearly indicate the trend of bpinion in the old country. If they are not sufficient, one may learn more of the popular opinion of the country from the humorous journals; and I should like to read a quotation from one which was sent to me yesterday. This profound disbelief the majority of Englishmenpublication io John Bull, of the 21st Sepregard tember, and the quotation is as followsTHE The Australian windbag buttonholed the Brummagem man. ""Look what I've done for you. You'll only pay five pounds on every cycle you send us, whilst. the wicked foreigner will have to pay five guineas.""

That is from a journal which the Prime Minister quoted as in favour of preference. strongest antagonists of preference. Sitting suspended from 6.30 t'o 7.45. p.m, journed for dinner, I was quoting some statements made recently in the old country with the view of showing the attitude of some influential newspapers there regarding the proposed preferences which the Ministry have offered to the Mother Country. should like to add. I propose to quote from the Economist a paragraph which I think shows the attitude of the people at Home on the question of reciprocal pref erence between the Mother Country and AustraliaColonial statesmen do not yet know with what the policy with which Mr Chamberlain'sname has been associated for the last'few years.

Yet this is a working principle which is being adopted throughout theUnionist Party. A winning cause has not to beconcealed in order to be tolerated. In other words, we are to infer from thesequotations that the cause of preference in the old country at present is exceedingly unpopular; that its unpopularity has beenincreased by the new schedule submitted by the Commonwealth Government; that there is no desire to reciprocate preferences such as those now before us are supposed to be 7",24,Conciliation And Arbitration Court
89,Mr Deakin,No; it is one of the,26,Brummagem Man The Admission I F You Want To Win An Elec
90,Mr Joseph Cook,"When we adand that the cause of free intercoursefreedom of trade ' is perhaps more strongly entrenched to-day in the old country than it was at any other period in its history. There is one statement in the Prime Minister's speech at the Conference to which I should like to direct attention. It is that part of his definition of preference which aims at levering down the high duties of foreign nations. He saidOn a more general view, and subject to this, ""its objectthat is the object of preferenceis to obtain fair terms abroad where fair terms are granted by us. I should like the Treasurer to say whether that statement means that the Government is open to negotiate reciprocal preferences with foreign countries who now have high duties against imports from Australia. Canada just now is busily engaged with Germany in negotiating a treaty for reciprocally lower duties. Has this Government anything of the sort in contemplation? Supposing, for instance, Germany, who is a great customer of ours, and will be affected more or less by the Tariff, should say to-morrow, "" We will give you better treatment than we have hitherto, on condition that you lower your duties against us to the level of those imposed on imports from Great Britain,"" what would be the attitude of the Government? That is not an impossible supposition, seeing that Germany, just now, is negotiating a reciprocal preference with Canada. The Commonwealth Government has made no provision, such as Canada has done, for an intermediate preferential schedule, and, therefore, any proposal on the part of Germany with that object in view would involve, if the Government seriously considered it, a re-arrangement of the whole Tariff.. I take ;t that, if such a proposal were made by Germany, the Government could not refuse to treat it seriously. If that be so, how stand the Government with regard to their effective protection ? If they are prepared to level down the small preference which now exists as between the foreigner and the Mother Country, then what is to become of the preference to Great Britain? And, if in making this arrangement with Germany they reduced the present duties as against Great Britain in order to grant her a preference, what would become of their effective protection ? This matter ought to be made far clearer than it is at present; the -position is now very vague. If the Government are proposing a series of preferences which will aim not only at closer trade relations between the various parts of the Empire, but at reducing, in favour of Australia, the high duties of other countries, we ought to hear something from them on the subject before we depart from the discussion of this question. At all events, the Prime Minister, when at the Conference, unquestionably addressed himself to that aspect of affairs. I can conceive of no other inference to be drawn from the expression which I have just read. what he meant by the word "" abroad."" shadow of doubt that he was clearly referring to foreign nations-to nations outside the Empire. If that be .part of the Prime Minister's preferential trade proposals, then it ought to be made clear in connection with the discussion of this schedule, and before we finally shape our attitude, as we are now proposing to do, towards the rest of the world. Supposing Germany should satisfactorily complete her negotiations with Canada, and then proceed to address herself to the same question, as it relates to Australia, what would be the attitude of this Government? Would they not be compelled to re-cast their schedule, in order to secure effective protection as against Germany and Great Britain, and at the same time arrange a schedule of preferential duties? There is no need to pause to discuss how far considerations of this kind trench upon the province of self-government. Happily, that point is not in question in connection with a schedule such as this, and that is one reason why I am readily able to agree to the broad methods which the Government have adopted, or, shall I say, to the free preferences, as opposed to reciprocal preferences, which are contained in the schedule. My only complaint is as to the quantum and method of these preferences. I heartily believe in the principle of a free -and unconditional preference, and I take it that the majority of the Committee would be strongly in favour of the broad principle. We differ, only as to the way in which effect should be given to it-as to whether our duties should be raised or lowered against Great Britain; or remain at the old ratesIn regard to these matters, we shall shape our different attitudes as we proceed with the schedule. There",26,Brummagem Man The Admission I F You Want To Win An Elec

92,Mr Joseph Cook,"There can be nois no need to discuss the other aspects of preferential trade as they affect the outlying portions of the world. Unquestionably, however, the preferential champions of Great Britain have in contemplation a bringing down of the high duties imposed against her by the rest of the world, and they believe they can most effectually lever down those duties by the. imposition of retaliatory imposts. interesting to glance at the history of the attempts in that direction which have already taken place. Failure is written over everv one of.them. The pages of history record no successful instance of retaliation When England was discussing her fiscal reof this kind. We are unable to point to a single case where retaliation has secured the object which it set out'to accomplish. It has been tried in Great Britain; i't is being tried tentatively in various parts of the world. Only the other day, I read an American letter bearing upon this very subject. I have not it by me; but it showed that, a little while ago Germany and America-and Germany to-day is the most alert nation in respect of reciprocal preferences with foreign countries-negotiated a preferential arrangement in regard to certain duties. Germany agreed to treat America under most favoured nation conditions, and to apply her minimum Tariff to her on condition that America in .turn would give her a preference. selected which granted. But as soon as the' treaty had been concluded, there began an agitation amongst the wine producers throughout the length and breadth of America, who pointed out that they were being singled out as victims in connection with this reciprocal arrangement. A further difficulty arose with France,' which is a wine-producing country. Instead of refraining from interfering with her.Tariff, and allowing the preferential arrangement between Germany and America to .pass unnoticed, France immediately revised her duties on certain goods which she was importing from America, and taxed them out more completely than ever before. And so America to-day in connection with Germany and France-to go no further-is finding out, to use the words of the writer, that the application of these reciprocal prefermethod known to them by which they ences is merelv the application of the old Mosaic law of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. The writer suggeststhat the fault is with Americathat she ought to be more reasonable in Mr Joseph Cook. the imposition of her duties, and should adopt a more reasonable attitude towards both France and Germany. Preferences have also been tried in connection with our own Empire. This is not the first occasion on which the Empire haa set out to lever down the duties imposed against her by' means of high Tariffs. Great Britain attempted to follow the very method which is It is sketched out for her now by the preferential champions at Home., and she failed miserably in the attempt. I shall quote a short passage bearing upon this point from Bastable's Commerce of Nations. lations generally in the years immediately preceding the corn law agitation, Mr Gladstone attempted to negotiate treaties for freer trade with a number of European nations which had Tariff walls.built high against Great Britain. When a member of the Peel Administration, he made strenuous efforts to negotiate those treaties with America, and with France and various other' nations in Europe But in every case he failed; it could not be done. Here is his commentIn every case we failed. I am sorry to add my opinion that we did more than f a i l . The whole operation seemed to place us in a false position. Its tendency was to lead countries to regard with jealousy and suspicion, as boons to foreigners,, alterations in their laws which, America though doubtless of advantage to foreigners, wine as an article on would have been of far greater advantage to the preference should be their , own inhabitants. In other words, when a nation begins to make reciprocal concessions to foreign nations, human nature-that ugly thing which makes for us to-day all our problems, both political and socialcreeps in. Human nature, with perversity of mind, sought in every case to attribute a wrong motive to an innocent action, which had in contemplation the equal goodwill of the various communities concerned. And so Gladstone says that these efforts, not only failed, but estranged the. very people' whom they sought to bring into closer trading relations. It was only after that failure to reduce high; Tariff walls, backed up by a high Tariff .of their own. threw up the fiscal sponge and declared themselves to be free-traders, as the only could best compete with the Tariffs of the various countries of the world. Thus it will be seen that what we are setting but to do to-day has been tried more than once in the history of the Empire, and, as a",27,Brummagem Man The Admission I F You Want To Win An Elec
93,That Both Mr Gladstone,"and Mr Peelpolicy, has miserably failed. I do not say that because it failed then it must necessarily fail to-day, but I do say that we have a right to consider all these experiences of the Empire, and that they should at least correct our hot-headedness in any enterprise that we may undertake with the same object in view. I think.it stone was at. least the equal of any statesman in England who is advocating preference to-day. I do not think it will be argued that it was owing to want of ability, or tact, or reasonableness of attiI f we follow the course which is broadly tude, that these treaties failed then. And if they failed then, are they likely to succeed now ? What is possible under our present circumstances ? We cannot hope to induce the Mother Country to enter into reciprocal arrangements with us at the present time. Any man who made such a proposal in Great Britain would very soon be sent politically to the right-about. Mr Asquith, choose against her products. Let us conMr Lloyd George, and ' Mr Winston -Churchill are quite frank about the matter. They all agree that any negotiations for reciprocal preference between the various portions-of the Empire would to-day te negatived by a vote of the House of Commons of at least three to one. Therefore, we cannot look in that direction for reciprocal treatment at the present moment. But we need not altogether fail in the object which we have in view-and 1 profess to have that object in view just as earnestly ' as have the Government. There is still left open to us the method which is being adopted iff this schedule, but adopted in a wrong and clumsy way, which, in my judgment, will cause it to fail in its object. Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner, I read an article, in the nature of a criticism of our present proposals, which showed that in Great Britain the feeling is being engendered that if we do this kind of thing that coun'trv must begin to retaliate. That is a consideration which must ibe kept in mind when we are piling duties upon the goods of the Mother Country, and, at the same time; asking her to impose higher duties upon her food stuffs for our benefit. Country would not be so spiteful as to retaliate? any spite in taking the action that I have indicated ? there would be an element of spite in it. spite, if there be any, is' upon our part in seeking to erect barriers against the commerce of Great Britain. The people of that country are already beginning to say that if we are going to close the door tighter against them they had better think about closing it against us. That is a spirit, the creation of which we ought carefully to avoid, because it can . lead only to further trouble. laid down in this schedule, it seems to me that we shall avoid that trouble. Let us cease lecturing the Mother Country upon the question of protection. Let us permit her to follow her own course. She does not lecture us upon our fiscal policy, but concedes to us the fullest freedom to impose duties as high or as low as we may cede the same liberty to her. Let us grant her a free and unconditionala real and substantial-preferenc e in. the duties that we,levy under this Tariff. To my mind, a great deal might be done to improve the relations of the Empire, to facilitate its commerce, and to make it stronger commercially, socially,' and in every other respect, by looking to the means of communication, a subject which occupied so large a share of attention at the recent Imperial Conference. I believe wiith Mr Winston Churchill that by building roads and by opening up communication .throughout the Empire, we can accomplish a great deal' to facilitate its .commerce. In these ways, and in many others,-we can still pursue our paths, each, oi us settling our own relationship to this supreme question of how best to bind the Empire together. The more I see of this matter in its relations to the future, the more I recognise that we can only .secure an Empire united in its commerce, in its defence,. and in all those things which make for a great and prosperous nation, so long as we pursue an ideal which will tend to bring the unitsnearer to each other and Avhich will more and more extend the freedomat present existing. In other words, I am for a free-trade Empire, and when we have attained that, I confess that I am not very much concerned as to what we do in respect of the foreigner.' My idea is that of free commerce within the Empirea common trade and a common defence. If we can secure these two things,",28,Brummagem Man The Admission I F You Want To Win An Elec

Had the honourable member been present before the adjournment for dinner, he would have heard me allude to India. When the final relations of the self-governing portions of the Empire come to be settled by any such proposals as these, India will prove the one difficult problem of statesmanship. She will require separate treatment, at once humane, delicate, and substantial, so as to make her position secure as a srreat part of the British Empire. I confess, too, thati the proposal of Mr Hofmeyr, to which the Prime Minister alluded last night, has some attraction for me. clined to think that that proposal was the conception of the late Mr Cecil Rhodes. Sir .brought it forward in 1887. tion is not faulty, it was Mr Rhodes who first bruited the idea of a police tax on the whole commerce of the Empire, amounting to about 2 per cent, of its value. He suggested that all this money should be devoted to a fund for the purpose of providing a.common defence. In that idea, I see the possibility of entering into an arrangement under which every outlying dependency of the Empire would contribute in proportion to its means, to a common clefence fund of which we should all be the beneficiaries. was that the dependencies would not contribute in proportion to their means, but in proportion to their foreign imports. member may be quite right in regard to that, but if'he will investigate the subject fully, he will find that the foreign trade of the Empire approaches per head very nearly to an equation. There is not such a large difference as one would imagine. It is true that there are different fiscal policies operait has always been noted, an Empire purting within the Empire, each of which is at war with the other. But in respect of the duties imposed, and of the fiscal barriers erected,, we must recollect that we have to do business outside our borders. We may raise our duties against Great Britain as high as possible, but we shall still have to import from the Mother Country. The moment that we cease to do so Â©ur exports will be penalized,, and we shall become a sufferer in consequence. Protection, it must ibe remembered, does not stop foreign trade. It merely makes it more difficult. A ll trade is barter, as' everybody knows, who has studied the rudiments of the matter. A proposal such as I have indicated would help to meet the common defence of the Empire, and would mark a step towards the ideal to which I have alluded. But there is something more that we can do in the way of a definite movement downwards so far as the duties imposed upon the products of Great Britain are concerned. I have in my mind the very innocent proposal which I made in the last Parliament, when we were discussing a proposal 'for preference. As honourable members are aware, we base our duties upon the f.o.b. value of goods at the other end of the world plus 10 per cent, and I proposed that, in estimating the duties to be levied.upon the goods of Great JOHN FORREST Mr Hofmeyr Britain, we should take off that 10 per cent. If we did so it would amount to an all-round preference of about 2 per cent. I ask any protectionist in this Chamber whether he is averse to making a concession of that kinda sacrifice of 2 per cent -so far as imports of the Mother Country are concerned? Such an action would constitute a real sacrifice although a small one-so far as the Empire trade relations are concerned. But whatever means we may adopt we must always keep in mind that our object is to grow closer and closer together, endeavouring in every way to facilitate each .other's operations so' as to attain a common object. That object is the building up of the Empire in all that will make for its peace and prosperity, thus showing to the people of the outside world the example of an Empire as far as possible unified, trading within itself without let or hindrance, each part standing by the other in its common troubles, and defending each other part to the last-a n Empire governed by righteous laws and penetrated above all things by that spirit of freedom for which suing its way in peace, and so promoting its intercourse and prosperity. intend to vote against the Government proposals, I wish to shortly state my views in regard to them, rather for the infor-",29,Brummagem Man The Admission I F You Want To Win An Elec

Those who do not agree with that position are really opposed to what have been the views of the fair-trade party in the United Kingdom for years past. There are very few protectionists in England; and those who advocate preferential trade do so with the object of creating a retaliatory weapon to be used against foreign powers. What they ask for is power to make treaties so as to obtain a fair position in foreign markets; they do not desire the protection of industries, but they do desire a Tariff behind which they can make bargains. Consequently there has arisen in England not so much a protectionist school, but a fair-trade school, or what has been more recently called . a school of preference. ing to give a preference of, not 5 per cent., but of 15 per cent., as soon as 'Great Britain makes it worth our while to do so. ducts would the honourable member ask for preference ? that Mr Chamberlain offered when he made his proposals just after the close of the South African war.

136,Mr Crouch,"No doubt; but wheI desire to direct the attention of honourable members. It is not a fair argument against preferential trade to say that Great Britain affords us protection; but in passing, I may say that when defence matters come before us, I shall be found ready to do what is fair to the old country. Those honourable members who agree with the retention of the second column are really, by their action,, delaying the proper settlement of this question. I should like to refer to the missing letter of which the honourable member for Parramatta spoke, when he said that the retaliation attempted against Germany by the United States was not successful. The history of that incident shows the injury we may do ourselves by giving preferential trade to possible competitors. Executive were given power to apply a retaliatory Tariff, in order to further their own trade, and obtain concessions from rivals. lowing quotation from the London Times Weekly, of 7th June, 1907Our Washington Correspondent telegraphs :The State Department has taken advantage of the President's proclamation announcing the conclusion of the new commercial agreement with Germany to publish a statement in which it is proved that the United States has had the best of the bargain. Germany, it says, has conceded the minimum rate on various kinds of grain, on tinned meats, boots, shoes, and other commodities largely exported from this country. On other articles, moreover, including leather goods and machinery, reductions have been obtained below the minimum tariff to the extent of 25 to 50 per cent. Over 96 per cent, of American products will continue to.enjoy most-favoured-nation treatment. American exporters to Germany will in fact' be benefited by the reduction of the duties to the amount per annum of over Â£1,300,000, while the corresponding loss in the United States Customs receipts owing to the reductions in favour of the German importers w ill, it is calculated, barely exceed Â£40,000. member think that they will produce reThat was a weapon which Congress gave to the Executive, and it was usedwith the result set forth in that extract. United States, while gaining ground with Germany, lost ground with France. tinuesThe authorities here express willingness to negotiate with Great Britain with reference to granting special rates on articles enumerated in the third section of the Dingley Law. It is admitted, however, that there is a' serious obstacle, which practically precludes any advance in that' direction. By the Dingley Law the President is empowered to grant a reduction of rates only in return for similar concessions. In view of the fact that practically all imports from the United States enter Great Britain duty free, it is difficult to see on what negotiations between the two countries can be based. United States reduced the duties to Germany, France raised her duties against the United States. to the preferential trade policy, which I think represents a great disadvantage to us. I refer to the duties of 5 per cent, and 10 per cent, levied in the case of foreign countries, on sixty or seventy articles,.which are admitted free from Great Britain. The great majority of these imports should come iii free. They cannot be manufactured here, and by imposing duties of 5 per cent, and 10 per cent., we In the United States the are really handicapping our own manufacturers, who have to use imported machinery. No one will have the temerity tp say that an impost of 5 per cent, is a The result is shown in the folprotective duty. Such imposts will do great harm to the cause of preference, and result only in irritation. The Government is playing into the hands of the free-trade party by proposing to impose them.

I hope that his recovery will be sustained, and that he will soon be completely restored to health. In his speech, he expressed a desire for a new definition of the term "" preference,"" or a new word which would better express his meaning of that term All -1 can say is that if what is proposed in'the Tariff schedule constitutes a preference, a new word to express its meaning is certainly necessary. The Government proposals are merely a pretence at granting a preference to the Mother Country. I quite agree with the honourable member for Corio that they are a sham. There is no doubt that while in a few instances they do give a preference to the goods of the United Kingdom, the net result of the change in our treatment of British goods under the new Tariff as against the old one is to impose a-disability upon them. ' I have no hesitation in saying that the figures which have been placed before us are not honest figures.

If we allow that Â£[1,300,000-the Treasurer states that it may grow to Â£1,500,000*-represent s the difference between the duty which will be payable upon British imports as compared with the amount which the foreigners will have to pay upon imports, of the same value, we must set against that amount the increased duties which reduce that advantage, and which in my opinion remove every rag of preference that is granted under the Tariff. The other figures to which I shall allude are of a more questionable character even than those to which I have referred. They were given by the Treasurer last night, and certainly they contradicted the figures which he had previously supplied to the Committee. prove what I am saying. further inquiries in regard to them, and I find that they are absolutely correct. are correct as regards arithmetic, but that does not prove what the Treasurer attempted to prove. I admit that to some extent they are on a different basis from previous figures inasmuch as they deal with ' only 187 items of the Canadian Tariff and of the Commonwealth Tariff. The result of the comparison made is one which I am sure surprised the Treasurer as much as it did the Committee. He said:The' Canadian preference averages 34^ per cent. This is a true average, because it wil l be noticed that the majority of the items cluster around the 31 per cent, to 40 per cent. mark. The Commonwealth preference items show an average of 44 per cent., but this is inflated by the inclusion of seventy-six items, each 100 per cent. The goods enumerated in these seventy-six items are free if of United Kingdom origin, but low ad valorem rates have been imposed against the imports other than those from the United Kingdom. Excluding these seventy-six items the Commonwealth average is ioÂ£ per cent. However, a reasonable allowance should be made for these items, and making them dutiable at 33^ per cent, results in a general average of 23^ per cent., which from the figures I have given seems to fairly represent the case. According to the first given figures, showing an advantage to Britain of .Â£1,300,000, it is evident that if absolutely prohibitive duties -to the extent of 100 per cent, had been imposed upon foreign goods and to the extent of 50 per _cerit. upon British goods, the saving to Great Britain would have been greater, though, as a matter of fact, she would have been practically excluded from our markets. In other words, she would have saved 50 per cent, upon the whole value of her importation, or nearly, .Â£5,000,000, instead of upon Â£[1,300,000. That is the way in which we are -treated in respect of figures which are sent broadcast all over the world. As regards the second set of figures quoted by the Treasurer last night, comparing Canadian and Australian .duties, I do not think that they could have been prepared for the uses 'to which they have been put. As used, they are absolutely false. The average should be arrived at by taking out each rate of duty, and multiplying it by the imports at that rate. If Â£100 worth of imports were charged at the rate of 5 per cent., and Â£[1,000 worth at the rate of 60 per cent., the average rate would be 55 per I have made cent.; but what has been done in this case has been to add 5 and 60, and divide the result by 2, putting down the average at 32J per cent. That that is absolutely wrong can be seen by reversing the figures which I have given. If Â£[1,000 worth of imports were charged at the rate of 5 per cent, and Â£[100 worth at the rate of 60 per cent., the average would be only 10 1 per cent.; but, according to the mode of reasoning which.I am criticising, it would still be 32J per cent. Therefore,I say that I do not think that the figures which have been given could have been intended as an indication of the average of the duties in. fhe Australian and Canadian Tariffs, on the 187 items referred to. lutely misleading. take the calculations of my own officers than those of the honourable member. ister has pen and ink in front of him. and can, if he chooses, verify mv statements.

If you multiply 2 by 2, and get 4 as the result, that is arithmetically true. that show something that it does not show, you are making a false use of fhe figures. I admit that it would be a difficult task to make an average comparison, because it would necessitate the getting-out of the value of Canadian and Australian importations at the different rates, and the necessary details may not be obtainable. Buti f the correct figures cannot be ascertained, a comparison which is not correct should not be made public. In conclusion, I have only to say that I am absolutely against a bargaining preference. dangers in front of the British Empire, if it trusts for its union to the business bargaining of its various portions. I agree with Mr Winston Churchill that the Empire is a family, not a syndicate, and that the ties which bind it are those which bind the family, hot ties of jQ s. d., or of immediate personal interest, but of affection, of blood, of race; ties light as air, but in every well-regulated family, strong as iron. If you attempt to substitute for these ties the ties of mere bargaining, you will create opportunity for dissension and separation. Every bargain that, is arranged must be dealt with by two Parliaments, and Parliaments are touchv as to their rights. A t the present time, Canada is offering an intermediate Tariff to certain countries, and Great Britain raises no objection to that. gain preference between the two, the intermediate Tariff offered to Italy and to Germany would reduce the British preference, in return for which Great Britain had given concessions, and f h e British Government and Parliament would raise the Canadian Parliament would probably resent interference. cause trouble. ' While I am willing to do all that I can to aid the trade of Great Britain, I do not think that a preference w ill do much in that direction so long as Yet this false rewe attach to it the condition that our first object must be to completely protect our own industries. We have seen the effect of preference on British trade in Canada. Although Great Britain's trade with Canada countries with the Dominion, and the proportion of trade done by Great Britain is no better now than it was before .British goods were given preference'. Therefore, I do not anticipate from the adoption of preference as much as some do. Still, I am prepared to give Great Buti f you try to make Britain whatever advantages there may be in preference, as a return for the exceptional benefits which she has poured upon us. But in honesty to Great Britain and to ourselves, if we profess to give her a preference, we should see that that preference is a real one, and not a mere pretence as, to a large extent, the concessions in the Tariff schedule are. I can only add that I am in sympathy with what the Prime Minister last night stated to be his aim, the drawing of the various parts of the Empire closer together, so that time, I can see difficulties and instead of tending to separate them, may bind them more firmly. But I do not think it possible to obtain that result by the policy which he outlined when in London. In my opinion, the adoption of that policy would increase the risk of disruption. If we give preference, we should give it as Canada has given it, and as SirW i l f r i d Laurier is willing to continue it, without expecting Great Britain to change her fiscal policy by taxing her foodstuffs for our benefit. We should give her preference, believing that she has done enough for us to justify us in doing so, and as a trifling return for the ample gifts ""which she has bestowed upon us. speak when moving mv amendment, because I had already expressed my opinions on the subject of preference in general; but I wishBut had there been a barto offer a few words now, as the Committee apparently desires to come to a decision on this subject to-night, in further elucidation of the position which I have assumed.

182,Mr Glynn (Angas) [9.28],"I did notpolitical integrity and the continuous union of its members as a collection of self-governing communities 'Under one Crown. Personally, notwithstanding the very able speeches made from different pointsof 0 view, particularly by the leader of the Government and the leader, of the Opposition last night, I am still of opinion that we are making a very serious mistake in this implied solicitation of reciprocal preference. In view of what has been said by the Prime Minister on various occasions, and on an occasion to which the honourable member for Corio' referred to-night, and right through the whole of his speeches in the Imperial Conference, the object of the Government, which presumed for the time to express the feeling of Australia, was to introduce the principle of Mr the articles written; and I have mentioned Chamberlain, which was one of reciprocal preference. Prime Minister hinted it last night that he had ever mentioned that he was likely to introduce any concessions in favour of Great Britain, whichwere altogether divorced from the expectation of any return. did press with undue importunity, so far as ' he represented -Australia, for greater concessions in favour of Australia in return for the promise of some from us to Great Britain. That importunity was condemned by organs like the Edinburgh Review in terms which implied opprobrium. But now we are told that it was an offer divorced from all expectation, though, I cannot accept it as such, of reciprocal preference. In But it was pointed out at once my opinion, such preference would have the same effect as had the Canadian preference. The first result of that preference was to embarrass Great Britain in some of its treaty relations. ately afterwards was reluctantly obliged to denounce a treaty with Germany, which was a source of profit to Great 'Britain. Can*ada shortly afterwards was the subject of reprisals by Germany and other countries,, but chiefly Germany, and had to crv to the Mother Country for help against consequences induced by .her own act. AndI am certain that in the Gase of Australia similar results will follow-that the induceverv properly rejected by the British Goments we are holding out may lead to a condition of' affairs that will be embarrassconsideration, because it was immediaing to the mother country. Further, I believe that the Conservative Party will accept these preference proposals as an invitation to renew the programme according Mr Glynn. of the Empire, berlain in 1903. As I said before, this is the first time. I have heard from the lips of the Prime Minister-and I never. in my reading saw the statement-that it was part of his declared policy to grant concessions without expectation of any return. so at Home. Prime Minister said so. AllI wish the Committee to infer is that he did not give the declaration such prominence that men like myself, who endeavour to follow the course of Imperial politics, should not miss it. Some of the English periodicals dealt with the Prime Minister's attitude in the Convention as if he did"" not make anv offer except concessions as part .of reciprocal treatment. That is the burden of some bf one which appeared in the Edinburgh ReI was not aware until the view. The Prime Minister, apparently in desperation, at the end of the Conference made an offer, which was not accepted in the spirit in which it was made, for an arrangement for the imposition of 1 per cent, on foreign imports, in order to make some I am sure that time after time he provision for, I think, the defence of the Empire. That proposal was not supported even by some men who gave an almost whole-souled allegiance to his preference proposals. So far as I remember, when Mr Hofmeyr, in 1887, tabled a motion for the imposition of 2 per cent, on imports into the Empire from foreign countries, his idea was that a fund would thus be created for the naval defence of theEmpire. by' public writers and by the Imperial Government, that it would mean that, while Australia and New Zealand would contributeÂ£500,000, the Imperial Great Britain immediGovernment, in addition to their already large expenditure on the Navy, would contribute Â£4,500,000. Similarly, when Mr Deakin made the suggestion of 1 per cent, on foreign imports, Mr Lloyd George pointed out that the idea was ridiculous; and he gave figures to show that the incidence would be altogether disproportionate on the taxpayers of Great Britain.' The suggestion was not only vernment, but it did not even receive tely opposed by men like Sir Wilfrid Laurier, and, I think, the Prime Minister of the Cape.

185,Mr Glynn,"I do not deny that theence scheme had been received with a certain amount of applause in Great Britain; but the attitude of the London Times is somewhat significant. This is the greatest organ of English opinion, taken as a whole, and it is the representative At the beginning the Times not only took up the cudgels on behalf of Mr Australian Tariff, the article continuesChamberlain, shifting its position in order to do so, but actually hired political economists to write up his case in a series of articles. This is ithe newspaper which, before the Prime Minister went Home, published a special scries of articles in furtherance of the policy he was going to support; and it is rather significant, I sav, that the Times in the very first article, on his preferential trade proposals condemned them wholesale. I have the weekly edition of the Times here, in which there is a leading article following upon a rather tepid account by its Australian correspondent of what was foreshadowed by the Commonwealth Ministry. out-and-out preference paper saidWe have selected as far as possible the pornothing. tions of the Tariff which deal with commodities in which British commerce is most largely interested, ancl from which the effect upon this country of the changes whicli it has introduced can be most readily estimated, it will be found that the tendency of the whole Tariff is in the direction of .largely increased protection; and, although, in a considerable number of cases, the duties levied on British goods will be somewhat less than those upon goods of the same description arriving from other countries, the general efTect of the whole is in a direction which must be detrimental to our trade. The article concludedWe' fear it must be admitted even by those who are most earnest in promoting commercial intercourse with the Commonwealth, that the course taken by Australian statesmen is scarcely calculated to achieve ihat result. The article then proceeds to call the pre ference proposals derisory. Economist, which is entitled to considerable respect Sn this ""connection, published an article on the operation of preference in Canada, showing how futile ' it is. The article points outThe Trade Department here has been doing it -; best lo jjel the Australian Government to establish preferentialtrade relations with Canada, but thus far without a gleam of success. That is a statement by the Ottawa correspondent of the Economist, in a letter dated 27 th AugustIn Ihe first place, they have flatly refused to suspend the operation of new duties in the case of Canadian goods <n transit. [180] thing else ? clo anything else. I am not referring to that point, but to a different one. To be perfectly honest, '.[ completed the quotation of British national relations. which may perhaps not quite fit in with the views I ami expressing. Dealing with the Canadian trade with Australia does not amount to much, and is likely to diminsh under the adverse influence of the new Australian Tariff. The article goes on to point out that this is really nothing more than protection under a new guise, and protection marked with a selfishness which right through has characterized the system in Canada. The article proceedsThe wholesale distribution of bounties is doing more, perhaps, to arouse public opinion against the existing system than the high' price of manufactures. We may be humbugged into fancying that the high duties on foreign goods are in some mvsterious way beneficial to us all, but no one can persuade iis that the iron men, steel men, petroleum men, lead men, and what-not, And this is what' this are further entitled to draw immense sums from the public Treasury whilst tiie rest of us get These are the observations immediately f o llowing an examination of the new preference system proposed in Australia. There are one or two figures to which I should like very shortly to refer in support of the position I assume that preference of this class, which cannot be regarded as anything but an invitation to establish mutual preference, will injure the Empire. We know that the proposal is not asked for, ancl I have endeavoured to show from the quotations that it is not welcome, and I hope to be able to show that it is not required. If strong proof be wanted that this preference is not asked for, I refer honourable members to the vote given by the great Labour Party in England in September, 1905, against not only any tamThen the pering with the Imperial fiscal system in the direction of protection, but against any form of retaliation or preference..By a card vote of 1,259,000 to 26.000 this party rejected any proposals of the sort, and they are entitled to be regarded as expositors of the democratic"" opinion of Great Britain. It is said that this preference is intended only as a sort of manifestation of our attachment to the Empire. Surely, if we desire to manifest in a substantial and national way, from an Australian point of view, our, attachment-whic h has never been questioned or impugned, and which has been attested in the South African",40,William Lyne I T Is Quite Right Has Increased So Has The Trade Of Foreign

187,Mr Glynn,"I clo not say they shouldwar and on many other occasions-a better way would be to increase our contribution to the Navy that defends, not only the trade in which we 'are interested with Great Britain, but the trade of British Possessions, amounting to something like Â£300,000,000, which never touches the United Kingdom at all. It is senseless to talk like children of offering this petty prefrom foreign countries, and excluding raw ference to manifest a feeling which, as I say, has never been impugned, when a. much cleaner and more rational way is presented, either by increasing our subsidy to the Imperial Navv or our local outlay on naval and military defence, which would, of course, in proportion strengthen the integrity of the .Empire. Anything in the shape of preference must eventually, in varying degrees, affect the most important relationships of the United Kingdom. what wou.ld be the effect of the return wheat in favour of Australia. I find that such a preference to. Australia .would penalize, not only foreign countries, but the rest of the Empire. the figures during the course of this debate, I discovered that India supplies 70 per cent, of the wheat and flour which the United Kingdom imports from. India, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Such a preference given to us in return for what we now offer, would therefore strike at one of the very best exporters of wheat to England. But what would be the whole scope of the preference, as against the rest of the world, including the remaining units of the British Empire? Australia's export of wheat to the United Kingdom in 1905 was against an export of 5,000,000 quarters by Russia, 5,490,000 quarters by the Argentine, 4,000,000 quarters by the United States, ancl 5,900,000 quarters by India. I recognise that, in testing the exports of wheat, one can only take averages; but, whilst I am giving the exports of a particular year, they are not very far from being typical of the proportions of food products sent from the various parts of the world to the British Empire. IfI were to give the figures regarding food products other than wheat, the position would be far more marked. into the United Kingdom in 1904 or 1905 were of the value of Â£[t66,ooo.,ooo; and from the Commonwealth only .Â£6,918,000 worth were sent. These figures alone show the futility of any attempt to induce the Mr Glynn. Mother Countrv, by this implied solicitation, to revert to a system akin to the corn laws, which proved so disastrous to the British people. Is there any scope for preference in respect of the raw materials used in British manufactures ? Two-thirds of forty of the chief raw materials imported into England come materials, 71 per cent, of fifteen other imports come from foreign countries. ' Surely it cannot be urged that preference is a very great stimulus to trade, when we find that the interchange ""between Australia and the United Kingdom is better without preference than is the trade between Canada and the United Kingdom with preference. Canada's exports to Great Britain, in one year were of the value of Â£25,600,000, and her imports from Great Britain of the value of Let us take, for example, Â£17,800,000. Australia at the same time, without any preference, sent to Great Britain Â£[26,500,000 worth of exports, whilst she took from foreign countries only .Â£11,417,000 worth of imports. I have, not at the moment the actual imports of On looking up Australia from the United Kingdom, but I know that the Canadian figures are not as good as our own. The policv of preference has been tried-, not only "" in Great Britain, where it was abandoned some forty or fifty years ago as having led to disputes between some of the dependencies, but in France. France tried the very system that we are now introducing. She imposed a big tax on imports from foreign countries now. since 1892. Under her Tariff, I believe that there are substantially higher duties on imports from foreign countries thaln there are against colonial imports. Trade between France and its colonies is encouraged by a preference; but the result is' that, whilst the external trade of the British Possessions since the abandonment of that policy has increased to about Â£[500,000,000, the external trade of the French colonies and possessions is only about Â£61,000,000. If we take the relative importance of the trade of the United The imports of foodstuffs Kingdom .with Australia and New Zealand and all other countries, we find that the annual average of the export of British produce to Australia and New Zealand from' 1904 to '1906 was Â£[24,896,000, whilst to the other Colonies and Posses-",41,William Lyne I T Is Quite Right Has Increased So Has The Trade Of Foreign

191,Sir John Forrest (Swan) [9.55],"arrangement that we were to give a preference to the Mother Country and to receive no preference by way of return. My idea is that preferential trade involves mutual concessions. At the same time these concessions ' ought not to be made in a huckstering spirit. I disagree with those who urge that there is anything unsatisfactory in entering into a business bargain with the United Kingdom. What are the treaties which are made every day between countries and States but bargains? What were the agreements into -which we entered with New Zealand and South Africa but bargains? What is the arrangement into which we proposed.to enter with Canada but a bargain? I can see nothing unreasonable or improper in entering into an agreement with other countries in precisely the same way as individuals enter into agreements for their mutual advantage. But if we desire to give to the Mother Country a trade advantage I should prefer that we gave her something which is valuable to ourselves, in return for something else which is valuable to her, and which will be valuable to us. stance, the naval defence of the Empire is of the utmost importance to us, and if we are really anxious to help the Mother Country, we have an ""opportunity of doing something in the direction suggested by Mr Hofmeyr in 1887. in regard to assisting the Mother' Country in protecting all parts of the Empire, including Australia. I do not think that we deserve much credit for conceding to Great Britain something which costs us nothing. I do not say that the preferences proposed in this schedule will be of advantage to nobody. who send goods here from the Mother Country will be very glad of them. But they will not cost us anything, seeing that we have largely increased the duties upon British -goods-in many cases having doubled them. posed had not been inserted in this schedule, probably the duties levied upon Britishgoods would have been those proposed upon goods from all parts, of the world. Consequently the proposed preferential duties have assisted the Governport spelter concentrates to the value of ment to secure the imposition of higher rates upon goods from foreign countries, ancl which the people of Australia will be called upon to â pay for many -""years. Therefore, while it appears to be intended as a preference to the United Kingdom, it really is an increased protection to our Sir John Forrest. local manufacturers. There is one thing that I did not gather from the Prime Minâ ister's speech last night nor from that of the Treasurer. Neither of them told us in plain words what was expected by them, ir"" a preference had been granted to Australia by the Mother Country. The general idea of the producers in Australia is that under preferential trade, they will secure a higher price for their products in the British market than is obtained by other people. The Prime Minister did not tell us whether that is his view of the matter. If the fact is as I have stated-and if we are to reciprocate-the price of British goods in our markets ought 'also -to be higher than it is. But nobody desires that. We wish to get every advantage in price for ourselves and to give nothing by way of return.. During this debate we have been told that we must obtain all the advantage that we canfrom those who send us goods, and who are not of our own race. We desire that the Mother Country shall secure the whole of that trade and that foreign goods should not be allowed to For inenter Australia. But we are most anxious to send our products to other countries. As a matter of fact we are very glad to send our commodities to all parts of the world no matter what may be the colour of the people tliere. It appears to me that there is a rood deal of misapprehension as to the countries with which we clo our business. Some persons seem to think that we send practically . everything to Great Britain. But I wouia point out that in 1906 we sent a larger quantity of wool to Belgium, France, GerThose many, and the United States than we did to Great Britain. us if they did not get value for their monev. If the preferences prothat is. a very generous or fair statement. We exported in 1.906 to the United Kingdom wool to the value of ,Â£io,706.181, whereas our export of this commodity to the four above-mentioned countries was valued at Â£[11,566,077. Similarly we exonly. Â£[48,241 to the Mother Country, as against exports to Belgium, France, Germany, and the Netherlands, which are valued at Â£753,033. To other countries we sent only Â£ 1 0 1 worth. In other words, only one-seventeenth of* our export of spelter found its way into the United Kingdom. Then, again, we exported in",43,William Lyne I T Is Quite Right Has Increased So Has The Trade Of Foreign

We also exported Â£[186,000 worth of stock to India in 1906, and we further sent Â£111,000 worth of tanning bark to Germany and only Â£17,000 worth to the United Kingdom. We exported coal to countries other than Great Britain in 1906 to the value of Â£894,000, and butter to trie value of ^335-557We sent to Belgium, France, Germany, and the United States during 1906 practically as much.in-the form of hides and skins as we did to the United Kingdom, the values being to the United Kingdom, Â£ r , 334,000 to the four above-named countries. We sent only Â£[347,000 worth of lead to Great Britain, in 1906, as against Â£483,000 worth to otlier countries. It will be seen, therefore, that the United Kingdom is not the best customer of Australia in regard to the exports I have referred to. friend. with the honourable member. Of course it may be said that these foreign countries must buy from us, the inference being that we have no need to consider them. ber think that they consider us? that in the case of countries, as of individuals, the transaction of lucrative business tends . to engender feeling. done' between the Mother Country ancl the United States increases the good feeling between those nations. There is, therefore, no reason for using the argument that they buy from us because they have to do so. If you do an injury to any one he will probably try*to resent it, and if you show a desire not to recognise those who have been doing business with you, you run the risk of causing resent. ment. Cannot honourable members see that if we .place disabilities on countries with whose people we have been on friendly terms, ancl transacting a large amount of business, we shall engender bad feeling, and they may say, "" We resent this treatment, becaiuse you are not treating us well?""' Perhaps they are not in a position to injure us, but, in the long run, such a selfish policy will be likely to do us more harm than good. I do not desire that these remarks shall be construed to mean that I have no wish to helpj the Mother Country. All my life I have desired to do what I could to keep the Imperial spirit alive in this country ancl to make those with whom I come into contact, especially the young, feel that! they ha.ve inherited a great privilege in being British born, and that they enjoy great advantages from their British parentage,, in ' return for which they sliould do all in their power to foster and encourage loyalty and devotion to the mother land. AnythingI can do, now or hereafter, will be done to. assist in lightening the almost crushing burden placed upon Â£1,336,000,. as against the Mother Country in connection with the defence of our world-wide Empire, which she at present bears almost alone. I do not look upon the proposed preference as a real or genuine one, nor do I approve of the mode in which it is proposed to be given. I regard the Government proposals as' ill-thought out, and unlikely to effect much good; but I am not going to clo anything which might cause it to be thought that I am unwilling to assist the Empire, even to the slightest extent. Therefore, I shall vote with the Government. But I hope that no one will think that, because I do so, 1 approve of the method in which the preference proposals have been placed before us. tleman believes in preference? lieve in reciprocal preference in regard to trade. Had the Chancellor of the Exche-a good quer been able to say to the Prime Minister The great trade which is when i'n London, "" Although we see difficulties in the way of what you propose, let us know exactly what your proposals are,"" the Prime Minister would, I think, have hesitated before placing before him the Tariff and preference proposals which he has now submitted for the approval of honourable members. remarks will have, at any rate, the merit of brevity. I , like the honourable member for Corio, wish to place before my constituents my main reasons for the vote which I intend to give. I am distinctly in favour of .granting a substantial preference to the Mother Country.

214,Mr Liddell,"I agree with the hontrade. In the clothing trade, it is said that the raising of the Tariff will set back the improvement which was beginning to take place. In Northampton, the preferential proposals are characterized as bluff, and a similar opinion is expressed in Sheffield. We ought to feel that we owe more than we can repay to Great Britain, which has given us the land in which we live. We hear a good deal about the ties which, bind us to the Mother Land-abou t the. "" crimson bonds,"" and all that sort of thing-bu t we have to regard not only the interests of Australia, or of the Mother Land, but of the Empire as a whole. It stands to reason that if we could have reciprocal trade, with preference between parts of the Empire, it would be to our advantage; and for that reason, altogether apart fromfeelings of kinship, and because I feel it is the only way to maintain the solidarity of the Empire, I am prepared, although professedly a free trader, to sacrifice to a certain extent my principles in order to encourage such a trade. Mr ""TUDOR (Yarra) ' [10.33] -I am very anxious that we should get on with the consideration of the Tariff, but I desire to explain my attitude in regard to this question. I shall vote for preference if it will give greater protection to the workers of Australia, but if it will mean less protection to those workers, I shall vote against the proposal. With me the fiscal question is a labour question. with' the honourable member. of the workers obtaining the best conditions. much in the case of the harvester duties? much from me as from the honourable member, and I shall see, as far as I can, that this, or any other, Government administer properly and fairly the law to which the honourable member refers. I shall not' vote to give a preference to British goods which are manufactured under sweated conditions; and we know there are industries in Great Britain in which such conditions prevail. That shall be my guide in voting on the preference proposals. If the Government make preference a vital question, I cannot help it, because, as.I say, if preference . means less protection for the workers here, I shall vote against it. Government do not appear at all anxious about our progress with the Tariff. member speak for himself. statement has been evidenced from the very start. I have listened with considerable attention to the arguments in favour of preference; and it appears to me that the offer made is rather like an Irishman's rise in wages. If the English people are satisfied with the preference offered they are satisfied with very little. It is quite apparent, and only consistent with the protective idea, that the Australian manufacturers desire to capture the whole of the trade in Australia. We have evidence of that in the fact that on the great volume of imports from the United Kingdom, the duties have, in almost every case, been doubled. Nothing will convince me that this offer of preference is not a pretence and a sham; and the effect, in regard to goods the bulk of which do not come from Great Britain, is to penalize those who are engaged in the primary industries of Australia. If the Government were' honest, they would at once admit that the preferential duties were for revenue purposes, because all their talk about strengthening the Empire, and encouraging Empire trade, is just a piece of great presumption. There is not a manufacturer in the whole of Australia whp is prepared to take one brick off the Tariff wall in order to allow British goods to come in. The ambition and aim of every manufacturer is to raise the Tariff wall so high that no British goods shall be imported, and yet we have the Government and honourable members here prating about Empire-building by means of the proposed preference. I repeat that this offer is the greatest sham and humbug ever presented to anhonest people. For some, reason or other-perhap s because the Government cracked the whip at the first sigh of, a discussion on the questiona number of honourable ' members have climbed down.'

However, I will say that I think it is a great pity that the question of preference has been mixed up with this schedule. better plan to first deal with the Tariff, and then with the preference proposals. From, the free-trade point of view we might easily have raised the question by selecting a certain number of articles of British manufacture, upon which we could ask the Committee to make a substantial reduction of duty in the case of British goods, while protectionists, if not agreeable to that course,' might have proposed to increase the duties against the foreigner in conformity with their present policy. But, however the question might be raised, it would have been better, as I say, not to have confused preference with this schedule, in which, in my opinion, this important principle is dealt with in a haphazard .and unsatisfactory w ay. As the Committee has decided that the duty under the general Tariff shall be 2d., I should have been prepared to agree to the British preferential duty on candles being fixed at i d . per lb., as it stood under the old Tariff, but for the fact that the British manufacturers themselves have already pointed out that that duty was. prohibitive. It seems ridiculous to propose in such circumstances to increase that duty by 50 per cent. When the honourable member for Grey described as a sham the whole, system of preference which the Government propose, he was well within the mark; he might have used a much stronger expression to fitly describe it. The duty of 2d. per lb.' as against foreign countries to which we haye already agreed will give an absolute monopoly to the local Combine. It may be that a trust is not actually in existence in Australia, but we know that the local manufacturers have an arrangement which in its operation has the same effect as have the operations of a combine or a trust. this before? statement? No interruptions will force me to refrain from expressing my views on. this question. Sir WILLIA M LYNE -Then we must take some other means. ister to put his threat into execution. If honourable members think that I am going to curtail my remarks because of interjections and threats, whether they come from Ministers or any one else, they are very much mistaken. Under the old duty of i d . It would have been a far per lb. British imports of candles were shut out. The total imports under the heading of ""Candles, tapers, and night lights"" amounted in 1906 to 1,800,000 lbs., of which only 133.000 lbs. came from Great Britain. !As a matter of fact, I ?.m informed no candles were imporred from Great Britain. If we are not going to give as we did ' under the old duty a monopoly to the local trusts the least we can do is to afford the Mother Country an opportunity to secure' a little bit of the trade. She could not obtain any share of it under the duty of i d . per lb., and therefore the Committee ought to be prepared to reduce that duty to f d . per lb. The honourable member for Grey said there T was no possibility of the Committee agreeing to an honest preference to Great Britain. In moving this motion I give the Committee an opportunity to show whether or not that statement is correct. I believe that it is, but I want to test the sincerity of those protectionists who talk so glibly about their desire to give preference to the United Kingdom, yet oppose every .genuine attempt to give it.",47,William Lyne I T Is Quite Right Has Increased So Has The Trade Of Foreign

227,Mr Johnson,"I challenge the Min[10.51] I did not think that the Committee' would be asked at this stage of the debate fo agree to a further amendment except such as I understood that the honourable member for Lang would move, namely, a.reversion to the old duty of id . per lb. We have already decided that the general Tariff in respect of paraffine candles shall be 2d. per lb., and I wish to point out what would be the effect of. the reduction proposed by the honourable member for Lang. Under the old Tariff, paraffine wax and stearine, which constitutes 50 per cent, of the raw material of our candle makers, was dutiable at Jd. per lb., but under item 42 of the present Tariff it is dutiable at i d . per lb. That being so, if that duty be carried-and we have a right to assume that it will be-and this . amendment be adopted, the manufacturers of candles will be in a worse iposition under this Tariff presentatives of the British Government at than they occupied before. That is a point which the Committee ought to consider. I take it that no honourable member, wliether he be a free-trader or a protectionist, has entered this Hbuse with the idea of injuring an industry. If wepass the amendment now moved by the honourable member for Lang, however, we shall seriously prejudice the candle manufacturers of Australia. The Government apparently believe that the manufacture of stearine is an industry that is worthy of consideration,' otherwise they would not have placed a higher duty upon it, and in this connection we have a right to regard it as a raw material of the product now under discussion. It is certainly no part of our duty to interfere with an industry which is already carrying on operations in Australia. If we take any action in regard to it, it should be in thc direction of assisting, rather than retarding, it ; and, that being so, I am sure that the Committee will hesitate to agree to this amendment. We have reached a time when we are practically providing ourselves with all the candles we require. The line now under discussion is of vital interest to the sister State of Tasmania. There the manufacture of paraffine candles is carried on to a greater extent than in any other part of the Commonwealth. That', perhaps, is due to the fact that the milder climate of Tasmania enables paraffine candles to be used more advantageously there than they could be used, say,-in New South Wales. If this proposal be adopted, the manufacturers of paraffine candles in Tasmania will not be able to carry on operations. I trust that the industry will receive the consideration it deserves. We are offering a fair amount of preference to the Mother Country. id. per lb. candles from Great Britain were shut out. able member for Lang said that one of bis reasons for moving this amendment was that he desired to give a substantial preference to the Mother Country. I quite agree with him that only a small proportion of our imports of candles comes from the United Kingdom, but that is because candles from Belgium are very much better than are those coming .from Great Britain. The policy of the Government, and,"" I hope, of this Parliament, is that Australian industries shall be built' up. The Prime Minister clearly showed last night, by quotations from speeches made by rethe Imperial Conference, that they recognised that our first duty was to Australia. That being so, I think it is worthwhile considering whether we ought, as proposed by the honourable member for Lang, to so reduce a duty as to cause it to be destructive, rather' than constructive, in its application to one of our industries.
