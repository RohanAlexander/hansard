165,Mr Albanese (Grayndler,"Leader ofThursday, 26 February 2009 ----Ms Burke took the chair at 9.30 am. Swan Electorate: Queens Park Junior Football Club in my electorate to present some trophies. I went there as a representative of the Perth Football Club as I am the director of junior development at that club. While I was there I was pleased to receive a copy of a book titled Queens Park Junior Football Club Kicks Off!!! A History of the Queens Park Junior Football Club 1965-2008 written by Rebecca Doughty. The book describes a history which demonstrates the strong relationship between sporting organisations and community. I would like to share some of the stories written in this book with the parliament today. Queens Park Junior Football Club has existed for 44 years. This is not to be confused with the senior Queens Park Football Club, formerly the Canning Football Club, that was established in 1912 consisting mainly of volunteer firefighters, who have been in the press quite a bit lately. The story of the junior football club begins with Sister Kate’s Children’s Home which operated from 1936 until the 1980s. Sister Kate was sent from England to Australia to help disadvantaged children. The Parkerville Children’s Home she established is still operational today as a shelter for homeless youth and children at risk, something I have spoken about in this House before. Later she established the Queens Park children’s home for Aboriginal children and operated it for 15 years until she died in 1946. After Sister Kate’s death in 1946, Sister Kate’s assistant and friend Miss Lefroy continued to operate the home and established a football team. Children who attended the Queens Park primary schools engaged in football at Sister Kate’s and, after it had been established, these children played with the Queens Park Junior Football Club. There are plans to redevelop Sister Kate’s into an aged care facility for Aboriginals and a website has been established to support this plan. In 1958 a group of neighbours who had moved into the newly built homes in Donaldson Street, Queens Park, became close friends and took up the challenge of starting a football club. The group attempted to collaborate with Sister Kate’s club although establishing Sister Kate’s club formally was proving difficult. Eventually Queens Park Junior Football Club was born as its own entity and Sister Kate’s team joined them. They officially entered competition in 1965. Back then the club consisted of just a handful of kids. Over the years the club has expanded and is now a very important club within the Perth junior district. The original president was Colin Willey, from 1966 to 1968. He also held the position of secretary in the years 1973 and 1974. In the last few years in my role as director of junior development at the Perth Football ClubI have had the pleasure of dealing with Peter Salter and Dianne Brown who have both been presidents of the club. They have an enormous capacity for work and they have managed to hold this club together through some very difficult periods, which has benefited the club. During their time there has been an increase in the number of players representing Queens Park in the district representative sides. I wish this proud club, all its members and particularly its volunteers all the best for the future and know that they will be around for another 44 years at least. I thank them for the book, MAIN COMMITTEE",124,Adjournment
166,Mr Irons (Swan) (9.30 Am),"Last year I attended the Queens Park Junior Football Clubwhich is extremely interesting. I am probably going to put it in the Parliamentary Library and I am very happy to stand up here and talk about their club. Thank you. Youth Membership in Political Organisations very bright young woman, Melissa Westbrook, who spent a day in my office recently. They are about how young people might be best served by federal politicians. It has been suggested that rates of youth membership in political organisations are dropping which is a predicament when one considers that existing party memberships are ageing. Some speculate that this drop in numbers indicates that the current 18to 25-year-old age bracket is politically apathetic or uninvolved, but there is much evidence to show that this is simply not the case. Young people are now channelling their community values in different ways from previous generations and there are a number of things that federal politicians can focus on in order to politically engage people and better represent their needs and interests federally. Federal MPs can encourage young people to become more politically involved by introducing programs that focus on them being citizens rather than becoming citizens. Current school pedagogies focus on civic education programs that provide young people with the tools to exercise civil liberties for when they come of age. This is not a bad thing as education into our institutions and models is a must if we are to have well-rounded, responsible citizens. Federal MPs can, however, recognise that there needs to more of an outlet for the practical application of politics for young people, as only four per cent of a student population at any school get elected to a student reps council and an even smaller figure get elected to a university board or SRC. Federal MPs can provide assistance in terms of the formation and funding of programs where young people get a chance to take the reins on important issues. Social science studies have shown that young people are driven to focus on making a difference. They are often found in studies to be a results driven generation strongly motivated by a desire to make a direct impact on a cause that matters to them. Federal MPs can focus on opening these sorts of doorways for young people, with a strong focus on recognition and achievement. Moreover, it must be recognised that young people now are less concerned with the affairs of the state than they are with specific causes and movements. As a result of the information boom, young people are channelling their naturally-felt obligation to be good citizens into broader, more international issues such as climate change and foreign affairs rather than party affiliation and voting. This is a challenge for federal MPs as one of the key problems in trying to engage young people is that they feel obligated to participate in democracy but often feel they have very little power to do so. This is a sentiment MPs can focus on changing. It is a sentiment that has already led to a new brand of youth political action in the rise of internet blogging and course-oriented website building. MPs can help by acknowledging this individualised, digitally oriented approach to politics by providing more technological forums for young people to participate in federal issues. These could include online chat forums, consultations and mobile alerts in order to provide ongoing liaisons for young people and youth organisations in a way that speaks their language. Ultimately, the key point for federal members looking to engage young people in their electorates is quite simply to provide those young people with the means to get their hands dirty. MAIN COMMITTEE",125,Constituency Statements
167,Mr Butler (Port Adelaide) (9.33 Am),"The following words were written for me by aInterest Rates and interest rates, and I particularly want to raise the plight of one of my constituents, Eric Charlier, who is a director of a company called ActionCOACH. The issue with second-tier lenders is simply that interest rates go up faster than the Reserve Bank adjustments, and they come down slower. We have seen in the last few months that interest rates at the cash rate have dropped from a high of 7.25 per cent to 3.25 per cent at the cash rate level, which is the lowest in some 40 years. At the same time, the rates of second-tier lenders have not come down. IfI could quote a situation that Eric Charlier is currently facing, his lender, Bluestone, on a number of occasions has raised its interest rates over and above the cash rate that the Reserve Bank raised last year, taking his interest rate to above 13 per cent. Interest rates have, as we know, come down, to the point where a standard variable rate now for a package with National Australia Bank is 5.11 per cent-if you are on their portfolio program-reflecting the cash rate at 3.25 per cent. Yet with second-tier lenders like Bluestone, rates have come down only to 11.39 per cent, with Bluestone informing Mr Charlier on 23 February that it would be dropping rates by only 0.5 per cent rather than passing on the full one per cent cut. Mr Charlier has also indicated that Bluestone has consistently refrained from passing on the full amount of decreases and has, in fact, added other charges to the mortgages as interest rates have decreased. Whilst every second-tier lender has a range of issues and an expense base and it is almost impossible to put them all together into one lump, I would question whether second-tier lenders are actually doing enough to reduce rates in the current climate where their cost of borrowing has so dramatically decreased. I therefore call on second-tier lenders, like Bluestone, to look at their expense base, to look at the way they work out their loan structures, and to pass on the full rate reductions that the Reserve Bank is passing. If lenders can borrow money at a lower cash rate then those who are the beneficiaries of those funds through loans should benefit from the reduction in those rates. I would call on a full pass-through of rate reduction by all lenders, especially the second tier. Ovarian Cancer Ms HALL (Shortland) (9.38 am)-Yesterday all members of the House wore a blue ribbon to raise awareness of ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer has been known over the years as a silent disease, but it is not quite as silent as people think. Women do have symptoms of ovarian cancer-symptoms such as abdominal bloating, feeling full, appetite loss, unexplained weight gain, constipation, heartburn, back pain, frequent urination, abdominal or pelvic pain and fatigue. The reason that I feel so passionate about this particular form of cancer is that 12 months ago I lost a very dear friend who had ovarian cancer. She did not have it diagnosed until it was too late. She lived for almost five years with the cancer. The five-year relative survival rate has increased. It was 32.7 per cent from 1982 to 1986 and 39.8 per cent from 1998 to 2004. There is a growing awareness of ovarian cancer. More women are aware that they need to look for these symptoms. It is the ninth most common cancer diagnosed in Australian women, so it is not to be scoffed at. Women should really focus on the symptoms that I mentioned beMAIN COMMITTEE",126,Constituency Statements
168,Mr Robert (Fadden) (9.36 Am),"I rise to raise an issue regarding second-tier lendersfore. If they have any of those symptoms, they should go and see their doctor. It is better to ask about it than to find out when it is too late. The present life expectancy of Australian women is 83 years. One in 77 women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer before the age of 85. In Australia in 2005 a total of 1,205 women were diagnosed with ovarian cancer. It is projected that there will be 1,378 new cases of ovarian cancer in 2010. The older a woman becomes, the more likely she is to develop ovarian cancer. It is the sixth most common cause of cancer death in Australian women. In 2005, 888 women died of this cancer. It is so important for women to listen to their bodies and check to see if they have this cancer. I only wish my friend had done so. (Time expired) New South Wales Floods on the mid-North Coast of New South Wales, to say a few thankyous and to give a report to the parliament on an event of last week that might have received greater significance in this place if there were not such devastating events happening elsewhere, both north and south, on the east coast of Australia. I start on that point because probably what I am most proud about from last week is the ‘two-bucket’ mentality of the local communities of the mid-North Coast. While they had a bucket and mop in one hand for cleaning out shops and homes, there was still very much a commitment to the greater good within Australia through the ‘bucket drive’ of support for victims of the Victorian bushfires, in particular. This was still going on, despite people being very wet. The fundraising campaign is going on throughout the mid-North Coast, despite it being in fairly deep waters as a result of the flooding. It was certainly a proud moment for me to see that, and it is something for all of us to reflect on in a positive way as far as community is concerned. ‘No lives lost’ is an old surf club term, and the mid-North Coast was very lucky to be able to use it throughout the past week. There were seven serious rescues. Not much airtime was given to that, but things could have gone wrong very easily. SoI very much thank the various agencies, particularly the state based agencies, for their rescue and recovery efforts. The SES have now centralised their phone number system, with the 132500 number, and that made a big difference on the ground. It made it very easy for those in need. I thank those state agencies, including the police and the other agencies. I will also mention the ABC. With all the disaster relief that has been happening, the ABC do deserve a wrap-and they have been mentioned in various speeches from members. I know they are putting a funding submission to the government at the moment. I hope that is considered. They are an emergency service in regional areas. I have met with the Insurance Council of Australia. About $5 million of insurance claims are in so far. You can draw a comparison with about $800 million of claims in Victoria. That shows the difference, but there have been about 300 claims from the mid-North Coast so far. I am about to meet with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and thank him for his commitment to the primary producers who may have some issues. I will continue to talk at length with him. The key issue for government to consider is the damage to local infrastructure. The area does have natural disaster relief under state rules.

Lowe Electorate: Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program community infrastructure program. I am delighted to record that the Enfield Olympic Swimming Pool in my electorate of Lowe will receive $190,000 to upgrade its amenities under the community infrastructure program. Those funds are part of the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, the Hon. Anthony Albanese’s, $250 million component of the program, allocating a share to every local council and shire in Australia. The Enfield swimming pool is Sydney’s oldest freshwater swimming pool and it celebrated its 75th birthday in November last year. Burwood Council recently funded the construction of an indoor heated pool, and the new change rooms, to be funded by the federal government, will make the entire facility an all-round water wonderland for the residents in my electorate of Lowe. The pool hosts many children’s swimming lessons, aquarobic classes and swimming clubs. The upgrade to the change rooms will be warmly welcomed by the patrons of this fabulous facility. The community infrastructure program was initially announced by the Prime Minister on 18 November last year. The program gave every council and shire the opportunity to submit projects for the benefit of their community. It is terrific that the submissions to Infrastructure Australia are processed so quickly so that the fantastic improvements to our local communities can be delivered as soon as possible. I am also very pleased to note that, despite the best efforts of the Liberal and National parties to prevent the $42 billion Nation Building and Jobs Plan passing through the parliament, an additional $500 million for community infrastructure projects will be made available to local councils this year. That brings the total funding available for community infrastructure to $800 million. Minister Albanese highlights that this is the single largest investment in local infrastructure in Australia’s history. This initiative will result in the improvement of sports grounds, community centres, swimming pools, town halls and many more worthwhile projects in every electorate in Australia. Without federal funding assistance, I know that many of these projects would not be possible. The program is important to our local community because it stimulates the economy, supports local jobs and invests in quality long-term infrastructure which will be utilised and enjoyed by generations to come. I take this opportunity to congratulate Burwood Council on their application for this funding and note the good work of the mayor, Councillor Lesley Furneaux-Cook, who is continuing to work hard for her municipality, following in the steps of former mayor, Councillor John Faker. Burwood Council will receive the approval for the funding shortly, and I encouraged them to organise the relevant paperwork as quickly as they can to ensure the construction work can be underway as soon as practicable. In my more than 10 years as federal member for Lowe, I have made many representations to Canberra supporting local projects like this and today I am pleased that the Rudd government is delivering for my electorate. I commend the Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, and Minister Anthony Albanese for this worthy initiative, and I look forward to further funding announcements for other councils in my electorate of Lowe.

170,Mr Murphy (Lowe) (9.45 Am),"Today, I rise to speak about the Rudd government’sMacarthur Electorate: Camden Hospital with a fully operational maternity ward and an emergency ambulance drop-off. But, sadly, due to the New South Wales Labor government’s cutbacks in health and the underinvestment in the Camden Hospital, the area hospital is degenerating into a subacute-care medical centre. No longer is there a fully operational emergency ward and there are no facilities for birthing and no maternity ward. I was part of a very large crowd-over 300 people-who walked through the streets of Camden protesting to our local state members about the importance of Camden Hospital and protesting that facilities have actually gone backwards over the last 10 years. There was a time, 10 years ago, when Camden Hospital had a birthing clinic, a fully operational emergency ward and was in a growth phase. But, of course, since the New South Wales government came to power and started their cutbacks, those services have decreased greatly. While the population grows, the services are cut back. In 1998, Camden LGA had a population of 40,180. It now has a population of 52,166 residents, and yet services have declined greatly. I was disappointed that the federal Minister for Health and Ageing was unwilling to take up my open invitation to inspect Camden Hospital even though she was in the region just last week with the cabinet, meeting in the Campbelltown area, and I would encourage her to come along and see the facilities-or lack of facilities-out there in the Camden area. I know that the Prime Minister of Australia, the Hon. Kevin Rudd, has mentioned that the buck is going to stop with him, that he is going to make a difference to the health system throughout the whole of Australia, and that no longer will other people be blamed-that he is prepared to accept all concerns and all blame in relation to health and education and so many other things in this country. AllI want to say on that is that this is an opportunity for him to not just speak about doing that but to actually do something about it and to work with the New South Wales government to provide them with funding to be able to keep Camden Hospital as a fully functional hospital instead of the skeleton of a premises that it is at this time. I think it is appalling that, while Camden is going to grow to the size of Canberra, with an extra 100,000 homes being developed in that area as we speak, our facilities are going backwards. The people of the Camden district-and, indeed, the Southern Highlands and the whole of south-western Sydney-deserve much better, and I am calling on the federal government to support the New South Wales government in this matter. Wakefield Electorate: Rotary Club of Kapunda punda on having their 50th anniversary on 31 January this year. It was held at the Dutton Park club rooms, the home of the Bombers, my old football team. And, of course, Kapunda is the town I grew up in. So it was terrific to see this organisation which has played such an active and committed role in the community life of this town-Rotary received its charter in 1958celebrate this anniversary. It was interesting to hear Bruce Eastick, who is a former Mayor of Gawler and was a charter member of the Gawler Rotary Club as well, speak about events in that first meeting on that first night in 1958. Bruce has played a great role in the local community in and around Gawler. MAIN COMMITTEE",129,Constituency Statements

172,Mr Champion (Wakefield) (9.51 Am),"I rise to congratulate the Rotary Club of KaThe achievements of the Kapunda Rotary Club are really quite prominent in the town. Probably the most prominent achievement has been the building of ‘Map the Miner’, which was an idea of John Davidson in 1986, to celebrate the contribution that the Cornish miners made to the state of South Australia. They made Kapunda the oldest mining town in South Australia and one of the oldest in the country. Map the Miner is a statue, about 13 metres high, of a Cornish miner, commissioned by the Rotary Club, and designed and built by Ben van Zetten. Unfortunately, although it was finished in 1988, it was burnt down, I think at the start of 2007. So it was damaged by fire but then rebuilt and made bigger and better and, thank God, it has been made fireproof! It is a really prominent sign of Kapunda’s heritage. Another thing the Rotary Club has achieved is the construction of a helipad at Kapunda Hospital, something that has been used often to help people who have had car accidents and the like, and has obviously saved many lives. Brian Good fellow and Don Franks were involved in that project and David Quodling gave an admirable speech to the meeting on that. We also had Dean Rohlach, my old school principal, receive the Paul Harris Fellowship. The night itself was organised by Anne Hornsey, who has made a magnificent contribution to the town, to the school where she worked for many years and also to the Rotary Club, along with her husband Robert Hornsey, who is, of course, the Mayor of the Light Regional Council. So this is a club that is very dear to my heart and a town that is very dear to my heart. Victorian Bushfires all those involved in the recent Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria. In particular, I mourn for those who lost their lives in this horrific blaze and I pray for those who lost loved ones. The tragedy is all the more real for me because I know many of the areas so well. The first five years of my life were on a soldier-settler’s block at Flowerdale, where my parents had a sheep property. My forebears, extended family and many friends come from Yea, Alexandra, Thornton, Kerrisdale, Whittlesea, Kinglake, Doreen and the Yarra Valley and surrounding areas. A brother of mine lives at Traralgon. It is hard to reconcile the devastation and the ferocity of the fires with the beauty and the serenity that I know and the uncomplicated and welcoming nature of these very special parts of Victoria. I feel deeply for all those affected. I admire enormously the efforts of the brave and selfless firefighters and the many forms of assistance provided so willingly and instinctively by so many members of our community. It is a great tribute to the character of our community. For so many, their lives will be forever altered. Scars will remain. Memories will not diminish. I still remember vividly-most vividly-as a nine-year-old grabbing treasured possessions and being bundled into our FJ Holden with my many brothers and sisters as fires bore down on our dairy farm at Epping, not that far from the areas hit by the Black Saturday fires. I remember the sense of loss and destruction when my parents told us that our property had been burnt out, despite saving the house, sheds and cows, and the sense of deep anguish and sheer disbelief that a neighbour had died on our property when his knapsack was caught in the fence wire as the fire swept through. That was nearly 50 years ago, yet it is with me still. The memory is as clear as if it was yesterday. So too will the memories and the emotions remain with those affected in the Black Saturday fires. Yet we are a resilient people, and those affected will in due course pick up the pieces and seek to make the most of life. I offer my condolences and my best wishes.

173,Mr Robb (Goldstein) (9.54 Am),"I rise to convey my deep regrets to and sympathy forFranklin Electorate: Urban Black Gum Reserve Rehabilitation and Community Education Project Ms COLLINS (Franklin) (9.57 am)-I want to talk about a project that I was fortunate enough to launch in the southernmost municipality in Australia last week, in the Huon Valley. It is a Green Corps project. It is a partnership between the Huon Valley Council and Central Victorian Group Training, and it is called the Urban Black Gum Reserve Rehabilitation and Community Education Project. It is a 26-week program. Its aim is to improve the black gum reserve area, to help protect its unique species. The Huon Valley environment network approached the Huon Valley Council about two years ago wanting to highlight the importance of a piece of remnant bush. It is a five-hectare block that contains a wide diversity of flora and fauna, but, more importantly, it includes the black gum reserve, which is significant due to the presence of a threatened species of swamp gum. The swamp gum is habitat for the endangered swift parrot. The black gum reserve has several natural wetland areas and a diversity of vegetation types. It is also very close to the centre of the township of Huonville. When I arrived at the black swamp gum reserve, I was really surprised to see that such a diverse habitat was only a few streets away from the busy town centre. It was no wonder that the Huon Valley Council was so eager to see this area preserved. I want to congratulate the eight young people who are taking part in this project. They will receive accredited training in environment and resource management. They will be doing a lot of work over the next 26 weeks. They are looking at collecting seeds and propagating and planting seedlings. They are looking at constructing swift parrot nesting boxes; undertaking weed control; constructing tracks, bridges, benches and tables; and hosting a community field day, as well as conducting school environmental education with the Huon Valley primary school. When these young people were asked why they were involved in the Green Corps project, they were very honest with some of their answers. Their reasons ranged from wanting to contribute to the environment to doing it just for the money, but I was really thrilled that they were so enthusiastic about this project. I hope that their enthusiasm continuesparticularly during the winter months in Tasmania, as it does become a bit colder-as they work through this. Their team leader, Leon le Bon, is a very enthusiastic young man, and I hope that his team does very well over the next 26 weeks. 193 the time for constituency statements has concluded.

175,Mr Ciobo (Moncrieff) (10.00 Am),"I rise this morning in response to the House of Repartists receiving an income stream from their work-as opposed to the income stream that is able to be achieved by those that record music, for example, or by authors of works of literature-do not prevent them from receiving that income stream. One way of addressing this difference between visual artists and musicians or other artists-and this has been put forward under the Berne conventionA division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 10.02am to 10.14 am accordance with the Berne convention to look at rewarding visual artists by providing an income stream which essentially is directed at putting them on the same footing as musicians or authors of books. I know this was a commitment of the Labor government and is a commitment that has been followed through by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, the member for Kingsford Smith. What is also very clear is that once again the Australian Labor Party has not taken into account the very legitimate concerns that have been raised in the development of this Resale Royalty Right for Visual Artists Bill 2008. Perhaps mindful of that, the minister on the first reading speech directed the legislation to the Standing Committee on Climate Change, Water, Environment and the Arts in order to obtain the committee’s views on the bill. This of itself was interesting. I was surprised that the minister referred it to a House of Representatives committee. It is not a common practice and in fact, as all members would know, typically these types of matters are referred to Senate committees for review. The cynic might say the minister did it because he knew that in the House of Representatives the Labor government controls the majority of the committee. As it turns out, the committee report was supported by both coalition and Labor members. What is crystal clear in this committee’s report is that the bill in its current shape is fundamentally flawed. The question may also be posed whether the bill is so badly flawed that it is unworkable in its current concept. There are a variety of views as to how fatal the flaws in this bill are, but what is clear from this report from the committee is that their very specific recommendation to the minister is that the legislation not be continued with, the bill not be proceeded with. It said: The committee was mindful of these competing views throughout its deliberations and it has concluded that a number of matters need to be further investigated before the bill proceeds. The competing views that that sentence refers to are essentially two principal views that are put forward on this bill. The committee summarises that there is widespread support for the resale royalty scheme but also notes that those supporters typically feel that the current legislation would deliver very little by way of royalties to artists at the commencement of the proposed scheme and also the view that the proposed scheme is out of step with other schemes already in place internationally. On the other hand there are those who believe that any sort of royalty scheme will only benefit relatively few, and in fact literally a handful of already successful artists and/or their estates, and the imposition of another levy on art purchases will adversely affect the primary art market and future resales of art work may as a consequence go offshore and be sold in other markets where no resale royalty right scheme exists. They are the two principal points of view that are put forward. What is also clear is that the committee-and I notice that there is a member of the committee here and I will be interested in their comments-has stated unequivocally that the bill that is before the House requires MAIN COMMITTEE",132,Resale Royalty Right For Visual Artists Bill 2008
176,Mr Ciobo,"In continuation, resale royalty right is a concept that has been developed inmuch further investigation before it can proceed. This also highlights that this bill as it currently stands should not be proceeded with. The minister’s timetable of the introduction of this from 1 July is blown out of the water. I have to say on behalf of the arts community that I have been talking with a large number of artists, with intermediaries in galleries and with some of the significant collectors of Australian artworks, and universally across-the-board I would say to the minister that there is condemnation of this flawed bill. This committee report highlights why there is condemnation of this flawed bill, and it is time that this minister stood up, took a graceful back step, acknowledged the fundamental flaws in this legislation, acknowledged that he has got it very wrong, and acknowledged that the department, although I am sure they have used their bona fides and best efforts in drafting this bill, have made a number of mistakes. It is time that this minister listened to the views of me and the opposition as well as the views of those stakeholders in the arts community and fundamentally addressed the concerns that have been raised. Whether it is clause 11, which deals with the retrospectivity issue, or whether it is the broad operation of the resale scheme or whether there should be a cap-a whole raft of issues that the committee has considered in this report need to be looked at and closely evaluated by the minister and by the department before going forward. My concern and the concern raised by this committee-and we share indeed a number of the concerns-can be summed up really by illustrating one key point. Perhaps the singlelargest area of friction in the bill as it is presented at the moment is the non-retrospective nature of the bill-in other words, the committee has highlighted that the bill as it stands will only apply to the secondary sale and will only embrace a very small number of artworks on an ongoing basis. It could even be suggested that in its current proposed form the bill will have such a narrow scope of operation that the central collecting agency that the government intends to appoint through the tender process will not even be viable. The government is throwing $1.5 million of taxpayers’ money at the central collecting agency under the proposed draft legislation to sustain the collecting agency in its first three years. But in its current draft it is entirely sensible and in fact reasonable to conclude that beyond that three-year period without ongoing taxpayer assistance the whole scheme could fall apart-it could come undone and be unsustainable-and then where would Australian artists be left? So Australian artists have every right to be very fearful of the major flaws in this draft bill, and again I urge this minister to take a graceful step back, to acknowledge his mistakes and to sit down and start again with respect to resale royalty rights rather than stubbornly digging his heels in, refusing to listen to anyone, refusing to admit his mistakes and pressing on with something that basically has zero support at all out there in the community. When it comes to the central point of friction, it is to do with the retrospectivity issue and the operation of clause 11. The fundamental problem as well is that we have a minister who is unwilling to share the legal advice that the Solicitor-General’s office has provided the minister and the government about whether or not constitutionally retrospectivity can be brought into play. I know and I know the Labor member opposite, a member of the committee, knows that this committee was very frustrated at the unwillingness of the minister and the government to release this information. I again say to the minister: release the legal advice you have, because we know that there is eminent advice from other members of the legal profession which indicates that they disagree very strongly with the conclusions that this minister is forcing the MAIN COMMITTEE committee, all members of the arts community and the opposition to accept blindly-that is, that the advice stipulates that retrospectivity would make the bill unconstitutional. It is not good enough. Where is the notion of accountability? Where is the notion of transparency? Where is the notion of the government providing stakeholders and the opposition with the information they need to make an informed decision? It is not good enough that the minister is wanting to keep everyone like mushrooms in the dark about the most fundamental aspect of this legislation-that is, the legal advice which addresses clause 11 and the whole question of the operation of retrospectivity. It is not acceptable. It was not acceptable to the committee and it is not acceptable to me as the shadow minister. This minister is running scared and is unwilling to provide that legal advice publicly. It frustrated the committee, it frustrates me and I know it frustrates all of those stakeholders in the arts community-who, frankly, are unwilling to accept at face value the minister’s assurances that the advice from the Solicitor-General is good enough and that the advice from the Solicitor-General indicates that clause 11 and indeed the retrospectivity issue cannot be addressed in any other way. If there was consistent legal opinion that supported that point of view, things might be different. But there is not. There is eminent advice from the legal profession, which the committee itself took evidence on, which indicates that, in the view of those legal professionals, the Solicitor-General’s advice could be wrong or at the very least certainly very debatable. In the face of this public rejection of that point, we have a minister running scared and a government unwilling to be transparent-unwilling to provide this most basic information so that stakeholders can have an informed point of view. In conclusion, I can say that there is a rocky road ahead for the resale royalty bill based on essentially a couple of key points. The first is the unwillingness of the minister to release the legal advice. This legal advice should be released sooner rather than later-the legal advice should be released, full stop-in order to ensure that all stakeholders and I, as the shadow minister, have a chance to actually look at the contention which the minister has put forward and which he refuses to actually provide any substantive evidence of. The other key point is that the committee has been frustrated in their investigation process. I welcome the report but I note their frustrations. It presents a rocky road for the passage of this bill because nobody is happy. Stakeholders in the debate are not happy, whether they are artists, galleries or, indeed, collectors of Australian artworks. I am not happy with the approach adopted by the government. The committee is not happy with the approach adopted by the government. It can all essentially be brought back to one key issue: the unwillingness of the minister for the environment, the member for Kingsford Smith, to acknowledge he has got this very wrong, to acknowledge that he needs to be more transparent and to acknowledge that he needs to take a backward step. I urge the minister to take account of this very important concluding sentence that is incorporated in the committee’s report, which says ‘it has concluded that a number of matters need to be further investigated before the Bill proceeds’. The minister needs to take account of that very salient point by the committee. I welcome the committee’s report and I welcome their conclusions. I acknowledge their frustration at dealing with the minister on this issue. We have a long way to go on this issue. The minister’s timetable is already blown out of the water. The minister should accept and acknowledge that and should move forward in good faith MAIN COMMITTEE to ensure that we can actually get a unified approach to this, instead of this basket case of a bill that is currently before the House. House of Representatives Standing Committee on Climate Change, Water, Environment and the Arts on the Resale Royalty Right for Visual Artists Bill 2008. I was a member of the committee that looked into the matters that have been reported back to this House in that report and, let me say from the outset, the introduction of this bill is long overdue. It is a bill that I commend the minister for introducing, and for doing so as quickly as he has been able to since becoming a minister of government. It is long overdue because it was back in 1977 that Australia acceded to the Berne convention. The convention was drafted in Paris in 1971, and it effectively gave protection to the literary and artistic works of artists around the world. So we have a convention being established in 1971, we have Australia agreeing to that convention in 1977 with formal entry into it in 1978, and now, 31 years later, we still have done nothing about ensuring that the rightful entitlements of artists are protected and provided to them. SoI certainly congratulate the minister for getting on with what should have been done a long, long time ago. Interestingly, already 54 countries of the 164 that signed the Berne convention have introduced a resale scheme of some kind or another. It is true that those schemes have some differences in different countries of the world; they all have peculiarities about them that make them somewhat different between one country and another. But, broadly speaking, they all set up a framework to ensure that artists get the rightful entitlements that they deserve and are entitled to. Amongst those countries, I have to say that both the UK and the European Union are signatories to it. I want to quote from the Berne convention, because I think it is important that members understand exactly what it says. The convention states: (1) The author, or after his death the persons or institutions authorized by national legislation, shall, with respect to original works of art and original manuscripts of writers and composers, enjoy the inalienable right to an interest in any sale of the work subsequent to the first transfer by the author of the work. (2) The protection provided by the preceding paragraph may be claimed in a country of the Union only if legislation in the country to which the author belongs so permits, and to the extent permitted by the country where this protection is claimed. (3) The procedure for collection and the amounts shall be matters for determination by national legislation. That is what this bill does. It is Australia’s national legislation in response to the Berne convention. Because artists have been denied their rightful entitlements for so long, there are too many artists in this country who no longer apply their artistic ability to creating artworks. A number of my acquaintances are very good artists-I have seen their work; I have got some of their work-who have not been able to continue to be artists because the remuneration simply was not there and they have had to go back to relying on other forms of income, in turn denying them the time that they need to apply themselves to creating the artwork that they are so good at doing. SoI have seen it myself. BeforeI came into this place, as Mayor of the City of Salisbury I would regularly host art exhibitions for young students of the schools in the area from which I came. These artworks MAIN COMMITTEE",133,Resale Royalty Right For Visual Artists Bill 2008
177,Mr Zappia (Makin) (10.26 Am),"I, too, wish to speak in respect of the report from theshowed an extraordinary level of talent amongst those young people; talent that I am sure could have been developed in the years ahead. But, sadly, I do not know too many of them who have continued to apply that talent. Again, I suspect because they understand that there is simply not the remuneration there as the law currently exists, they do not pursue those talents and skills. Quite frankly, because they do not, we as a society are the poorer. The resale royalty scheme provides a key incentive for those artists who do have talent to in fact continue with that work. There have certainly been some questions raised by a number of people as a result of the bill being introduced into parliament and, because we were aware of these concerns, the committee, quite rightly, held a public hearing into the bill. IfI recall correctly, we received over 40 written submissions and, on the day, we heard from around eight or nine representatives-some speaking on behalf of others. So we got a really good cross-section of all of the issues relating to the concerns with the current bill. Having listened carefully to those issues, I have to say that, by and large, the bill gets most of the issues pretty right. Yes, there could be some fine tweaking of some matters-and the nine recommendations that the committee has put forward, I believe, do that. They were not controversial matters. They were matters where, on perhaps a second look at the bill, one might say, ‘Have you allowed for this? If not, do you think it would be a good idea to amend the bill in this way?’ There is only one critical issue that is perhaps still the subject of some controversy, and that is the issue referred to by the member for Moncrieff, relating to clause 11-the issue of retrospectivity. It relates to section 51(xxxi) of the Constitution and what lawyers might describe as ‘acquisition of property on other than just terms’. It relates to the fact that, under the current bill, the resale royalty scheme cannot take effect until the second sale of the artwork. My understanding is that the legal advice in respect of whether or not clause 11 should stand in the bill is unclear in that there will be differences of opinion on it. I have listened to the advice of those people who made submissions to the committee. We also heard advice from the department. I have drawn the conclusion that that matter will only ever be properly determined in the courts. It is my view that we need to try to ensure that the matter never gets to the courts. We should at least put together a framework that is likely to ensure that the matter never gets to the courts. I do not believe we will ever get a clear definition on whether the clause ought to remain in the bill. Because of that, the committee quite rightly recommended in its report that further advice be sought in respect of clause 11. But, as I say, it is my view that, regardless of how much advice is sought, the truth is that it will only ever be clarified once it is tested in the courts. The other nine recommendations relate to matters which are not controversial, but they are interesting. They relate to issues such as what constitutes art and what is an art transactionfor example, if you gift art to someone, is that a transaction that should be included in this legislation? The question of internet sites which might be used to sell artwork is of some concern. There is also the question of Indigenous art, and I would have to say that the Indigenous community is probably the most deprived in terms of their rightful remuneration when it comes to artworks. There were also questions with repect to the royalty scheme and the succession that applies with that scheme. Under the current scheme, as members may or may not be aware, after the death of an artist the scheme remains in place for 70 years and it is a flat MAIN COMMITTEE five per cent royalty. Therefore, that royalty would continue to the heirs and successors of the artist. Because of Aboriginal law, matters were raised with respect to the intestate succession in Indigenous communities. Those are, in my view, quite proper matters to be raised and they are matters that I am sure the minister will respond to. The opt-out clause, if an artist does not want to be in the scheme, was also raised, and again quite properly so. AgainI expect that the minister will respond to that. Because this is a new bill and because there are a range of issues that one can only assess after the bill has been in place for some time, the committee has recommended that the bill be reviewed in five years time. I think that is quite reasonable. We are dealing with a very complicated matter. We are dealing with a new bill and we are dealing with artists from a whole range of different areas, and so to suggest that a bill ought to be reviewed is not unreasonable. In any case, it is the prerogative of the parliament to review bills at any time, regardless of whether or not that recommendation is in the committee’s report. The only other matter that I want to touch on is with respect to the submissions that we received. We received a lot of submissions that I believe the bill in its present form adequately caters for, and the committee did not make any recommendations on them. It was interesting to note that the art sales industry generally opposed the bill in its entirety. Again, I can understand why, but the committee certainly did not share their view in opposing the bill. The matter that I found interesting was that one of the countries has a provision whereby, if art sold goes down in value, the royalty should not apply. That is another matter that is perhaps worthy of further response by the minister. Having said that, as a member of the committee that looked into the bill in detail and listened to the submissions, I can only say that the bill in its current form-with the exception of the questions in relation to clause 11-is a bill that is worthy of being proceeded with. Certainly, as a member of the committee, I would welcome some additional legal advice with respect to clause 11. But, having said that, I am not sure that it would give me the clarification that I need. I would like to see the bill proceeded with in the parliament. Debate (on motion by Mr Hayes) adjourned. Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity Committee Report Debate resumed from 23 February, on motion by Ms Parke: That the House take note of the report. Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity on its inquiry into law enforcement integrity models. I note the presence of the member for Werriwa. I hope I get my facts straight and reflect fairly on the committee’s hard work. I give credit from the outset to the chair of the committee, the member for Fremantle, and all of my parliamentary colleagues for the spirit of bipartisanship and the professionalism which has typified our work on this committee. As a new member in this place, it has been very satisfying and professionally rewarding for me to be involved in such productive work, and I give much credit to the member for Fremantle for her level-headed approach and even-handed treatment of all members. All credit to her in that regard. MAIN COMMITTEE",136,Resale Royalty Right For Visual Artists Bill 2008
178,Mr Chester (Gippsland) (10.39 Am),"I rise to speak in relation to the report by theI would also like to thank the committee secretariat and the staff for their outstanding support over the months of the inquiry and thank the people who appeared before the committee for their insights, their forthright comments and the submissions they made, which have guided the committee in its report. As I said, as a relative newcomer to the committee, I missed some of the early stages of the inquiry, but I have appreciated the willingness of the other committee members and support staff to bring me up to speed on the issues of interest. House that it was formed to provide oversight of the Commonwealth law enforcement agencies: the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Crime Commission. Unlike many of the state based agencies, which were formed as a response to evidence of major corruption or other incidents relating to law enforcement, ACLEI was not created because of any findings of corruption or misconduct in these agencies. That does not mean, of course, that a level of corruption does not exist, but it is worth emphasising that ACLEI came about more as a preemptive measure. I believe it is inevitable that it will need to expand its role in the future, particularly in the areas of prevention and education. During the inquiry, as the report before the House reflects, a number of witnesses argued for a stronger corruption education and prevention role or focus for ACLEI itself. ACLEI has noted that it has limited capacity to advertise widely at the moment, but its awareness-raising activities undertaken so far have produced results, and the agency has experienced an increase in the flow of information to it. I believe the big issue for the future will undoubtedly be the level of resources provided to mends that the Australian government undertake a review of ACLEI’s funding levels as a matter of urgency, and I wholeheartedly support that recommendation-and not in any political or partisan way. I believe that it is inevitable in the future that ACLEI is going to require more resources to undertake the work it is expected to do. As I understand it, the decision to establish ACLEI in the first place was always intended as a building block approach. It was expected that ACLEI would establish itself and get a direct understanding of the task at hand, and the funding requirements to fulfil that role may well flow out of that experience. By starting small, the commissioner, Philip Moss, and his team have been in a position to build relationships with the agencies in what has been describedand this is reflected in the report-as an ‘integrity partnership’. I think that is a good model going forward. As I mentioned previously, ACLEI was not formed in response to some cataclysmic event, but, as witnesses to the inquiry reported, it is wrong to suggest that corruption does not exist within these agencies. The Commonwealth Ombudsman, Professor John McMillan, commented to the inquiry: I am strongly of the view that it is misguided to work from the premise that we have not seen corruption and, therefore, that it does not exist and it is not a problem. Firstly, corruption has been a problem for every police force internationally and it would be wrong to assume that it cannot be a problem for any policing agency in Australia. The creation of ACLEI has been a precautionary policy, and I strongly support the recommendations which deal with the issue of future funding and resourcing for the organisation. MAIN COMMITTEE Just by way of reference, in 2007-08 there were eight ongoing staff at ACLEI and six casual or seconded staff. As a matter of comparison, ACLEI has an oversight role for the Australian Federal Police, which has 6,598 staff, and the Australian Crime Commission, which has 585 staff. Given its main purpose of enhancing the integrity of Commonwealth law enforcement agencies by providing independent and effective external investigation of possible instances of corruption, this quite small staff at ACLEI has a very large job on its hands. Another of the key recommendations in this report, which goes directly to the task of mended that the government fund a secure hearing room and associated technical infrastructure and personnel support as a matter of priority. It is a significant issue in terms of the independence of ACLEI and its capacity to hold its own investigations without relying on the facilities of other agencies, as is currently the case. The committee noted that a secure hearing room is one of the fundamental building blocks for ACLEI, and it considers that there would be important practical and symbolic benefits to the effectiveness of the integrity system if would allow ACLEI to hold investigations as necessary rather than subject to the availability of other facilities. I freely acknowledge that all this will cost money, in an environment of very difficult economic circumstances. I think members on all sides, though, would place a high value on the anticorruption initiatives undertaken by ACLEI and would appreciate the importance of the work that has been undertaken by the organisation. I would also like to acknowledge that ACLEI has received a significant budget increase in the past, but it was the committee’s view-and one that I fully support-that ACLEI is not sufficiently resourced to meet its increasing workload or to deliver adequately on its designated output. Without wishing to pre-empt in any way future decisions, it is highly likely that funded and appropriately resourced to fulfil that role. In closing, I would like to reiterate my thanks to the chair and to my fellow committee members, along with the support staff, for their work. It is the first report that I have been part of in this place and I look forward to continuing the positive working relationship within the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity. I commend the report to the House. He may be a newcomer, but he is a very significant contributor on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity. This was the committee’s first inquiry, so to that extent it was a significant review of the position of ACLEI and what it needs to expand upon its role and to go further in terms of law enforcement integrity. Regrettably, when it comes to law enforcement we probably will continue to increase the powers of law enforcement agencies, which means, in respect of the Commonwealth, the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Crime Commission. When we do, that obviously impacts on the freedom and rights of individuals. Therefore it was considered back in 2006 that it would be appropriate, as we are increasing powers-including coercive powers in some jurisdictions-to have a proper regime of integrity insurance built into our system. That is how the Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity was initiated. As MAIN COMMITTEE",138,Committees
179,Mr Hayes (Werriwa) (10.45 Am),"I am very happy to follow the member for Gippsland.the member for Gippsland said, it did not arise out of some corruption investigation into either the Australian Federal Police or the Australian Crime Commission, but it was created as a check or a balance, if you like, to ensure for the public that preservation of integrity in those law enforcement jurisdictions is regarded as an absolute premium. The Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity was initiated by an act of this parliament in 2006. This organisation is small, certainly in comparison to the Police Integrity Commission in Sydney, the bodies that operate in Western Australia and the Crime and Misconduct Commission of Queensland. It only has eight ongoing officers and, I think, six secondees. Its role is to carry out an ongoing review and check of integrity measures within the AFP and the Australian Crime Commission. Of late, I think there have been one or two inquiries which it has undertaken that have actually been drawn to the public’s attention. So its work is quite significant and quite demanding, particularly given the fact that it has a small staff. One of the things that the member for Gippsland raised-and I echo his view on this-is that, when we talk about law enforcement integrity, there are more organisations than just the AFP and the Australian Crime Commission involved in law enforcement activity in the Commonwealth. One of the areas that we think it is worth the government addressing in due course and funding appropriately is the jurisdiction of this Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity to ensure that the appropriate integrity regimes are functioning in a proper manner in other organisations which also have law enforcement powers-organisations which may, without limiting them, involve, say, customs, immigration, taxation et cetera. Those things are certainly live in the mind of the committee. What we would request of government in that respect is that, should it be considered, it must be done on the basis that the organisation is appropriately resourced to undertake that work. The committee made a series of recommendations and I will quickly summarise those: that the government review ACLEI’s level of funding as a matter of urgency; that the government fund the establishment of an anticorruption education and prevention unit within ACLEI as a matter of priority and that this object be an active function to be strengthened by an appropriate and detailed amendment to the act; that as a priority the government provide a secure hearing room so that ACLEI can conduct various hearings and also provide the necessary technology and personnel required. On that recommendation, given the fact that this organisation undertakes highly secret inquiries within the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Crime Commission, it is a bit strange that this organisation has to go and borrow hearing rooms to be able to undertake investigations. I have seen the hearing rooms of some of the states. They are secure rooms that are purpose-built and equipped to hold what are not interrogations-I would not say that-but very detailed question and answer sessions with people who are brought before those organisations. Unfortunately, ACLEI needs to interview people in any room that is available. If we are going to take this organisation seriously, if we take the policing of law enforcement integrity seriously, we should ensure that this organisation has not only the staff but the proper facilities to undertake that work. We also recommended that the government establish a national forum through which matters of common interest to federal and state law enforcement agencies can be addressed. That was particularly obvious after we spoke with people from other law enforcement integrity regimes throughout the Commonwealth. There is a great degree of overlap and there is certainly in a practical sense a lot of collaboration, as you would expect. It is appropriate that MAIN COMMITTEE there be some national leadership to ensure that all these organisations could come together as a group to appropriately look at and refine techniques and also to pass on information to one another on issues that arise or are emerging with respect to law enforcement integrity investigations generally. One of the other recommendations was that the government should review and consider strengthening the existing obligations under which employees of the Commonwealth enforcement agencies report misconduct. This is something that is related to whistleblowing, but it is not just about providing protection to a person who does blow the whistle. It is to make sure it is alive in the minds of everybody involved in Commonwealth law enforcement that as a professional you have an obligation to uphold the integrity of the organisation and also the work that you are undertaking. Therefore, it is not whistleblowing; it is an obligation. We see that more needs to be done to communicate that it is a duty of all Commonwealth law enforcement officers. It is not a matter of putting one’s mates in. It is a matter of observing the proper and professional conduct that we require of our law enforcement agencies. Another recommendation is that we review the existing arrangements for suspending and dismissing Commonwealth law enforcement agency personnel who are believed on reasonable grounds to have engaged in serious misconduct or corruption. This is a difficult area and an area where we have to ensure that people’s rights are not inappropriately interfered with. But, having regard to the level of investigations that take place within the Australian Federal Police, and the powers of the Crime Commission-and bear in mind that they have coercive powers and it may be an offence not to answer a question; these are very significant powersif we suspect corruption there, we cannot leave someone in play with access to all of those powers while we wait to prove a case against them. On the other hand, it is difficult to work out what to do with a person if they are suspected of that; it is taking them out of a job. It is almost akin to what we would do if it we had in ASIO someone thought to be a spy; would we leave the person there unattended and with access to records that could possibly be going elsewhere? We are alive to that. This comes out of a series of investigations that have occurred. As a matter of fact, one investigation that I am aware took place involved the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and the normal civil industrial relations regime that protects a person’s rights. However, this goes very much to the area of law enforcement and people who exercise very significant powers and have access to highly secret information. We think that where a person is believed, on reasonable grounds-and they have to be made out-to have engaged in serious misconduct or corruption, there is a case for that person to be removed from office. This does not affect a person’s rights elsewhere. We need to understand that if those organisations-the Australian Federal Police and the Crime Commission-are to work properly and fulfil the tasks that they are required to do then they must have appropriate belief in the honesty and integrity of the officers working in that capacity. I would like to pay particular regard to the secretariat of this committee. We are very lucky to have the calibre of people we do working for us in our committees. I would like to mention the secretary, Dr Jacqueline Dewar, and her colleagues Dr Robin Clough, Ms Nina Boughey, Mrs Jill Sedaitis and Mrs Dianne Warhurst. These people do a power of work day in and day out. The degree of organisation they put into these inquiries is phenomenal. I feel a little guilty sometimes just turning up having had these people organise everything, including proMAIN COMMITTEE viding a very detailed set of research notes every time a witness comes before you. What they do in the background is very significant and, as a member of this parliament and, in particular, as a member of this committee, I would like to acknowledge that work. I think that far too often the people who do the best work around the place do not get recognised for it. I indicated some time previously-and I still hold this view-that the secretariats that we have here who work on a range of committees do a lot of work to make us look good. In reality, we have a very dedicated and hard-working group of people. Without their assistance, we would not be able to conduct these inquiries in the time frames required by government. I conclude on that note. This was the committee’s first inquiry. I think it was very successful. Melissa Parke, the member for Fremantle, was the newly appointed chair of that committee, and I join with the views put by the member for Gippsland: she did a sensational job in that capacity. It was a pleasure to be on this committee, as all members participated fully. Debate (on motion by Mr Secker) adjourned. Corporations and Financial Services Joint Committee Report Debate resumed from 23 February, on motion by Mr Ripoll: That the House take note of the report. ing to make some remarks on the report from the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services into the statutory oversight of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, otherwise known as ASIC. I am a member of this particular committee. This recent inquiry and report covered some key issues in our financial services market. I will touch on some of those key issues this morning. The first major issue is that of short selling. Madam Deputy Speaker Moylan, you know that this has been an ongoing and significant issue within our financial markets over recent times. I believe that short selling is a legitimate and important dynamic of Australia’s financial services market. The issue that was raised at the hearings and in the report relates to the government’s approach to short selling and, through the government, the approach of ASIC to the bans in relation to short selling it has been implementing in recent months. The bans and the approach the government has been taking culminated with the introduction and passage of the Corporations Amendment (Short Selling) Bill in December last year. At that time, I took the opportunity to raise in the parliament the very real need for the bill and the government to provide some certainty in the marketplace with regard to short selling. In that debate, I raised the issue that, regrettably, none of the regulations surrounding the issue of short selling were included in the bill. I regret to say that here we are, almost three months later, and still the regulations surrounding short selling in our market have not been defined by the government. Only last night, I had the opportunity to have dinner with some of the key stakeholders in our financial markets, and they highlighted to me the problems caused by the fact that these regulations still have not been designed or put out for consultation. There is a great need for certainty and clarity in this regard so that our financial markets can get on and do their business. I take the opportunity to call on the government: please bring forward these regulations as a matter of haste, because all market participants require certainty in this regard. MAIN COMMITTEE",140,Aclei Will Expand Into Other Appropriate Jurisdictions In The Future And It Needs To Be Fully
180,Mr Pearce (Aston) (11.00 Am),"I shall take a few minutes in the parliament this mornAnother issue that was brought to the attention of the committee and discussed at the hearing was that of the freeze on redemptions from mortgage funds and cash management trusts. The report says: ASIC reported that the freeze on mortgage trust redemptions had been widespread: ‘something in the order of 52 or so mortgage trusts have frozen redemptions, which affects about $30 billion of the $32 billion of that market’. This is a significant issue. Today, 270,000 people still have their funds frozen through these mortgage trusts. Why are their funds frozen? Because of the bungled bank guarantee approach of the government. That is what has done this. Because the government bungled that approach, it dislocated our financial and banking system and, as a result of that, these funds have been frozen. Over a quarter of a million people are unable to get their money from the funds that have been frozen. I think the most concerning thing that came out of the hearings, and which continues to be obvious in the marketplace, is that there is still no solution whatsoever from the government for this very important issue. Another issue that was considered was the strategic review that ASIC has been undertaking. The report notes that there has been some very good progress made in this regard by ASIC. I commend ASIC for the work that they have done. I commend Tony D’Aloisio, the Chairman of ASIC. Mr D’Aloisio was, of course, appointed by the former government, and the strategic review was commenced under the former government. I think that ASIC has been doing well in that regard. Superannuation was also discussed at the hearing. Madam Deputy Speaker, you would of course know that, right now, many Australians are finding life very difficult as a result of the decline in the markets and the impact that that has had on superannuation investments. The issue about superannuation funds being able to give members an indication of their end benefit was discussed at the hearing. The committee’s report says: The fact that the law does not facilitate superannuation funds offering projections to individual fund members hampers the likelihood of them making informed decisions about their superannuation contributions. And that is the key point about this: the law needs to be changed. The government needs to change the law so that superannuation funds can provide end benefit statements to their members. Again, I think this is a very important matter, particularly at these times when the markets are down and superannuation fund members need certainty and advice. Finally, I would like to touch on the issue of financial literacy. This was also canvassed during the inquiry and it is in the report as well. The previous coalition government had a very strong commitment to financial literacy. Unfortunately, this government has changed the Financial Literacy Foundation from being a stand-alone body to being a unit within ASIC. I have no problem with ASIC-I have a great deal of respect for ASIC-but I feel strongly that the issue of financial literacy amongst all Australians, young Australians as well as older Australians, is very important. Governments have a key role to play in educating people about how to manage their finances going forward, and it is a deep shame that the Financial Literacy Foundation has been merged into ASIC and has therefore lost a lot of its emphasis, a lot of its focus, as an important stand-alone foundation. Again, I call on the government to ensure that this merger with ASIC in no way undermines any of the great work that the foundation MAIN COMMITTEE was doing in supporting Australians of all ages to improve their understanding of finances throughout their lives. I commend the report to the parliament and I also take the opportunity to thank all of those people in the secretariat for their fine work. Ms GRIERSON (Newcastle) (11.08 am)-I too rise to speak briefly on the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, Statutory oversight of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, presented this week by the committee chair, the member for Oxley. The global economic crisis has shone new and much needed light on the behaviour of equity markets, the behaviour of those who design and promote particular products, the behaviour of corporations who are listed on the market, the behaviour of investors and traders, certainly the behaviour of the operators of the stock exchanges themselves and particularly the actions and roles of regulators such as ASIC, who have responsibilities with regard to the integrity of the financial system. Our overall finding in this report is that the committee remains satisfied that ASIC continues to carry out its functions in accordance with the provisions of the corporations legislation. At the public hearing, we were able to further explore ASIC’s performance across its operations as well as some particular new issues which have emerged from the global economic crisis. Those included: ASIC’s decision to ban short selling to reduce market volatility; their dealings with hardship exemptions from frozen mortgage fund redemptions, which the committee registers its intention to track more closely in the future; and new licensing and reporting arrangements for credit-rating agencies. It was also noted that the government has provided ASIC with $66 million to regulate consumer credit operations. With respect to short selling, whilst pleased with the actions of ASIC the committee considers that more transparency in disclosure and reporting is the desired outcome which should be pursued. The area that I would particularly like to focus on, though, is market regulation and the importance of consumer confidence in the integrity of our equity markets. Whilst welcoming new initiatives designed to better identify and prosecute insider trading, false rumours and market manipulation, the committee has encouraged ASIC to continue to work closely with the ASX on identifying these practices. The need for greater rigour was borne out in ASIC’s survey of the regulator’s stakeholders. Unfortunately, only 20 per cent of respondents to the survey agreed with the proposition that ASIC was good at identifying image problems. The review also indicated a lack of confidence in ASIC’s ability to identify and prosecute instances of dishonesty, misconduct, insider trading and market abuse. Pleasingly, additional new training and other initiatives aimed at bringing about necessary cultural change have been implemented by ASIC. However, a more aggressive move towards a risk management based operation rather than a process orientated organisation is imperative if stakeholder confidence is to be maximised. Accordingly, the committee encourages ASIC to continue with these initiatives. We are pleased that the commissioner recognised this need when he acknowledged and stated the need to develop people who are much more in tune with the market and understand what is happening so that they can give a quick response. The need for the early identification of risk was borne out in a table presented in an answer to a question taken on notice at the hearing. The table, on page 22 of the report, shows the Australian Stock Exchange’s referrals to ASIC of potential breaches of market rules over three financial years. The table shows an increase from 29 referrals in 2005-06 to 55 in 2006-07. MAIN COMMITTEE The 2007-08 results provided are incomplete but the total for the 2008 calendar year showed a continuing high trend of referrals. What is important is that an almost doubling of referrals in 2006-07 should have certainly triggered a dramatic response from ASIC. Unfortunately, that did not seem to be the case. The committee has praised ASIC, though, for its honest reporting of these survey and review findings and encourages it to use its external advisory panel to stay more in tune with the market. I note that since we met in November the new chair of that advisory panel, Dr Stuckey, a former partner of management consultants McKinsey and Company, has been appointed. I also note that the panel members are still to be appointed, and I encourage ASIC to attend to that as quickly as possible. The committee stressed that the external advisory body can certainly help ASIC to stay more in tune with the market realities and the external financial landscape, which they need to be scanning at all times. Since we met with ASIC in November the collapse of Storm Financial Limited has taken place, leading to grave personal losses for many mum and dad investors. The committee will be pursuing the issues surrounding the collapse of Storm and other similar ventures in its future inquiries and hearings with ASIC. The interests of consumers-the constituents of the members of this parliament-are paramount to us and certainly need our full attention. The committee’s comments on further improving financial literacy and the adequacy of professional indemnity insurance point to the need for further investigations of these issues. Another pleasing development commented upon extensively in the public hearing last November by the commissioner was ASIC’s participation with the international economic community in the better regulation of international markets. The very genuine leadership being shown by ASIC in this regard is most welcome. I commend this report to the House. I acknowledge the hard work of the secretariat and members of this committee, and I thank them for it. liamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, Statutory oversight of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. ASIC forms one of the four pillars that have kept our financial system held in such regard and such standing over the last decade. ASIC, APRA-which was pulled out of ASIC in 1998-the Reserve Bank and the ACCC have provided a sound regulatory framework that has held us in very, very good stead, as seen through the strength of our banking and financial system whilst other banks around the world continue to find themselves in significant difficulties. The committee’s hearing with ASIC on 28 November raised a range of issues that should be raised to ensure that the regulatory function of one of those four key pillars continues to receive the proper and due parliamentary scrutiny. A number of issues were raised, including ASIC’s decision to ban short selling to reduce market volatility. Issues such as disclosure of short selling and the ownership of short sales, the transparency and reporting of short selling-both naked and covered-received due attention. The hardship exemptions for frozen mortgage fund redemptions also were considered, as were new licensing and reporting arrangements for credit-rating agencies. A range of other issues were discussed with ASIC that have been included, or shown interest in, at previous ASIC hearings, and they may feed into further hearings within the financial services area. These include ASIC’s investigative capability-noting that the Storm Financial MAIN COMMITTEE",143,Aclei Will Expand Into Other Appropriate Jurisdictions In The Future And It Needs To Be Fully
181,Mr Robert (Fadden) (11.14 Am),"I also commend to the House this report of the Parcollapse occurred after the hearing with ASIC. But ASIC’s investigation and subsequent action surrounding the collapse of Storm and responsibility for that will be watched by the committee with some interest. Likewise, the regulation of insider trading, market manipulation and false rumours to affect a share price will receive some due attention. The strategic review of ASIC, as well as its funding arrangements, its financial arrangements and the impact of efficiency dividends and the like, will continue to come under review, as will workload and further budgetary issues. Financial literacy, including the transition of the Financial Literacy Foundation across to ASIC and how ASIC will use its services and the literacy programs that the foundation is bringing across to it, will also continue to undergo scrutiny, as will professional indemnity insurance for financial planners. The proper parliamentary oversight of ASIC, and the four pillars that have held up our banking and financial systems so well, is proper, is due and must continue. I commend the committee for its work. I thank the secretariat for their support and I look forward to further review of ASIC and its work to help support the economy and the nation. Debate (on motion by Mr Secker) adjourned. Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee Report Debate resumed from 25 February, on motion by Mr Dreyfus: That the House take note of the report. bate on reports of committees. The parliament has an undeservedly bad reputation in the Australian community as a place of conflict, difference and argument. But so often parliamentary committees bring down unanimous reports which indicate that members have sat down around a table, listened to the evidence they have received and brought forward recommendations which, hopefully, the government of the day will adopt. This inquiry into whistleblower protection was referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs by the Attorney-General and, once again, this committee has brought down a unanimous report. In the previous parliament, I was the chairman of the committee, and all of our reports were unanimous. I am pleased that the 26 recommendations in this report, entitled Whistleblower protection: a comprehensive scheme for the Commonwealth public sector, enjoy the support of the full committee. I do not believe that in 2009 anyone could realistically argue that there ought not to be protection for whistleblowers. We believe in openness, accountability and transparency in government and, without adequate whistleblower protection, we simply would not achieve the high standards that in Australia we have come to expect of governments. I must say that I think we are fortunate in Australia, generally speaking, to have a high level of integrity in the administration of governments at all levels. We have very low levels of corruption, and I think that is one of the things that, as Australians, we ought to be proud of. But the committee did recommend in the report tabled this week in the parliament that a bill, to be entitled the Public Interest Disclosure Bill, should be introduced as quickly as possible, and the principles of this bill would be to promote accountability and integrity in public administration. In recommendation 2, the committee was very keen to ensure: … the provisions of the Bill are guided by the following principles: MAIN COMMITTEE",146,Aclei Will Expand Into Other Appropriate Jurisdictions In The Future And It Needs To Be Fully
182,Mr Slipper (Fisher) (11.18 Am),"The Main Committee is an appropriate place for deit is in the public interest that accountability and integrity in public administration are promoted by identifying and addressing wrongdoing in the public sector; people within the public sector have a right to raise their concerns about wrongdoing within the sector without fear of reprisal; people have a responsibility to raise those concerns in good faith; governments have a right to consider policy and administration in private; and government and the public sector have a responsibility to be receptive to concerns which are raised. In recommendation 3: The Committee recommends that the Public Interest Disclosure Bill define people who are entitled to make a protected disclosure as a ‘public official’ and include in the definition of public official the following categories: Australian Government and general government sector employees … contractors and consultants engaged by the public sector; employees of contractors and consultants engaged by the public sector; Australian and locally engaged staff working overseas; members of the Australian Defence Force and Australian Federal Police; parliamentary staff; former employees in one of the above categories; and anonymous persons likely to be in one of the above categories. Personally I was very pleased that the report sought to extend protection to contractors and consultants engaged by the public sector. While we have had in place certain rules and regulations designed to protect whistleblowers in certain circumstances, the circumstances covered by the existing provisions are not wide enough, and that is why the House of Representatives committee has recommended the introduction and swift passage of the Public Interest Disclosure Bill. The committee would have liked to see this bill introduced yesterday, but we are realists and we do understand that the parliamentary timetable does have a queue of bills. In a prior manifestation, when the coalition was in government, I was well aware of how long it took sometimes to get legislation through the parliament. But I hope, given the fact that this is non-controversial legislation, at least within the parliament-or we hope it is-that this legislation will be accorded the sort of priority it needs so that the protections sought for whistleblowers by the members of the committee will be able to be enshrined in legislation. The committee secretariat always displays a very high level of impartiality, competence and professionalism. I would like to recognise the members of the secretariat staff publicly in the Main Committee today. Our parliamentary committees would not be able to operate if it were not for the expertise that the officials seconded to those committees and who work with those committees bring. I believe that committee staff often help to create a sense of camaraderie within the committee, and that can ensure that quite often we are able to achieve unanimous reports. Reports that are tabled in the parliament without dissent are very much more powerful and convincing reports than those which are rammed through with the government of the day using the majority it has on all parliamentary committees in the House of Representatives. I think that it is important, wherever possible, to seek to obtain a unanimous report, because that report has a much greater chance of being implemented. MAIN COMMITTEE I am particularly pleased to commend this report, Whistleblower protection: a comprehensive scheme for the Commonwealth public sector, to the House. I hope that the government responds expeditiously, that the government, in its response, accepts the recommendations of the committee and that we see introduced to the parliament as a matter of urgency the Public Interest Disclosure Bill. Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in thanking the committee secretariat, particularly Dr Anna Dacre, Dr Mark Rodrigues, Mr Michael Buss, Ms Melita Caulfield and Ms Claire Young, for the wonderful work they do. They make us look good. They do superb work. They are fantastic in the work they do. The research they undertake and the drafting they do is expert, and they are across the issues. I want to pay tribute also to Dr AJ Brown, who heads the ‘Whistling while they work: enhancing the theory and practice of internal witness management in public sector organisations’ team. This is a group of eminent academics and professors who have worked extensively to find out just what evidence there is in relation to whistleblowing and to provide empirical data which will help governments to form a better understanding and better legislation when it comes to public interest disclosure. Dr AJ Brown found that the typical view of a whistleblower is not correct. In fact, whistleblowers are likely to be women and to have a very positive attitude towards corporate citizenship, but they are less likely to have a positive view of the managerial oversight of their respective government departments. Dr Brown also found that the media is the ninth recipient of public interest disclosures. So the idea that whistleblowers go straight to the media is not correct. There is also evidence that only 20 per cent of whistleblowers end up being treated adversely in the workplace by their peers or by their superiors, which again is not what the community would normally think in the circumstances. The real reason we need to have a public interest disclosure bill introduced as soon as possible is that there is a deficiency when it comes to the Public Service and those people who contract to the Commonwealth or volunteer for Commonwealth government activity. Only about two-thirds of Commonwealth public sector employees in the Australian Public Service are covered by APS whistleblower provisions. Of course, employees who work for those agencies which are governed by the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 are specifically included. They include employees of the ANU, the ABC and a variety of other corporate governmental agencies. So public interest disclosures are very important to deal with from the point of view of a model piece of legislation and a national approach. We are not talking about internal grievances and internal management disputes. We are really talking about serious disclosures: evidence of illegal activity, corruption, maladministration, dangers to public safety, dangers to the environment, official misconduct and scientific misconduct-serious matters which adversely affect the public interest. The committee recommended that those types of disclosures be protected and recommended the expansion in the categories of people who make those disclosures to encompass Commonwealth agencies and insider knowledge. For example, those people who are deemed to be public officials for the purpose of the legislation would also be covered, as well as volunteers. So there is breadth in the coverage. With respect to the way this is dealt with, there is a staged approach. The first port of call for a whistleblower is to deal with their matter internally with their superiors. MAIN COMMITTEE",147,Aclei Will Expand Into Other Appropriate Jurisdictions In The Future And It Needs To Be Fully
183,Mr Neumann (Blair) (11.25 Am),"I want to echo the Deputy Chair of the House ofThen they go to an external agency, and finally there is the safety valve of the media if it is absolutely necessary. There was discussion and submission about which particular body or bodies should be involved in the oversight of whistleblowing legislation. The committee believed-and I agree; it was a unanimous decision-that the Commonwealth Ombudsman has the oversight and the integrity agency requirements to do these sorts of tasks. The Australian Public Service Commissioner and the Commonwealth Ombudsman gave evidence in relation to the additional costs involved in this process. They gave evidence that it would cost an additional $1.5 million initially and recommended that a deputy be appointed for this purpose in the various agencies. They also said that after two or three years the cost would be about $1 million to the Commonwealth with six to seven employees. I concur with the committee’s decision that the Commonwealth Ombudsman has the appropriate skills, expertise and experience to handle these really difficult, sensitive and serious matters. The research shows that that is the case. The evidence before the committee shows that this should be the avenue that people take if internal matters have not been dealt with properly. There is a subjective test that the committee recommends with respect to whistleblowing. The whistleblower must have an honest and reasonable belief on the information available to them that the matter concerns disclosable conduct. The committee rejected the objective test, which was that the disclosure showed or tended to show wrongdoing. We thought that would not lead towards good public policy and that there would be people who would be dissuaded from coming forward with disclosures. We are not about protecting false allegations or reckless disclosures but we are about good public policy. The committee appropriately rejected the idea of a qui tam provision in the public interest disclosure legislation. The idea of pecuniary profit or incentivisation for a disclosure to be made is simply anathema to me, and I certainly agree with the committee’s recommendation that we should look at the public good and a more communitarian approach to public disclosure. We should look at an approach that does not follow the American system in these circumstances. I conclude by saying that we have taken note of what the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security has said in relation to the matter. We have specifically excluded a number of intelligence agencies, such as ASIO, ASIS and the ONA, from this public interest disclosure legislation in our recommendations. I urge the government to act upon this and act quickly. We would have liked to see this happen under the previous government’s regime but we urge the government to take note of these recommendations, which in our view will help to overcome what I would describe as the governmental vices of secrecy, victimisation, inflexibility and buck-passing and will promote what I would describe as the governmental virtues of openness, transparency, flexibility and accountability. I am very pleased to be a member of the committee, and I thank all those people who participated. I particularly want to recognise the admirable qualities of the chairperson, the member for Isaacs, who did the job exceptionally well. Ms PARKE (Fremantle) (11.33 am)-I am pleased to speak to the report from the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs arising from the inquiry into whistleblowing protection within the Australian government public sector. This report set out to ask the question of ‘how’ we should protect whistleblowers, not ‘if’ we should protect them. As noted in my submission to the inquiry, the statutory protection of whistleblowers-individuals who MAIN COMMITTEE make a principled public interest disclosure of wrongdoing-can no longer be regarded as a new or controversial area in mainstream Australia. From 1993, commencing with the response to the 1989 report of the Fitzgerald commission of inquiry into official misconduct in Queensland, whistleblower laws have been enacted in the Australian states and territories. The key feature of the approach taken in Australia has been the recognition that the ultimate objective of whistleblower protection law and policy, properly understood, is not the protection of whistleblowers as such. Protection is a crucial strategy for achieving the main objective: to encourage the disclosure of wrongdoing, fraud, waste, misconduct, abuse, corruption, imminent danger et cetera in an appropriate way so that something can be done about it. Practical concern about the public interest, rather than moralism, is the key. New laws to protect public interest disclosure of wrongdoing in broadly similar terms have also been enacted since 1994 in Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Japan, South Africa and the United Nations secretariat. There is now broad acceptance in Australia of a public interest justification for effective and practical protection of responsible whistleblowers and for whistleblowing activity by public officials and others occupying positions of trust. There appears to be no serious suggestion in any quarter that those who genuinely disclose official corruption, fraud, theft, criminal conduct, abuse of office, serious threat to public health and safety, official misconduct, maladministration or avoidable wastage of public resources should not receive protection from retaliation by those involved. On the contrary, organisations which fail to protect genuine whistleblowers and permit or take reprisal action against them usually face severe censure. However, incredibly, until now in the Australian government sector the issue of protection of whistleblowers has remained an open question for no apparent reason. The Australian Public Service lacks adequate statutory provisions protecting public servants despite numerous formal inquiries, a significant number of noteworthy cases and eventually, in 1999, the provision of minimal protections in the Public Service Act for a very limited form of whistleblowing activity. During my time working for the United Nations, I was involved in setting up a UN Ethics Office in New York, putting in place standards and programs to reinforce a culture of integrity, to enhance transparency and accountability and to restore public faith in the organisation. The UN needed to apply to itself the very global standards whose setting it had facilitated, especially in the light of the public perception of corruption in UN agencies arising from the oil for food investigation. The new measures included new financial disclosure policies, conflict of interest provisions, training, advice, standard-setting functions and, importantly, whistleblower protection. The primary focus of the Ethics Office was not intended as another layer of policing for the organisation, which already had an Office of Internal Oversight Services, but as a resource to which staff could turn for advice on ethical issues, such as potential or actual conflicts of interest, and for whistleblower protection. Whistleblower protection is actually a measure of last resort. External whistleblowing is an indicator of a failure of ethics. There is something wrong within the workplace integrity system if a person who has concerns about wrongdoing is not able to have those concerns addressed internally without fear of the consequences. Ultimately you want to achieve a situation where whistleblowing as such is not necessary because there exists in the workplace a MAIN COMMITTEE culture that encourages people to raise their concerns as a normal part of their duties. Until that situation exists, however, whistleblower protection will be necessary. Public debate about the responsibilities of governments and public officials, and in particular about what we should expect by way of accountability, integrity and ethics, is crucial to the health of Australian democracy, and I am delighted that this discussion is taking place within government, within the parliament and within civil society. Some people think that we do not really need to have a discussion about accountability in Australia, as corruption in government and unethical conduct by public servants only happen ‘out there’, in other, less developed, less democratic and less well-regulated countries. Aside from being untrue, this argument misses what is for me an essential issue: accountability is all about the uses of power and is especially about the delegated power which is exercised by officials away from public scrutiny. There is a fundamental duty for public officials at all levels to account for how power was exercised to those who are not in a position to check for themselves that it was, in fact, exercised fairly, lawfully and legitimately. Establishing formal responsibility for accountability in public office is, of course, only part of the task. Putting formal responsibility into practice is the real challenge. From time to time there have been signs that our public institutions are failing in this challenge. Probably our biggest integrity failure of all resulted in the colossal scandal of the Australian Wheat Board, which in 2006 emerged as the single largest source of kickbacks to Saddam Hussein’s regime, to the tune of $290 million through fraud on the UN’s oil for food program. This episode stood as a stark indicator that there was something seriously amiss in our accountability framework, not least because those involved continued to characterise and justify their behaviour as the cost of doing business rather than recognising and naming it, as Commissioner Terrence Cole did, as a failure of ethics at the most fundamental level. In my view, the acquiescence and deceptive conduct by some parts of the Public Service and by relevant ministers and their staff during this period, which continued for years, indicates that the problem was not confined to a lack of corporate ethics. It showed an irresponsible failure on the part of those involved to recognise that the AWB’s interests were not the only interests to be considered and that failure to take account of broader public interest concerns would ultimately become a matter for public accountability and justification. As a result, Australia’s international reputation was severely damaged. I believe that author Catherine Aird could have been referring to the Australian Wheat Board when she said, ‘If you can’t be a good example, then you’ll just have to serve as a horrible warning.’ Other horrible warnings during the past decade have included the children overboard episode and Australia’s abandonment of the international rule of law through its participation in the Iraq war, to name a couple. Within each of these incidents, there were public servants and others who had severe doubts about the legitimacy of the government’s actions or, worse, knew that they were wrong but were afraid to speak out. I note that this committee received over 70 submissions and heard from more than 70 witnesses. The level of public engagement on this issue shows that there is an urgent need for legislation in this area. My own submission to this inquiry argued for the passing of a public interest disclosures act and for such an act to cover all public sector staff, including the staff of members of parliament and non-Commonwealth employees working for Commonwealth agencies. I commend the committee for recommending a public interest disclosures bill as well as for the MAIN COMMITTEE types of disclosures and the categories of people recommended for protection. The inclusion of not only Commonwealth Public Service staff but also parliamentary staff, government consultants and contractors is welcome. I also strongly support the role proposed for the Commonwealth Ombudsman. In my role as Chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, I welcome the committee’s recommendation that the proposed public interest disclosures bill specifically provide for the Commissioner for Law Enforcement Integrity to be able to investigate public interest disclosures relevant to the commissioner’s area of responsibility. This raises again the crucial issue of adequate resources for these agencies to be able to carry out their roles effectively. As we follow our colleagues in the states and territories and countries including Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Japan and South Africa, I hope that we not only enact laws to protect whistleblowers but also administer these laws in a way that makes them effective. What is lacking in the Australian states and territories is not good laws but effective administrative and organisational support for whistleblowers and would be whistleblowers and more accessible mechanisms for compensation and protection. This was demonstrated by the wide-ranging research project Whistling while they work, a three-year collaborative national research project led by Griffith University. It is clear from the committee’s report that the discussion of whistleblower protection in Australia does not stop with the introduction and passing of a public interest disclosures bill. The further questions raised in the report of topics outside the direct terms of reference of the committee will need to be addressed by parliament in the coming years. This includes protection from disclosure of wrongdoing in the private sector. Other countries have legislated protection for those working in the private sector, such as the UK Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998, which has proved effective in thousands of cases in both the public sector and the private sector. Of importance too is the need for education and awareness-raising activities for employees and managers about the values of transparency and accountability which will lead to a changing workplace culture that encourages public interest disclosure with appropriate support mechanisms for whistleblowers. I note that an education and awareness-raising function is intended to be part of the extended role of the Commonwealth Ombudsman, and I welcome the suggestion in the committee’s report. This report has been well received by one of the key stakeholders, the Community and Public Sector Union. The union has commended the report and asked that the relevant legislation be introduced to put the report’s recommendations into law so that public sector workers are no longer forced to make a choice between disclosing matters in the public interest and their job security and careers. The recommendations contained in the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs are eminently sensible and the reforms are long overdue. I congratulate the committee for its hard work, in particular the chair, the member for Isaacs, and also the Attorney-General, who requested on behalf of the Cabinet Secretary that this inquiry occur. I welcome Minister Faulkner’s commitment to respond quickly to the report and to introduce whistleblower protection legislation in this term of parliament. The government recognises the crucial role both of people and processes in ensuring public confidence in the integrity of our public institutions. Without good institutions good people will fail, and without good people good institutions are ineffective. MAIN COMMITTEE of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, including the deputy chair of the committee, the member for Fisher, and the member for Blair, for speaking to the report and also thank them for their participation in the committee’s deliberations on this important matter. CouldI also thank the member for Fremantle for the speech that we have just heard, because it went a long way towards setting the context of accountability, transparency and integrity in public administration, putting it in an international context and drawing on the work that we know that the member for Fremantle has done overseas. It is important to recognise that a scheme of protection for whistleblowers taking legislative form is but one of a range of measures in this area of improving transparency, improving accountability and improving integrity of government. We have recommended a comprehensive scheme, and a scheme which is very long overdue. It is a scheme that is of course intended to protect workers in the public sector who speak out about wrongdoing. The focus is on improving accountability, improving integrity in public administration. As we say in the report, it is not just about introducing legislation. It is about, through that scheme of legislation and through procedures adopted by public sector agencies, creating a culture in which public servants and all who work in the public sector are encouraged to speak out when they see wrongdoing or maladministration in their workplace. I have said it is long overdue, and perhaps one could demonstrate that by pointing to the fact that there is already in every state and territory in Australia, as well as in a whole range of overseas jurisdictions, legislation that provides protection for whistleblowers. But one can say it is long overdue also because going back some 14 years there have been numerous reviews and attempts made to introduce this type of legislation at the Commonwealth level. You could start with the 1994 report from the Senate Select Committee on Public Interest Whistleblowing, which was entitled In the public interest. That was an all-party committee. It made a very comprehensive set of recommendations with, perhaps one can say with hindsight, a somewhat elaborate scheme. Perhaps the elaborateness of the scheme that was recommended by the Senate select committee in 1994 is what led, first of all, to a very long delay in a response by the former Keating government, which did not come until November 1995. While the government accepted quite a number of the recommendations of that Senate committee and indicated that it was going to move to introduce legislation, the election of March 1996 brought that promise to an end. The new coalition government abandoned the preparation of specific legislation on whistleblowing. There was very, very limited protection introduced in the Public Service Bill that was introduced in 1997, and the provisions that were introduced then found their way into section 16 of the Public Service Act. But, even then, there was very serious criticism by two parliamentary committees. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts, in its report of September 1997, and the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee, in its report of October 1997, were both critical of the very limited whistleblower protections that were proposed in that Public Service Bill. Those provisions did, however, come into force in 1999 and are still there in section 16 of the Public Service Act. Since then, there have been no fewer than three private member’s bills, introduced by Senator Andrew Murray in 2001, 2002 and 2007, dealing with whistleblower protection or public interest disclosure. But, without any support from the former government, each of those three bills proposed by Senator Murray lapsed. MAIN COMMITTEE",149,Aclei Will Expand Into Other Appropriate Jurisdictions In The Future And It Needs To Be Fully
184,Mr Dreyfus (Isaacs) (11.45 Am),"by leave-CanI thank other members of the HouseThere is one benefit only of the long delay we have seen in introducing legislation at the Commonwealth level, and that is that it has enabled this committee and also the government to consider the lessons that are to be learnt from, in some cases, over a decade of experience in the states and territories of this kind of legislation. The committee, and so too the government, has also had the benefit of a whole range of research work that has been conducted by a three-year project headed by Dr AJ Brown of Griffith University. This project has been referred to extensively by the committee in its deliberations, and it has been referred to by other speakers on this report. In that ‘Whistle while they work’ project, as it was entitled, Dr AJ Brown and his colleagues were able to conduct research across thousands of workplaces by means of survey work and direct interview, as well as holding their own seminars and producing discussion papers over that lengthy period. The situation produced by that is that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs was in a position that standing committees do not often find themselves in, which was that all of that research work was available to the committee, and we were able to take full advantage of it. The report produced by the ‘Whistle while they work’ project in early September last year contained such helpful sections as a complete analysis of all of the state and territory legislation, including analysis of the deficiencies discovered in each of those state and territory schemes, and also recorded the results of the empirical research work done by the ‘Whistle while they work’ project. Interestingly, one of the conclusions expressed was that, contrary to the popular perception, people who blow the whistle in their workplace do not always suffer. Very often there is a full investigation of the matters raised and, as should be the case, the whistleblower is commended for disclosing the matter of concern. What the legislation that this report deals with is aimed at is the other situation-with which we are all too familiar-where someone who has made an allegation of wrongdoing, maladministration, corruption or the like within their workplace does suffer in a range of ways. The proposal is that a very large group of public servants and those working in the public sector are to be protected. That is perhaps the core recommendation of the report. Casting the net so widely will ensure that the legislation covers not just those people who are employed under the Public Service Act, which captures in effect only about two-thirds of public servants. It is proposed that the legislation would cover everybody who works for a Commonwealth agency, everybody who works for a Commonwealth corporation and everybody who works for a company that is contracting to the Commonwealth, and it will include a mechanism that recognises even people who are volunteers within corporations or organisations that are connected with the Commonwealth public sector. As was commented on by Dr AJ Brown at the press conference that followed the tabling of the report yesterday, that coverage is very important because it is important that everyone involved in the public sector knows that, if they discover wrongdoing and make a disclosure in respect of that wrongdoing, they will be protected. Another important feature of the scheme of legislation that the committee has recommended is that it would set up a procedure for making a disclosure and then impose obligations on public sector agencies who receive disclosures. It is important that the legislation specify a set of procedures, because one of the things that the committee wanted to ensure was that people who are contemplating making a disclosure be able to determine, by ready reference either to the legislation or to guidelines that we hope will be prepared based on the MAIN COMMITTEE legislation, that they are eligible for protection and the procedures that they need to follow in order to gain that protection. They will also be able to readily see that there are obligations on the agencies to which they make the disclosure to go on and investigate the matter and, further, that there are remedies available to them if that does not occur. It is very important to ensure that the protection that is afforded by the legislation achieves the purpose that it is aimed at and that the person considering the disclosure be able to see just how the protection is going to work. The purpose which the legislation is aimed at is, of course, improving integrity and accountability in public administration and improving the already high quality of public administration in this country. Unless those considering making a disclosure can see at a glance that they are going to be protected, there will be continuing discouragement from engaging in whistleblowing activity. There are a range of other aspects of the legislation that I would like to mention. Another is the sequential nature of disclosure that is proposed by the recommended scheme of legislation, and by that I mean that it is proposed that those wishing to make a disclosure first make the disclosure to the agency that they work for or are connected to and then that the legislation provide for the possibility of disclosure to another, more central Commonwealth agency apart from the agency that the whistleblower is connected to. There is a recommendation that the Commonwealth Ombudsman be the central oversight agency for the whole scheme of the legislation, but other recommendations for the legislation are that it would be possible to make the disclosure not only to the Commonwealth Ombudsman but also, at a general level, to the Australian Public Service Commissioner and her colleague, the Merit Protection Commissioner. There are further recommendations that would provide for disclosures to be made to a range of agencies specialised in their particular area-for example, in the intelligence and security area, we have recommended that the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security be authorised to receive disclosures, as is the Commonwealth Ombudsman for that purpose. For other specialised areas, we have recommended that such agencies as the Aged Care Commissioner, the Integrity Commissioner, who was mentioned by the member for Fremantle, the Commissioner for Complaints of the National Health and Medical Research Council, the Inspector-General in the Department of Defence and the Privacy Commissioner all be able to receive disclosures about wrongdoing that are directly relevant to their area of expertise. Following the tabling at the press conference yesterday, Dr AJ Brown also noted the recommendations that the committee has made in respect of the legislation needing to include a set of obligations for managers, Dr Brown making the point that that is an important obligation. Dr Brown also commended the recommendations for external oversight and coordination by the Commonwealth Ombudsman, and I can say to the House that the reason the Commonwealth Ombudsman was selected is that it is regarded by the committee as being the Commonwealth agency with the most expertise in investigating complaints and is recognised across the public service-and, indeed, in the wider community-as being the agency that was established for that purpose. As has already been noted, the report of the committee has been very well received in most quarters. Senator Faulkner, the Special Minister of State, has indicated that the government is now to consider the report. I look forward to receiving the government’s response to the report. I note that the Special Minister of State’s press release informed the public that the SpeMAIN COMMITTEE cial Minister of State was looking forward to progressing the issue through government, to developing legislation later this year and to introducing legislation in this term of the parliament. It is a long overdue measure, and I look forward to the legislation being introduced. (Time expired) Debate (on motion by Ms King) adjourned. Ms KING (Ballarat) (12.01 pm)-I move: That the Main Committee do now adjourn. Mr Norman Jennings tralian and a great member of our community in Mitchell. Saturday, 14 February 2009, was the day Australia lost an ingenious inventor and Rouse Hill and Mitchell lost a favourite son. Norman Jennings was born on 14 July 1934 and grew up to invent what would become one of Australia’s most iconic products, Dynamic Lifter. Dynamic Lifter is on a par with great Aussie icons like the Victa lawnmower and the Hills hoist. Dynamic Lifter is that much-loved but smelly garden product that was produced by pelletising chook poo. It was invented and marketed by none other than Norm Jennings of Rouse Hill. The original factory, on the corner of Commercial Road and Withers Road, is long gone, but the unmistakable smell of Dynamic Lifter in gardens across this country and abroad may well outlast religion! Norm was the quintessential blond-haired, blue-eyed Australian, who loved everything about his beloved country. From humble beginnings, Norm became an engineer at the Clyde goods yard near Granville. He loved learning about how things work. He especially loved cars. He also loved to fish. He was clever with his hands. He loved nothing more than making something old new again. Seeing over 700 members of my community at the service of thanksgiving for his life brought home to me how important he was to all Australians but particularly to people in the north-west of Sydney. Many people, including Don Burke, Jack Iori and other locals, were there to pay tribute to and recognise a man who did so much for his country and achieved so much with his life. It was Norm’s passion for making old things new again that eventually led him to master the art of how to turn smelly old chook poo into one of the most marketable garden products in the world. This was a long and complex process for Norm. It was a life work. His wife, Nadia, was responsible for coining the phrase ‘Dynamic Lifter’, and they were indeed a dynamic partnership. Norm was a dynamic man. Norm came from simple origins. He worked for his family throughout his life. He loved his family dearly, but he always had time for other people. He supported his community, through membership of service clubs, through donations and through charitable giving. On every occasion there was a worthy cause, he was there to share the wealth that he had produced with those that were less fortunate than him. Norm was a foundation member of Kenthurst Rotary. He gave up much of his time on behalf of good causes, but he was a great Australian who never forgot his humble beginnings. He treated everyone with respect. He spoke ill of no-one. He was one of those great people with whom you instantly feel as though you have known them for a long time. The first time.

185,Mr Hawke (Mitchell) (12.01 Pm),"I rise today to pay tribute to the life of a great Aushad the privilege of meeting Norm, it was as if we had known each other for many years. He spoke to people of great importance and of lesser importance equally. A great story was told at Norm’s thanksgiving service about the first time he met John Howard. Norm and a friend crashed the SCG Trust box in order to be introduced to the Prime Minister. His opening remarks were: ‘Hi John, I’m the king of chook poo!’ That is the kind of man he was-an ordinary Australian. His other great love was fishing. He delighted in taking anyone he met out to his favourite fishing spots around the lakes. The tributes paid to him by his friends, his children and his grandchildren were moving in the sense that he always shared his passions with others. We heard many times that, if anyone ever became seasick, he would take them back close to shore and tell them to swim the rest of the way as he had to get back to the fish, especially if they were biting! Many people were dumped off the boat unceremoniously into what they thought was shallow water, only to be soaked from head to toe. As I said, there were 500 or 600 people present at the thanksgiving service at Our Lady of the Rosary Church in Kellyville. It was a moving service which paid tribute to the life of a man who contributed so much to our community. On behalf of the Mitchell community, I want to pay tribute to Norm for his life and I extend my condolences to his wife, Nadia, and his children and grandchildren. Thank you, Norm, for a life so well lived. Sydney West Area Health Service start by expressing my serious lack of confidence in Sydney West Area Health Service, particularly its top executives. I do so for two reasons. Firstly, I am really concerned that they have become prisoners of the Sydney University medical faculty and seem to have more concern about their priorities than those of the people who are served by Blacktown/Mount Druitt Hospital. Secondly, they are impossible communicators with the public. Let me explain why. Currently, there is a great deal of public protest about a study which is examining the closure of our emergency department. You have to understand that this is one of the busiest emergency departments and it serves a demographically disadvantaged community. We have a large proportion of Sudanese refugees and the largest number of urban Indigenous people-and I could go on. Why anyone would want to close an emergency department which is being so heavily utilised, I do not know. If SWAHS were to do it, I think we ought to have a parliamentary committee inquiry into Sydney West Area Health Service. The study will be finished in the next several weeks and it will go to the Minister for Health. I think that, inevitably, there will be a decision to maintain the emergency department. The local state government members, Richard Amery MP and Allan Shearan MP, are very confident that it is going to be retained. I share their confidence. I should explain that my history goes back to chairing the community committee that agitated for the hospital. I was the inaugural deputy chairman of the hospital. A want of ecclesiastical qualifications prevented me from being the chair-and I was not prepared to undertake the study. But I have had a long association with that hospital. Not so long ago, Sydney West Area Health Service looked at privatising the shops in the kiosk that services the Mount Druitt Hospital. We have had a long history of ladies auxiliaries and volunteers servicing the kiosk at Mount Druitt. In fact, an answer to a question on notice MAIN COMMITTEE",157,Adjournment
186,Mr Price (Chifley) (12.06 Pm),"I would like to speak in the adjournment debate. I willshowed that the volunteers at Mount Druitt raised the largest amount of money of any volunteers at any hospital in New South Wales-not bad for a disadvantaged community. Of course the volunteers were upset when they were doing this study. AgainI ask: why would you want anyone to scope the most successful volunteer organisation for closure? If you would want to do anything, it would be to learn the lessons of their success. It seems that every couple of years there is a protest meeting about a possible closure of Mount Druitt Hospital. In fact, Mount Druitt Hospital now has three specialities: paediatrics, rehabilitation and palliative care. There is also elective surgery, and we are doing very, very well in fulfilling important community needs. But the real problem rests with Blacktown Hospital. Blacktown LGA has the largest number of early adult deaths in New South Wales. We are the heart attack capital of New South Wales, and there is a whole series of other statistics I could quote to you. Let me say that 27 per cent of patients at Blacktown LGA have to go to Westmead to have non-tertiary services provided because of the lack of medical facilities at Blacktown. This is the fight that we need to be involved in. I think it is an outrage, but it is also a reflection of the fact that the Sydney West Area Health Service have not and will not put the money into Blacktown. (Time expired) Ryan Electorate: Victorian Bushfires groups can hold their collective heads up very high, and as the federal member for RyanI am very proud of all of them because the true spirit of Australia shone through last Friday evening, 20 February. The true spirit of Australia, the character of Australia and the compassion of Australia shone through by means of the Ryan constituents putting their hands up and saying, ‘We would like to show just how much we care about the deaths, the victims and the families-all those who suffered because of the catastrophic bushfires in Victoria.’ Last Friday, 20 February, at the Hotel Indooroopilly, more than 300 local residents and representatives of local businesses and community groups donated some $10,685 to the Red Cross Victorian Bushfire Appeal. This was organised with only four or five days real notice to those who participated. We held a local community concert, and I want to take this opportunity in the Parliament of Australia to thank all those who made this evening possible. First of all, I would like to thank Mr Paul Currie from Kid Rock Productions, a local musician and teacher-a man who has a deep love for music. He arranged for his very talented young musicians to perform to provide the evening’s entertainment. I also want to thank, obviously, the Hotel Indooroopilly, who very generously provided the venue free of charge. They also put on a sausage sizzle for all the guests who came that evening. I want to thank those who made a contribution to the evening’s raffle items and silent auctions, including Nautilus Scuba Centre and Forte School of Music, and also Sonnic Beatt Sound and Lighting Productions, who provided all the equipment for the evening’s concert. They very kindly came from all over Brisbane and donated their skills and equipment so that there was no charge incurred there. I also want to thank Westside News, the local newspaper that partnered with us and helped to promote the concert. But in particular I want to thank the young people of the western suburbs of Brisbane. I want to thank the Kenmore State High School students who gave their evening for this very worthy cause.

187,Mr Johnson (Ryan) (12.11 Pm),"Ryan residents, families, businesses and communityentertainment, and their talent was admired by all those in attendance. I want to thank them here in the parliament today. Emma Gage sang beautifully. Her parents, Ross and Therese Gage, through their business, Westside Swimming, organised a donation of some $1,600 towards the evening. It was inspiring stuff, and to anyone who questions the character and compassion of our country I say that this answers any questions, doubts or reservations you might have. It was just a marvellous occasion. Also from Kenmore State High School, Chloe Hill played the flute beautifully, and really everybody was in awe of her talent. These are two outstanding young Australians whose lives are going to be enriched because of their musical talents and who have clearly shown that the spirit of Australia shines through not only at Kenmore State High School but also of course in the western suburbs of Brisbane. I want to thank the head of music at Indooroopilly State School, Jill Elsworth, and the principal, Hilary Backus, for encouraging their students to perform. Young pianist Chai Jie Low played a beautiful piece so marvellously that she had the audience entranced. She was accompanied by Astrid Raschke, Lila Cassidy, Ellen Lynch and Chandra Choudhury. It makes me proud not only as the member of parliament representing the electorate of Ryan and the western suburbs of Brisbane but also as an Australian because they were just marvellous. I want to thank especially the Veteran’s Support and Advocacy Support Association, thank you so much for showing just how marvellous a country we are. They are a community group that does wonderful things for our veterans, but on this occasion they contributed so much to other Australians whose lives have been torn apart by this force of nature. Banking Mr Glenn Stevens, appeared before the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics and commented on some impending reforms to ATM fees. The RBA, in consultation with the banking sector, has put together a package of reforms that will have an impact on the way people use ATMs. These reforms come into effect from next Tuesday, 3 March. Under the proposed regime, transaction fees will be charged by the owner of the foreign ATMthat is, an ATM operated by a bank other than the customer’s bank-to the customer directly. To provide greater transparency in relation to these fees, the fee will be displayed on the screen during the transaction-allowing the customer to cancel the transaction if they do not wish to proceed and pay the fee. This relatively simple reform is intended to make ATM fees more transparent and promote competition between financial institutions and ATM operators by allowing customers to identify and choose to use the cheapest ATMs. Underpinning these reforms is the abolition of the interchange fee. Under the existing arrangements, each time a customer uses an ATM that is not operated by their own bank, their bank is charged an interchange fee by the ATM operator, and that fee is generally passed on to the customer through a transaction fee. Depending on the bank, these fees could range from 50c to $2 per transaction. Now that the customer will be required to pay the ATM fee directly to the foreign ATM operator under the new rules, there is no longer any real cost to the customer’s bank and therefore no justification for a customer’s bank to impose any transaction fee upon the customer for using the foreign ATM. The only possible argument for the imposition of a fee is to recoup the cost of processing the transaction. MAIN COMMITTEE",159,Adjournment
188,Mr Bradbury (Lindsay) (12.16 Pm),"Last week the Governor of the Reserve Bank,Mr Stevens estimates that any such administrative cost would be ‘at most 10c and quite possibly a lot less’. If these new arrangements are designed to ensure better disclosure of ATM fees then this simply will not be achieved if the customer’s own bank continues to levy a fee, which will not be disclosed at the point of the transaction, on their customer for using a foreign ATM. The only way that customers will be able to have any faith that these new arrangements will lead to a better disclosure of ATM fees is if banks and other institutions do not impose transaction fees upon their own customers for using ATMs not operated by them. However, I understand that some institutions are planning to continue to charge customers a fee. These fees have been described as ‘disloyalty fees’. I think most customers would find the notion of a fee for ‘disloyalty’ just a little bit rich coming from their bank. To my knowledge, only the Commonwealth Bank and Citibank have announced that they will not charge their customers a disloyalty fee for using a foreign ATM. I congratulate these two institutions for doing the right thing by their customers. I am concerned that other institutions have foreshadowed an additional foreign ATM transaction fee, which will mean that customers will be slugged twice every time they use a foreign ATM. The National Australia Bank say that they will charge a 50c fee every time a customer uses a foreign ATM, on top of the fee the customer will directly pay to the operator of the ATM. There is no justification for these ‘disloyalty fees’. The costs to the banks of processing these transactions are negligible, yet some have seen this as an opportunity to profiteer. While banks in other countries have been collapsing and governments spend billions or even trillions of dollars to recapitalise and bail out their banks, four of our banks are among the only 18 banks in the world to have a AA credit rating. This is unquestionably a good thing. Ensuring our banks have strong balance sheets and return profits in these difficult times is critical to the overall health of our economy. It is, however, reprehensible that banks and other financial institutions propose to slug customers a fee for using a foreign ATM when the bank is not bearing any real cost, especially when many of these institutions have been the beneficiaries of significant government support in the form of bank guarantees. I know many people in my electorate-and, no doubt, right around the country-are very angry. That is why I am launching an online petition on my website, www.davidbradbury.com.au, where people can sign on and register their opposition to being hit with these unfair bank fees. I will keep those people who sign my petition updated with further information on the charges that institutions choose to impose from next week. I call on the banks to do the right thing and drop these absurd and unfair fees. Mr Billson interjectinging is in order, Member for Lindsay! Flinders Electorate: Red Hill Community Centre vision for Red Hill. The vision is a very simple one. The Red Hill community have approached me, through the show grounds committee, through the National Trust and also through community members.

190,Mr Hunt (Flinders) (12.21 Pm),"I rise to give my support to a magnificent communitylifetime opportunity to create a community centre in this former Church of Christ property, which is currently up for sale. The church, through no fault of its own, is having to consolidate two of the church sites on the Mornington Peninsula, and therefore it is disposing of the Red Hill site. What we have on the Red Hill site is a magnificent old building and a very useful major second building, on land right in the heart of Red Hill. The vision that has been put to me, and which I support completely, is of a community hub which draws together the National Trust, community organisations, a site for the Red Hill show grounds and Red Hill Show Committee, and then a space in which visitors, tourists and others can come and have a sense of this grand, historic area, this town and agricultural site. I think this is a wonderful proposal. The question then is: how would this work? The elements of the proposal are these. Firstly, the Red Hill show society has Scott House. Scott House is a building of questionable quality. I am told that it has a large fibrocement component to it. There are fears of asbestos. And it is in a space which would allow the Mornington Peninsula Shire to complete playing fields, tennis courts and other elements in the area of the old Red Hill show grounds. If the council were to purchase the show society’s current building, that would enable the show society to contribute capital to the purchase of the Church of Christ building. In turn, the National Trust would contribute capital, and the council could assist with the fit-out. This is a great proposal for the community, and that is the way in which it can be done. The Church of Christ have indicated that they would give the community the chance to match any proposal made by a private bidder for their site, so they want to do the right thing. These are the elements that have been brought together, and I urge the Mornington Peninsula shire to consider completing the sports facilities which they have very generously developed in Red Hill. This is a once-in-a-lifetime, once-in-a-generation, opportunity, firstly, to complete the community sports facility in the Red Hill showground area; secondly, to give the Red Hill show committee the chance to have a permanent base in a facility which would be outstanding; and, thirdly, to give the community ownership, control and use for community purposes of facilities which include a hall and office facilities right in the heart of Red Hill. It is a great example of a very thoughtful community proposal. The players who need to be commended are the different community leaders who have come together to build the Red Hill community hub proposal; the show grounds committee, in particular, Rob Breeschoten; and the National Trust, in particular, Gillian Tolley. My strong proposal is to the Mornington Peninsula Shire Council. I respectfully ask that they consider the proposal, that they look to complete their show grounds sports facilities. This will bring all else together. I have made the commitment to work with state and federal governments to access programs under existing budgets which would allow for the fit-out and for the operational funding to be, in part or in whole, sourced from those levels. The Red Hill community hub is a great proposal for a great town, and I commend it to council. I thank all of those who have helped put it together. Nation Building and Jobs Plan Building and Jobs Plan, which was rightly passed by the parliament last sitting week, and, in particular, the positive effects on employment thanks to the insulation component of that plan.

191,Mr Dreyfus (Isaacs) (12.26 Pm),"I want to speak about the Rudd government’s Nationwill create and support jobs across many sectors while reducing Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions by around 49 million tonnes. So on that score alone it is a very important measure, even before one gets to the economic stimulus effect. I do not want to spend too much time talking about the opposition’s decision to vote against this plan, because there are so many positive things I have to say about this package, but I want to put fairly and squarely on the record that, while this government is making tough decisions and taking decisive action to best protect Australia from the global financial crisis, the opposition leader and his band of merry men sit there and offer nothing except their lack of economic credibility. Theirs is a position of economic vandalism, plain and simple, and the Australian people are seeing through their thin rhetoric and constant changing of position. The time has really come for the opposition to say what they would do. They have put no serious alternative to the government’s clear and decisive action. Moving on, I want to focus on the insulation component of the plan because it will have a particularly strong impact in my electorate. Fletcher Insulation, which is Australia’s largest insulation manufacturer, has this country’s largest insulation manufacturing plant, in Dandenong South, in my electorate, as well as a major distribution centre in Braeside, also in my electorate. The company is firmly and long established in my electorate. What benefits the insulation industry and Fletcher Insulation also benefits the people of my electorate. Yesterday I spoke to the General Manager of Fletcher Insulation, Mr David Isaacs, about the flow-on effects of the government’s insulation package. Mr Isaacs was full of praise for this plan and how it would support Australian jobs at so many levels of the insulation process. He said it is ‘a great initiative and very positive’. For the benefit of the House, let me run through the myriad links in the manufacturing chain where jobs will be created and supported. Mr Isaacs said this plan will see jobs created at the Dandenong South manufacturing plant, where glass wool is produced to use in their Pink Batts and Fat Batts. He also told me that other competing insulation products like rock-wool, polyester and cellulose, which are produced by other manufacturers, will need production to be boosted, and that of course means even more jobs. Jobs will be created in the transport, warehouse and distribution sectors. Warehouses will need more staff to deal with the increased volume of stock, and the same for distribution. And what of hardware stores like Mitre 10 or Bunnings? Mr Isaacs tells me that this plan will also have a positive spin-off for these companies because of their distribution networks, and that is a big tick in the retailing box. Of course, this is all before considering the people who will be employed to install the insulation in millions of homes across the nation. One of the great things Mr Isaacs pointed out to me was just how Australian this will all be. Insulation is not a product which is readily imported-and, for the benefit of the member for Sturt, who seemed confused about this on Tuesday, that means bringing something into the country. This is due to the very bulky nature of the product and also the fact that potential importers just do not have the distribution structure to get it to homeowners. How many jobs will this plan create? The chief executive of the Insulation Council of Australia and New Zealand, Mr Dennis D’Arcy, with whom I have also spoken, said that 4,000 jobs will be created in the insulation industry and that ‘the economic multiplier will ripple MAIN COMMITTEE well past the insulation industry’s raw materials suppliers, manufacturers, installers and delivery drivers’. This plan is all about supporting Australian jobs. We are entering an economic phase that will see unemployment rise and times will get tougher, but I stand proudly in my electorate and say that I am part of a government that is taking every possible step to best cushion the blow of this financial crisis, with decisive and prompt action. Dunkley Electorate: Post Office cern to the Dunkley community. You could be forgiven for thinking it is groundhog day. Ten years ago our community rallied and fought to protect the Playne Street post office in Frankston from plans by Australia Post to close it and relocate it to a far less acceptable location. We are there again! There are plans by Australia Post to close not only the Playne Street post office but also the more retail focused outlet in the Bayside Shopping Centre in Frankston and to consolidate those two activities in Wells Street at the former Dr Edelsten building opposite the new cinema and entertainment complex. I can understand the rationale for closing the Bayside retail outlet. There was a decision some time ago to move it from a very popular, high-exposure and, I understand, very high rent area in the complex to a far more distant corner of the Bayside complex. It has seen a significant reduction in retail activity and not the take-up of post office box opportunities that people really hoped for. ThatI can understand, and I can completely understand the proposal to consolidate that somewhere and to make it more attractive as a retail proposition. The idea of shutting Playne Street post office, though, just leaves me completely bewildered. Since the last time we had this battle 10 years ago, I obviously have not learnt much. It bewildered me then and it still bewilders me now. The local community, the Chamber of Commerce and Councillor Christine Richards are just a handful of those who are confused and anxious about what the future plans look like. As yet, there has been no commitment to actually shut Playne Street, but it certainly is on the radar screen. The idea that the retail activity in the Bayside Shopping Centre and the mainly business bulk mail post office box activity at Playne Street could be brought together in a central location in Frankston may have some theoretical appeal. But all I say to people is, ‘Road test the proposition.’ Wells Street in Frankston, which runs through the middle of the central activities district, has actually had some excellent work done on improving its street amenity and its presentation. There are not too many car parks there, though. The idea is to move that post office, where many of the customers of the post office boxes are from the greater Frankston area. They drive to the current venue. It is on the southern edge of the CBD. You can nip in to the post office. There is angle parking on both sides, and there are a couple of park and ride parks as well that have been provided by the council. It all works quite well. But to move that kind of concept into the middle of town is not a well-thought through proposition. If you are fortunate enough to get a car park in one of the three that are in front of not just this premise but the whole complex along Wells Street, you would be doing well. You would have to take a chance with the three ATMs, the other business activity and the like. The 1,000 or so post office box holders could have a raffle to see who got to use those rare, scarce car parking places-that is, if those places were made available. Frankston City has made it MAIN COMMITTEE",162,Vsasa Based At Toowong They Donated A Cheque For $5 000 For This What Can One Say But
192,Mr Billson (Dunkley) (12.31 Pm),"I rise today to raise two particular issues of conabsolutely clear that it has not made any commitment to make those car parking places available for the exclusive use of Australia Post. This idea needs to be re-examined. If you are lucky enough to get a car park, you have then got to get out of the central area. Wells Street would see you heading towards the railway station and there is no way other than to turn left, which would take you for a nice scenic drive past the front of the railway station and the bus interchange and then you might be able to escape. Alternatively, you would go down Park Lane and through the little rat run behind the entertainment complex. That does not look like a sound traffic management proposition either. I have been encouraged by the willingness of the Australia Post commercial manager to discuss these issues, but the uncertainty about Australia Post’s actual plans is causing great anxiety in the community. I believe Playne Street needs to stay. I understand that there is an argument for the retail activity moving out of the shopping centre because of rental costs, but we need to think carefully about the nature of the customers, the use of the facility in Playne Street and all the arguments we had 10 years ago, and say that we need to maintain the functionality of those premises. Car parking, traffic movement, ease of access and the popularity of the post office boxes underline the very simple fact that where it is now works. The customers shop with their feet, they can park their vehicles, and they have all of their needs met without going into the heart of the CBD. It is a positive tenant to have on the southern side of the Frankston city area. The council is actively engaged, the Chamber of Commerce is engaged and so am I. I would encourage Australia Post to carefully consult with their clients and customers who make the Playne Street premises one of their most viable and financially profitable outlets in greater Melbourne, and to rethink this plan to make sure that Playne Street can be saved and can continue to serve its very useful purpose for the people of greater Frankston. Werriwa Electorate: Community Infrastructure commitment to support jobs and boost the local economy of the south-west of Sydney. The Rudd government last week approved more than $4 million to build and upgrade community infrastructure in and around my electorate of Werriwa. The Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, the Hon. Anthony Albanese, visited Campbelltown last week as part of the community cabinet meeting, where funding from the $800 million Community Infrastructure Program was announced. While he was in Campbelltown he took the opportunity to meet the mayors of Campbelltown, Liverpool, Camden and Wollondilly councils to discuss a number of issues of local concern, including the sound barriers along the new freight line being constructed by the ARTC along the Casula corridor and a bridge at Cambridge Avenue, which is a main thoroughfare but one which regularly goes under water every time it rains. These are matters that are very important to our local mayors, and it has been reported to me that at that meeting the minister was very responsive to looking at making plans to better facilitate those pieces of infrastructure. The Rudd government is acting decisively on local community issues to support jobs and improve the quality of local infrastructure, and I think what we saw from the community cabinet meeting was that commitment writ large. A new and vibrant partnership between federal and local governments is emerging.

Swan Electorate: Youth Focus Foundation goodies he has just told us about. I rise today to talk about the issue of youth suicide and the efforts of a charitable organisation within my electorate to prevent it. I begin with some sobering statistics. In 2005, young people accounted for 14 per cent of all suicide deaths. A 2002 Western Australian child health survey found that 16 per cent of WA adolescents between 12 and 16 years of age reported having had suicidal thoughts in the previous six months. The highest occurrence was 29.1 per cent among girls aged between 15 and 16 years. Youth suicide is clearly a serious problem in WA and across the nation, and it is a problem that appears to be worsening: between 1996-97 and 2005-06, the hospitalisation rate for intentional selfharm by young people increased by a dramatic 43 per cent. Depression, which is one of the early signs associated with suicide and self-harm, has been predicted by the World Health OrMAIN COMMITTEE",165,Vsasa Based At Toowong They Donated A Cheque For $5 000 For This What Can One Say But
194,Mr Irons (Swan) (12.41 Pm),"I congratulate the member for Werriwa for the basket ofganisation to become the second-highest cause of illness globally by 2020, yet this is an issue that is not talked about enough in Canberra. I hear speeches about road safety in this place; however, the latest figures available, from 2004, reveal that 500 more Australians die from suicide than from road accidents each year. This is clearly an area all members need to focus on. An organisation within my electorate is battling this rising tide and deserves enormous credit. The Burswood based Youth Focus Foundation is a community based charitable organisation with expertise in providing support and solutions for young people-and the families of young people-aged between 12 and 18 who show early signs of suicide, depression and self-harm. These services are provided free of charge. Services include youth counselling services; family counselling services; a peer support program which runs therapeutic, recreation based groups for 14to 18-year-olds; and a mentor program which provides mentors and engages with young people who have completed a six-week training program. Locals do not have to travel to Burswood to access these services. The qualified professionals of the organisation travel to schools, community centres or even local parks to deliver the services. In 2007, Youth Focus assisted 552 young people and 138 families. Many lives have been saved. They provide an outstanding service and should be commended. Unfortunately, the services provided by Youth Focus are under threat. Thirteen per cent of Youth Focus funding comes from government, and the remaining 87 per cent comes from non-government sources. Government funding for Youth Focus in the last 12 months has included two federal funding grants totalling $37,000, which they are very grateful for. However, the charity encounters several problems with its government funding which I would like to raise with the House. First, funding grants tend to be based around new projects. This makes maintaining proven, successful projects very difficult indeed. Additionally, the competitive nature of the grant process makes it difficult to establish collaborative partners and, given the economic crisis, businesses are less and less likely to fund the balance with donations. We must consider altering the application requirements to rectify this. The second point on government spending is that it is simply insufficient. Youth Focus said it had to turn away at least 300 people last year because it simply did not have the money to help them. This is unacceptable, and as long as I am in parliament I will push for this to be rectified. I believe that we, as federal lawmakers, need to take a significant part of the responsibility for this. Youth Focus receives 40 per cent of its referrals from schools. However the WA department of education funds only the provision of one full-time councillor; instead funding the provision of social workers, chaplains, school psychologists and nurses, who in turn refer students to Youth Focus. This seems to be a waste of resources. The contribution from the federal department of education is also limited. I will be writing to the WA and federal ministers for education to suggest a policy change to reflect this. It is the lack of money which means that Youth Focus has to rely heavily on nongovernment funding. I am pleased to report to the House that private organisations within my electorate have contributed to this cause. These include the Burswood Entertainment Complex and Mustard Catering. However, as one might suspect in these tough economic times, businesses have been reducing the scale of their charitable contributions. This is happening at a time when the global financial crisis is putting more pressure on families and when the services provided by Youth Focus are becoming increasingly in demand. This not only highlights MAIN COMMITTEE the need for strong economic management to bring us out of recession but also reinforces the need for federal government investment. It will not be massively expensive and will save lives. Not many policies can claim to achieve that. In conclusion, youth suicide is regrettably a problem in my electorate and across Australia. However, it can be minimised through the work of groups like Youth Focus Foundation. The commendable work of the foundation helps to achieve these goals. (Time expired) Victorian Bushfires Ms HALL (Shortland) (12.47 pm)-The horrendous bushfires in Victoria and the devastation that they have wrought have caused great concern throughout the community. There was a great sense of hopelessness yet a strong feeling that every person throughout Australia wanted to contribute and help in some way. I think the TV coverage made it so real and brought it into everybody’s living room. My office-and, I am sure, the office of every member of this House-was contacted by numerous people wishing to do something. Because of this massive uprising in the community, I decided to organise a fundraiser. The fundraiser was initially planned for the first weekend after the bushfires but, unfortunately, unlike Victoria, we had torrential rain and the fundraiser had to be postponed, instead being held last Sunday. It was an enormous success, with nearly $17,000 being raised. It was a whole-of-community response. I want to take this opportunity to thank those people that were involved in this fundraising event. I was supported by the state member for Swansea, Robert Coombs; the Mayor of Lake Macquarie, Greg Piper; the Belmont Chamber of Commerce; Belmont Rotary; Swansea Lions Club; Red Cross; and the Salvation Army. They all played an organising role in the event that took place, along with my staff members Kathy Tudor and Mark Raper. I have to give special mention to Steve Smith, the CEO of Austereo. Dr Dave, from Austereo’s KO-FM and NX-FM, came along and was the commentator on the day. They gave enormous support, as did all media. We also had support from ABC Radio, Animal Crackers, Belmont Amcal Pharmacy, Belmont Bunnings, Belmont Cake Shop and Belmont Citi Centre, and I would particularly like to mention the efforts of Barbara Davis, who is a dynamo. When Barbara gets behind anything, it is a great success. We also had support from Belmont Coles, Belmont Copy Centre, Brian Beesley, Belmont Ministers Association, Father Clive Gerard and the New South Wales Fire Brigade, Belmont Station. We also had support from the Rural Fire Service from Nords Wharf; Grant Hampton from Belmont Retravision, who donated a flat-screen TV for a raffle; Belmont Rotary Club; Belmont Quality Meats; Belmont Woolworths; Blondies Hair Salon; BNP Security; Caffe Macquarie; Caves Beach Butcher; Caves Beach Hotel; Chris Osborne; Clan McEwan Pipe Band; Community First Credit Union; Companion Credit Union; Darbys Swansea; Deck 56; Balcony Restaurant and Swill& Grill at the Gunyah Hotel; Hollebone Meats; In2Sport Belmont; Jim Cowburn; Joe’s Wood-Fired Pizza; Kaylah Anne Farmer; Kennards Hire, Lambton; Kennards Hire, Warners Bay; Kevin’s Meats; Lake Macquarie City Council, who donated the park free of charge for the day; Joe Rowbottom at Lakeside Real Estate; Lakes United Rugby League Club; Logic Hair Design; Marks Point Hair Salon; Marks Point Newagency; Marks Point Post Office; Marks Point Takeaway; Mayfair Jewellers; Swansea Mega Mania; Milano’s Restaurant; Murrays Meat Swansea; Newcastle Jets Football Club; Newcastle Knights Rugby League Club; Newcastle Permanent Building Society; Newcastle Star Newspaper; Nextra Newsagency; Pelican JetBuzz Jet Boats; Rusty Springfield; Sesames on the Lake; Showcase MAIN COMMITTEE Jewellers; Squid’s Ink; Soup& Song; Spotlight Newcastle; Sun Patch Gift& Kitchenware; Swansea Chamber of Commerce; Swansea Coles; Swansea Lions Club; Swansea RSL Club; Swansea Workers Club; 2HD/NewFM; Ultimate Style Hairdressers; Uproar; Viktoria’s Shoes; Westpac Bank; Warren Ure Jazz Band; Bill Charlton and Robyn Bowman Charlton; and Mark Wison. All these people gave donations and contributed in some way to this very successful day. The success of the day was because it was a whole-of-community event. Everybody in the community got behind it. Businesses donated prizes and sausages for the sausage sizzle, and Mega Mania donated a jumping castle and fun activities free of charge. It was an outstanding success. It was a comment on what a wonderful community I am privileged to represent in this parliament. Water Dr SOUTHCOTT (Boothby) (12.52 pm)-I would like to speak on the issue of water security for Adelaide and the Murray-Darling river system. We now have a situation where the Murray River ceases to flow through the Murray mouth 40 per cent of the time. I can remember when the Murray first closed in recent times, in 1981. That was seen as a rare event. We now see that happening 40 per cent of the time. The recent report of the Murray-Darling Basin Sustainable Yields Project, which was handed down in November, states that total flows at the Murray mouth have reduced by 61 per cent. The report also shows that by 2030 flows at the mouth will reduce by a further 24 to 30 per cent. This is grim news for South Australia and it is grim news for people who rely on flows in the Murray for their water supply and for human needs. That is one of the reasons that in January 2007 the Howard government announced $10 billion of work in infrastructure to go towards the Murray-Darling river system. It is of real concern that, while there has been a lot of spending announced by the government over the last four to five months, there has been nothing for water infrastructure. It is estimated that $6 billion had already been set aside by the former government. If that were used, it could save up to 600 million litres of water. Unfortunately, instead of that, Kevin Rudd and Penny Wong are voting to take more water out of the Murray-Darling Basin. They voted in favour of building a pipeline from the Goulburn River to Melbourne, which will take 75 million litres of water per year out of the Murray-Darling Basin. At the same time, the minister says that there is not enough water in the Murray-Darling Basin to save the Lower Lakes. If there is not enough water in the system to save the Lower Lakes, why did the federal government vote to take out an extra 75 million litres of water per year? They also voted against a $50 million assistance package for the people around the Lower Lakes. The people of the Lower Lakes and everyone else living in the Murray-Darling Basin who rely on a health system to survive are sick of hearing about who is to blame. They are sick of hearing about how years of mismanagement have delivered us this mess. They do not want to see another cheap headline that delivers nothing; they want to hear solutions for today and tomorrow. The issue of water security and the state of the Murray River is one of the major issues that constituents raise with me, and it is one of my priorities in representing the seat of Boothby. I am very pleased to be holding a water forum next week in my electorate with the shadow minister for the environment, climate change and water, the member for Flinders. Travelling around the electorate, the lack of water is very obvious. People’s gardens are bone MAIN COMMITTEE dry We have had years of water restrictions. Parks and school ovals have turned into dustbowls. Unfortunately, we have a state government that have dragged their feet on anything to do with water security. In September 2007 I launched a petition in my electorate, calling on the state government to act on a desalination plant. This petition received over 8,000 signatures. I am pleased that a desalination plant is now going ahead. This is a good way forward, and it will provide water security for Adelaide in the future. I think it is a real shame that we had to wait as long as we did. I was also very pleased to be associated with the Community Water Grant Program. The last round of this in 2007 saved 73 million litres of water in the electorate of Boothby alone. It was a great program and it really worked well with schools, sporting clubs and other community organisations. It is a real shame that the government have given no incentives for the community to save water and have not continued with that program. Robertson Electorate: Marine Discovery Centre Ms NEAL (Robertson) (12.57 pm)-I rise today to inform members of the merits of the proposed marine discovery centre at Terrigal, in my electorate of Robertson, on the Central Coast of New South Wales. This centre will provide the Central Coast with an environmental, educational and tourist facility that will become, I am sure, a benchmark facility of its type in Australia. Over the last six months I have been actively involved in promoting the benefits of the marine discovery centre. I have hosted two meetings of stakeholders in my Gosford office. There was overwhelming support for the centre, and it was widely appreciated in those meetings and elsewhere that Terrigal was the ideal location for such a facility. The preferred location is The Haven at Terrigal, an established tourist precinct. There is enormous potential for this centre to bring to the coast a sustained economic boost from tourist dollars. Terrigal Haven is also the preferred location and departure point for tourists, divers, researchers and day visitors, who will be able to dive to the wreck of HMAS Adelaide when it is sunk off the coast of Terrigal. Besides education, research and community facilities, the centre will also be the focal point for a vibrant and potentially lucrative dive industry. The spin-off dollars from associated accommodation and restaurants generated by traffic visiting the centre from tourists visiting the coast will also bring long-term benefits to the local community. The meetings that I have hosted in my office were attended by representatives of the Community Environment Network, the peak environmental body on the coast; the University of Newcastle’s Central Coast campus, which runs a well established and well regarded marine research centre and course; the New South Wales Department of Lands, on whose land the centre may be built; and the New South Wales Department of Premier and Cabinet. Among all these stakeholders there is a real sense of excitement about the possibilities that the marine discovery centre will open up for the people and the economy of the Central Coast. This is a project that builds on strong and already existing partnerships within the community. The linkages that can be built between education, community interest, environmental groups, tourism, local business and major infrastructure provision make the centre an extremely attractive proposition. A marine discovery centre at Terrigal will provide a marine research and educational facility for the university and for local environmental groups. It will also be used by community groups and will have a number of associated small businesses operating within it. HMAS MAIN COMMITTEE Adelaide is a real drawcard that will establish the marine centre and the Terrigal site as a must-see destination. Dive wrecks and artificial reefs based on ships similar to HMAS Adelaide have proved extremely successful and a sustainable tourist destination in other parts of the country. There is already considerable interest in the project among dive shop operators, the hotel industry, restaurants and other small businesses on the Central Coast. The centre has already the in-principle support of Central Coast Tourism, the peak tourist body on the coast. The marine discovery centre and HMAS Adelaide will, I am sure, assume its role as a major drawcard for tourists on the Central Coast. Its proximity to Sydney will attract considerable tourist trade both from within Australia and from overseas. In this role the Terrigal site will provide an ongoing return on the initial investment in such a centre. In short, this is community infrastructure that will pay its way in the future. One of the challenges to the promotion of this project is the position of Gosford City Council. The stakeholders’ group has so far not been able to secure the support of the council for this project. Despite my best efforts and my promotion of the project with the mayor, I was unable to secure the council’s support in applying for a grant under the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program, much to my disappointment. This competitive nationwide program funds local government bodies for strategic projects worth more than $2 million. The original $50 million funding was recently increased to $500 million as part of the Nation Building and Jobs Plan, the Rudd government’s response to the global financial downturn. This is a great project and deserves the support of the community. It certainly has my support and I will continue to fight for it. I urge the council to support it also. (Time expired) Question agreed to. Main Committee adjourned at 1.02 pm MAIN COMMITTEE Living Murray and Water for Rivers Projects (Question No. 334) Dr Stone asked the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, in writing, on 17 September 2008: (1) In respect of the Living Murray and Water for Rivers projects mentioned in his conditional approval of the Sugarloaf Pipeline, could he: (a) provide a list of the projects in Victoria that are funded under the Living Murray program and Water for Rivers company and for each project, include the date of the grant, the amount funded and the megalitres of water to be saved; and (b) confirm that the projects already funded under Living Murray or Water for Rivers are not counted in the water savings from sending water to Melbourne via the Sugarloaf Pipeline. (2) In respect of the independent audit of the water savings as part of the conditional approval for the Sugarloaf Pipeline: (a) who will be responsible for undertaking the audit of the water savings, (i) can he provide assurance that it will be conducted independently, and (ii) would he consider it appropriate for the proponents of the project, the Sugarloaf Pipeline Alliance and Victorian Government, to be involved; if so, why; and (b) do the water savings have to be demonstrated annually in order to send the water down the north south pipeline to Melbourne. (3) Given his decision, as a condition of the Sugarloaf Pipeline, to not use the water quality reserve in Eildon Dam for the water supply to Melbourne, will he also take action to stop Coliban Water using this reserve to supply water to Bendigo. (1) (a) Projects being funded in Victoria through The Living Murray initiative (TLM) and by Water for Rivers (WfR) are listed in Table 1.

195,Mr Garrett,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Project Funding Grant Date1 Funding ($M) Savings Source (ML) Lake Mokoan/Casey’s Weir WfR 3/06/2002 1.4 1,000 Stage1 Lake Mokoan TLM To be finalised 39.2 27,000 WfR 3/06/2002 28.3 18,000 Central Goulburn Channel WfR/VI 3/06/2002 42.8 18,300 Automation ProjectC Note 1: The grant date listed for TLM projects relate to the date Investment Agreements were signed for the particular commitment. The grant date listed for Water for Rivers is the date the Commonwealth, New South Wales and Victorian Governments signed of the Snowy Water Inquiry Outcomes Implementation Deed. The Water for Rivers Company is responsible for the commercial arrangements to implement projects. (b) Water recovered through The Living Murray initiative will not be available to send to Melbourne via the Sugarloaf Pipeline. We are advised by the Victorian Government that water savings achieved through the Central Goulburn Channel Automation project will be available to send to Melbourne up until Water for Rivers finalise payments, which is currently budgeted for 2010-11. (2) (a) This has not yet been determined. (2) (a) (i) The conditions of approval imposed on the project require that the audit be conducted by a party independent of the Sugarloaf Pipeline Alliance. As with all approval conditions imposed under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, compliance will be assured through the Department’s robust compliance and enforcement framework. (a) (ii) Some Victorian Government agencies already play a role in the regulation of water within the Goulburn River system, and their involvement through the provision of information to the audit process may be appropriate. (b) We expect that the Victorian Government will be assessing savings each year in order to identify the appropriate allocations to irrigators, to the environment and to Melbourne users. (3) Condition 11(e) attached to the Approval Decision states that the Melbourne water extracted to the Sugarloaf Pipeline must be “zero if the necessary regulated releases are for the maintenance of environmental flows or materially deplete water stored in Eildon Weir that is designated as being an environmental reserve”. The water quality reserve, part of which was previously sold to Coliban Water, is a separate allocation of water over and above the environmental flows or environmental reserve. The water quality reserve is not the subject of any condition of approval. Living Murray and Water for Rivers Projects (Question No. 344) Dr Stone asked the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, in writing, on 22 September 2008: (1) Did he assure the House on 16 September 2008 that there would be no allocations of water to the North-South Melbourne pipeline which have already been allocated to the Living Murray system or Water for Rivers initiative. (2) Is he aware that a spokesperson for the Victorian Water Minister was reported on 15 September 2008 as saying that Melbourne will receive 75 gigalitres of water in 2010 from existing savings from projects in the Goulburn Valley that are funded by the Living Murray initiative. (3) Is he aware that the Victorian Government’s Water Authority, Goulburn-Murray Water, clearly states on its website that the expected water savings from both the Central Goulburn 1234 Modernisation Project and Shepparton Modernisation Project are earmarked for the Living Murray initiative. (4) Will he confirm that no water will be diverted to Melbourne via the pipeline which has been identified for the Living Murray or Water for Rivers initiatives; and if not from the environment reserve in Eildon, the Living Murray and Water for Rivers savings initiatives, does he know from where the Victorian Government will get the water for Melbourne; if so, from where. (1) Yes (2) I am aware of comments attributed to a spokesman for the Victorian Water Minister, the Hon Tim Holding, reported in the ‘Weekly Times Now’ on 18 September 2008. The spokesman noted that only savings attributed to Victorian investment in the Shepparton Modernisation project would be used for Melbourne in 2010. (3) Yes, however, the information on the Goulburn-Murray Water website was incorrect at the time the question was posed. This website has since been updated to reflect that: (1) the Living Murray component of the Shepparton Modernisation Projects is only one part of a larger project; and (2) the Central Goulburn 1234 Modernisation (CG1234) project is not a Living Murray project. (4) No water allocations identified for the Living Murray initiative or Water for Rivers will be diverted to Melbourne via the Sugarloaf Pipeline. The proponent has identified water savings from the Victorian Government’s share of the Shepparton Modernisation project, savings from the CG1234 project achieved prior to the transfer to Water for Rivers in 2010/11 and a water quality reserve not allocated to environmental programs. The Victorian Government claims water savings achieved under Stage One of the Northern Victoria Infrastructure Renewal Project will form the primary source of water to be diverted through the Sugarloaf Pipeline. Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy: Program Funding (Question No. 459) Mr Hockey asked the Minister representing the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, in writing, on 1 December 2008: (1) Which agencies and departments in the Minister’s portfolio will return money to budget in the 2008-09 financial year as a result of underspends in the 2007-08 financial year; and what sum of money will be returned to budget from these programs. (2) From1 December 2007 to 30 June 2008, what sum of money has the Government committed to spending under Regulation 10 of the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 for applicable departments and agencies under the Minister’s portfolio; and how much of this commitment was approved: (a) at the department and agency level; and (b) by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. (3) What sum of depreciation funding: (a) is available for each department and agency in the Minister’s portfolio as at 30 June 2008; (b) was spent by each department and agency in the Minister’s portfolio in the 2007-08 financial year; and (c) was spent by each department and agency in the Minister’s portfolio in the 2007-08 financial year to directly replace assets for which it was appropriated. has presented the following answer to the honourable member’s question:",172,Questions In Writing
