(1) The administration of schools, including the provision of literacy and remedial education, is the responsibility of the State and Territory education departments and non-government education authorities, not the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth’s indigenous education programs which can assist the literacy and remedial learning outcomes for Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people are the Indigenous Education Strategic Initiatives Program (IESIP) and the Indigenous Education Direct Assistance (IEDA) Program. These programs provide supplementary assistance for the education of indigenous students for literacy and remedial education not just for literacy and remedial assistance. Under IESIP, recipients determine how these funds are best used to achieve the mutually agreed targets specified in their individual agreements with the Commonwealth. Under IEDA, literacy and remedial education assistance can be provided to students through the Aboriginal Tutorial Assistance Scheme (ATAS), an element of the IEDA program. This is generally provided independently, outside of school hours. The Commonwealth is working with the States and Territories to ensure that all children achieve an acceptable standard of literacy and numeracy skills. Under the Literacy and Numeracy Program the Commonwealth will provide approximately $200 million for literacy and numeracy for disadvantaged",114,Questions On Notice
