I have operated the regulation with great care, so that the deposits of those affected may not be immediately withdrawn. It has been applied to prevent the increase of such deposits, and is in the interests of the banks and of the Treasury. temporarily suspend the regulation now that the loan is through. applied for the right to pay a higher rate of interest because it has hitherto been doing so, we have kept the amount on which the higher rate could be paid at the limi t reached before the regulation was passed; we have been preventing the payment of a higher rate on any additional amount.

We are all aware that a very startling cable message from the Old Country appeared in the press to the following effect:Several plans have been sent in , Men who were on board the Barambah state that the vessel wns in a filthy condition before it left Australia. The planking covering the iron decks was so badly laid that the interstices were filled with dirt, which could not possibly be cleaned up. Meat was cut up on the deck. When some of the planking was lifted, a seething mass of maggots was found. The vessel was quite unsuitable for the sleeping of 800 men on its single 'tween deck.

I assume that if investigations had been made, even although the inspection of the machinery might prove satisfactory, although the authorities might have been satisfied as to the speed of the vessel, complaints must have been brought forward by the soldiers in regard to the filthy and overcrowded condition of the Barambah. on that score. sible; but I made a note in my pocketbook of what I was told-that a medical officer on the vessel had been overheard to say that the boat was in a damnable state. I also learned fro m officials who had been on the boat, that it was in a very bad state. Nevertheless, I looked upon this matter as subsidiary at the time. I shall not trouble to read tbe further official correspondence. Acting Prime Minister, through the Assistant Minister for the Navy, wired to Durban, and received the assurance that there was no danger likely to arise from the engines. I am not at liberty to disclose other correspondence which I have, because it did not come to me directly, and I have heard of it unofficially only, but I know that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Heitmann), who was on board the Barambah as a private, is now in London, and that his opinion as to the condition of the vessel could easily be obtained at once, in order to verify the complaints which I am now making. A t any rate, if there has been grave negligence of duty-and , apparently, there has been-o n the part of the naval officer or defence officer whose responsibility it was to inspect that transport, it must be punished. The House should demand it . There are detectives in the service of the Defence Department. They are somewhat like the Military Police. We hear a good deal of them occasionally, but we cannot see much use for them. In the honourable memglad to agree witE the honourable member for once. had Detective Jones chasing round Melbourne in regard to an uncensored letter. is so; but in I do not propose to give the name of the writer, but the Department w ill find it on file C.1590. A boy wrote to his brother. That letter was censored, and Detective Jones was racing round Melbourne, not and in order to find out whether there was any truth in the allegations which the boy had made, but in order ' to ascertain whether any of his family were disloyal. Tn one of his letters he saidIf we get to England on this boat (tub is We heard no complaint too good to call her) we will be damned lucky. And in another letter, from Capetown, on l l t h October, he saidThis boat is a seething mass of filth from stem to stern, and it will be remarkable if disease does not break out. I would like to tell you what happened at our last port of call (presumably Durban), but I would got C.B., cashiered. That boy became ill on beard, and was p u t ' ashore at Sierra Leone, where he died. What reparation his family are to Thn receive it is hard to say; but those responsible should get the family curse. I do not know how many others died there. It is reported that twenty-five died, six in one day. Surely this House will see that something is done so that there shall be no possibility of a recurrence of this sort of thing when cur boys are returning from the Front. Action should be taken by either the Government or the House. I hope the Defence Department w ill at once make public the names of those lads who have died and those who are ill , because letter after letter is coming from relatives with inquiries as to whether their boys are all right. Some parents are cabling to the Old Country to ascertain if their soldier sons have died on the journey, and I think the Department should immediately publish all available information in the press so that those relatives who have not been bereaved may be released from their wretched uncertainty.

40,Mr Brennan,"Hear, hear! I amlarge number of letters on tbe subject, but I propose to quote only a couple of them. One writer saysI was staggered on reading of the state of tilings with ship BaramVah, but there should have been no necessity for this. We do not offer our boys to the country to be treated worse than cattle, and somebody is responsible for this terrible bungle. I heartily sympathize with the parents of the boys who have met their death through this shameful neglect, and it is tlie one great blot that comes with thc cessation of hostilities. Our sons go to do their part on active service, and only expect trouble from the enemy 'by torpedoes, or mines, not to be cooped up in a den of disease, principally brought about by overcrowding and bad arrangements. Such organization is incredible, and members will not be doing their, duty if those responsible axe not brought to book. ber know whether there was any sickness on board the Barambah bef ore she touched at Durban? cause if there was no sickness before Durban was reached, the probability is that the infection was picked up in South Africa. to when the outbreak of Spanish influenza commenced in Cape Colony, but nothaving complete dates as to the Barambah's movements I am not able to say whether the vessel departed from Capetown before the disease broke out. Another letter I have received is from a lady who had two sons on tlie Barambah, and it is very evident that she is in a most distressed state of mind because of the shocking disclosures that have been made. Other letters are couched in similar tones. Minister will give the Blouse an assurance that an exhaustive inquiry will be made. I do not hold Ministers blameable for happenings of this sort, but I shall blame them if they t r y to shield those who are responsible. I do not believe Ministers will do that. I should not have moved the adjournment of the Housei f I had thought there would have been a chance of dealing with a notice of motion for the appointment of a Parliamentary Committee to make inquiries. The House should receive from the Acting Prime Minister an assurance that an investigation will be made at this end, but we shall not be satisfied with a departmental inquiry. Hundreds of thousands of Australian lads have been sent overseas, and the majority of them have yet to be returned, and, according to tlie reports that have been made public, there has been gross carelessness on the part of somebody. If so, those who were responsible should be brought to book. In order to safeguard against anything of this kind happening in connection with the return of our soldiers, a Committee, or Business Board, should be appointed in England to take charge, to some extent, at any rate, of the shipping arrangements at that end. We .cannot tolerate a recurrence of this scandal. Whether anything of the sort has happened in the past we do not know, because if such things had occurred the censor could, and probably would, have prevented the facts being made public. But any Government that knew of such an occurrence,' and did not take T h a t is a vital point, be-. steps to prevent its repetition, would be culpable. Everybody must regret what has happened. We can imagine .1,000 men cooped up on a boat at Sierra Leone, the hottest part of Africa, in a crowded, I inquired to-day as dirty , and disease-stricken vessel. ' A l though they had been confined on board ever since they l e f t Melbourne, only about thirty or for ty of them were allowed to go ashore at Fremantle. What time was spent at Durban or CapetownI do not know, but probably the soldiers had not more than two or three days ashore during the whole trip from Australia to England. The evidence discloses, that there was no room for proper recreation or exercise on board. Therefore, I ask from the GoI hope the Acting Prime vernment an assurance that in connection with the return of soldiers to Australia the arrangements w ill be placed in the hands of a representative committee. A . couple of soldiers should be appointed to make inquiries in London as to the condition of the Barambah on her arrival. I shall not rest content until the fullest independent inquiry has been made, and if there has been carelessness, whoever was responsible will deserve the severest punishment. is regrettable that a matter of this sort has to be brought before the House, and",26,Adjournment Formal Tboopship Barambah

45,Mr Mcgrath (Ballarat) [3.38],"I tI suppose fchat if hostilities had uot ended we should have heard nothing about this trouble. Probably the censorship is not so strict now as it was a few months ago, and we, are beginning to learn a little of the truth about the treatment of our lads on the transports. I propose to tell the House a little of the truth about the treatment of soldiers on transports returning from England. HithertoI have maintained silence for many reasons, but those reasons no longer exist now that the war is practically over. The honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) is to be congratulated on having brought this* matter up, apd also on the interest he took in it prior to the departure of the ship. He wired to the Acting Prime Minister drawing attention to the condition of the boat. The Acting Prime Minister replied immediately, but I think t h a t in one respect he was somewhat remiss. orable member were most serious, and although the vessel had at that time left Fremantle, the wireless might have been brought into operation to recall her. Why she should have been recalled it is unnecessary for me to explain. Without a moment's delay, I took every step that could be taken.

MrM c GRATH that the vessel could not be recalled by wireless. not say that, but they did say that reports did not justify such action being taken. worthiness of the vessel.

MrM c GRATH I returned from England was slow; but although she stopped eight days at Sierra Leone and four days at Cape Town, she completed the voyage in eight weeks and three days. If the Barambah took ten weeks and five days to reach England, there must have been something very seriously wrong with her. Then, again, the failure to provide medical comforts for the lads on board was due to negligence on this side, for which some one should be held responsible. The blame in this respect cannot be attached to the Navy authorities. Some one i h control of tlie military operations here was responsible for the departure of the vessel for England without the necessary supply'of medical comforts. There should be a most searching inquiry. It should not be an inquiry by military authorities into the actions of military men, but a searching investigation by The charges made by the honmembers of this House, or a body of outside men. It should be an inquiry quite distinct from the M i l i tary authorities. Like the honourable member for ' Dampier, I have been inundated with letters from the parents of lads on board the BarambahI t is unfair to say that. and the other vessel. They are anxious to obtain f u l l particulars as to what has happened. It is remarkable that the B ut the wireless names of the lads who died ou board have not yet teen published. The failure to I discussed that point disclose their names has caused much anxiety, and it is up to the Minister for No one could say Defence to see that the names are published at once, so that the feelings of the parents of the remaining lads may' be relieved. While we are having this inquiry"" we should go a little further. I haye here a They were quite sure of the seadeclaration signed by five blind soldiers who returned to Australia by the Llanstephan Gastle, by which I also returned.

MrM c GRATH I do not know. If fche honourable member ever puts on khaki he will quickly learn that when an order is given, there must be no question as to the authority for it . An order, even if given by only a lance-corporal, must at once be obeyed. Whatever one's feelings may be, there is no redress. There is no one to whom one may appeal as a friend. It is the duty of a soldier to obey, and if he disobeys an order, he knows what .the consequences will be.

Some one called out, "" He r e conies ' Stumpy,'--the y used to speak of these men in tliat way"" he is going to parade before the colonel."" The poor fellow had to crawl along to see the colonel, and he was followed by those of his fellow soldiers who had also suffered double amputations, and who were to attend as witnesses. The statement proceedsLater on, the Colonel eame up, and he sent us down to H deck, one deck higher up than E deck. The floor of the lavatory is always covered with water, so that when we go for a wash, or to the urinal, we have to go through the water on our knees. That also is true. These men had no artificial limbs, and with nothing more than bandages around their knees, where the amputations had been made, they had to crawl through the water on the lavatory floorThere are no chairs on this deck, and the only convenience for us men when we want some fresh air is to sit down on the damp deck. The food we receive is of very poor class. Numerous complaints have been made, but very little notice has been taken of the same. This statement is signed by Private James Hagan, Co. J . Hagan, C. Joseph, and W . McElwee. While these"" men had to submit to such conditions, I do not think the officers on board ever sat down, to a dinner without having the band to play for them. There was not a meal for which a menu was not printed. For breakfast they had oatmeal fried sole, frizzled bacon, buttered eggs, lambs' f r y , hot rolls, toast to order, preserves, tea, coffee, cocoa, f r u it . I was a warrant officer and had the same, so I had nothing to complain of. While the officers were enjoying that meal, the men had stew, not a third of which was eaten. Li'ttle satisfaction was obtainable from the orderly officers to whom complaints were made. And they had porridge in big thick lumps, half of which was eaten, no sugar, and no milk. For luncheon the officers had potage minestrone, brill rnariniere, jugged hare, chasseur, mashed potatoes, sardines, sirloin of beef, horseradish, collared head, galavance salad, compote of French plums, cheese, f r u it , and coffee. The men's luncheon consisted of soup, roast mutton, boiled potatoes with haricot beans, and prunes in a dish of rice. For the dinner or evening meal the officers had consomne cagliari, brill meuniere, noisettes of mutton, calmart, corned silverside of beef, carrots, boiled potatoes, turkey macedoine, pale York ham, bachelor pudding, cheese, dessert, coffee. The men for their evening meal got tea and bread and jam, and they could listen to the band far away. My time is nearly up, but I wish to say that there should be a committee appointed in Londonat once to deal with The conveniences there are very bad. the transport of returned soldiers. Brigadier-General Griffiths is here, and prior to his coming I said that he is one of the best, officers we ever hacf. He could be trusted to do all that is necessary for the' protection of the men. But it has to be said that he is only one man, and could not attend to everything. Hecould not attend to every boat,' and see that it was supplied with everything necessary for the men. He had to trust to officers, but he trusted men whom I would not trust a yard. One man trusted was StaffCaptain Perrin, who has never heard a shot fired. He went abroad, and was placed in a comfortable j o b ; but I say that all these positions of responsibility should be filled by men who have been with cur boys in the danger zone. Such men would be sympathetic, and would take'good' care that our lads should have fair treatments -There 'wil l be thousands of men coming home shortly,"" and they should not be trusted to the military authorities. Their lives are very precious porridge, to us, and they should be cared for. In the case of those who have died on the battlefield, their parents and relatives have the consolation of knowing that they died in the fight serving their country. No other lives must be lost if possible. The condition of affairs on the Barambah was criminal, and it is hard to think that fortv lads, the flower of the land, should have lost their lives as the result of the negligence of officials. I hope that there will be a searching inquiry into this case, and that prompt action will be taken in London to see that there can be no repetition of such a state of affairs in the case of transports returning with our soldiers. This is a very painful debate, but as much good may come of it , I am satisfied that honourable members will not regret it for one n oment. So far as the statements made by the honourable memspect to the vessel by which he returned are concerned, I sincerely trust that even new, so long after the event, the Government^will take the most stringent steps to see that the men who were responsible for what the honourable member has related shall be found, and shall be brought to book. So far as the Barambah is concerned, I have seen the statements which have appeared in the press, and the reply of the Government to them. Even when one is suspicious of Government reports, as honourable' members on both sides know I am, it is always fair to take the Government reply into account, as well as the charge. If the statements appearing in the. press as to the filthy condition of the Barambah 'when leaving Australia are true, they justify the hanging of some one responsible for it . The press reports -have led me to believe that the ship did not become plague-ridden u n t i l she had been a week or two in the South Atlantic Ocean; and so far as my recollection of the press reports w ill guide.me, the shortage of medical equipment was not experienced until after the vessel had become plague-ridden in the SouthA t lantic. Now, a ship might possibly leave Australia as clean as health conditions would require, and with sufficient medical comforts; but if she became a hell on the waters, as a ship under an epidemic would become, the morale of the ship's company would disappear, and she might well fall into the dirty condition described, and medical stores provided to meet normal requirements would completely disappear. ordinary ship, extra medical stores are provided for transports. they are not. be. is quite possible that it was the unforeseen plague that brought about that hell on the waters which the Barambah became. has been brought up in this House in order that such a condition of affairs may never be repeated in connection with the transport of Australian troops. Honourable members have an instance of what may occtir before their eyes today. I blame for the carelessness evident in this case not so much the menwho were in charge of the ship, and who were responsible only for carrying out the regulations in connection with ports of call, but Head-quarters here in Melbourne for not having been more closely in touch with our health authorities to discover what ports might be safely touched at. We recently sent away a large number of Australian reinforcements in the Medic. That ship went to New Zealand. By some gross criminal negligence on the part of the Department here no warning was given to that ship that the men should not be allowed to land in New Zealand. They did land,, with the result that tlie Medic is now lying at the Quarantine Stationi n Sydney, and good Australian lives have been lost as the result of that official negligence. The Barambah should not have been permitted to land men at Durban or Capetown, or wherever they were landed in SouthA f r i c a . Whatever the truth may be as to the condition of the vessel when she l e f t Fremantle, and I am inclined to place as much reliance on the opinion of two such boys as the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) has described as upon that of the officials, the facts appear to be that the epidemic developed on the ship after her men had been allowed to land in SouthA f r i c a . I trust that the Government will take this circumstance into account, and will ask why men were refused the privilege of landing in Perth, in healthy Australia, and were afterwards permitted to land in pest-ridden. South Africa? ber know that the men were allowed to I am not saying that land at Durban1 I am only pointing out that it were. but I am not sure.

I do not know the 1 circumstances regarding the outbreak on the Barambah, but I do know of other cases in which men have gone ashore in Honourable members on both spite of instructions, and that may have occurred at South Africa. The information which has been placed before me with regard to this matter is as follows:On the 10th September the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) telegraphed I am not now dealing with from Perth that he believed, from trustworthy It seems obinformation, that a steamer, then in the West, with troops, was not in a fit condition to proceed to sea, and he demanded an inspection before the vessel proceeded on her voyage. The These germs are not floatmatter was at once referred to the Navy and Defence Departments. The 'former replied that Mr Gregory's statement was not understood, Whether as the Naval Transport Officer, Melbourne, reported that the vessel was inspected both at Sydney and at Melbourne prior to departure, by Naval and Military embarkation officers, and that the accommodationfor troops was considered to be very satisfactory. The vessel had made five previous voyages, carrying troops as well as invalids, and no adverse reports had been received. It was stated fchat That is a matter a telegraim was received on the 8th September, intimating that the vessel would require twent3 -four hours for engine-room repairs, but r there was no indication that these were of other than ordinary nature which might occur on board any vessel. The vessel sailed on Oth September, before receipt of Mr Gregory's telegram', and Mr Gregory was advised accordingly. On the l l t h September the Navy Department I think that an inquiry should intimated that the District Naval Officer, Fremantle, reported that tliere was nothing known there of the vessel not being in a fit condition when she was granted clearance and sailing orders. The transport officer, master, and officer commanding troops had made no comby the honourable plaint against the vessel or otherwise. The Defence Department also acted promptly in the matter by instructing the Military Commandant at Perth to take, in conjunction with the Naval authorities, such steps as might be necessary, but tlie Commandant replied that the vessel had left before the receipt of these instructions, and that no complaints were received by the Military embarkation officers. Mr Gregory followed up his telegram by a letter (18th September, 1018) stating that he In regard to had learned from most reliable sources that when the vessel, with 1,100 troops on board, was proceeding from Melbourne to Western Australia, the machinery broke down on three or four occasions-onc e in the day-time and twice or three fimes during the night-and that the boat was drifting while repairs were being effected ; that the general conditions of the boat were vile; that the rate of speed was S knots",31,Adjournment Formal Tboopship Barambah

63,Mr Poynton (Grey,"Assistant M i nor less per hour; and that the repairs effected in Western Australia were of a temporary nature. Mr Gregory strongly urged that when the vessel reached Durban, before there was any possibility of getting into the danger zone, a ' thorough examination of its machinery should be made, and an assurance given that it was in first class order before it was allowed to proceed. On the 18th September, Admiral Clarkson reported that he had ascertained that after the Barambah left Melbourne the pumps supplying the latrines with water broke down, thus necessitating a temporary flushing of the latrines w i th hand buckets. Necessary repairs were, however, effected before the steamer sailed from Fremantle. Admiral Clarkson, a few days later, reported that the average speed of Si knots an hour was mado by the vessel, which was not unusual in the winter against a head wind and sea for a vessel which usually averaged 10 to 10i knots. The distance run for the first twenty-four hours after leaving Melbourne would probably have been below the average, due to the condition of the firemen on leaving. The Admiral said that a cable was being despatched to the next port of call, requesting that a report be obtained of working of the steamer's engines on the voyage, and that if necessary, a survey of the engines would be carried out, but that so far as could be ascertained,' the trouble referred to on the voyage from Melbourne to Fremantle was confined to the breaking down of the sanitary pump, which could not be regarded as a serious or unusual occurrence. On the 30th' September the District Naval Oflicer, Durban, cabled that the master had reported that the condition of the engines on the voyage had been satisfactory; that a defective eccentric strap had been made good on the voyage, and that no further trouble had been experienced. cable, Admiral Clarkson remarked that the vessel had made an excellent voyage from Melbonrne to Durban in point of time, and in view of the District Naval Officer's report, there seemed to be no grounds for the original report made that the vessel was unseaworthy. These additional facts were also brought under the notice of Mr Gregory, who replied, that the class of pump with which the vessel was fitted must have been something novel, "" new and out of the ordinary,"" when the fact of its getting out of order necessitated the stoppage of the ship in raid-ocean. on mote than one occasion, and also necessitated delay at Fremantle for repairs. He added that, should anything occur to the vessel when in -the danger zone he would hold himself free to take such action as he should consider essential to protect the lives of those on board. The records show that the Barambah has made five trips from Australia with troops. Eor her fourth trip, in June, 1916, she was fitted for troops, and embarked from Sydney on the 23rd June, Mr Poynton. and Melbourne on 27th June, 27 officers, 52 sergeants and 1,180 other ranks. The voyage report by the officer commanding troops stated that the ship was overcrowded. The vessel returned to Australia ih June,-1917, with invalids, carrying a total of 17 officers and 956 other ranks. The voyage report statedTroops' decks are excellent in their special accommodation, ventilation, and natural lighting. Ample supply of fresh water. Voyage throughout has been satisfactory. Conduct of the men on the voyage excellent, and health all that could be desired. On her fifth trip from Australia, which is the voyage under comment, she embarked at Melbourne, on 31st August, 1918, 26 officers, 62 sergeants, and 857 other ranks, and I draw attention to the comparative numbers of men carried on the two preceding voyages. The particulars of accommodation provided on the fifth voyage are as follows:-Troop deck space for 1,126; number allotted, 919; hospital accommodation, 32 cots; regulation allowance, 32; wash places, 49 basins; regulation allowance,' 38; showers, 21; regulation allowance, 4; latrines, 38 seats; regulation allowance, 26. I have, in connection with the matter(1) A report of naval transport officer, Sydney, dated 23rd November, 1918, showing the careful examination which was given to this troopship in August last at Sydney.

The scuppers were ""examined and .cleared, and there should have been no trouble-in keeping this ship's troop-decks clean. The upper deck was sheathed with open plonking'to facilitate washing out. It was well cleared of obstructions, and there was ample exercising space, seeing that the ship carried a reduced number to her ordinary complement of 1,250. Washing places and latrines were fitted for the carriage of l,200-meiij these were thoroughly overhauled and tested, and were found satisfactory. The main hospital and isolation hospital were fitted with all necessary requirements, and, in addition, an inhaling room was fitted in this ship; also extra sterilizers and percolaters. There was sleeping accommodation for 893, and messing accommodation for 1,000. At the preliminary inspection here, before sailing for Queensland, the ship was thoroughly cleaned and everything found working satisfactorily. The chief officer, chief engineer, and chief steward, expressed their satisfaction. This vessel arrived m Sydney on 6th August, and sailed for Queensland on the 10th August, 1918. I have here the usual report of the final inspection before sailing of this steamer, and while it seems unnecessary to detail all the. questions and answers which are embodied in it , I may say that they relate to arms, sea kits, and accoutrements, helmets, hammock and bedding, messes, precaution against fire, baggage, regimental stores, camp equipment, latrines, &c. port signed? that. which is set apart for remarks by the Board, I find the following: Very satisfactory. Melbourne, 31st August, 1918. The report is signed by C. R . Brewis, Naval Inspecting Officer; A . E . Greig, Military Inspecting Officer, and M . Sturdee, Military Medical Officer. Prom that report it would appear that everything which could be done to insure proper conditions being observed.on the Barambah was done. regret the eagerness of some honourable members to cast reflections upon officers who are not here to defend themselves. ter's time has expired. Extension of time granted. believe that these officers would deliberately fake statements, or do any of the many tilings which have been hinted at by one honourable member to-day. Upon the whole, I can say that the officers with whom I come into contact, exhibit quite as much interest in the preservation of the lives of our troops as do those honourable members who are so fond of reflecting upon them. It is quite possible that the statements published in the London newspapers regarding this ship relate to what occurred on board after she l e f t Durban. Whether the troops were allowed to land at that port I cannot say. But an. outbreak of sickness occurred subsequently, and in view of the large number of men who were affected by it , there may have been a considerable amount of neglect of the cleanly conditions which are ordinarily observed on board such vessels. Nothing is farther from my mind than to countenance treatment such as it is alleged was meted out to the men on these transports, and I am sure that nothing is farther from the mind of Admiral Clarkson. that.

I only returned from Adelaide to-day, so that I have not yet had an opportunity of finalizing how the inquiry should be conducted, or who shall undertake it. But I shall certainly have an inquiry made into the matter. am very glad that the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) has seen fit to bring this matter before the House, because I am convinced that the question of the control of our transports is one whicli urgently calls for investigation. There have been many incidents on board our transports proceeding overseas or reburning to Australia which reflect great discredit upon whoever is responsible for them. Some persons ought certainly to be punished for what has occurred. If an investigation into these cases results in the punishment of those who are responsible for then:, it may improve the conditions which will govern the return to Australia of the 180,000 of our men who are still abroad. In this connection I would like to direct attention . to a couple of instances of which I have personal knowledge-on e relating to the time when I was returning to Australia, and the other to the period during which I was on active service as a soldier. Upon the vessel by which I returned home as an invalid there were over 800 non-commissioned officers and privates, in addition to six officers and one Young Men's Christian Association secretary. cargo tramp, which had only one deck. That was the boat-deck. There were two well-decks, all lumbered up with various odds and ends, and not having a total of 30 square yards of space in either of them"". The 800 non-commissioned officers and men had the run of the two welldecks, with a total of less than 20 square yards, in which to exercise themselves; while the six officers, and the Young Men's Christian Association secretary, who had never done a bit in the war, had the whole of the boat-deck to themselves on which to play their deck quoits. I cannot remember which particular transport that was, hut the date of its arrival at Fremantle was 9 th July last year, and its name, therefore, should be traceable. That boat, apart from the condition I have just described, was fairly good. The food was reasonably good, except that the staff, on board was totally inadequate, and the invalids who were being sent back to Australia because they .. were physically unfit for further service, were forced to haul the food up for themselves from the .holds. Sides of beefhuge pieces of meat-ha d to be drawn up by means of cranes. I might add that the men were bribed with a little issue of rum to do this. The other boat to which I have referred, and with which I was concerned while classed as an active soldier, possessed the most disgraceful set of conditions I have ever come across. We were on hoard this vessel while travelling from Egypt to Lemnos, on our way to Gallipoli. We were three days and nights on board. The ship was filthy and verminous. There had apparently been no inspection. There were' a number of live cattle for the use of natives, who insist upon killing their own meat. . These animals were on a deck above the men, and the filth filtered through, to a certain extent, to the deck below, where the troops were. As a result, many of the men slept in empty cattle-pens, amongst the cattle themselves, since those places were cleaner than our own deck. The pipes of the latrines were all blocked, so that all the refuse was flowing about the scuppers of the boat. Food was practiThe vessel was an oldo cally non-existent during the three days and nights. Between each section of men in the different companies there was issued one 7-lb. tin of bully beef-come d beef. That was the only issue of food to each section. There was not even the old, hard Army biscuits. Matters became so bad that the troops were practically in a state of mutiny. Fortunately, the vessel ran into Lemnos Harbor,"" where we were able to secure more provisions. those transports across the Mediterranean?

We did not see them put on, nor did we know who put them on board. I am not aware of the name of the transport, but she left Alexandria about the 1st October, 1915; and it should be possible, therefore, to trace it also. Those are two incidents which came under my personal observation, and they show that some one negleeted his duty with regard to the transport both of troops invalided home and of troops on that it is not because 'the Government here wish the men to be treated in that manner; it is simply because their servants-officer s overseas -ar e neglecting their duties. It is up to the Government, therefore, to see that the responsible parties shall be punished, so that, at any rate, the boys who are still to return shall not be treated in the same way. I am glad that an inquiry has been promised, and I only hope that it will lead to something. after many years of parliamentary experience I am inclined to be diffident in the matter of holding any hope. There is an argument which has again been used, and which is so hoary with age that I shall be glad to hear something different; that is, that men should not be attacked who are not present to defend themselves. I know, of course, that it Is not possible for them to be here; but, if there is a searching inquiry, men accused in Parliament may then give their evidence. On the other hand, however, is an honourable member to be prevented from exposing an infamy because he cannot get the party concerned in f r o n t of him in this Chamber? Now, if there is to be a little relaxation of the red tape "" powwow "" in regard to our soldiers and their affairs, we shall be hearing one hundredi o l d additions to the stories such as the returned soldier, the honourable member for Swan( Mr Corboy), has just mentioned. I know that; but was it When I exposed and proved to the h i l t the fact that that man Angliss forwarded diseased meat to the soldiers I cannot give that in who were going to the Front, what was done? Did the Government punish him ? D i d they cancel his contract ? Not a b it of it . When another man was exposed for selling diseased lice, w i th weevils ini t , and! a member of that same firm had the condensed cheek to come down to the Court and give evidence to the effect that it was not bad as food for the people, and that the weevils could be removed from the rice, what did the Government do ? What have they done ? I understand they have appointed a member of that same firm to active service. I feel confident one of their various Commissions. Possibly, he will get £ 3 0 a week for his services upon that Commission. fined three times before the Courts, and finally the magistrates spoke very strongly against him. Yet, one member of that same firm told the Court that he did not think weevils made rice unfit for human food. That is the same individual whom the Government ""have regarded as a fit and proper person to hold office upon some one of the Government Commissions. is getting any salary. at any rate. We do not want any of those l i p patriots to be making another pile of money out of the war, in addition to their fortunes from the ordinary conduct of their business. How different are they from that American multi-millionaire, Ford, who, for one dollar a year, is not only giving to the United States Government the advantage of his intellect^ but has handed over his factories also to the making of things for his country, free of cost. I proved that matter of diseased meat in the case of Angliss. 1 proved that that man was sending down that vile stuff to our transports.

As for Board pf Trade regulations, if ever there was a farce in its relation to the welfare of . immigrants travelling in the steerage of vessels, it is those regulations. I have brought immigrants out to Australia on three separate occasions. I was told to examine their arms to see if there were vaccination marks upon them. They might be rotten with phthisis; they might be dying of consumption; they might have tubercular joints everywhere, but I had to pass them if their arms showed the vaccination marks. the passengers on the first of those ships, when it arrived in Western Australia, five died w it h in some weeks of being landed. X knew that the sentence of death was placed on them, ibut I could not refuse them. All I had to ask was what the Board of Trade stipulated. I was not permitted to go outside of their instructions. ' "" I was required by the Board to provide certain instruments, and actually had to go to the museum of our hospital and borrow them. These instruments had not been used in St. Mary's Hospital for over twenty years, but the Board of Trade insisted that they should be on the ship. WhatI did was to borrow them from the museum, show them to the officer, and then put them hack in thc museum. So much for the Board of Trade regulations. 1 honour the man who insisted upon the provision of more latrines and more baths. I had trouble once with my friend and leader ( Mr Tudor) over the bath accommodation at the quarantine in Sydney Harbor-fthe Dr. Moloney. hope that somebody w ill be in Australia. When I was quarantined there with the rest of the Pearling Commission through a case of small-pox occurring on the Japanese boat we were travelThese officials ling hy, a number of women were also landed from the steamer.

I hope to see the wide, and 11 in . deep. N'ot one man at the station carried out really antiseptic measures on this occasion, except the Japanese doctor from the steamer. All that prevents disease spreading from the station to the town of Manly is a galvanized iron fence eight or nine feet high. No medical man can say with certainty how f a r ' germs w ill carry in the air in a genial climate like that of New Seuth Wales. I would emphasize the fact that we.have a respite of a few days through the quarantine arrangements in dealing with the dread disease now hovering over Australia. The suggestion made in to day's paper with regard to the charge for doses of vaccine is an infamy. It appears that the 'authorities are manufacturing 500,000 doses a week and propose that a Of charge of 5s. per close shall be made at the Melbourne Hospital. The amount of money that has been spent on vacoination against small-pox runs into hundreds of thousands of pounds. The Acting Prime Minister( MrW a t t ) has fought more than one personal fight on that matter. I fines. ahle member's pluck. He w ill agree with me that more inoney has heen spent in that direction than can possibly be spent in combating this dread disease. I can. now ask him if the Government w ill supply the serum to treat the disease known as Spanish influenza free to private medical men in the same way as vaccine for small-pox is now supplied, on condition that the medical men charge only a nominal fee to the public for administering it-sa y 2s. 6d. or 5s. at the most. station ence is sitting on that and other matters biggest station now.",36,Adjournment Formal Tboopship Barambah

Mr ""WATT I do. ference is being held, hut it will.be an infamy if the press is not allowed to he present at its meetings. The press is the great means of publishing throughout Australia the remedial measures that can be taken. Placards have not yet been put in various places in the city showing the simple precautions that should be taken, and describing the symptoms. The first step for the patient to take is to rest in bed; then he should send for the doctor. If he cannot afford to pay for a doctor, he should be allowed to send for the Government doctor. I am assured by the Premier of Yictoria-and this was confirmed only to-day by Sir Alexander Peacock-that the State would co-operate with the Eederal Government in everything in this matter. Now is the time for us to organize. Let the request be made courteously over the Acting Prime Minister's signature to medical men throughout Australia to offer their services free, and volunteer to combine and organize to meet this disease. I am sure the request would meet with so successful a response that the Acting Prime Minister would never regret making it. Two parties are to blame for the men on board the transport mentioned being allowed to land in New Zealand, where the disease was prevalent. One is the Quarantine Department of New Zealand, which was to blame for letting the ship allow the men to land; and the other was the medical officer in charge of the transport, who let the men land, knowing that the disease was present in New Zealand in a most virulent form. of the doctors. General Fetherston, the head of the Medical Department, insisted on going ashore, and went ashore. quire into that allegation. Dr. Fetherston was the cause of bringing the contagion on board the ship, the blame should rest on his shoulders; and blame should also rest on the Prime Minister of New Zealand, if it is true that he ordered the ship to go right up to the wharf. If I were in New Zealand, and lost friends or blood relations through his action, I would publicly hold him up to the opprobrium of the people. I am loath to think that General Fetherston would do what is alleged against him; but, if he did it, let punishment fall on him. to him? quarantine law, and send him back to New Zealand. Dr.' MALONEY -Absolutely . If he carried the disease to a beloved member of the family of the honorahle member for Brisbane( Mr Finlayson), the honourable member would feel inclined to punish him even more severely. If he has been responsible for the deaths on board that transport of men who should be at the healthiest time of their life, punishment should certainly fall on him. The district of Auckland has lost over 1,000 lives through this disease. I know the Acting Prime Minister is sympathetic with me in this matter, but he has to carry on his shoulders such a large .amount of work connected with various Departments, that I sometimes feel I am doing wrong in pressing him so much. But I do not want any pause to occur in our preparations. Now is the time for us to put on a ful l head of steam. ties have done very well.

Pending completion of this plant, the Austral Nai l Company is drawing wires from these rods for the joint account of both parties in Melbourne, and the finished wires are sold for joint accoimt. The initia l difficulties in rolling wire -rods have not yet been overcome, and u n t i l the rods are of perfect and uniform quality, the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company is not prepared to place them on the market. Imperfect or unsuitable rods would give the company a bad name, and unti l the rods are perfect none w ill be sold. The BrokenH ill Proprietary Company has not sold any rods, but as soon as the initia l difficulties have been overcome, and a surplus over its own requirements is produced, rods w i ll be sold to all customers; and without auy preference. In order to bring this about, additions are being made to the rod-producing plant, and the machinery for these additions w ill be made locally. It is true that the AustralN a i l Company sold 750 tons of rods. These rods were not made by the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company, but rods that the Austral Nail Company imported for its own use, and were resold to Messrs.

144,Mr Finlayson (Brisbane) [ 5 . 3 ],"rate, inspired in most of our minds, a much keener dread of militarism than ever before. Whatever opposition we had to the establishment of a military system in Australia prior to the war, the very fact that we have taken such an active part in the war was due to our desire to crush, once and for all, not only in Australia, but in the world, that military system which is such a> perpetual threat to our civilian institutions. I quite recognise that the more strongly the system is entrenched in the community, the more seriously are the liberties of the people threatened. ThisB ill is another attempt, born out of war-time and war conditions, to rivet still closer the fetters of militarism on Australia. For myself, I have always been opposed to militarism; and it was because of my opposition »to militarism that I supported the attitude of Australia in regard to the war. ' But my opposition to militarism is stronger today than ever before. I am not prepared by any vote or voice of mine to give the military authorities a single ounce more of power or of opportunity than they now possess; but, on the contrary, I am disposed at all times to use my vote and influence to take from them even the opportunities for power they now possess. For these reasons I am opposed to the B ill . The Bill may have been necessary on the 25fch September, when it was introduced in the Senate, and it may even have been necessaiy on the 1st October; but I contend the conditions under which we are now who have spent their lives in preparing placed do not warrant these proposed themselves for military efficiency. Their amendments of the Defence. Act. times during the war the Defence ties have thought it necessary to have the the war as instructors or area officers.

Finlayson. oppose it , and sliall oppose it as effectively as possible at every step. May I briefly refer to one or two of the principles sought to be included in the Bill. First of all, there is the matter of making officers who have' been on active service senior to other officers of tlie Military Forces As a general rule that may appear to be perfectly correct. We are not yet allowed to give the facts publicly, but they are well known, and some day the public will learn some of them. Many members of the Forces, particularly officers, are parading about in decorated uniforms, and under false pretences to the extent that, although they claim certain recognition because they have been on service abroad, they never, really went to the war as such, never heard a shot fired, and took mighty * good care never to place themselves in danger. There are many such officers in Australia; and it is proposed, simply because they went abroad and gained certain decorations, in most cases because of social influence, and not because of any military merit, that these men' shall rank superior to men in this country who have obtained like rank. There are two points to which I desire to refer. I am opposed to the formation of the proposed reserve force. I am entirely opposed to the establishment of any permanent form of military system in Australia, and as I regard this proposal as an insidious attempt to perpetuate military despotism here, I when sent to this House am entirely and unalterably opposed to it . that I know a number of competent men Five profession has been that of arms, and authorithey were employed in Australia prior to I was their urgent desire, to get permission now proto go to the war, because it was thefr only I am not now their request was repeatedly refused by Australia, the Defence Department on tlie ground There are unfairly these men were being treated, and, in fact, the only advantage which they could hope to gain through following the profession of arms was being f closed to them because it was thought necessary to retain sufficient men here to train our Forces at home. I have always held that the interests of these men, who were not given reasonable recompense either in money or rank, ought to be protected, and while on the face of it it seems perfectly fair that men who have had service overseas should rank senior to those who have not been abroad, still the principle is open to objection in individual cases. There are cases in which men simply took charge of troopships from Australia fco Egypt and came back again. There is one man in Brisbane, a prominent member of the party supporting the Government, who did this. full-blown major, which rank he will'hold until he dies, and he .will have all the rights and privileges attaching to the position, and rank superior to men who have done active service abroad. who is not a supporter of the Government took charge of a troopship. other cases only makes the position worse. Take there any tiling more degrading to a military position than the manner in which military chaplaius parade themselves about ? I know chaplains who l e f t Australia in charge of troopships, went to Egypt, and in some cases England, and came back as colonels and lieutenant-' colonels. Although they have no right to use the titles, they parade themselves about as colonels and lieutenant-colonels,and rank senior to men who have done the work abroad, and deserve all the honour attaching to the promotions they have obtained by active service.

I know of no reason why members of Parliament should be exempted any more than any other memhers of the community. As a matter of fact, members of Parliament have accepted responsibilities in regard to this war, as many honourable members of military age have volunteered for service, but I can see no particular reason why members of this House should be exempted from military service if . it should become necessary to defend our country. In my opinion, the amendment to section 61 should cover the whole of the exemptions except paragraph a.

162,Mr Finlayson,"T h a t has beenis that which recasts section 75, and makes a new provision for a penalty to be imposed on any person who conceals or assists to conceal any person who js liable to enlist in the Defence Force. We know that in recent months there has been a good deal of concealment of Italians and others who were called upon to leave Australia and serve in foreign armies, for even though those armies belonged to our Allies, they were still, for all practical purposes, foreign so far as Australia is concerned. I have a good deal of sympathy with those people who refused to be compulsorily deported from Australia after having become Australian citizens and made their homes here. They were doing their best to make their lives comfortable and permanent in this country, but they were compelled to leave their families and businesses and go abroad to fight. Having regard to the fact that Australia twice refused to apply compulsion to its own citizens, it was reasonable that people of other than our own race should claim the protection of our laws. come naturalized ? naturalized were forcibly seized. wards released. of that. I am convinced that but for the noise which we on this side made in Parliament a lot more Italians would have been deported. Fortunately we received word soon enough to permit of us making an emphatic protest against the deportation of naturalized British subjects. But even unnaturalized ""persons had a claim to some protection. It may not have been their fault that they were not naturalized. to become naturalized. They had reasons of their own for not doing so. defend them, but I think they were entitled to consideration, especially as Australia rejected compulsion so f a r as its own citizens were concerned. We know that a good many Italians were concealed, and some are being concealed now. No t even to-day, when the war is practically over, are they being given an opportunity to carry on their businesses and assist in the development of _the country. This is proof to me that however necessary such a provision may have been under war conditions, it is quite superfluous to incorporate it in a B ill which is fixing permanently the conditions of our defence system. cealment is only provided in respect of those persons who are liable to enlist in our own Forces. Unnaturalized Italians would not be liable to serve in the Australian Forces. the honourable member can logically arrive at the conclusion that a person who is liable to he deported for service abroad would not be liable for service in Australia. A t any rate, if a state of war existed in Australia and the services of those people were demanded, as they legitimately would be, it would be quite easy to amend the Defence Act to meet their case, as during the last fou r years we have amended it to meet other cases. One matter to which I wish to' refer w it h special pleasure is the statement of the Minister that he does not propose to proceed w it h the clause which aims at giving the militar y authorities power to We have no proof impose the death penalty for murder. I am very pleased, indeed, to know that the Government so appreciate the altered circumstances that they are prepared to make that concession. But I suggest to the Minister that it would be advisable to go further, and deprive the m i l it a r y authorities of the power they now possess in regard to the death penalty. Section 28, which deals w it h the death penalty,-is altogether too wide. terfere w it h it now. that, because I am entirely opposed to the death penalty. In time of war, and even in time of peace to some extent,' certain offences, such as desertion, spying, and the carrying of secret messages to the enemy, are very serious; but I am so opposed on principle to the death penalty, that I am prepared not only to accept the offer of the Government to",49,Thomson Anothe R Man Which I Take Strong Exception Is That

173,Mr Mcgrath (Ballarat) [ 5 . 4 1 ],"Ias well if every sentence recorded against our lads at the Front could be reviewed. While at Le Havre, where we had an Australian Base, I saw gallant soldiers who had been at the landing at Gallipoli, who had come to France, had been up the line, and had come back wounded, but without a crime on their books, brought before officers who had never heard a shot -fired, and were not likely to hear one, and commence to go. Many brave men have -fined by them for some trivial offence. The lads might have been an hour or two late in returning to camp from Le Havre, and for such trivial offences they were ordered seven or ten days' confinement to barracks, or forfeiture of pay. A crime mark was also enteredi n their pay-books. I have heard many lads say, when such a record was made against them, that they -would never again fire a shot. They complained'that they had been forced to go to the Base to have a crime recorded in their pay-books a book which they -cherished as a souvenir of all that they had been through. W it h such a recordwritten, by the way, in red ink-the y -could not show their pay-books to their friends. If the Commanding Officer who tried them had seen service, he would ""have shown a little more leniency in dealing with them. From what I have seen abroad I am glad that the proposal to give officers power over life and death is to be withdrawn. I shall never forget the case tliat I heard mentioned in the House of Commons-the case of a soldier who had been wounded in five stunts, and who in his sixth stunt near Ypres dropped out because his nerves gave way. Because of this he was charged with cowardice, found guilty, and on the following day was shot. It was a common thing to see ten or twenty men shot at daybreak on an English order. twenty. mon occurrence. These orders are readily obtainable. It is because of these things t h a t I shall be more than ordinarily carea standing army here. The financial burf u l in extending tlie powers conferred on officers. tried these men were not fit to try any one-thei r nerves had gone. often they desired to do tlie right thing, but 'their nerves were so shattered that they were incapable of giviug a man animpartial trial. It is not always tlie coward who falls by the wayside. My experience is that every man is at his best in his first stunt. In the second stunt he is not so good, and in the third his nerves hesitated to face their second or third stunt. Because of what I heard and saw in France, I am uot prepared to give military officers further power. I would rather reduce tlie powers they have. I do not know that tlie Ministerial policy of creating the reserve force, for which this B ill provides, is a wise one. If it is going to savour of anything in the nature of a standing army, I shall oppose it . Germany has broken down the military spirit, and so have Austria and Russia. Those countries have removed the loads from their back, and will have a great advantage over the nations that adhere to the military system. They have done with conscription, and France and Great Britain will have to follow suit. We in Australia should not overburden ourselves w it h a military class, and we should be very careful in proposing to create reserve forces. I recognise fchat Australia will need a proper defence system, but it has been demonstrated at Gallipoli and in Flanders that it does not take years to train a soldier. W h a t we need to do is fco perfect our artillery, to improve our wireless system, and our flying corps, and to provide for a sufficient number of submarines and destroyers. If the Defence Department confines itself to these activities nothing more will be necessary for the defence of the Commonwealth. I do not think we shall need to build many big Dreadnoughts. The tornot ten or pedo destroyers and submarines have demonstrated their worth in tlie war through which we have just passed. In no circumstances should we create den we shall have to bear will be big enough without adding to it in that way. The war is not yet over from the standpoint of what it is going to cost us.

MrM c GRATH is not what it was when this B ill was passed by another place. There are some clauses of the B ill w it h ' which I am in f u l l accord. Most of them are in fhe direction of liberalizing the DefenceA c t ; but there are some which w ill require a very f u l l explanation to secure their acceptance. I shall want to know a good' deal more about the reasons for clause 2, for instance, before I vote for it. offioer who has held the rank of colonel while at the Eront w ill be permitted to retain that rank when he comes back and joins this Reserve Force. W it h that I am quite in agreement, but we shall have to go a good deal further, and deal with the position of members of the Permanent Forces who volunteered. The honourable member for Brisbane( Mr Finlayson) spoke of instructors in the Permanent Forces who could not get away; but the fact is that a number of them did not wish to go to the Front. Some went away as sergeants-major, while others waited in the hope of obtaining a commission before they went to the Front. ' The honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney), in reply to a statement. I made the other day, said that M a j or Mclnerney could not go to the Front. There was nothing to prevent any man going to the Front as a private. trouble was that many would not volunteer for active service unless they couldi secure a commission. The sergeantsmajor to whom I have referred volunteered, risked everything, and in many cases speedily obtained'promotion. Some of them were promoted to the rank of lieutenants, others secured a captaincy, and still others became majors in the A u s tralian Imperial Force. On their return to Australia, however, as members of the Permanent Forces here, they w ill revert to their former rank, and w ill have to serve under others who did not volunteer. Why do not the Government propose to remedy that state of affairs? Brigadier-General Griffiths, for instance, went away as a warrant officer. He is in Australia jiist now, but is, I understand, fco return to England. If he remained here he would have to revert to his old The position to-day position as a warrant officer in the Permanent Forces. TheB ill , as ' it stands, makes no provision for recognition of the work done by these men abroad. They will have to serve under quite a number of officers who are to be seen strutting about Melbourne wearing uniform and stars, and taking all the glory of winning the war, although they have never been to the Front. When the news of the signing of the armistice came through, I wast I take it to mean that an in the company of a major, who, perhaps, might have desired to go to the war, b u t , at all events, did not. Every one was greatly excited, and while he and I were in the city a lady rushed up and embraced him as a man who had been to the Front and had done his duty. He acoepfced both the embrace and the congratulations just as if he had been on active service. We are making a mistake in allowing those engaged in an administrative capacity to wear uniform. They should wear civilian attire, just as officers in the Lands Department do, and senior men, instead of securing military rank, should receive increased pay, just as senior officer? in other Departments are treated. Ifc almost makes one lose one's temper to see these administrative officers strutting about as if they were the saviours of their country.

The Government should also consider the advisableness of so amending the B ill as to provide that all members of the Permanent Forces who have been to the Front should be allowed, ou their return to Australia, to retain the rank they gained while on active service. If it is right that ordinary citizens who went to the Front as privates, and gained commissions abroad, should be allowed to retain their f u l l rank when they return, the same privilege should be extended to men in the Permanent Forces who volunteered while others stayed at home, doing administrative work no doubt, but not risking their lives. secures promotion abroad not entitled to retain his rank on his return ?

Charles McGrath, a man like experience gained in the field. Men who have gained commissions on the battlefield . should certainly retain their rank when they return. I took up the case of some of my constituents, who, after securing commissioned rank at the Front, when they came back had to resume their former rank of sergeant-major. I fought the question of their retention of their commissioned rank with tlie Department, and the concession I secured for them was that they are permitted to have the honorary rank of lieutenant with the pay of a sergeant-major. That is the return of a grateful country for what those men went through. The Asistant Minister for Defence( Mr Wise) will know that my statement is correct, and that men on their return to Australia, though promoted at the Front, revert to their original rank. to which the honourable member now refers is being considered at the present time by the Minister for Defence. MrM c GRATH I am glad to hear that, and I hope that before this B ill is passed,' that consideration will have reached 'finality, and some amendment will be proposed to remedy the anomaly to which I have called attention.

I wore the Sam Browne, and looked like a commissioned officer without the stars. When I returned from the Front to London, and convalescents came into' Horseferry-road, it was my duty to take them to the Waterloo Station, and see that they were safely entrained for Weymouth, LarkH ill , or some other Australian \ camp. When I ""would be leading a hundred of our soldiers through the streets of London we would often be passed by a company of English soldiers led by a corporal.

He would come up behind you and give you a salute. troons through London, if I met English troops I was always careful to look straight ahead, because I knew what was going to happen. I knew that as soon as the corporal in charge of the English troops caught sight of the Sam Browue, he would say, ""Eyes right,"" and give me the salute. As a sergeant-major it was a military crime for me to return that salute, and so I was placed in a most awkward position, as I naturally did not .like to appear to ignore tbe salute. Very often when walking in the streets of London, if I saw a company of English soldiers coming in the other direction, I got busy looking into the nearest shop window, because ninety-nine times out of one hundred, if the corporal in charge of the men saw my Sam Browne, he would call out, ""Eyes r i g h t "" or ""Eyesl e f t , "" and he and the whole of his menwould give me the salute. compelled' to salute a nonsalute if the officer -returns it ?

In that case, the Defence Department recognised that his services were equal to those of any man who had But the deletion of the been on active service, and granted a pension to his mother.

Now, the term "" Act i v e Military Forces"" in the principal Act has a special definition. It includes ' ' All parts of the Defence Forces other than the Reserve Forces."" But the point I wish to stress is that section 20 should he amended so as to make ih read, "" But officers of the Australian Imperial Forces shall rank as senior in their respective ranks to officers of the Active or Reserve Military Forces."" tlie Australian Imperial Force have not seen service abroad. Sir EOBERTBEST I know that the Acting Minister for Defence( Mr Wise) thinks it is undesirable to rigidly lay down the principle for which I am contending, in an A ct of Parliament, on account of the difficulties and anomalies which may thereby be created. In order to overcome such anomalies, I would suggest the insertion of the words, ""except in those cases which are provided for by regulation, or which may be prescribed."" is a good one, it should be applied uniformly. Sir ROBE RT BEST -Undoubtedly . Bnt exceptional cases w ill doubtless arise. If honourable members are*desirous of laying down as a fundamental principle that officers of the Australian Imperial Force who have been engaged on active service abroad sliall have seniority over other officers of the ActiveM i l it a r y Forces or the Eeserve Forces, let us clearly specify it in the B ill . Then, in order to meet the Acting Minister's objection, it may be jgossible to throw upon him the responsibility of making exceptions where he deems it desirable to do so. tentions clearly in this B ill . see that done. Instead of deleting the words proposed in this clause, we should substitute for the-words, "" Act i v e M i l i tary Forces,"" in section 20 of the principal Act , the words, "" Officers of tlie Australian Imperial Force who have been engaged on active service abroad."" Silting -iiifprnded from 6.30 to 7.£5 p.m. that the Committee desires to affirm, as a matter of principle, that officers . of the Australian Imperial Force who have served abroad should enjoy seniority over officers of corresponding rank in the active military service nnd the reserve service at home. I suggest that the Minister( Mr Wise) accept that as a principle. If he will do so, and the Committee desires that this substantive principle should be laid down, I shall propose an amendment. I am quite prepared to believe that the' Government desire and intend to give seniority to those officers who. have seen active service abroad. They propose to do it in an elastic way, in all probability by regulation. But the Committee desires to go further and set it for t h in the B ill that that shall be the exact case. Practical experience should go further and should give higher qualifications than oan be possessed by men who have merely had home training. I move That all the words after the word "".words "" be omitted and that the following be inserted in place thereof "" 'Active Military Forces' and .by substituting for the words so omitted the words 'Australian Imperial Forces who have been engaged on Active Service abroad' au'd by inserting before the word ' Reserve the ; words "" Active Military Forces and the ' "" . The amendment, so f a r as I have got it , w ill not effect the honourable member's purpose.

We cannot get over that difficulty without this amendment, which, if carried, w ill give the Minister power to prescribe that they shall be senior. That shows the Committee what the Minister's policy in administering the Act w ill be. I do not see how the amendment of the honorahle member for Kooyong( SirT h a t is so.

I admit that there may be a technical difficulty in getting a proper definition. Le Havre, where our Australian Camp is, is as safe as this place. I never heard of it being bombed, and those there ran practically no risk. There were officers there who had never left Le Havre.

255,Mr Finlayson (Brisbane) [S.34],"This is based on the recognition of the principle that citizenship responsibilities shall carry citizenship privileges. That is a principle from which there is no escape. This war has shown that, while Australians are, perhaps, better developed at eighteen years of age than youths of Other nations, it is an unfair tax on their physical endurance to compel youths at this age to undergo military service. In fact, most of the troubles commanders have encountered have heen due to the physical inability of men to carry through an extended campaign. Therefore, it is reasonable to relieve men under twenty-one years of age until the final'necessity may call for their services. The amendment will not prevent men under twenty-one years of age from volunteering for service, arid from being accepted. It will simply prohibit the Defence authorities from calling them up. 'Some of the nations during the recent war found it the safer course to call up men over the military age rather than the youths, and only feil back on their undeveloped manhood in the last extremity of the depletion of their man power. The Government have strenuously resisted every suggestion that the age of citizenship should be identical with the military service age. ment. The Electoral Bill which passed through the other day included a provision extending the franchise to members of the Australian Imperial Force. the Minister has admitted that at last the Government have accepted the principle. It was the fourth attempt I had made to have it accepted. I endeavoured to have a similar provision included in the Bill that gave votes to our ""soldiers overseas. I endeavoured to do the same in regard to both Referendum Bills, and it was only because honourable members on both sides of the House saw the reasonableness of my request during the consideration of the Electoral Bill that the principle was accepted hy the Government, and included in that measure. We ought now to take the other step which is the logical deduction of the acceptance of the principle, and say that the conferring of the franchise confers also a status in regard to military service, and that the two things are parallel. will know that when they are called upon for military service they are entitled to citizen rights. strong reinforcement to any appeal for the services of men under twenty-one years of age, that by offering their services they would secure the privileges of citizenship otherwise denied to them. amendment. amendment is that men under the age at which they are acknowledged to be worthy of being given the privileges of citizenship are free to volunteer for military service, but are not liable to he called up.

The proposal in the Bill is that the Government should be enabled to call up part of a class instead of the whole of it, thus enabling men from twenty-one years of age to thirty-five years of age to be called up, instead of all men from eighteen years to thirty-five years of age.

Clause5 (Training of Cadets). the past the position in regard to naval defence has been essentially different from that governing military service in one important particular, namely, that although the Defence Act provides that there shall be no compulsory military service without Australia, that provision, which was doubtless intended to cover also naval service, does not do so, and we have had more than one example during the recent war of mere boys who, as cadets, had been subject necessarily to naval training, finding themselves at the outbreak of war conscripted for active service abroad. I need hardly say that I offer my strongest opposition to compulsory service overseas, but I think the Committee generally should at least . . . . .

273,Mr Wise (Gippsland,"Assistant MinI f the Assistant Minister for Defence( Mr Wise) had not heen trained as a lawyer, I do not think he would have attempted to sway us by an argument such as he has just used. He has said that no Parliament has yet agreed to punish offences solely by imprisonment I would reiniud him that it is only within the last twenty years that Democracy has ruled in any Parliament. I have tried for over a quarter of a century to provide for only one form of punishment in our penal laws. It is an infamy that wealthy men should be able to escape the consequence of their wrongdoing merely by the payment of a fine. As to the disgrace being in the conviction, and not in"" the result of the conviction, I would remind the Minister that if a man is fined for an offence he can never be called a gaol-bird; the taint of imprisonment will not be upon him.. Such an argument on the part of an educated man like the honourable gentleman is somewhat surprising. .1 shall press this question to a division. Some time ago two men induced the landlord of an hotel to enter a room, and, having got him there, thrashed him severely. The magistrates before whom sentenced them to seven days' imprisonment. They offered to pay a fine of £1,000 rather than go to gaol for a week, but the police magistrate remained firm. It is not fair that a. man with means should be able to commit an offence of this kind and escape on payment of a fine, while a man without means must go to gaol. At one time wealthy men in France could avoid military service by payment of a certain amount, but in advanced countries all men in this respect are now equal. Meunier, of the great French chocolate manufacturers, had to put in his period' of compulsory training. A magistrate recently criticised very severely a wealthy man in this community who was charged with selling rice in which there were weevils. In connection with that case, one man had the audapity to go into the witness-box and say that such rice was not unfit for human consumption. The offender was fined for the third time. Tf the magistrate had been able to send him to prison for a week, the punishment would have been more effective than any fine could he. If the Government insist upon passing the clause as it stands, I shall brand them as -being prepared to punish the man without means by sending him to gaol, and to alloAV the wealthy to escape on payment of a fine. shall vote against the Government proposal, since I am not in favour of gaoling any one who, for conscientious reasons, objects to undertake military service or to undergo military training. v While I was working on the Barrier, I saw mere lads arrested by the military ' authorities for failing to comply with the compulsory service provisions of the Defence Act. I saw young lads go to gaol rather than he false to tbe principles which had been inculcated in them by their parents. A few months ago one of them, a lad named Yeo, whose parents had trained liim in the belief that to shed blood or to undergo training to fit him for such a purpose was wrong, was sent down to Fort Largs, in South Australia, for refusing to train. Lads reared in the the offenders were tried religious belief of the Society of Friends are compelled to choose between adherence to their religious principles *or go into the camp at Fort Largs, or,previous to the establishment of that camp, to the Broken Hill gaol. Some of the lads have been imprisoned because of their conscientious religious objection to compulsory military service. There are others in this community whose objection to compulsory ser^ vice, though not based on religious grounds, is as conscientious and sincere as if it were. I will not at any time support the persecution, for it is nothing else, of lads who object to compulsory military service on the ground that it is against the training they have had from childhood, and war is, in their opinion, inimical to the interests of the human race. The proposal to provide for an. alternative of a fine will merely have the effect of permitting the children of parents possessed of wealth to escape military service.

The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) mentioned that when the proclamation was issued calling up the young men of this country a large number of those who refused to obey the call were prosecuted.

There is neither justice nor common sense in the proposal. agree heartily w i th the argument put forward hy the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) in regard to the pecuniary penalty and the opportunity afforded by it, as a general principle, to rich persons to evade punishment which only too frequently falls to the lot of those not so well circumstanced.

He has made it abundantly clear to me that he does not believe in military service for the protection of Australia. T can quite understand, therefore, his efforts at every opportunity to defeat the splendid system which has been forced upon us by our desire to retain possession of this country.

Because he regards it as a necessary precaution for the protection of his home. Yet he w ill countenance no measures which make for the effective defence of this great Commonwealth. He says, in effect, "" Immediately an enemy conies to our shores, the other fellow must defend it. I w ill get away into the hills."" cannot understand his contention that we should gaol a man who has the misfortune to break the law-that we should associate h i m with the worse criminals we have in Australia., Why should we do this? Simply because, if a. fine be imposed, the rich offender . w ill be able to pay it . But there may he poor men who w ill be quite able to pay it , too.

When members opposite, like the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney), advocate the treating of all offenders alike by the abolition of monetary penalties, one is surprised at their action in passing into law sueh measures as the Land Tax Assessment Act, which was passed when the old Labour party was in power, and which provides for the imposition of fines of various amounts on wealthy landowners who may break the law. Hitherto no one has taken exception to having an alternative to imprisonment, and throughout the Defence Act, except in the three sections now under consideration, such an alternative is provided for. The provisions of the Defence Act were passed with the consent of the Labour party. Minister would not willingly injure me, and I hope that he will accept my statement, that for the'past twenty-five years I have endeavoured to eliminate monetary penalties. honourable member's statement. I was dealing, not with what happens at the meetings of the party, but with the honourable member's actions in this Chamber. the Defence Act was passed, no monetary penalty was provided for the offences now under consideration, Parliament being of the opinion that every man in the country, rich or poor, should be treated alike. What do rich men do when there are monetary penalties for legal offences? Conscientious objectors to vaccination pay the fines provided for by law rather than obey the law. We were determined that wealthy men should not . exempt them'selves from military service by the payment of fines. pressed by the honorahle member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney), hut I cannot endorse the insult put upon the magistracy of Australia by the Leader of the Opposiliterally, seem to mean that rich men will bribe the magistrates to make their punishment different from that of poor men. The clause,. however, provides alternative penalties for the magistrates to apply at their discretion. The difficulty which arises under the proposal of the Ministry is that similarity of treatment by magistrates cannot be guaranteed, and I , therefore, am inclined to think that they would be wise to reconsider it. I would not embarrass them in regard to it if -they feel that it is important, because I am not in a position to know how the operation of the Act has been affected by the absence of a provision for a monetary penalty in these cases. There is the possibility, when only imprisonment is provided for, that a magistrate who wishes to impose a light penalty, may award a term of imprisonment so nominal as to amount to practically no punishment at all. Thus, honourable gentlemen opposite, while desirous of applying a heavy penalty for failure to recognise a citizen's obligations, may in reality be opening the way for the evasion of these obligations practically without punishment. I should like to know from the Minister how the Act has hitherto operated, and what sort of penalties have been imposed by magistrates for the offences created by the sections we are amending. I do not want to have boys hanged, drawn, aiid quartered for declining their responsibilities, but I should like to know whether the existing Act has proved a farce, and whether, in the opinion of the Minister, the giving to the magistrates of the power to impose an alternative penalty will Strengthen its administration. ister for Defence) [10.2] I do not know that I can give the honourable member the information for which he asks.

The amendment proposed fixes the liability upon the particular person in whose custody the vessel was wben opened. An increase has been made in the annual licence-fees for brewers. The Government, by prohibiting the importation of beer with a view to the conservation of freight space for more essential articles, has created a monoply for the local brewers. This has, of course resulted in a much greater output, entailing a consequential supervision. annum-prescribe d by the ExciseA c t does not by any means cover the expenses of. supervision and administration. new scale fixes the licence-fee upon the equitable basis of 'output,, commencing with £ 2 5 per annum for a brewery turning out nofc more than 50,000 gallons per annum, and increasing by amounts of £ 2 5 up bo £250 per annum for a brewery producing more than 12,000,000 gallons in fche year. On the other hand, the amount of security to be given by a brewer for compliance with the requirements of the Act has been considerably reduced. The amount of security as determined by the present ExciseA c t is in a sum not exceeding twice the estimated amount of duty which the applicant will be liable to pay i u any one month.. In the case of 1 large breweries this would amount to a very considerable sum. The new scale as set out in the f if t h schedule fixes the amount of security to be given according to fche output of the brewery and the licence-fee paid. Thus, a brewery with To prevent auy second use of an output of 50,000 gallons and paying a licence-fee of £ 2 5 per annum will require a security bond iu the sum of £ 1 0 0 , and a brewery with the maximum output and licence-fee of £250 per annum, one in the sum of £10,000. Attention is also invited toclause 9 of the B ill . It may be explained that It has been licences r u n from the 1st of January to tlie 31st December of each year, when they automatically lapse Uuless renewed prior to the close of the 31st December. In a number of instances through some oversight, principally due to the holiday season, brewers have neglected to renew tbeir licences before the New Year. This causes considerable inconvenience, necessitating fresh applications, new securities and expense. Owing to the revenue involved, fche Department cannot afford to forego the strict provisions of the Act . Provision has been made in clause 9 for an extended period of seven days in which application for renewal may be made. This should avoid the inconvenience complained of. Clause 12 enables the Comptroller at additional expenditure in his discretion, and subject to desirable The licence-fee-£2 5 per conditions, to permit transfer prior to payment of duty of beer from one brewery to another. Owing to certain causes a The brewer finds he is unable to use his machinery, and his manufacture temporarily ceases. His only opportunity to carry on his business and supply his customers is to obtain beer from another brewery. The law does not permit this concession unless duty is first paid, and then on opening the vessels in his brewery the brewer must cancel the stamps and put more on his own vessels when he sends out the beer to his customers. Clause 12 gives the necessary power to meet an emergency of this kind. The provisions of the present Act require that no vessel shall be removed from a brewery unless the name and address of fche brewer are shown on same. This requirement operates very harshly on the business traders engaged in export trade with the Pacific Islands and the East. On receipt of the vessels giving information as to the name of the brewery and address, the oversea customer can then discard his former business connection and trade direct with the brewery. tain cases it is desirable that the Department should be in a position to meet the wishes of export traders and provide that the vessels shall be marked in a manner to be prescribed without disclosing the name and f u l l address of tlie brewery. t Care w ill , of course, be taken to see that the vessel is marked so that it may be readily known the contents have been made in Australia. provide the power to make the necessary regulations to meet such special cases.

If they have been advised of the contents of this B ill , I have no objection to the House dealing with it straight way, although we have only just heard the Minister telling us of several important alterations which the measure w ill effect. It is difficult for honourable memhers to follow such a B ill without a memorandum showing the alterations to the principal Act, which contains seventy sections and eight schedules. When I was administering the Customs Department I know that it was found necessary to make'several alterations in regard, to the Tobacco Excise Act, but the Department waited for an opportunity to make them. The opportunity came only the other day. This is a similar B ill . Amending measures of this character can better be conI n cersidered in Committee, and I shall deal with some of the proposed alterations when Ave reach that stage. HoAvever, the alteration which was made in .1912 Avas not quite as the Minister said. It simply increased the amount of exciseable liquor in hogsheads, barrels, half hogsheads, and kilderkins. I remember introducing the B ill as Ministerf o r Trade and Customs. Owing to an improvement in the methods Clauses 18 and 19 of brewing since the passing of the prin cipal Act, in 19.01, the brewers Avere ahle to avoid a great deal of Avastage. The Act of 1901 collected duty on fifty gallons to the hogshead, the f u l l capacity of which is fifty-four gallons, but the amendThese ing B ill of 1912 increased the dutiable contents to fifty-two gallons. In like The object of the amendments proportion, the dutiable contents of smaller vessels were also increased.

I am surprised to find that the innocent beverage known as hop beer contains a greater percentage of alcohol than the 2 per cent, prescribed by the Excise Act. If any .hop beer is brewed w it h a greater alcoholic strength than 2 per cent., it should not escape the payment of Excise duty. The persons who drink hop beer under the impression that it is nonalcoholic should be protected by the Customs Department, and brewers, of such beverages should pay duty in the same way as the brewers of ordinary beer.

355,Mr Watt (Balaclava,"Acting Primeand i find that Dr. Fetherston arrived in a ship which, was not quarantined at all. He came via Colombo, and the ship was not infected. shall only detain the House for a minute or two; but I find it necessary to bring under the notice of honourable members a condition of affairs which, I think, they will agree should be remedied. We have established preference to returned soldiers, in the Civil Service; but, unfortunately,' it operates unjustly in certain circumstances. I have before me the case of a man employed as a temporary hand in the Postal Department, as senior messenger. He haB a record of sixteen years' service as an I m perial soldier. He served in three campaigns, and at the outbreak of the present waT volunteered for service; hut was turned down on account.of disabilities due to active service in previous wars. He has since received notice that he must leave his job-h e is a'married man, with a wife and family-in order to make room .for another man,' who, I am informed, has not fired a shota man who got to England, but no further, and, being returned . to Australia, he is now, under the regulations to which I have referred, displacing a man with sixteen years' service in the Imperial Military Forces to his credit. I feel certain that Parliament and the country never intended that such a state of things should arise, and I feel it is only necessary to bring the matter before the Government to insure that some actionbe taken to safeguard such men. ment! that they be treated as returned soldiers, and he given positions, but that, if they are already in the Service-the y are not particularly numerous their interests should he safeguarded. I think the returned soldiers themselves Tegard men with Imperial -servioe to their credit as returned soldiers, and welcome them into their association. I feel sure, also, that the Returned Soldiers Association will support the TequestI am making, so there ought to. be no difficulty whatever iu pre[309] venting such cases of hardship as the one to' which I am now drawing attention. pleased to hear the statement made by the Acting .Prime Minister( Mr Watt) with regard to Dr. Fetherston, the principal medical officer of our Military Forces. There should be no misapprehension ahout this matter. Every vessel, that comes to Australia must he examined by a quarantine official. When I . was Minister for Trade and Customs a Western Australian. legislator was fined because he left a vessel before she had been granted a clean bill of .health. I am glad to know that the principal medical officer did not commit this indiscretion. We have to thank the .quarantine officials for the fact that, up to the present, we have kept the. scourge of Spanish, in -' fluenza out of Australia. Minister and Treasurer) [10.59] -In reply to the honourable member for Perth( Mr Fowler) may I be permitted to say that I think the case he cited is' one of the most striking that has been brought under notice;.and as his request is that the services of men with extended Imperial military service to their credit shall not he displaced, I shall confer with the Department', and see how far it is possible to amend the regulation to give effect to the suggestion he has made.
