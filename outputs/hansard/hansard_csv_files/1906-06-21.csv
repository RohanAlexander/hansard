Does not section 5 of the Constitution provide that after any general election Parliament shall be summoned to meet within thirty days from the date of return of the writs. 3. If so, would not the holding of a general election on any day in October next involve a meeting of the new Parliament before the end of tlie present year? 4. Should a new Parliament meet before the end of 1906, will not the persons returned for the first time to the Senate at the ensuing election be precluded from sitting therein, seeing that section 13 of the Constitution provides that "" the service of a senator shall be taken to begin on the ist day of January following his election "" ? 5.

Yes, but see section 168 of the Commonwealth Electoral Acts 1902-1905, under which the person causing the writ to be issued may provide for extending the time for its return. 2.

Not necessarily. 4. Senators elected this year for a term of office, commencing on the ist January next, cannot take their seats till their term of oflice begins. 5. The election of a new House of Representatives and of senators elect for a new term does not affect the right of senators whose term has not yet expired, to sit for the remainder of their term. ter, upon notice1.

For several years past the political position, so far as affairs are concerned, has been very unsatisfactory. up, and new parties have been but there has been no proper fqllowing of party leaders, and no cohesion, and honourable members have not known where they were. I do not propose to say who, in my opinion, is responsible for this state of affairs; but I regard it as having retarded Federal development, while it has bitterly* disappointed the public of Australia, and has caused embarrassment, and, in some cases, perhaps, humiliation, to honourable members. here almost on go-as-you-please principles, but, throughout, one party has been pushing .steadilv, ruthlessly, ahead, and has lost no chance of improving its position. In saying that, I cast no reflection upon the party to which I refer, sympathy because, if I were a member of it , I should be glad to see it working on those lines. I am Its object hitherto has been, by holding the balance of power, to control the conduct of government, and in that it has largely succeeded, although its members have had The to cast their fiscal opinions aside to achieve that end. gratifying to the Labour Party, but what have they to do with the question before the Chair? We have been to do with it, as the honourable member will piesently discover. Having hitherto controlled to a great extent the administration of affairs, the Labour Party will make at the next elections a determined attempt toof divisions; capture the reins of government. For that I shall not blame them; but it will make the next elections of the utmost importance, and will require an expression of opinion from the whole of the people of Australia. If they had a majority of the electors beAs honourable members hind them, they should take charge of t h e affairs of the country. I do not know that in such a case the conditions would be much worse than they are now. 1 am quite willing that the Labour Party shall control the administration if they For this reason the fanners canhave the support of the majority of the electors, but [ am not content that they shall exercise such a large influence as th?y do over the affairs of State whilst they represent a minority of the electors.

No one takes exception to the leader, to whose tact and general characteristics the success of the party has been mainly due. That honourable member, however, is merely a chip on the stream, and when the tide begins to run a little more strongly, he may be swept aside, and landed on the bank. We know very well that his views do not coincide with those held by certain extreme members of his party, and the date is not far distant when he will have to with his position or his conscience.

Howthink the remarks of the honourable member are extending over a very wide range. There appears to be ample room for the discussion of the question whether the elections shall be held upon a certain date without introducing issues such as the honourable member is raising. I hope, therefore, that he will confine his remarks to the subject of the motion. MrM c COLL I am sorry that the' members of the Labour Party do not like to hear the truth. It seems that I am touching them on the raw. I do not think that it is creditable for politicians of high standing to enter into an arrangement that will render them immune from the oppart company either position of any party. A t present we will call them immunists, who are on the road to to run becoming communists.

It has been urged that the adoption of the plan suggested would not insure the holding of all subsequent elections at the same period of the year. But we could at least insure that, unless there were a penal dissolution of both Houses, under the deadlock provisions of the Constitution, the elections for the Senate would be held at a much more convenient time than they are at present. So far as this House is concerned, penal dissolutions are always possible, but we are at present under just as great a liability to have the elections of the two Houses separated as we would) be then. To insure that in future the inconvenience to which allusion has been made shall be minimized COOK -The honourable as much as possible, the effort, I think, is worth making.

Before the newspapers had moment. At the same time, I am inclined to think that the honourable member has overlooked the immense distances which exist in Australia. The Department has to 3eal, not merely with the electors of New South Wales or Victoria, but with those of the Northern Territory, the north-west corner of Western Australia, and the far north of Queensland with which places communication is not frequent. Though an earlv election might not inconvenience the voters resident in' these remote portions, of the Continent, their distance from the centres of population increases the difficulties of the Department in getting the electoral machinery to work. That machinerv is more difficult to work in respect of the places I have mentioned than it is in respect of places, like Echuca or Wagga. I think that the Government should strain every nerve to enable the forthcoming elections to be held at the earliest possible moment.

He declared that the honourable member spoke in the interests of the farmers and he added ; that the Labour Party would secure the farm labourers' vote. He quoted figures to show that this was so. For instance, he said that 5,000 more votes were cast in the agricultural constituency which he repreAt fhe same time it concerns sents at the last State elections than were recorded in his own favour at the general elections for this Parliament.

By this time our Electoral Department should have reached such a state of efliciency as to be alble to fix the probable date on which the electoral machinery can be used. Minister does not know when it can be used ; he will make inquiries, but he has not the remotest idea. There is a careful estimate ancl an accurate conclusion as to October, and everything else is vague and in the air. penal dissolution. the case I am putting-som e grave emergency arising requiring an immediate appeal to the people on some matter affecting their interests. ing to the dictum of ithe Minister, a period of six months must elapse before the electoral machinery can be ready. All this is neither more nor less than a reflection upon the condition of things which obtains in the Department in regard to matters most vitally affecting this Parliament and the interests of the people. My own impression is the same as that of the honourable member for Bland, and I 'believe of honourable members generally, that the December date fixed for the Senate is the most inconvenient that could possibly be fixed. I urge upon the Government the advisability of submitting a simple constitutional amendment fixing the date of the termination of a Senate term earlier or later than that now provided for. In all the circumstances it would seem that a later date is preferable to an earlier one-rha t is to sav, that a date in February. March, or April, would best suit almost the whole of the people of Australia. It is impossible to fix a date which will suit the interests of all the people, but we mav have a fair idea of what will suit the great majority, and in all these questions, which are matters of expediency and administration, it is the interests of the great majority that we ought to consult I am not rmite sure whether what I have suggested should not be done at the forthcoming elections. Certain it is that until ifc is done we shall have to continue the holding of elections at a time when a great proportion of the people-for whom, in view of the natural disabilities under which they labour, the electoral machinerv should be stretched if* possible-wil l be unable to record their votes. Thev are under natural disabilities in this regard, arising from their remoteness from the polling booths and centres of population, and from the general conditions under which they live, and we should endeavour to modify and remedy those disabilities as far as possible by means of our electoral machinerv. Every one Instead of that, the knows that some of our farmers must go from i o to 20 miles to record their votes. to such a disability, we make it necessary for them to secrifice their crops and to Suppose there were a suffer all kinds of inconvenience, we are imposing what is equivalent to a monetary penalty upon them, and the effect is, in many cases, just the same as if we had no equal franchise at all. A geographical hindrance does not materially differ in its Accordeffect from a legislative hindrance, and we might just as well disfranchise these people or give electors in towns two votes to their one, unless they are given some facilities for recording their votes in the easiest, earliest and quickest way. Considered in all its ramifications, the matter is a very important one. It is said that an ounce of fact is worth a ton of theory, and I remember that at the last election I went to address a meeting of farmers in my own electorate. ; When I reached the place of meeting, although the meeting had been advertised, I found that there were only two assembled to listen to my eloquence. The explanation of that is explanation. tion is that there had been four or five wet days, and the day on which I was to address the electors was a fine day.

When the polling-day came I got all the votes in the neighbourhood but two. It is difficult in their busy_ seasons to get farmers to give attention _to political matters, and I suppose it is the more difficult where they have confidence in their representative.

I have mentioned this matter to show that natural difficulties are always dogging the farmer's life, subject as he is to seasons and climatic tween now and October or November is a conditions. It is not fair that, in addition to natural disabilities, we should impose disabilities upon country voters arising from defects of our legislative machinery. It is just the same as if we imposed legisus, that should be merely a matter of the lative disabilities upon them. Under the Constitution as it stands, a legislative restriction is necessarilv imposed upon these electors, and the sooner we can remove or modify it the better for the country as a whole. There is, I think, a consensus of opinion at the present time that the sooner an appeal to the people is made the better. We have the authoritv of the Prime Minister for saying, that this House, as at preprofessedly so anxious to have settled, and sent constituted, cannot do useful work. Prime Minister has not the material with which to work. I should have thought that that had been made clear to the honourable member last night. The Prime Minister is quite impotent to do anything except by the grace and favour of men who clo not believe in him, and who are prepared to put him to the sword at the earliest possible moment. That is the condition of affairs to-dav. In other words, there is no such thins as responsible government set up. The Prime Minister says that there are three parties, in the House, and that we cannot have responsible government with three parties.

That condition of affairs should be remedied, and the electoral machinery should be .ready whenever we wish to use it-withi n reason, of course, because we cannot expect the necessary adjustments to be made in a moment. I suggest that bereasonable time within which to make the necessary arrangements. If the compilation of the rolls is in question, seeing that there are now no revision courts to trouble employment of labour for the purpose. The delimitation of the boundaries, and the fixing of polling-places are again merely matters of the employment of labour, and I submit that they should! not stand in the way of getting the electoral machinery readv at the earliest possible moment, in order that we may have those great issues settled which both sides of the House are none more than honourable members opposite, who have declared this House to be an unworkable House, and who seek to dissolve existing parties into two, so that responsible government may be carried on, andi good and useful work, such as will lead to the building up and prosperity ancl stability of Australia may take the place of our present inefficient and unsatisfactory methods. of Home Affairs) [3-29] -The honourable member who moved this motion stated that he desired to introduce it in an inoffensive form, that he desired to obtain an expression of the opinion of the House, and not in anv way to take up the attitude of dictating to the Government the exercise of His Majesty'si prerogative. After all is said and done, what is aimed at is an early dissolution of the House, involving the exercise of the*Royal prerogative, which, as a rule, is exercised on the advice of His Majesty's Ministers. On the face of it the motion is certainly inoffensive, and should not necessarily introduce party poliI tics; but under cover of it the honourable member has made a few remarks which seem to indicate that it has been introduced from his own political stand-point.

We have always borne in mind the interests of the farmers, and will continue to clo so, because we recognise that they form one of the most deserving sections of the community.

If honourable members express the opinion that the election should be held at the earliest possible date, they will merely be declaring themselves in favour of that which has already Ibeen done, and is still being carried out by the officials administering the Department, both at the head oflice and at every branch throughout the Commonwealth. MrM c LEAN (Gippsland) [3.'58] I was very pleased to hear that the Government were in favour of holding the elections at the earliest possible date. The Minister indicated the progress which is being made with the work of preparation for the elections, but he did not show that it would .not be possible to hold the elections before the date mentioned in the motion. ticular date. the elections on the date suggested. dicated that, and I hope that the elections may ibe held then. But I stated that it 1 was impossible to bind /the 'Chief Electoral Officer down to anv particular date. MrM c LEAN be bound down to a certain limit. the officers. I indicated that, if possible, arrangements should be made to enable the elections to be held not later than the middle of November. that, because every honourable member who has had any experience must know that it is quite practicable to hold the elections within that time. We are all familiar with the formal matters to which the Minister has referred, and we know that they can be attended to simultaneously in all the States, -and that the great distances to which reference has been made do not impose insuperable barriers to reasonable expedition. When I was at the head of the Customs Department, I used to receive telegrams from the most remote parts of the Continent, and I must confess that I never experienced the -slightest difficulty in replying; to them by wire upon the same day. Surely the same expedition can be observed in giving instructions-by wire or otherwise-to officers in different parts of the Commonwealth. If the Government desire to hold the general elections before the middle of November, we all know that it is quite possible for them to do so, and I think the necessity for doing so has been pretty well That matter is now reemphasized already. I have given a good deal of consideration to this matter. I am not one who would advocate the granting of facilities to farmers which are denied to any other section of the community. I merely wish, as far as it is practicable, to place the farmers upon an equality with other sections of the community. We know that in spite of anything that we may do we cannot place them upon exactly the same footing. Thev have to contend with many difficulties which are not experienced by any other class. A 'good deal has been said in referenoe to the shearers-. I am as much interested in extending to the shearers facilities to vote as I am in granting them to the farmers. But the obstacles in their case are of an altogether different character. If a shearer leaves his own State, and goes to another to pursue his avocation, there is no practical difficulty in the way of him I did not mention any paravailing himself either of the "" Q "" form It may be possible to hold or of the postal vote.

The farmer may be within five miles of a polling booth and vet be unable to discontinue his operations in order to exercise the franchise. There is no great loss involved in the discontinuance of shearing for half a day. man stops operations without tihe consent of his employer, which is not always obtainable, he has no emplovment to return to after he has recorded his vote.

174,I T Is Quite Mr Dugald Thomson,"I shouldspeak now. were it not for a remark made by the Minister. The honourable gentleman said that, in his opinion, the re-organization of the Electoral Department should have been taken in hand before his entry into office. The reorganization that is spoken of is not a very serious matter. gentleman has appointed an officer as Chief Electoral Officer, and otherwise, I believe, he has practically the same staff as comprised the Department before his acceptance pf office. have been appointed in the States, ancl other matters have been attended to. Electoral Officer has been appointed, but, speaking generally, the same staff is conducting the operations of the Electoral Department which conducted them in the past. I informed the House, 'when I had an opportunity of speaking on the proposals submitted by the Minister in connection with the Electoral Bill-whic h proposals were largely amendments which I had previously adopted-that I was satisfied that no reorganization on the present lines will achieve what is necessary, in the case of an electorate so large as all Australia, to secure the efficient, speedy, and successful carrying out of elections. I was then convinced, and I am still more convinced by what we know to-day, and by the remarks 1 of the Minister, that when we have to reach the remote confines of Australia with our electoral administration, and must control such an enormous area from one centre, the Department operating over all that area must be handling the electoral administration, not merely at the time of an election, or suddenlv when the rush of an' election comes on, but day by day and hour by hour during the whole period between elections. That can only be accomplished by a staff so large and so permanent in character as that represented by the staff of the Commonwealth Post Office Department, assisted-and that could be arranged-by the States police forces and by States school teachers in remote districts. With a reorganization of the Electoral Department on those lines, we should have the strongest electoral staff in the world. In conducting the business, on the lines at present adopted, there will always be weaknesses, because we are depending upon men in remote districts who are not permanent officers of the Commonwealth. I should not have spoken They are men in receipt of small salaries, and liable to be removed from time to time. They constitute weak links in the chain; some of them give way and then the whole system breaks down. a voucher for i o j d . for his services during The honourable a year. know what that individual could have had to do. Commonwealth officers shows either that there was no work for him to do, and that he should not have been appointed, or, if there was work for him to do, that he did not do it, and should not have received the rojtd. returned the r o j d . officers form a number of weak links in what ought tb be a very strong chain extending throughout he Commonwealth'. I had come to the conclusion, in which I have been confirmed by the remarks of the Minister to-day, that if the work of the Electoral Department is to be done thoroughly, it must be in hand all the time. Honourable members will see that if a returning officer is removed from his position, there is an electoral chaos in his district for a time, because his successor will know nothing of the work. If it were the work practically of a permanent Department, every boy and youth in it would come in contact with that work day by day, just as they do with the money order business of the Post Office Department at the present time, and in the event of vacancies arising there would be an enormous staff of persons competent to undertake the conduct of the business, from which they could be filled. I repeat that there is no reorganization attempted now. There has been merely the placing of one officer, who in his position in Tasmania was a very good officer, and who, I hope, will prove to be a good officer in the position to which he has now been appointed. In the coming elections other officers in the Department will naturally, from their previous connection with the work, be more useful for the time being. I have no desire to unduly criticise the Department or the Minister. I am aware that the officers in the Department work their very hardest, and, indeed, overwork themselves in their endeavours to carry on the necessary electoral work.

182,Mr Dugaldthomso N,"Thesethem. I know that the Minister will also have to overwork himself in connection with the coming elections. But I do say that there has not been that anticipation of difficulties which might be expected. For instance, I may refer to the measure which' created a difficulty in the first instance, and to which the Minister has alluded. It fixed the occasions for the redistribution of State representation. The result attained by that measure was just the same as that -which would have been obtained by the process which the previous Ministry desired to adopt, and which was ' the very process which had already been adopted by the Barton Government, of which the present Prime Minister was the Attorney-General. It seemed to me that that measure was brought in by the present Government to save its face, or to save the face of some of its members. Some of them having said in the press, before they became Ministers, that the process proposed by the late Government was not right, they had to do something, or it w ould have been an admis: sion that they had been incorrect in their statements. That delayed matters; but we have passed that, and have come now to the position after the last redistribution. I quite agree that an enormous amount of work had to be clone after that. In some cases the wbole of the voters in certain polling areas had to be transferred from the old electorate into a new electorate. That is not a very difficult task where there is no division of a polling area by the alteration of a border line. cut in two. so. Some of the polling areas have been bisected. must be a great many throughout the Commonwealth. are manv in Victoria, alone. orable member for Echuca might not knowit, but in the Department it is known that it is difficult to judge from the maps where polling places get their voters from, as electors have their names put down for polling places at some considerable distance from the place at which they reside. transfers are made from the various centres to other large centres? transfer is a matter which must take some time. The officers must go round and collect all the names, ascertain which division they are in, and which polling place the electors are to be enrol led for. to the country than to the town electorates. 1 ter is, of course, much more difficult in country electorates. One of the causes of delay, of course, arises in connection with the printing. I am not aware whether the Minister has already adopted the course, but I would suggest that the printing should go on immediately after the receipt of the Commissioner's report. the materials are complete, and the officers of the Department, have instructions to proceed as soon as possible with the printing. had decided was that immediately the reports of the Commissioners were in, all the registrars should be communicated with to send down the latest information. that now. course had been adopted, the information from the bulk of the electorates should be in the hands of the Department now. there should be a great deal of it in. are not in yet. The honourable gentleman will remember that the report; of the Commissioner for Victoria was fairly late in coning in. orable gentleman refers to the police returns in the case of border polling areas ? there was no necessity to have waited for them. The information might have been obtained from the central polling places, comprising the bulk of the electors. If the registrars were asked to send in the latest information as soon as the Commissioners' reports were received, that information should be in now for many of the city and suburban electorates, and for the nearer country districts. If they have sent that information in, the necessary alterations can be made, and all the rolls except those for the border line polling areas for-",30,Willis T H E Honourable Prevent Impersonation Therefore There

I agree with the honourable member for Echuca that, in fixing the date for a general election, the convenience of the electors should be studied, andi that, whenever possible, loss should not be entailed upon them, by requiring them to record their votes at a busy period of the year. no right to consider how one political party or another will benefit by the fixing of the date of the elections in a particular month. The honourable member for Echuca may have suggested that it wouldi be to the disadvantage of the Labour Party to hold the elections on the date he proposes, party may have said that ift would be to its advantage to hold them then, because it would give the employees of the farmers an opportunity to vote. what is the best date to fix to prevent interference with the occupations andi avocations of the electors.

I seconded the amendment, I did so chiefly to secure an opportunity to speak at once, because it seems to Every week by me to matter little whether the motion be carried as it stands, or as it is proposed to amend it. In any case, the elections will be held as soon as practicable, because on the 15th November Parliament We have not will be in recess, and possibly this!

Then, again, we know very well that a comparatively small number of crops ripen simultaneously, and therefore only a small percentage of farmers would be harvesting on election day. In fact, if the Government could arrange for the election to take place on a wet day, the farmers would have no right to complain. The Government, in dealing with this matter, must consider the whole of the Commonwealth, and not take into account the conditions which prevail in any particular district.

They are live men and intelligent citizens of the Commonwealth. The farmers have buggies and horses, and every facility to enable them to attend the polling-booth, and I repeat that the percentage of those whose operations would prevent them from recording their votes! in November or December is very small.

I have not heard that any large number of farmers were prevented from voting at the last, election, although I am aware that some of them were very apathetic about the exercise of the franchise. I trust that the motion will be rejected. The honourable member who brought it forward should be content with having had the matter ventilated. I quite admit that the most suitable period for all parties at which to hold the elections would * be about March. Taking the Commonwealth as a whole, it will be found that a considerable number of electors will be disfranchised, no matter when the elections are held. I hope that this matter will be left entirely in the hands of the Government. Assuming that the motion be carried, what effect can it have? It seems to me that, having ventilated the 'matter, the honourable member for Echuca might well withdraw his proposal. He must know that the Government will select the most suitable date upon which to hold the elections. The brunt of the attack made by members of the Opposition this afternoon has been directed, not against the Ministry, but against the Labour Party. If the Opposition wish to see only two parties in this I have heard such House, why do they not join the Lab* his seat. It would .be manifestly unfair that a senator elected in March should be unable to take his seat until the following Tanuarv. and that in the meantime, the State concerned should be represented by a man who might have been rejected by the electors. There are hieger questions involved than the mere date of election, but the matter is one which we must face, if we do not desire that the elections shall continue to be held at a most unsuitable time. Honourable members know that at one time we gave up nearlv six months of our legitimate term of office, and it is nowagreed that we were rather foolish to do so. The elections were first of all held in March, ancl that practice should have been continued. We took the course we did in order to save the money of the people of the Commonwealth, but we have never had any thanks for doing so. On the contrary, complaints are frequently made that our expenditure is extravagant. It would be wise, I think, for us to revert to the previous position, and the necessity for some alteration should not be lost sight of by the Government. I have suggested what I believe would be a remedy for a condition of things which is admittedly unsatisfactory, and which would enable the elections to be held at a time which would be convenient for the majority of the electors.

I absolutely disagree that those honourable members are the only persons who look after the interests of the farmers, and I also repudiate the suggestion that in the past the farmer has not received a fair share of consideration.

In the Wimmera electorate, which is almost a purely farming and pastoral division, the percentage of votes recorded was 51.11. I now come to some of the city electorates of Victoria, and I find that in Southern Melbourne the percentage of votes recorded was 53.59, or the same as the percentage recorded in the Wannon electorate. bourne, 48.16 per cent, of the votes on the rolls was recorded. In the Ballarat electorate, represented' by the Prime Minister, and a purely city constituency, the percentage of votes recorded was 46.92, a lower percentage than that recorded' in any of the country constituencies to which I have referred. Still honourable members claim that the farmer is the only person who does not get an opportunity to record his vote. The returns show that in the country divisions a greater number of electors go to the poll than in the city divisions. is mistaken. sented by the Department of Home Affairs are wrong, and the honourable and learned W ill the honourable memmember is right. I am quoting the Viccentage of votes recorded' in the towns in country electorates, but in the farming centres of those electorates not more than 30 per cent, of the electors recorded their votes. * orable and learned member's statement will stand investigation, I ask how it is that so many more votes were recorded in towns outconstituencies side the metropolitan area than, in electorates within the metropolitan area? In the Grampians division, the percentage of votes recorded was 49.67, which, judging by a The rough glance at the figures, is well up to, if not beyond, the average. I have every consideration for the farmer. I believe that,in In the country common with other people, he should be able to have his opinions voiced in this Chamber, In the division of Wannon,and impressed upon the legislation that is passed ; but the choice of representatives by the farming constituencies is scarcely consistent with the arguments we have heard this And in the farming afternoon. We are told that the farmer clamours for certain consideration, and' when he is given the opportunity he selects a citv lawver as his representative. I have not the slightest objection to that. If the farmers of Wannon prefer the present honourable and learned member for that constituency to a practical farmer, that is their look out. I notice from the Age that it is proposed in Flinders now to displace the present purely farming representative of that electorate by another city lawyer in the person of Mr Irvine. same thing.

In the interests of a section of the community composed of men who are doing as much for the advancement of the country as are the farmers, I object to this motion. I refer to the people who go into the interior of Australia in search of mineral deposits. The low percentage of voters on the rolls who cast their votes at the last Federal elections in Western Australia is notorious. In many of the outposts of Western Australia a few. people were gathered together, but, as in such places, men do not remain for any very considerable time, very many electors were disfranchised at the last elections. Instead of being able to record a vote of over 60 per cent, of the electors on the rolls, as was done in the Corangamite division of Victoria, the number of voters recording their votes at the elections in Western Australia was not more than 26 per cent, of the number on the rolls. This shows that the farmer has received twice the consideration in the matter of representation that has been received by the gold-mining section of the community. moving about for the greater part of the year ? which may attract hundreds of men to a particular district; they may remain for a few weeks, and should the find turn out to be a "" duffer,"" they get back into the cities again for another few weeks. the elections which would suit those people. be difficult to do so, but I object to the fixstructions issued? ing of an arbitrary date at this time without any consideration for the people of the outposts of Australia. In my electoratej which, I may casuallv mention, is as big as the State of Victoria, I may inform honourable members that there is mail communication with Eucla by subsidized steamer only once every three months. The people there get their supplies under the same conditions. That is from the Western Australian side, and their means of communication from the South Australian side is no better. If we fix an arbtrary date for the elections at the present time, should a steam-boat leave for Eucla in ihe near future, it is just possible that there would not be another leaving for that place before the elections too* place. The right [20] honourable member for Swan will be able to bear me out when I say that it may taka months for the Electoral Department to get into communication with places like Derby and Onslow. The fixing of a definite date. for the next Federal elections, whilst it might assist a few farmers, might do serious injustice to other sections of the community. The height of summer, when the farmer is gathering his grain, is not the most convenient time at which to hold the Federal elections, but, whilst I have no desire to do anything which would 1 be unfair to the farmer, or which might prevent him from recording his vote, I repudiate what I consider an attempt by a certain political party to make capital out of this proposal, and I desire to see consideration given to the interests of people in the more remote portions of the Commonwealth. shall not occupy many minutes of the time of the House, because, in my opinion, the disabilities under which the farmers labour when they have to record their votes in the last month of the year have already been well pointed out by a number of honourable members. I do not agree with the honourable member for Darling that it would make much difference to the shearers if the elections were held on the 15th instead of the end of November. The Minister, I understand, has promised that the next elections shall be held with the least possible delay, and probably before the 15th November. instructions to keep in view a date in the middle of November. « not told of them the other day? nitely when the elections would be held. for Bland and the honourable member for Darling both dwelt on the advisableness of holding the elections in Maich or April, and, although it had not occurred! to me before, it seems to me now that we have ourselves to blame to a great extent for having changed the time of the holding of the elections from the earlier to the later months of the year.

263,Mr Skene,"The honourable member would be a very simple matter, after the expression of opinion which we have had, to secure analteration of the Constitution which would bring about what is desired. But the matter should be taken in hand at once, because such an alteration requires, not only that majorities in the two Chambers of the Legislature shall vote for it, but that it shall be before the electors for at least two months before they are called upon to express their opinion in regard to it . If the people are not asked to express their opinion on this matter at the next general elections, they cannot, unless a special referendum is taken, be asked to do so before 1909, so that it wiLl be impossible to effect before 1912 the change which we wish to bring about. Darling somewhat overstated the case when he said that some shearers have more difficulties to face in going to the poll than have the farmers. It is easy to say that the farmers may vote by post, but that can be done only when electors live seven miles away from a polling-placq, and, if a farmer requires all his time for the harvesting of a valuable crop, he will not go to a polling-place which is only three or four miles away. I remember that, during the last elections, I heard of, not one, but several, electors who would! not take the trouble to vote, although they were within sight of a polling-place. However, as I said at the commencement, the disabilities of the farmers have been fully placed before the House, and I rose only to ask the Minister to consider seriously whether steps cannot be taken at once to provide for the alteration of the Constitution which has been suggested. to point out, in connection with, the suggestions of the honourable members for Bland ancl Darling, that, although there seems to be an unanimous opinion that the latter months are more unsuitable than the earlier months of the year for an election, the worse month of all is December. Our experience in 1903 showed that to be the case. It is impossible, of course, to fix a date the statement of the Minister, I cannot for the holding of the elections which will inconvenience no elector; but it is our business, so far as we can, to ascertain, and to fix that date which will be least inconvenient to the majority. gaged in agriculture, whether they be employers or employees, .are concerned, the nearer the date of the general election to the end of fhe year the more marked will be the inconvenience to which they will be put if they wish to vote, because at that time climatic conditions are often unfavorable, and there is consequent risk of great loss from the cessation of work for even a few hours. Although a certain number of electors would be inconvenienced by the holding of the elections in November, most of them are electors who could vote by post. The cases in which three weeks would be taken for electors to send and get an answer to letters are, of course, abnormal, and by the middle of November the shearing in the more northern parts of the Commonwealth has been finished, and those who have been engaged in it are back in their homes, or living again within comparatively The honourable member for easy reach of postal facilities. When the choice is between those who can, with nothing more than a little inconvenience, record their votes through the post-office, and 1 those who cannot record it at all without risk of material financial loss, the latter should Le considered first. To hold the elections not later than the middle of November would inconvenience fewer persons than to hold them in December, when, in some cases, electors would be altogether prevented from voting. This is an instance in which, as we cannot find a course of action altogether free from inconvenience, it is our business to choose that which is least opento criticism. The experience of 1903 shows that December is the worse month for the holding of an election, because at that time of the year many electors are prevented from voting, not by reason of their negligence, carelessness, or indifference, but because of the risk to their financial well-being in ceasing from work to go to the poll. I am very glad that the Minister has; instructed! his officials to have in mind the middle of November as the date for the holding of the elections. It is not merelv the farmers, but their employees as well, who have to be considered. Every adult elector should, if possible, be afforded an opportunity to vote, and no elector should be prevented, by the risk of loss, from recording his vote. In view of understand why the Government will not accept the motion, because all it declares is that, in the opinion of the House, the general elections should be held not later So far as those enthan the 15th November, and. if possible, earlier. Of course, if it is impossible to hold them earlier, it is useless: to discuss the matter. After what the Minister has",38,Willis T H E Honourable Prevent Impersonation Therefore There
264,Mr Mccatf (Corinella) [5.35],"I wishsaid, I see no reason why the arrangements for the holding of the elections should not be completed by the date mentioned. The1 motion is couched in language to which no exception can be taken on the ground that it is an attack upon or a challenge to the Government, and as both the Ministry and the Labour Party have expressed concurrence with the proposal that the elections should, if possible, be held at the date fixed, I shall not hesitate to vote for the motion if it is pressed to a division. astonished to hear the honourable member for Darling assert that there was no considerable disfranchisement of farmers at the last general elections. If he had studied the returns of the voting, he would know that that statement was far from correct. The percentages given by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, in order to reenforce the argument of the honourable member for Darling, although, no doubt, put forward in perfectly good faith, cannot De accepted as a reliable criterion. percentages have been given of the votes cast at the different polling booths, the perfacilities, and have fixed a date upon which centages applying only to the voting in the divisions, andi it must be remembered that in many of the farming districts there are towns where the great bulk of the votes were recorded. the electors in the country towns voted in greater numbers proportionately than did the electors of the large centres ? given equal conditions, there is a strong probability that that happened. The honourable member for Darling sought to show that the farmers were not deprived of the opportunity to vote, andi that they were too apathetic to go to the polls. No doubt the charge of apathy as applied to some farmers is to some extent, perhaps to a large extent, true, just as it is true as applied to many other electors, but we know that there were other reasons why such an enormous number of those who were on the rolls failed at the last general elections to exercise the franchise. It is, I think, the duty of those responsible for our electoral ,administrat.ion to see that every facilitv for voting is given to electors, irrespective of their occupations. It is hardly fair to charge the farmers with apathv, when we fix a date upon which it is practically impossible for them to leave their homesteads. A farmer may, by [20]2 going to the poll a long distance away, in harvesting time, risk the loss of his crop, and, however strong his political views may be, he cannot afford to take that chance. I do not think that there is a tittle of evidence to support the view put forward by the honourable member for Darling that the motion has been brought forward with a view of disfranchising another section of voters. I have not heard the slightest suggestion of any such desire on the part of members of the Opposition, nor do I believe that such an idea was ever entertained. I can honestly say for mvself that my, sole object is to enable as many electors as possible to record their votes, and that I am not swayed.in any way by the political views they hold. I desire to remove the slur which now rests upon the electors of being so apathetic that they will not take the trouble to record their votes. At present we are placing obstacles in the way of a large section of the electors, and are then charging them with indifference. No No such charge can be fully sustained until we have afforded the electors the fullest they can vote without serious inconvenience or risk of loss. I was gratified to learn of the measures which are being taken by the Minister and his officers to expedite the work of the Electoral Department, with a view to holding the elections as early as possible. All that the Minister said! as to the completeness of the organization of the Department furnished an argument in favour of the motion. I hope that the arrangements will be pushed forward so that the elections mav be held, if not prior to the date mentioned in the motion, before the harvest is at its height. The honourable members for Kalgoorlie and Darling charged members of the Opposition with seeking to have the elections held at an earlier date than usual, with a view to placing the Labour Party at a disadvantage. I think they made it very clear that their own desire to have the elections postponed until a later date was due to their impression that the purposes of their own partu would be better served! at the expense of the farming communitv.

The honourable member prefaced his remarks by stating that the shearers always voted for Labour candidates. prepared to admit the truth of that statement, because a large proportion of the shearers are small farmers, who vote for democrats belonging to the party of which I am a member. The honourable member for Echuca made it clear that he desires that the elections should be held at a time when every elector would be in a position to record his vote. The honourable member referred to the large percentage of men and women who fail to record their votes, and I think that if we continue to hold our elections a.t an inconvenient time of the year, it will be impossible to poll a satisfactory percentage of votes. The Minister promised that he would do his utmost to arrange for the holding of the election at the earliest possible ""date, and according to his statement, it should not be held"" later than the 15th November.

If it were practicable to allow the election to stand over until 31st December, I should feel it my duty to support such a proposal. HonorI am not able members are elected for three years, and that period is short enough, especially if an honourable member has to travel through an electorate with an area of 20,000 square miles in order to address his constituents. I trust that if the Constitution is altered, the period will be extended to five years. I have no desire to cross swords with honourable members of the Labour Party, because I think that they must desire that as manv electors as possible shall go to the poll. If they do .not represent the people they cannot wish to occupy the seats that should be filled by members of the party to which I belong. We know that only a small percentage of the electors in New South Wales, and in fact throughout Australia, now support the Labour Party as a, party. A number of influences operate to bring about the return of honourable members to this House. For instance, I have no doubt that the honourable member for Grey would be elected, no m'atter how he described himself.

271,Mr Mcdonald (Kennedy) [5.58],"Isuitable period at which to hold the general elections. I most strenuously object to any such arrangement, but I have nothing to urge against the polling-day being fixed for some time in May. I need scarcely point out that in Queensland the wet season extends from January to Marcli, and, during those months it, is almost impossible for one to get over the country at all. In the northdoes that mean? It means that if in Queenswest and portions of the south-west of Queensland, at that particular time of the year, I have seen the water stretching across the country for thirty or forty miles. The rivers are flooded in all directions: Under such circumstances, the great bulk of the voters would be disfranchised if the elections were held at that particular period. As a matter of fact, whilst I was engaged in electioneering, I had an experience of being kept four days in one place, without being able to obtain anything to eat. A t the first general election for this Parliament, my opponent, in following me round my constituency, got stuck up between two rivers, and was unable to 'get back to the big centres of population before polling day. final address to the coachman who was driving him, on the banks of the Flinders River. May would be the most suitable period of the year at which to hold the elections. A good deal of talk has already been indulged in upon this motion. So far as South Australia is concerned, I do not think that it makes any difference to the voters when the elections are held. The honourable member for Dalley has asked a question in reference to the percentage of votes polled in that State at the last general election. I admit that, so far as the elections for the Senate were concerned, the percentage' of votes recorded was bad, for the simple reason that unost of the South Australian representatives were returned unopposed, as I believe they will be in future. But I would' point out that at the elections for the State Parliament, despite fche fact that some of the constituencies are very compact, we have never secured a better average than 50 per cent., and I find that in several constituencies at the last elections in Victoria more than 50 per corded their votes. of Corangamite and Wannon, the percentage was very high indeed. Whatever date may be fixed for the holding of the elections will not make very much difference to South Australia. A t the same time, if by altering that date we can induoe more electors to record their votes, I am thoroughly in sympathy with the alteration. The honourable member for Kennedy has suggested that if any change be made, the elections should be held in May. What land, March is too wet to permit of the elections taking place then, May is certainly too wet in South Australia. In the latter State, many voters have to travel long distances to exercise the franchise. In the electorate of Grey, for example, many voters have to travel twenty or thirty miles to the polling, booth. If the elections were held in wet weather, these persons would be disfranchised. However, there seems to be a consensus of opinion that iti is inadvisable to hold the elections in December, and I am quite prepared to fall in with the wish of the majority that) they shall take place in November. I am quite prepared to give the people every opportunitv to record thehI understand that he deliveied his votes. Indeed, I should like to see every elector exercising the franchise. This desirable result can be brought about. I am Tn my opinion, either April or sorrv that the right honourable member for Adelaide is not now able to take the active part in our legislation that he did in State politics, or I am sure he would have moved in this direction. The way to bring about the desired result is to impose a small penalty on those who will not take the trouble to record their votes. I hope that the time is close at hand when we shall take some step of that character. I have no fear of ever being asked to represent a minority, but I should not like to do so, and I am confident that no other honourable member would. If the matter were taken in hand by the Government, we could soon insure that no honourable member would be returned by a minority vote. the last speaker, I desire to see a date fixed for the holding of the general elections which will meet the convenience of a large majority of the voters. The debate which has taken place this afternoon demonstrates that whatever date is fixed some in cent, of the electors reconvenience will be experienced. But we In the divisions have to regard this matter, not from, the stand-point of a State, but from that of the Commonwealth.

So far as New South Wales is concerned, I think that March or April would be a very suitable period at which to appeal to the country. effect to his suggestion, but these would not be nearly so insurmountable as are those which are experienced at the present time. Undoubtedlv the last elections were delayed till the very worse period of the year, so far as the farming interests were concerned. In my own electorate the fact that there wa's not a contest for a seat in this House helped to minimize the vote which was cast on that occasion. the very midst of their harvesting operations, and the period was one at which the greatest amount of damage could be done to the crops by About a day or two Rrior to the pollingday a severe windstorm passed over a portion of my own constituency, with the result that the standing crops were practically threshed out. cover an extensive area, but the country which it affected was severely injured in the matter of ifs wheat return. alarmed the farmers in the district who were not touched by the disturbance. worked all hours in order to get their crops harvested. number of them did not trouble to record their votes, notwithstanding them were working within sight of the polling booth. has been suggested by farmers' representatives in Victoria, supported by the leader of the Opposition, that the general elections should be held in October. So far as New South Wales is concerned, difficulties would be experienced in October, only in another direction. munity franchised, but in October the shearers Mr Brown. and those engaged in the pastoral industry would share the same fate. Early in October shearing operations are in f u l l swing, and towards the end of that month the grass seeds begin to ripen, sothaf one day's) seeding may mean a very, heavy loss in a man's wool returns. Consequently it is the great desire of the pastoralist to get his wool off the sheep's back within that period. What we should aim I think that Parliament would be at is a mean between tbe period of the completion of the shearing and the heavy time of the harvesting-between , say, the 15th November and the first week of December. After the first week in December the difficulties in connection with harvesting are accentuated every day t ill the end of the year. It has been suggested that the Labour Party desire the elections There would be difficulties in giving to be held as late in the year as possible, because they fear the farmer's vote. Personally I db not fear that vote. I am a farmer myself, and I have done something to make the farming movement in New South Wales a substantial success. I do not think that the partu to which I belong has any cause to fear the farmers' vote. I hold that the elections should be held at a period of the year when the The farmersi were in largest number of voters will be able to exercise the franchise, and consequently I urge the Government to fix a date between' the 15th November and the first week irt windstorms.

274,Mr Batchelor (Boothby) [6.14],"for the same reason. I am sure that every member of the House desires that as f u l l a vote of the electors as possible shall be recorded. The only question is which is the best time of the year to secure it . If an attempt were made to alter the Constitution so that the Federal elections could be held in March, I think that it would be successful, and I have no doubt it would be a desirable course. tend to vote for the motion, and I have been somewhat surprised that any honourable member should oppose it. I quite expected that the Government would accept it. Its terms are not mandatory. It would be absurd tofixa definite date, and say that the elections shall be held before that date, because circumstances might arise which would render that impossible. But the carrying of this motion would be merely an expression of opinion by the House that the next elections should be held not later than the 15th November. I believe that the members of the Government and of the Opposition, of the Countrv Party, and of the Labour Party, are alike anxious that, if possible, the next elections should be held not later than that date. That is not by any means an ideal time of the year for the purpose, but, in the circumstances, it seems about the best we can do. So far as South Australia is concerned, anv time from October up to January would be about equally inconvenient for the farmers. From the beginning of November to the end of December would be the most inconvenient time for the fruit the dictation of Victoria. growers. So that the latter end of the year is inconvenient for horticulturists as well as for agriculturists, as the harvesting of the fruit crops, as well as of the grain crons. takes place at that time. I suggest to Ministers that they should accept the motion. Personally, I can see no possible obiection to it. The main consideration is that we should endeavour to secure an alteration of the Constitution, so that such a state of things should not happen again. £6.20] I hope that the Government will not accept this motion. To me, it looks too much like Victoria dictating to the rest of the Commonwealth. It is all nonsense to talk about the difficulty of getting a vote in country districts. I ask the Victorian representatives to look at the vote which the farmers of Darwin put up. If it is found that people will not vote in Victorian constituencies, it is because they have lost confidence in their representatives. It is a proof that the electors say "" We have had these men long enough; it is time to dispense with them, and it is not worthwhile to go to the polls to vote for them.""

Having come to Melbourne to do business, and not to talk, I was very glad when the debate on that motion concluded. I shall, however, take advantage of this opportunity, seeing that the regulations under the Commerce Act are to be gazetted within a few days, to draw attention to the manner in which a very large and important industry will be affected thereby. When that Bill was before the House the Minister of Trade and Customs made certain statements from time to time which indicated that he had no intention of introducing a system of grading in connection with butter. of honourable members, I should like to quote one or two passages from the speech of the Minister to show that those interested in the dairying industry were quite justified in forming the impression that no Federal compulsory grading wonld be introduced. xxv., the Minister statedThe object is to compel persons who are exporting goods to bring their products up to a prescribed standard. The honourable andi learned member for Parkes interjected that, in order to carry out such a system a whole army of inspectors would be required. There is no doubt that if a system such as is indicated by the regulations published in the press a short time ago is to be carried out, it will be necessary to employ an army of inspectors, not only in Svdney and Melbourne, but also at Bvron Bay and other butter-exporting centres. The Minister said, furtherThe exportation of articles which are properly No one could cavil at such a statement, described will not be interfered with, unless they but the supervision indicated by the' are unfit for human consumption. On Friday last I asked the Minister of ferent frdm that contemplated in connection' Trade and Customs whether he had any inwith the butter industry. Apparently it formation to the effect that the butter'prois proposed to appoint Government officials duced at any of the factories in New South to exercise supervision over the butter fac-' Wales was unfit for human consumption, tories, at which butter is being produced and what justification he had for proposing to bring into operation a system of butter grading. The Minister knows that not and the Governor General's one butter factory in New South Wales is turning out an article unfit for consumption. On the contrary, he is fully awarethat the product of the New South Wales factories is fit to occupy the highest place in the markets! of the world. If Government supervision were to be exercised only in regard to products unfit for human consumption, no exception could be taken to the attitude of the Minister. The Minister further remarked in the course of the speech to which I have referredHonorable members opposite may call it what they like. They have been trying to make out that the object of this Hill is to apply to goods such terms as grade No. i , grade No. 2, grade No. 3, grade No. 4, and so on. They know perfectly well that there is no intention to do anything of the kind at present. These statements naturally led those inter-' ested in the dairying industry to believe that the Minister had no intention of bringing into operation a system of grading as applied to butter. The Minister stated, further, in the course of his second-reading speechFor the information It is absolutely necessary to prevent the practice of adulterating food for consumption by, children and adults. No one could disagree with any regulations that were brought into operation with a view to preventing the adulteration of food, either for home consumption, or for export. At page 631 of Hansard, vol. It is important that our own people, and particularly our children, should! have pure food, and it would be a serious matter for our producing industries if adulterated goods were to find their way into the markets of the world under such conditions as. would injure our reputation. The Minister went on to sayIn regard to exports, we desire to obtain somecontrol over goods of short weight and impure foods, which are probably sent away to other countries. Honourable members, no doubt, are familiar with the statements made before the. Royal Commission, which is at present investigating the condition of the supplies which were forwarded to the troops in South Africa during the recent war.

The Minister called a Conference in Sydney, to which he invited representatives of the dairying, fruit, and meat industries of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, and Tasmania. The Minister made a very lengthy speech in opening the Conference, and explained that his object in calling the delegates together was to seek their assistance in arriving at means by which he could administer the Commerce Act with as little friction as possible. He could have had no more laudable object than he then indicated. butter were graded, and marked under regulations as first class, a guarantee would be afforded to buyers which they could accept with full confidence. I need only refer to the evidence which was given before the Victorian Butter Commission to show that, so far as butter is concerned, the Victorian Government brand affords no guarantee as to the quality of the product. Mr Sinclair, the Victorian Government expert, told the Commission that, so far, the Victorian Government brand had proved absolutely useless in the London market. Most honourable members who represent constituencies in which dairying is carried on, have received similar information from gentlemen who have visited the old country. The buyers in the London market have their own experts, and pay for the butter according to their judgment as to its quality. It is only natural that this should be so. It is well known that after transit from the Commonwealth to London, which extends over a period of seven or eight weeks, butter branded as second class frequently brings a higher price than that marked first class. Tiiis is due to chemical changes which take place during the voyage. The Minister also referred to the fact that butter branded as first class in one State would probably not be equal in quality to butter branded as"" first class in another State. Take Queensland and Victoria-tw o States in which the climatic conditions are very different. The quotations in London indicate plainly that the Queensland butter is not entitled to be placed in the same class as the Victorian product. This difference in quality between the products of the various States will lead to great difficulties in the application of any uniform system of grading. It would be unjust to Queensland to prejudice her products by marking them as inferior to those of New South Wales. learned member think that grading can be enforced ? press any opinion upon that matter. Perhaps tha Minister of Trade and Customs will be able to inform us upon the point The Minister further stated that he failed to understand the arguments of those who w^ere opposed to the grading of butter. He quoted largely from a report upon the New Zealand dairying industry, and also from a report of a Conference which was held He also pointed out that if at the Hawkesbury Agricultural College. He also read a letter that he had received from the Albury Co-operative Butter Company. That company does not occupy a very prominent position in connection with the butter industry in New South Wales, and one of the dtelegates at the Conference interjected that the Albury factory did not turn out more than one ton of butter per week. Yet the Minister quoted a letter from that company as representing the views of a large body of farmers, in favour of grading. The whole of the great cooperative butter companies of New South Wales are entirely against a system of compulsory grading. After several questions had been asked by delegates, the Minister saidIt was necessary to have certain brands to separate the first from the second quality, and the suggestion of one of the delegates,, he thought, was a good one; that was, lo recognise the 1 and A i qualities. Thus, Queensland butter would be classed as i , and Victorian best, recognised to be of superior quality, would be branded A i . These, however, were only suggestions. But the point I wish to make is 'that; these suggestions constituted a distinct departure from the statement which was made by the Minister upon the floor of this House. When the honourable gentleman left *he Conference, an attempt was made by the representatives of the Co-operative Company of New South Wales, to discuss the question of grading, but the acting chairman, Mr Campbell, at once said, "" Oh, this grading business is as dead as a door nail, and cannot be debated.""

What the delegates desired to do was fo discuss the whole of the Commerce Act, and to upset it if they could. that they had no intention of that sort. They merely desired to protest against the compulsory grading of the product in which they are so vitally interested. They were denied an opporunity of doing so. What was the result ? The representatives of the butter industry withdrew from the Conference. warded their protest, a copy of which is before me. representatives of the butter industry in New South Wales. With them was Mr Sinclair, the representative of the Queensland Butter Manufacturing Association. These gentlemen forwarded the following protest:That, in common with the delegates of the meat industry, we, the undersigned representatives of the dairying industry, respectfully decline to enter into the conference convened for the purpose of suggesting regulations under the Federal Commerce Act, and hereunder give some reasons for so doing :i . Because the insistence of Sir William Lyne to enforce compulsory grading of butter by regulation under the Commerce Act is opposed to all the first principles of commerce, and inimical to and an undue interference with the best interests of the producer. We consider the prejudging of a perishable commodity like butter (which is continually undergoing chemical changes) eight weeks before it is marketed in London is misleading and valueless to producers and consumers. This assertion is based upon our practical experience of the commodity, ancl upon the fact (hat the commercial representatives of the several co-operative distributing organizations in Victoria and New Soutli Wales (sent during the last two seasons to supervise sales, and report on the handling of our products in Great Britain), are unanimous in their opinion that the "" grade"" stamping on packages by the Government officials of New Zealand, Victoria, and Queensland, is useless and farcical in its results, and that the great majority of retailers absolutely ignore it, when purchasing, owing to its unavoidable irregularity and inconsistency. This view was also publicly endorsed during a visit to London of a director of the largest factory in Australasia. With the object of popularizing compulsory grading, the practice is to include under "" first grade"" a heavy percentage of factories. That is exactly what has taken place in New Zealand, where it has been shown time after time that large quantities of this article are passed as being of the first grade, when they are not entitled to that grade. The protest continuesThis, instead of raising the standard of the industry, has a strong levelling down tendency. 2. That the argument used by Sir William Lyne and others "" that under grade stamping forward purchases are effected in New Zealand for the whole season's output by London specuI know perfectly well lators "" is useless to the producers on this side, for the reason that climatic conditions, rainfall, & c , are not analogous, and for the still more important consideration that purchasing on this basis on a constantly changing market is mere gambling, and not commerce. In passing, I may say that the two large co-operative companies in New South Wales have taken the products of the farmer out The next day they forof the hands of speculative buyers, thus allowing the proiits upon them to find their These gentlemen are the chief way into the pockets of the producer. The document continuesOn the contrary, we consider that it should be the mission of all those who seek to legitimately assist producers to establish more direct communication with the consumers of Great Britain, over the heads of these large speculative buyers, whose interests and intermediary profits are naturally detrimental to the best interests of producers. The great bulk of the wool produced in the Commonwealth passes direct to the woollen manufacturers, and the butter producers of Denmark have by co-operati >e organization, achieved T the same result. Our-people are following in the footsteps of the people of Denmark, where this system has produced abnormal development. The dalegates proceedWe consider too much theoretical importance is given to the mere branding of packages. The Minister desires that these brands shall be placed upon the various packages in order that consumers in other parts of the world may be afforded some guarantee of Sheir quality. But the men who have built up this business in New South Wales, without any Government interference, and in the absence of any protective duty. dpsire to be left alone. They do not wish to be hampered in their efforts to develop the industry. Ever since its inception, the aim of this Parliament has been to interfere with the men who are settled upon the land. In the course of a few days, a series of regulations will, no doubt, be issued, which will have a disastrous effect upon the handling of these products.

He saysAs the representative of the Butter Manufacturers Association in Queensland, I desire to endorse the abovethat is, the protest which I have just read-and give additional reasons why the Federal Government should not thus interfere with State rights, and the trade liberties of producers. His individual protest was as follows :Without wishing lo be discourteous, I , on behalf of the Butter Manufacturers Association of Queensland, beg to withdraw from the conference. My primary reason for doing so is that I had a misapprehension concerning the objects for which we were' called together. Sir William Lyne assured the public, on the second reading of the CommerceB ill , that it was not a grading Act, but a Trades Description Act. The Vice-President of the Executive Council made the same statement. Mr dairying industry in that part of New South Sinclair continuesHe now states definitely that he intends to administer it as a grading Act, even to the extent of indicating on the packages the "" grade quality,""'that it will apply principally to dairy produce, and that not only will the produce be graded, but the States as well. I invite the attention of the Queensland representatives to this fact. Under the ing Commerce Act, the farmers of Darling pulsory Downs will not have their butter graded to be carried out under the Commerce Act, as by Federal officials, but the Queensland an undue interference with an important and butter will be graded second-class to that growing industry, of Victoria.

Minister of Trade and Customs proposes to issue them in a few days, and I wish 1 the honourable gentleman, before doing so, to give the people interested in the industry, who have not been consulted in any way. an opportunity to express their opinions on the matter. It is only fair that they should be consulted, and that I and other representatives of dairying districts should put their position before the House and the country. As the Vice-President of the Executive Council has made this little interruption, I should like to draw his attention to the fact that a large meeting to consider the matter was held in Lismore, which is in the constituency so well and honorably represented by himself. At that meeting there were present representatives from Alstonville, Ballina, Kyogle, Brooklet, Coraki, Lismore, Tweed, the r North Coast Co-operative Butter Companies, and Foley Bros. The Vice-President of the Executive Council will agree that the meeting fairly represented the Wales. A resolution was passed unanimously approving of the -action of thc butter delegates as a protest against the introduction of compulsory grading and branding. The following resolution was also unanimously passed: We, as delegates appointed by and representco-operative butter factories in the Richmond River district, hereby protest against the comgrading and branding of butter proposed' which has been built up by the themselves. It has been proved beyond question that any Government grade mark grading of the cream at the factory is the only means of maintaining and designating the quality and standard of butter. Such legislation has never been asked for by producers of the State, ancl it will entail a heavy additional I therefore protest expenditure, without any corresponding advantage to the industry. It was further resolved that the resolutions agreed to should be forwarded to the Minister of Trade and Customs by the honourable member for the district, and I I have since obhave .no doubt that the honourable gentle man has acceeded to the wishes of his constituents. Further, I may say that the Queensland Government have taken action in this matter, and instructed Mr Scriven, the Under-Secretary of the Stock and Agriculture Department, and one of the Queensland delegates to the Conference, to write are not any yet. a letter to the Comptroller-General of Customs in Svdney, objecting to what had been done. A reauest was made that the letter should be placed before the Minister, and I. have no doubt,that that request has been complied with.

If it were suggested that the persons engaged in this industry were manufacturing for local consumption or for export, an article unfit for human consumption, I would agree to interference by the Government. the sort is suggested, and it would appear to be the intention merely to place a host of officials upon the backs of the producers of Australia. able and learned member for Darling Downs and the honourable member for Richmond, as members of the Ministry representing constituencies deeply interested, should get the Minister of Trade and Customs to give the representatives of the great point is that, if we are to have this sysdairying industry of Australia an opportunity of being heard in so important a matter. It is said that a system of compulsory grading is to be carried out, because it will be of advantage to the industry. There is to be no such thing as voluntary grading, which has, so far, been carried out in Victoria and South Australia. Some time ago I remember that the honourable member for Boothby, who had considerable experience in South Australia, told the House that voluntary grading in 'that State had worked very well, and that it had been found to be an advantage to the industry that producers should have the right to export their products without inspection, because that had kept the Government grading officials up to the mark. On behalf of the producers of South Australia, the honourable member strongly resented interference by the Federal Government in the matter. well in America until a little time ago. with what was done in America, but certainly the inspection of meat carried out by Government officials in the United States has been of a very unsatisfactory character. Officials were appointed by the United States Government to inspect meat intended for local consumption and for export, and yet shameful frauds and iniquitous practices have prevailed in connection with the meat business there. That experience does not make us hopeful of the labours of Government officials in the grading and inspection of produce in the Commonwealth. The Lord knows what sort of officials we shall get, and they will be brought into direct opposition with the responsible men connected with the dairies throughout the country. Any one who is cognizant of the history of the dairying industry in New South Wales must be aware that since the co-operative companies came into existence their one object has been to secure the production of a good article. However, nothing of Where the product of any factory, when placed on the market, is found to be not up to the mark, a representative is sent to the factory to find out what is the matter. The honorThe result of the system oT inspection by the co-operative companies is that in New South Wales to-day, in the dairying industry, we are producing an article which is second to none, and we need not fear the competition of any other country. Another tem of compulsory grading, it is likely that the business will have to be carried on in future in accordance with the Government stroke. We have had enough of the Government stroke in the political history of the States in years gone by, and it is very inadvisable to attempt to introduce it into our Federal system. The old saying that "" distant hills are green "" applies particularly in this connection, because every one who desires to support the system of compulsory grading at once quotes New Zealand as an example. It is forgotten that New Zealand is peculiarly situated for the production of this article. With a good climate, a magnificent rainfall, and fresh grasses, those engaged in the dairying industry in New Zealand are able to produce an article of first-class quality, and a comparison of a country like New Zealand with Queensland, for instance, with her dry climate, is unworthy of attention. The success of the industry in New Zealand has been due, not to the adoption of a system of compulsory grading, but to the fact that the New Zealand Government, while favouring protective duties, impose no such duties upon implements and articles required by the man on the land. The farmers are able to get the agricultural implements, and everything else they require, at the cheapest possible rate, and with the additional advantage of their climate and rainfall those engaged in the dairying industry have been successful.",50,Labour Party And The

321,Mr Fuller,"I am not conversantAny one who has had any experience of the London market for dairy produce must know that experts take no notice of the New Zealand grading of butter, and that it is on the quality of the article that buyers make their purchases. We are told that the New Zealand butter which is graded brings the highest prices in the English market. That is quite true, but butter which is not graded brings just as high a price. I had the pleasure recently of inspecting the Grassmere factory, in the Warrnambool district, which is one of the finest butter factories I have ever seen, and I am aware that the product of that factory, and of other factories in Victoria, has brought as high prices in the London market as has the best New Zealand butter. It is, therefore, perfectly ridiculous to contend that the high prices received for New Zealand butter in the London market are due to the adoption of the system of compulsory grading, when we know that it is the quality of the article, and not the grading marks on it, which is of interest to the buyer. were strongly opposed to grading until it was tried. of that. mously in its favour. whether the New Zealand farmers have expressed such an opinion.

The Minister has received the protests which were sent through me.

He, as a member of that party, would be willing to continue to work with Mr Deakin, but before he so agreed he wanted to know what were Mr Deakin's programme and proposals. That was a very fair request to make, but it is a request with which the Prime Minister declines to comply. ther saidMr Deakin's programme at present was in a state of transition, if , indeed, it existed at all. That being so, the Labour Party had a right to be informed as to Mr Deakin's intentions before it entered in:o any agreement. The party had had no clear statement on this matter from Mr Deakin. Mr Deakin had declared that the question of Socialism waj one for the States, and that before the Federal Parliament could deal with it there would have to be an alteration in the Constitution. Under those circumstances it was fair to ask Mr Deakin whether he would alter tlie Constitution in order to make it possible to nationalize one or more existing monopolies. There is a straightforward demand on the part of the Labour leader that the Prime Minister of Australia should make a declaration about the progressive land tax, and also on the question of the alteration of the Constitution for socialistic purposes. No demand could be more clear or more insistent. The honourable member for Bland' I am stating facts when I say went on to sayThere was one concrete question that the Labour Party had put to Mr Deakin, and that was as to his intentions as to the progressive land tax to burst up the big estates. The party had a right to know what the other two parties meant in this connection. . He had said that intricate financial problems were involved, but he ( Mr Watson) denied that was the case. It was only an excuse, and did not justify the refusal of Mr Deakin to give the public an idea of his intentions. Since Parliament met, and the honourable member for Bland' came over to Victoria, he seems to have stopped that kind of talk, and we now learn that he is working heaven and earth in a private wav to call off all opposition to the Prime Minister.

The Chairman of the Shipping Commission told us, when he asked for the appointment of a Select Committee, that he would have nothing to do with the matter if he were not bent upon Socialism, and the whole object of this inquiry was to ascertain if the nationalization of tlie shipping industry of Australia was feasible. power to nationalize could be obtained by an amendment of the Constitution, and the leader of the Labour Party has challenged the Prime Minister to propose such an amendment. lenges are merely so much platform rhetoric.

That is how we differ. I wish to sav one or two words with regard to another matter. There seems to be a disposition to spend a little more public money in making additional appointments before the Government goes to the country. I see that one of the members of the Labour Farty has a motion on the business-paper which indicates an anxiety on his part to have a Lieutenant Governor appointed for Papua. I do not quite understand this, except it is desired to create another appointment for Papua. Of course, the It is very strange that, after all the great haste that was displayed in passing the Papua Bill through this Chamber, the Government should not have brought the new constitution into operation. We But, apparently, these chalwere told last session that it was necessary to pass the Bill in order to provide a system of government for Papua. It was reported that all sorts of 'dangers were The. honourable menacing the community there, and on _that ground the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, and the honourable member for Cowper, and others who held very strong opinions with regard to a certain matter, were induced to give way in order that provision might be made for a constitution without further delay. Seven months have been allowed to pass without any action having been taken to give Papua the constitution for which provision is made by Statute, and we have a right to some explanation. I venture to say that the Act would not have been passed in its present form had it not been for the appeal made by the Prime Minister upon the ground of urgency. Now, it appears that the Government do not want the constitution for Papua. I should like to know why. There is a vague statement in the Governor General's speech with reference to the matter, and thai is all that we know about it. Now, a private member suggests, even before the constitution is set up, that Castlemaine did a Lieutenant-Governor should b'e appointed. How does that honourable member know that the Government have not The Labour organ called already provided ""for a Lieutenant Governor? has taken independent action.

No one has recognised the present constitutional anomaly more than he has done, and he, of all persons, should sit quiet when matters relating to the alliance of the Government with the Labour Party are referred to. It is not so long since that he described the policy of the Labour Party as made up of 15 per cent, of practical politics arid 75 per cent, of bird-lime.

Less than a month ago Mr Ewing joined the Council of the Anti-Socialistic League; less than a fortnight age he was busy forming branches of the league in the northern rivers. Now he has taken office in a minority Ministry, which can only exist by, and with the co-operation of, the very party he pledged himself a few weeks since to strive to exterminate. That is the Vice-President of the Executive Council, to whose diatribe we have just listened ! It is somewhat difficult nowadays to get any answer from members of the Ministry, but I have to-night only a few questions to ask The deputy-leader of the Opposition referred to the trip made by the Treasurer to England, and I desire to express my sense of gratification at the right honourable gentleman's action. He was able to go to England for a considerable period, and it reflects great credit upon the officers of his Department that his absence should not have been felt. The right honourable .gentleman proceeded to England to gain information in connection with the consolidation of the States debts. Although the ground may to some extent have been cut from uncier his feet by the report prepared by Mr Coghlan on the subject, I still think he did much good while in England in advertising Australia, ancl in correcting many of the false impressions of the Commonwealth that were prevalent there. month in the mother country before every one knew that somewhere in these Southern Seas there was a lancl flowing with milk ancl honey, and the works of the right honourable gentleman. In advertising Australia the right honourable gentleman did signal service during the recess. things which he did in England reflect very great credit upon him. In the first place the right honourable gentleman delivered an outspoken address against the Commonwealth policy of borrowing. one has spoken in England so openly on that subject as did the Treasurer. No t at a l l ; we have not extravagant, and it was a proof that we were a careful people, because we had not borrowed anything yet; I did not say that we were not going to borrow. gentleman took credit for the fact that the Commonwealth had never borrowed anything. Commonwealth had been in existence for five years, and the fact that in that time we had never borrowed anything showed that Ave were not a reckless people. gentleman's remarks in this connection evoked greater cheering than anything else he said, and I hope now that he has got awav from that cheering he will put into operation his great principles, ancl will recognise that the Commonwealth should not borrow money, even for the construction of a railway which will cost manv millions. construction of the railway in the very same speech. right honourable gentleman explained that its construction would involve an expenditure which could only be met by the borrowing of ,£3,000,000 or £ 4 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 . Another matter upon which I must congratulate the right honourable gentleman was his steadfast advocacv of the principle underlying the Naval Agreement. A considerable amount of intriguing was going on for the purpose of representing the whole of the Commonwealth of Australia as being anxious to create an Australian Navv. The right honourable gentleman, who was known to every one in England as Treasurer of the Commonwealth, and one of our leading public men, threw himself into the fray in a most courageous spirit, and He had not bee.i a did such work that the Navy League elected him a vice-president. Addresses were presented to the, right honourable gentleman in which his actions were highly commended, and I am aware from mv own knowledge that his action in this regard did more than anything else to counteract Two the intrigues in favour of an Australian Navy then going on in London.

Although Federation has been in existence for six years, very little indeed has been done to co-ordinate the various postal services of the States. We still have in each of the States different system of postage in In addition to that, the postages are not uniform. There are different denominations of stamps in different States. I suggest to the Department that all its efforts should be directed towards co-ordinating these State services and arranging for uniform denominations of stamps so that wherever one goes in Australia one may be able to obtain the stamps that one requires. believe in a uniform penny postage system ? practicable at present. But a 'Commonwealth issue of stamps, with uniform denominations, is not an impossibility. Let me give an instance of the present lack of method. Honourable members are well aware that a ih<\. stamp is in some States extensively used. Australia there is no i j d . stamp.

I do not wish to take further advantage of the opportunity to discuss these questions this evening. I regret that I have had to occupy the attention of the Committee for some time in bringing them forward, but feel sure that those who take an intelligent interest in them will recognise that there is considerable force in the points I have raised. should not have attempted to detain the Committee at this stage, but for certain statements made by the deputy leader of the Opposition as to the possibility of Australia going, so to speak, to perdition under the present Administration. The honoraible member took up some time in explaining the differences between himself and the Labour Party, and treated the Committee to an electioneering address. permeated with the fear of the Opposition that there is a possibility of a straight-out fight taking place between them and the supporters of the Government at the next general election. It is all very well for the deputy leader of the Opposition to endeavour to arouse jealousy and fniction, but I shall not attempt to read ancient history, nor to indulge in recrimination. The honourable gentleman made accusations against Ministers, and asserted that they had done that for which they had no warrant from the country. He declared that they were not in a position to remain in possession of the Treasury benches. mav well ask ourselves whether the Opposition would allow the Government to remain in office another day if they had the num. bers necessary to oust them It was only yesterday that a former colleague of the leader of the Opposition publicly denied that he was under his leadership, and that being so, it ill becomes the deputy leader to accuse the Government of having two The n why did the Minparties behind them.

The ber will know all about that in due time. The honourable member for Parramatta condemned the Government for having failed to announce their policy for the next Parliament. It is only a few days since the leader of the Opposition complained that the programme announced by the Ministry was altogether too elaborate, and I should like honourable members to say whether we could have had a plainer statement of the intentions of the Ministry than was made by the Prime Minister on the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply.

I am in the business, and have no fear in that regard. A Victorian Act compels the inspection of butter before it can be put on board ship for export, and under that Act butter is graded in two classes. f h e CHAIRMAN that the honourable member is discussing the Australian Industries Preservation Bill? stated that there is a possibility of the Customs Department taking certain action under the Commerce Act, and, as the B ill makes provision for the administration of that Department, I hold that I am entitled to discuss the matter. It has been said by some that it is undesirable to place [21]2 a grade stamp on butter exported from Australia. But, strangely enough, although there has been no compulsory branding under the Victorian Act, during placed on 90 per cent, of the butter exported from the State, and no complaint has arisen therefrom. A t the same time, it is only fair to those engaged in the trade to say that the consent to use the grade stamp was obtained under a misunderstanding. Apparently, the Customs Department do not ask that any mark be placed on the butter-boxes other than that required to be placed there by the laws of the State, though it requires to be informed of the quality of the butter proposed to be exported. butter a farce? Are not the brands reWe have a State moved when tiie butter gets to the old country ? which can . be remedied. The honourable member, no doubt, is aware that legislation is now being passed in Great Britain to regulate the importation of food stuffs, and especially of butter. As I understood the reply of the Minister to those engaged in this business, all Tie requires is that a stamp shall be placed on their produce, In Victoria we have made an showing what it is; and he'is prepared to allow a certificate, testifying to the quality of the butter, to be supplied to the Department, and to be available for inspection if asked for where the butter is sold.

I shall be satisfied if thc Minister will give his consideration to this matter, and make some announcement in regard' to it when the Estimates are under consideration. Many of my constituents have written to me, and I have been in communication with the Department for several months on the subject.

The Minister of Defence informs me that having seen the report of Colonel Riccardo's remarks, he asked for an explanation. Colonel Riccardo stated in general terms that he never intended to say anything of the kind, and that he must have been misunderstood. The Minister was not satisfield with this, and asked Colonel Riccardo to definitely state whether or not he made the statements attributed to him. He then received from Coloned Riccardo a definite denial that he had made the statements.

It is about time that Parliament paid some attention to the wants of rifle clubs. In various places there are men who desire to band themselves together as members of rifle clubs, in order to practice rifle shooting, but no effort is made to provide them with a range. In two or three places in my electorate the riflemen cannot obtain a range, because the Department will do nothing in the matter. An inspector was sent round the country, and sites were pointed out to him, but nothing further was done. I should like to read a letter which bears on the subject. It reads as follows:I am directed to inform you that in all cases where it is desired to form rifle clubs, and no' c a n rifle range exists in the neighbourhood, it is necessary for the persons who wish to form the ciub to make all the requisite arrangements for the range, and then, if the site is approved of, a grant of ,£20 will be made. In the case to which I refer, at Ryl stone, the riflemen are unable to make any arrangement for a range, because the land will first have to be purchased. If it is desired to encourage rifle clubs, and to train riflemen, some effort should be made to provide ranges.",74,William Lyne I Think That He Triously Circulated Throughout Australia

If they sent an officer to the district they might be able to procure the land for nothing, whereas the local residents would have to pav for it. I should like to say a few words with regard to a matter that was referred to by the honourable member for Wentworth, namely, the necessity for providing some system of compensation or pensions for men who axe injured whilst serving in the Defence Forcesa system that would apply to men in all grades of the service. In this connection I should again like to mention the case of Colonel Price. I desire to know whether the Prime Minister has any intention of proposing, during the current session, that any compensation shall be granted to that officer?

I hope that the instruction which has recently been issued, to the effect that they shall not be allowed tea money unless they work until 10 p.m., will be withdrawn. Another question to which I wish to direct attention relates to the paypriation Act. In the case referred to by ment of increments to officers in that Department year a certain sum was provided for this purpose. That sum has been distributed, but its distribution has caused* considerable dissatisfaction. It has practically been allocated to the highly-paid officers. that now. injustice has consequently been done to the at once. In regard to the other matters tb lower-paid officers of the Department. I also understand that some trouble is being experienced iii connection with the payment of gratuities. I have been informed that the difficulty has been occasioned by certain objections which have been urged by a State Government. I hope, that this matter will receive early consideration, and' that the gratuities, so far as any proper claims are concerned, will be promptly paid. I regret that the lateness of the hour prevents the question from being adequately discussed, but I trust that the causes of the complaints to which I have referred will be speedily removed. surer) [11-33]--I "" reply to the honourable member for Yarra, I find that the Public Service Commissioner has recommended that the sum of ^550 shall be provided for the payment of increments to postal officials in Victoria, and £170 in Tasmania. There, has been a difficulty in satisfying these claims, and I am afraid that I have ibeen the chief obstacle to their settlement, inasmuch as I have refused to use the Treasurer's advance for the payment of salaries. In other words, I have declined to acknowledge the Public Service Act as an Appropriation Act. The provision relating to the minimum wage which was inserted in that measure I regard as I may inform one to which the Parliament has specially agreed, and have therefore made the necessary payments on the Commissioner's recommendation, from Treasurer's advance. I refuse, however, to use that fund generally for any other increments under the Commonwealth Publi; Service. Section 78 of the Public Service Act providesNothing in this Act shall authorize the expenditure of any greater sum out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, by way of payment of' any salary, than is from time to time appropriated by the Parliament for the purpose. It is perfectly clear that it was never intended that that-Act should be an Approthe honourable member for Yarra, I bave, Upon the Estimates of last however, been able to overcome the difficulty.

MrM c WILLIAMS (Franklin) [H.40J. -The honourable member for Maranoa han brought under notice a matter relating to our telephone system. The whole trouble seems to be that the Department seeks 'o apply hard-and-fast regulations, without the slightest consideration for the varying circumstances of different localities. There does seem to have been, in the framing of these regulations, an utter want of common sense and business knowledge. In my own electorate, as the result of the operation of the regulations, an application made for a telephone exchange in terms which would have given the Department 30 per cent, profit in advance, could not be accepted. The Acting Postmaster-General has kindly consented to go through the papers with me, and I hope that it will be possible to carry out the arrangement. Any attempt to apply to outlying districts a hard-andfast regulation applicable to cities, must fail' absolutely, and a regulation which prevents the Government accepting a proposal from which they would derive a profit of 30 per cent, in advance, should be rescinded.
