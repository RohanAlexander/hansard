I understand that they have been split to comply with various elements of section 55 of the constitution. These bills empower the Australian Communications Authority to tax the spectrum licensees for cost recovery purposes in the maintenance and management of the spectrum. Members will be aware that there is to be a new system for auctioning and licensing radiocommunications. The fact that this is to be done within the spectrum itself rather than tied to the receivers and the transmitters, as was the case in the past, is a change which I think is a step forward. In many ways, these bills try to harmonise the taxing of the spectrum and, therefore, the Labor Party will not be seeking to oppose them. Of course, we continue to support strong regulation for the spectrum to ensure that the public interest is protected-that, first of all, the public and commercial users of the spectrum know what their rights are-and that the interests of community broadcasters also are not ignored in making sure that people continue to have access to Australia's electromagnetic spectrum. I want to make a few comments about some of the consequences of this bill and some of the consequences of the proposed auctions that are mentioned in the bill. Firstly, I understand that the Australian Communications Authority is planning to run the auctions by using an online computer database with real-time bidding. The applicants will bid for packages of spectrum which fit into a particular plan. Applicants will also be issued with software and receive training on how to use the on-line computer bidding. One or two communications ministers have got into difficulty in the past in working out ways to allocate licences in communications, and pay TV of course is the obvious example. During the two years that I had the honour of being communications minister, we introduced an open auction system-an English auction system, I think, was the definition that was often used. estate. People would apply for the right to be bidders in the auction and they would have to meet certain criteria before they were given a paddle, allowing them to be bidders in the open auction system. Everyone knew what licence, what part of the spectrum, was being sold off and people could bid openly. I think the public got as close as possible to the fair market price",117,Notices D Increase State Revenues Through Stamp Duty

257,Mr Lee,"No, it was not the New Zealand model. It was a system like an auction for real7328 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 28 August 1997 for that spectrum. That is always the difficulty, making sure that the public do get a fair return from the sale of certain rights or access to spectrum. The department has been keen for a while to introduce on-line computer bidding, and I understand that it might have been trialled in the United States. I do not know how they judge the success of the auction in the United States, given that it is very hard to know how you measure the real value of something through different types of auction systems. I did have some concerns about how successful the on-line computer auction system would be and I have to say that, at the moment, my inclination would be to stick to the open auction system. But it will be interesting to watch how this government and this minister go in taking the courageous decision to move to the new system for allocating this part of the spectrum. Of course, we will be watching with interest how those auctions go. One of the bands to be auctioned includes the 800 megahertz and 1.8 gigahertz spectrum. In debates in the past I have raised my concerns about what that might mean for the community. It is my understanding-and it has been confirmed by the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston, in a letter to me-that the signal for these higher frequency communications devices will only travel a short distance before there are difficulties with signal strength. As a result, the next generation of mobile phones-some people call them PCS-will be using the 800 megahertz and 1.8 gigahertz system. But, as the signal will only travel half the distance, when companies purchase the rights to use this spectrum and introduce the next generation of mobile phone towers, to make that system work they will have to install twice as many mobile telephone towers as we have today. Given how much opposition there has been to date to the existing mobile telephone tower network, imagine the effect of the number of mobile telephone transponders doubling: that has to be the inevitable result of the government proceeding down the path outlined here. I am not sure if the minister has explained that to his backbench, who I understand have raised a few questions in the party room about mobile telephone towers, but perhaps at next Tuesday's meeting they might ask whether the minister has written to the opposition and told us that, in fact, there will be many more mobile telephone towers as a result of the auction for the 800 megahertz and 1.8 gigahertz system going ahead. He has certainly told us; I hope he has told you. off to the independent arbitrator-the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency-which I thought would be pretty tough on any proposals that generated controversy. I am not sure that the current system has solved some of the problems that have been raised in many communities right around Australia-in your own electorate, no doubt, as well as in mine. The simple point I am trying to make is this: imagine having twice as many towers as we have today! That will be the inevitable result of the next part of the plan going ahead. The other point I would like to make briefly is that we all know that the analog mobile telephone network is scheduled to shut down in the year 200D-at the moment I think the date will be 1 January 2000. I know that the minister has publicly stated that he intends to keep Some of that spectrum active to allow people in the bush the ability to continue to use their analog mobile phones after the year 2000. That is a commendable step. One of the reasons it is commendable is that, despite the three mobile telephone companies spending a lot of money on building the digital telephone network, the quality of the digital network still does",119,Representatives Main Committee

Especially for people who move around on the outskirts of capital cities-let alone for people in the bush-the digital system is not as good as the analog system is. for users, I am sure, to have frequent drop-outs so that people have to re-call. Frankly, if the telephone companies are not meeting the promises they made to the public to provide a service of equal quality to that of the analog system, some tough questions have to be asked. If the digital network cannot match the quality of the analog network, maybe the minister has to consider whether he puts back that date of 1 January 2000.

I am not sure if people realise it, but the Olympics in Barcelona were probably before large numbers of people were using digital mobile telephones with the ability to be used in other countries. As far as the last Olympics, in Atlanta, were concerned the Americans had, and still have, a system that is completely incompatible with every other country. That means, of course, the Sydney Olympics will be the first occasion on which the Olympics will be held in a country when people can bring their own mobile telephones from most other countries. People will be coming to Australia as part of the Olympic family, as I think it is becoming known-people who are brought along by sponsors, people who are involved in international sporting organisations or people who are coming to the Olympics just because they love to see the Olympics-from countries where, I am sure, they have mobile telephones that are compatible with the Australian system. Since we will be the first country that is holding an Olympics with a mobile telephone system which is compatible with other countries, there is going to be a real risk that our digital telephone system will collapse because of the massive demand. There is going to be so much demand for the use of those systems that the system will clog up and, if it does not collapse, certainly it will be very difficult not just for ordinary Australian citizens who live in those areas but for the visitors to our country to ensure that they do have a proper service. I seem to recall that there are some technical limitations to how many base stations and how much additional capacity you can build into a network such as the digital network we have in Australia. I would expect and hope that Telstra, Vodafone and Optus are doing all they can to boost the capacity of the network around the areas where many of the people will be. Of course, it is not just a matter of the people who are coming to watch the games. I think 30,000 journalists alone are coming to cover the Olympics. We certainly need to make sure that we are providing as good a service as possible. If the government is allowing the analog system in the bush to survive a bit longer, one option is that we might ask whether the government should also consider allowing the analog system to remain up and running in Sydney for an extra year to get us through the peak in",120,Representatives Main Committee

That would mean that many Sydney siders, who otherwise would be forced to convert from analog to digital by 1 January 2000, might keep their analog phones that extra year and there would be less pressure and less demand on the digital system. I hope the government might consider that suggestion and perhaps get some advice on it. There might be reasons why that is not practical and not an idea worthy of further consideration, but it is worth exploring. Following those suggestions, I repeat that the opposition will not be opposing either of these bills. We think that they further advance the reform in the communications area. member for Dobell( Mr Lee) today to the radiocommunications legislation debate. The government is not afraid to listen to contributions from those on the other side and to take on board some of the serious suggestions that the honourable member has just made with regard to the Sydney Olympics and the potential pressure that could be on our mobile phone network. After all, Australians have had a reputation for a high take-up in technological matters. We have probably the highest proliferation of video cassette recorders in the world and mobile phone usage, I submit, is probably way up with the top handful of countries as well. If there are going to be 30,000 extra journalists in Sydney for the 2000 Olympics, you can imagine about 40,000 mobile phones attached to them. We can certainly see that there could be additional pressure. As long as we are not going to impose on the Australian taxpayer, and the telephone system in general, an unreal additional burden to accommodate the temporary additional usage of phones, we should be looking at some mechanism to accommodate them. The matters here today are also equally important. BeforeI go on to the bill in particular, I want to answer a couple of matters raised in the debate by the honourable member with regard to telecommunication towers. One of the things that Minister Alston has done since becoming the Minister for Communications and the Arts is to introduce and have passed the telecommunications legislation of 1997 which encourages the sharing of facilities and the sharing of towers. Whilst we have heard of the potential for proliferation of additional towers in the contribution from the honourable member, as a result of the changes which we made to the previous government's telecommunications regime there are more opportunities and demands for telecommunications carriers to co-locate. The erection of towers is now a matter for state and territory governments and local councils to determine and no longer a matter that is directly within the bailiwick of the federal government. The carriers certainly do not have the immunities that they used to have under the previous Labor government's act. It is also fair to say there are many factors that may determine the requirements as far as towers are concerned, so it is not inevitable that we will see a doubling of the number of towers. The government has addressed a lot of those matters. I only intended to speak for a few minutes on the bills themselves. I simply wanted to be associated with these new arrangements which are sensible and somewhat procedural in their nature. They are certainly straightforward enough and are not opposed by the Labor opposition. In fact, from the outset, they had their origins in a bipartisan committee suggestion in 1991 when the report Management of the radiofrequency spectrum was released by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. I am honoured to be a member of that committee in its current incarnation and I note the presence",121,Representatives Main Committee
263,Mr Hardgrave (Moreton) (10.28 A.m.),"I welcome the contribution by the honourableThursday, 28 August 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 7331 here this morning of the very effective chairman of our committee, the member for Lyne( Mr Vaile). What we have here is a government that is prepared to listen to private members' contributions through the committee system. Unlike the previous government, we have taken those suggestions on board and we have legislation here that is going to take those suggestions and bring them into law. There is a provision for an annual spectrum maintenance licence fee. As I said, the current government has shown itself supportive of the role of backbench members and that idea came straight from that committee years ago. The bills before us seek to apply and collect an annual spectrum licence fee and to recover spectrum maintenance costs from spectrum licences issued under the Radiocommunications Act 1992. This is not so much a new tax but simply a better form of taxing or charging or levying spectrum licensees who benefit from spectrum maintenance practices, including international coordination, domestic planning, interference investigation and policy development, carried out by what was known as the Spectrum Management Agency and since 1 July the Australian Communications Authority-the ACA. The ACA does all those different jobs on behalf of all radiocommunications licensees, so it is appropriate for spectrum licensees to contribute to the recovery of the various costs associated with access to spectrum and the services provided by the ACA by paying a proportionate share of an annual spectrum maintenance tax. It simply is a user-pays system and it is far better than the old approach which will go as a result of these bills. There has never been a spectrum based arrangement until now. Equipment licensees have been the ones to pay these various maintenance costs. These bills will tidy up inconsistencies between the licensing systems for spectrum and equipment as well as ensuring accountability via transparency, so that spectrum licensees are well aware of the ongoing costs of spectrum management they pay. This is important because the ACA will actually determine the amount of the tax that is charged, which is presently the case for apparatus licences. While there is no set maximum limit on the tax which can be imposed, there certainly are checks in the system, including powers under section 235 of the Radiocommunications Act which can be exercised by the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston). This is an area of public policy which is highly flexible; it is dynamic; it is changing exponentially in so many ways. Spectrum licences can be traded, subdivided and amalgamated, which could lead to the possibility that a single licensee could hold a large proportion of spectrum in a particular band. The amendments contained in these bills enable all radio communication licensees to share the costs of the provision of an efficient spectrum management service in Australia by the new ACA. The two key things that people in communications and, in particular, in the media, want is content and also means of distribution. As far as spectrum, even for mobile technology, is concerned, people in the general media, the Packers and the Murdochs, see the role of mobile telephony and mobile technology as being part of the future as far as they and their aspirations are concerned. It is important that the government understands that a regime such as this is growing and there are all sorts of possibilities. These bills certainly provide that flexibility. Perhaps the best part about these bills is that the processes are transparent, they are accountable and there are built-in limits on the discretion of the bureaucracy administering these matters. I commend the bills to the House. 7332 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 28 August 1997 Foreign Affairs) (10.35 a.m.)-In the absence of the minister representing the minister for communications in the House of Representatives, I will make a few brief remarks to sum up the debate on the Radiocommunications (Spectrum Licence Tax) Bill 1997 and the Radiocommunications Legislation Amendment Bill 1997. As the member for Dobel1 ( Mr Lee) pointed out in the beginning of his speech, the purpose of these two bills is to harmonise the tax regime of the radiocommunications spectrum to recover the costs of the maintenance of the spectrum. When we talk about the sorts of things that comprise the maintenance of a spectrum, we can think of things such as the international coordination of it, the planning of it domestically and the investigation of interference in the spectrum. The general policy development of the spectrum had until now been carried out by the Spectrum Management Agency, which from 1 July this year became the Australian Communications Authority or the ACA. There has been a little concern, I think, that the agency has perhaps unfettered discretion in being able to set the amount of tax to be paid by users of the spectrum. This is not so, because any determination made by the agency will be a disallowable instrument and, further, under section 235 of the Radiocommunications Act 1992, the minister has power to direct the agency in relation to the performance of its functions and the exercise of those powers. The member for Dobell also adverted to some likely difficulties with the spectrum around the time of the Olympics when a lot of visitors to a certain part of Sydney are going to be carrying mobile telephones with them. He made a couple of helpful suggestions and we will take them on board. This is probably not the first time that a large number of observers, journalists or otherwise, have gathered in a particular place seeking to use mobile telephony to communicate with their home bases. I can think, for example, of the Gulf War where many of the world's media gathered to observe that conflict. My observation of that was that they brought with them the temporary capacity to transmit their messages to their communications network back home. I expect that they will have to do much the same come the Olympics because, as the member for Moreton( Mr Hardgrave) said, it is not entirely the responsibility of the Australian taxpayer, through the federal government, to provide permanent capacity for a sudden influx of such instruments into a particular part of Australia. But I am sure that that issue will be dealt with in due course both by the federal government and, hopefully, by a Collins government in the state of New South Wales. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bills read a second time. Bills-by leave-reported to the House without amendment.

It is the sequel to the famous Ships of shame report and I commend the committee on producing this subsequent report with respect to this very important issue. The report reinforces the message that emerged from the original Ships of shame inquiry, namely that the operation of particular vessels in Australian coastal waters produces some very serious problems that Australia has yet to fully address. These problems include extreme exploitation of workers. Workers are sometimes bashed, denied food, put in outrageous circumstances, deprived of wages or, when they are paid, they are paid at an extremely low level. Some of the horrific stories that have emerged with respect to the treatment of workers on many of the vessels that ply Australian and international waters are of great concern. They are Dickensian circumstances that in most of the world-certainly in Western world economic activity-were eliminated a long time ago with, perhaps, one or two exceptions such as certain types of outwork. The prevalence of ships of shame exposes us to very serious safety problems. The reports of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority indicate that there are a substantial number of ships serving in the Australian industry internationally and registered in flag of convenience states that regularly have very serious safety deficiencies that inevitably, from time to time, result in disaster. These deficiencies are of particular concern not only for the lives of those on board the vessels but also, in certain circumstances, for those in the immediate vicinity if the vessels are in port-for example, the risk of fire could be a serious hazard to others, apart from the crewmen on the vessel. The environmental concerns are particularly of great concern to Australia as a nation. We have got such a vast coastline, and so much of that coastline is of extreme importance to our tourism industry and the broader environment. The Great Barrier Reef is an obvious example, but is one of only a number of examples. In recent times we have had disasters, such as the Sanko Harvest and the Kirki, that indicate just how serious these threats are and the sort of damage that could be done to our marine environment and our tourism industry by a disaster involving a flag of convenience vessel: the possibilities really beggar the imagination. These are very serious issues for Australia. Thus far, in spite of the best efforts of AMSA, which does do a very good job in inspecting vessels and enforcing regulations, we have failed to fully grapple with the issue. In that context, as the shadow minister for transport I and the opposition generally have considerable concerns with respect to the recommendations of the recent inquiry which is still the subject of discussions between the minister and the various parties interested in Australian shipping. It proposes to abolish cabotage. This means that the extent to which flag of convenience vessels, and foreign registered vessels generally, will be able to operate in",124,Representatives Main Committee
265,Mr Tanner (Melbourne) (10.41 A.m.),"I wish to make some very brief remarks on this7334 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 28 August 1997 Australian waters will be significantly increased because domestic routes will be opened up to foreign involvement. So initially we have a concern that, as well as vessels engaged in international trade being a serious risk to the Australian environment and to workers engaged on them-and to the Australian community generally-we will have a situation where vessels of that type will also be able to trade in the domestic Australian shipping industry. This is of particular concern because in reality this amounts to the first introduction of guest workers into the Australian economy, something that is common in many parts of the world, particularly in the Middle East and in some parts of Europe. What it means is that foreign workers, paid perhaps $200 a week or maybe less-but very unlikely to be much more and substantially less than the equivalent rate for Australian workers-will be able to work in the domestic Australian transport industry. The fundamental flaw with the notion of abolishing cabotage is that you cannot really stop there. If you are running a trucking company or a private rail line or even a charter aviation company, and the domestic shipping industry is able to employ foreign workers at substantially lower rates of pay than the Australian award rates, then it is difficult to see why you should be discriminated against and why you should not be able to do the same thing. The inevitable logic of allowing the open slather employment of foreign workers at a fraction of the rate that is provided for in the Australian award in domestic shipping is that you do the same thing for people who are driving trucks or driving trains or flying planes on the equivalent route because, even though there is a distinction between the freight task that is performed, there is a substantial competitive overlap. That can be seen in numerous examples. In the choices that are made by people who ship cargo there is a substantial competitive overlap. So if there is a change in the balance favourable to shipping because it can employ people at much, much cheaper rates than the standard Australian award rates, the end result is that there will be a shift. Others who compete with shipping in different transport modes, particularly in rail but also to a lesser extent road transport, will then be entitled to say, 'If they can have cheap foreign labour, why can't we?' Australia has a labour market regulatory structure that applies to our domestic economy. Shipping between Australian ports is part of our domestic transport system, part of our domestic economy, and should therefore be part of our domestic labour market regulatory structure. In closing, I will just refer to a few of the recommendations of this sequel to the Ships of shame report, and I certainly would urge the government to pay very careful considerations to them. One recommendation in the report is that ILO convention 147 should be ratified by the government. I would certainly support that. The report also recommends a detailed system of inspection for vessels whose owners are applying for single voyage permits or continuous voyage permits, which provide the flexibility in the cabotage arrangements and which mean a significant number of foreign vessels are plying our coast in the domestic trade where no domestic ship is available. This should only occur after a thorough examination and inspection of the vessel concerned to ensure that it is safe and that you do not have a serious environmental disaster or safety hazard to those on board or to other parties. Another recommendation is that insurance requirements applying to shipping be tightened to ensure that the protection for the Australian community is maximised. Thursday, 28 August 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 7335 I commend the committee for its work on the report. I certainly believe the government should take its recommendations seriously and it should not implement the recommendations of the Manser report with respect to the abolition of cabotage. I believe that would be contrary to the whole notion of labour market regulation in Australia. We are a nation of citizens who have certain rights and obligations with respect to our labour that do not apply to non-Australian citizens, people who are domiciled in other countries, other than through appropriate mechanisms-through immigration law and visas and the like. I commend the report to the committee and to the government. Debate (on motion by Mr Andrews) adjourned. ANL LIMITED Report Debate resumed from 27 August, on motion by Mr Reith: That the House take note of the paper. with respect to the annual report of the Australian National Line. It is of some interest because the ANL has been controversial in the past few years, and it is worth making note in the parliament of its progress in recent times. It is vital to understand the background to the ANL's current circumstances, the history of the organisation and also the changing climate in which it has to operate. The genesis of ANL emerged from the need by our young nation 60 or 70 years ago to stand up for itself against the monopolistic or cartel characteristics of British shipping lines. In those days, of course, they dominated world shipping. ANL was a very important means of ensuring that Australia was not being charged grossly excessive shipping prices by British shipping lines. It was not favoured by the conservative parties at the time, because in many respects they had formal and informal links with the people in Britain who owned the shipping lines. ANL and its predecessor had a difficult task staying in existence because of the general opposition of the conservatives, but nonetheless played a very valuable role. ANL was also important in ensuring that transport links, particularly freight links, were maintained with various remote parts of Australia that at that stage were not served by adequate road networks: certain parts of Queensland, Western Australia and, indeed, across Bass Strait. It had a task that in a sense has been outgrown because of the development of other transport modes: aviation, road transport, rail transport and the like. Decades went by without an acknowledgment of that changing task, or the fact that these two aspects of ANL' s origins were no longer particularly relevant. In recent years there has been a glut of international shipping because of the break-up of the Soviet Union and the change in economic orientation of China. This has meant that the international shipping arena is becoming increasingly cut throat, to the detriment of ANL. In a sense, international shipping is a gigantic international tax avoidance industry. All sorts of extraordinary activities go on there. The desperation for getting cargo and the desperation of seamen from ThirdW orId countries to get work, sometimes in the most appalling circumstances, have acted to shift the competitive balance substantially adversely to ANL and to Australian seamen. For many years these issues were not addressed, but they surfaced in a very stark way in the early nineties. ANL continued on largely unchanged for many years, but the impact started",125,Representatives Main Committee
266,Mr Tanner (Melbourne) (10.50 A.m.),"I would like to make some quick observations7336 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 28 August 1997 to emerge in the early to mid-nineties. To his credit, the former Minister for Transport, the member for Kingsford-Smith( Mr Brereton) bit the bullet and addressed these problems in 1994-95. In particular, he established a new board for ANL which was charged with refocusing the organisation, turning around its deteriorating finances and reforming its whole approach. Certainly there were some significant question marks about how ANL had been administered in the period prior to the intervention by the then Minister for Transport. I do not mean administration by previous ministers, but internally. Some matters clearly needed to be addressed with respect to budgeting and dealing with particular routes and a variety of other factors. It is interesting to note that prior to dealing with abnormals, the operating loss for ANL in this annual report for 1995-96 is $11 million. That is not necessarily a particularly happy state of affairs, but it is certainly an improvement on the preceding year's $19 million. It is interesting to note that Mr Kym Bills from the department said recently in Senate estimates that the 1996-97 loss, which presumably we will have details of in the near future, is expected to be halved again. If we are seeing a pattern in a $19 million loss going down to a $11 million loss, down to a $5 or $6 million loss, at least it is heading in the right direction. The changes that were introduced by the then Minister for Transport, the member for Kingsford-Smith, much as they have been criticised both then and in recent times by the then opposition-now the government-are paying dividends. The organisation has been turned around. The necessary hard decisions have been made and ANL is getting back on an equal footing. Even if abnormals are included-and it is interesting to note that this is the standard practice by the current minister when dealing with Australian National, our national railway corporation-the drop in the loss has been from $30.9 million in 1994-95 to $6.3 million in $1995-96. If abnormals are included, the reduction in the loss is even more stark. I would like to congratulate the new board and management of ANL for turning around the organisation over that period of time. It was desperately needed and quite clearly there is a major change in direction and a streamlining of the organisation that has actually started to pay dividends. It is interesting to note that, in opposition, the current Minister for Transport and Regional Development ( Mr Sharp) attacked the Labor government for failing to address ANL's problems and for failing to do anything. He has been in government now close to 18 months and over that time his track record of doing anything with respect to ANL stands at precisely zero. The coalition has made mutterings about selling ANL. We are yet to see any action on that front and, in some respects, I hope that he continues to do nothing. Given his track record, it is likely that any intervention on his part will actually make things worse. As things stand at the moment, the board and management are getting the organisation back on track to a point where it does have some future, albeit as a niche player and potentially, I suspect, as a player in alliance with a larger international shipping company. I suspect that the ultimate pattern that will emerge in international shipping is going to reflect what is happening in international aviation, where you will see alliances emerge, based on particular market strengths, between larger and smaller players. It would certainly be logical for ANL to become a niche player that is connected with a larger international shipping company, so that some of the problems that ANL has with backloading, for example, because Thursday, 28 August 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 7337 of the configuration of our exports and imports being so different, can potentially be addressed as a result of arrangements with other allies in the shipping industry. We do have to concede that ANL's future is very much problematic because of its size. I met with leaders of the Chinese shipping company, Cosco, or its manifestation in Australia, Five Star Shipping, late last year-from memory. In complete innocence, they asked me how many ships our national shipping line had and told me how many ships their national shipping line had. My answer to their question was six, I think, at the time. Their answer to me was 868 which is a good indication of the difficulty that ANL faces in the international shipping arena, when it has got players of that size competing against it. It has clearly only got a niche role to play. Nonetheless, there are significant possibilities there that I think we should be exploring. I commend the report to the committee and commend the management, staff and workers of ANL and the new board for having achieved a very substantial improvement over the last year or two. I trust that that improvement will continue. Debate (on motion by Mr Andrews) adjourned. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER ( Mrs Sullivan)-I ought to point out that in putting those adjournment motions, I suppose strictly I ought to put the question that they be adjourned to a later hour this day. I understand there is a possibility that at least one of the reports we have adjourned will be resumed in debate later today. Aviation Safety Regulation Debate resumed from 27 August, on motion by Mr Prosser: That the House take note of the paper. safety regulation is a breath of fresh air to many of us involved in the industry. At this point, I consider it necessary to explain my position in the industry. Unlike many in the parliament, I am a pilot of approximately 1,000 hours experience. I am endorsed on several different types of aircraft, and I own and operate my own twin engine Cessna 310 aircraft, which I have owned for approximately eight years. Last, but not least, I have my own maintenance facility, fully approved and registered by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. Because of my experience, I believe I can talk on this topic with some authority. The Minister, John Sharp, has produced scathing attacks on the industry in the past, and rightly so. The aviation safety industry has been lacking leadership and control for far too long and has never had teeth. The minister has discussed in depth in his ministerial statement the Monarch and Seaview accidents, and I will touch on another. Fundamentally, the reason disciplinary action has not taken place is that the people who were involved in the field were not able to fully exercise the delegations available to them under the act. While employed, the airworthiness surveyors would identify a breach, or a potential problem, and report it to their immediate superiors, but it was then failed to be acted upon. That is not the fault of the surveyor but the decision making process of management, and this has been the problem all along. I now allude to a perfect example: the hot-air balloon accident near Alice Springs in approximately 1988. It is relevant to note that it was common knowledge to the department",127,Representatives Main Committee
267,Mr Marek (Capricornia) (11.00 A.m.),"by leave-The minister's statement on aviation7338 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 28 August 1997 that this operator continually flouted the regulations and that nothing was ever done. In one particular incident, it is alleged that the operator took off from the Alice Springs aerodrome and then nearly collided with the aerodrome control tower. The balloon accident in Alice Springs was one of the worse ballooning accidents in the history of the world. There were several fatalities when that balloon crashed. That is one of many examples of similar incidents that occurred under the past regime. I now refer to my experience with my maintenance facility in Rockhampton. Since the minister has taken a grip on the industry and made positive changes as a result of his own personal experience in the industry, the people in the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, especially in Brisbane, do a mighty job. They are a credit to their office. I have had the pleasure of dealing personally with the airworthiness inspectors while setting up my own maintenance facility. They were most helpful. Their attention to detail and their requirement that every detail was met may seem to some a bureaucratic nightmare and far too much red tape, but aviation maintenance is one field where any lacks, breaches or poor workmanship can mean a complete accident and, of course, destruction of the aircraft. I commend the people in the Brisbane office for their efforts. They do a mighty job and they are a real credit to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. The regulators need muscle to be effective, and the thrust of this government is to give them teeth. As far as I am concerned, the minister has done a mighty job in tidying up the industry. You can obviously see from dealing with and talking with surveyors, inspectors and some of the people in the senior management of CAS A and, of course, airworthiness as well, that people are trying to adjust and trying to get their industry up to date and on track. I commend them. I commend the minister and I thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker, for this opportunity. are debating this morning is an attempt by the Minister for Transport, the honourable John Sharp, to redirect the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and air safety regulation in this country. No-one more than the minister has been aware of the failings of civil aviation regulation in this country in the past, and no-one is more determined to get it right for the future. This task is important to all Australians. Aviation safety matters not just to pilots and passengers and those who live under the flight paths but, indeed, to the reputation of our country, to the security that we all need as regular passengers, and to those who need to use the services of the aviation industry. Regulatory arrangements are important to guarantee this safety, but it is difficult to know of a regulatory body anywhere that has been subjected to such universal disapproval as the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. I know it is not a popular or an easy job to be a regulator. No policeman has a lifestyle that is full of happiness and joy. They sometimes have to make difficult decisions. Sometimes they have to do things that are tough in the state or national interest, but everyone expects that those decisions will be made with a degree of compassion, wisdom, and particularly accuracy. It has been the incapacity of CASA to act consistently and reliably that has caused such concern. We need a regulatory body that is competent and that people have confidence in. It has been a sad reflection on the board of CASA and its administrators, particularly in the early life of this government, that they have devoted most of their time, it seems, to arguing with the minister, unwilling to recognise that he was determined to make changes. Some of the board members seemed to be more interested in protecting their own position than in",129,Representatives Main Committee
268,Mr Truss (Wide Bay) (11.04 A.m.),"The statement on aviation safety regulation that weThursday, 28 August 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 7339 ensuring the competence of safety regulation in this country. They have treated the government with contempt. The chairman is still in position, even though it has been made abundantly clear to him that the government wishes him to resign. There seems to be this interest in personal positions rather than caring for regulation of safety in Australia. This is a matter of serious concern. In the past, there has been a lot of criticism of laxness in policy administration and several serious air incidents in Australia have been attributed in no small way to the inadequacies of CAS A. It has been an organisation which has a long record of discord and disharmony. The minister himself commented in the House, prior to becoming a minister, on the Monarch air situation. He said: The CAA has obviously fallen down in its prime responsibility to conduct safety regulation of civil air operations in Australia. It has no excuses. The CAA has been given the teeth. The problem is that they are not using them. In the Plane safe inquiry chaired by Mr Morris, the preface is an appalling indictment of the culture that existed in CASA at the time. It says: The inquiry has been characterised by personality conflict, unsubstantiated allegations, a venom and viciousness not experienced by committee members in previous inquiries. A little later in the preface, it states: The report reveals a regulator at war with itself and under constant attack from vested interests within the general aviation and commuter industry. This is really a very serious indictment of what has been happening within our aviation regulator. It is natural, therefore, that any government that is serious about its responsibilities will want to act to ensure that something is done about improving safety regulation in this country. There has been change within CASA not only with the appointment of extra and new board members but also in the attitudes of the administrative body. I am not sure that they are all for the better. There is a determination within some elements of CASA to vigorously enforce petty regulations. In fact, one person, who deals regularly with CAS A in these sorts of matters, described what is happening in CASA at the present time as 'a campaign of administrative brutality.' CASA seems to be spending a great deal of time on trivial paperwork offences-desperate, it seems, to get up the number of breaches that it identifies-but most of these are in such trivial areas that they are not a threat to passenger safety. They merely increase the score for the authority. I am told that recently they spent two days in court, after lengthy investigations, and achieved at the end a $400 fine-while at the same time there continue to be complaints about matters that really are worthy of serious investigation. I am concerned that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority is spending its time on trivial paperwork matters which, whilst they should never be ignored, are not fundamental to dealing with aviation safety issues. I also remain concerned about the quality, training and experience of many of the regulators themselves. It seems to me that, on many occasions, CAS A staff are placed in the position of supervising the activities of people who have experience vastly greater than, and training vastly superior to, that which the regulators themselves have received. Flying operations inspectors get 39 hours training time per annum-vastly less than those who are actually operating in the industry-yet they are the people who are supervising the pilots and the aviation industry. 7340 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 28 August 1997 There have been many instances reported of supposed flying operator inspectors indicating breaches when in fact, on further scrutiny, it has been found that people were not breaking the laws at all. There have been issued many notices of non-compliance which later had to be withdrawn because they simply were not non-compliant. I appreciate that the aviation regulations are complex and difficult to decipher-and, some people say, self-contradictory from time to time. But if in fact our inspectors are not able to understand them, how can ordinary operators within the industry know what is going on? A constituent told me of an example of a flying operations inspector for CASA seeking to hire one of his helicopters but having insufficient recent operating experience for the constituent to be willing to entrust his helicopter to the CASA official. Yet, the next day, this inspector is supervising helicopter pilots in this country and assessing whether they are competent to operate. There are still serious problems in ensuring that CASA attracts appropriately qualified staff to be able effectively to do the work that is assigned to them. It is of course essential that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority have substantial powers. It must have the capacity to ground an airline if there are serious safety breaches. It must have the capacity, without having to wait for court orders and the like, to act immediately if passengers are at risk. On the other hand, CAS A has the power to ground operators for mere technical breaches or matters that are perhaps of little substance; and that is a matter of concern. I am concerned that operators have their licences removed for trivial matters and are left incomeless and with no capacity to have their circumstances reviewed in the short term. Once charges are laid, they go to court, and of course it can take many months before matters are finally determined. But, in that period, the operator may have no licence and therefore will not be able to operate. It seems to me that there is a denial of natural justice when a licence is removed and a pilot or operator has no capacity to have that action immediately reviewed. This is something that needs to be examined in the legislation. There must be a capacity for somebody who has their licence removed to be able to appeal and get an immediate determination on whether that action is reasonable. It is no good-six months later, when charges are dismissed in courttelling the man he can have his licence back, if his business has already been lost. This is really 'guilty until proven innocent' stuff that has no place in the Australian system of justice and fair play. These are matters that clearly need to be reviewed. I would also like to refer to some of the other problems that are occurring and are regularly being brought to members' attention in relation particularly to the examination system for new pilots. In this area there are a number of matters of serious concern. Mr Bill Hamilton, the new President of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association of Australia, has written to all members expressing concern about the new examination papers. He said: It's pretty lucky that we have the expression ""on a wing and a prayer""; because a prayer is exactly what you will need if you are going to sit for the IFR WRITTEN EXAM. CASA is at it again; bad organisation, poor airrnanship and absolutely hopeless administration. In the last year the IFR WRITTEN EXAM pass mark has gone down to as little as 10% of the candidates-Why? BECAUSE CASA IS FAILING CANDIDATES WHO OUGHT TO PASS. They are doing it with bad questions and bungling the answers in company with a computer marking reader that can't read the answers! This is no way to maintain safety standards. AOPA has asked major teaching organisations in four States of Australia and the whole sorry story is the same all over the country. Bad questions, ambiguous answers. Many of the flying schools said that the questions could not be answered by properly trained candidates. Thursday, 28 August 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 7341 CASA won't tell anyone what the exam questions are, so we can only guess about what is asked but when CAS A gave us an example of their questions, they can't even get it right themselves! He then referred to answers in the CAS A Flight Safety Australia autumn 1997 magazine. He went on to say: Four choices are offered as the correct answer to Question7 and three of them are right (it just depends on where you are in the approach). How do you pick the correct one? Guesswork? That's great isn't it if your exam pass, or your son's or daughter's, depends on it. It is almost unbelievableAnd the letter goes on. So there are serious concerns about the quality of the examination system that is being provided. I would like to refer to another example brought to my attention where a helicopter instructor was required by CASA to test his own son for a commercial helicopter licence. The instructor objected and said that this was completely inappropriate, but CAS A insisted that he test his own son for a helicopter licence. That seems to me to lack procedural fairness, to put it mildly. Yet that was a requirement of CASA in the examination system. So we still have a very long way to go. Mr Bill Hamilton in his comments on this issue made the observation: I am seriously concerned about the harm the Civil Aviation Safety Authority is doing to our flying students (Australian and overseas), to our foreign trade, to our own airmen and to our International reputation. We are working hard to attract to Australia people from other countries to offer them pilot training. In fact, we have some success in this regard. In my own electorate there are a number of student pilots training who are from Korea. But we must provide to the world confidence in our examination and our training system. We must be able to guarantee to the world that our safety regulator is as good as any in the world. The minister is to be commended on his statement and his efforts to try and achieve something worthwhile for safety regulation in this country. I fear we still have some way to go but I am confident that the minister has the determination to achieve a satisfactory result for the industry. Motion (by Mr Andrews) agreed to: That this matter be returned to the House. Treaties Committee Report Debate resumed from 27 August, on motion by Mr Taylor: That the House take note of the report. Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay) (11.20 a.m.)-The report on protocols II and IV to the Inhumane Weapons Convention is a very interesting report. It is something that I rise to speak on mainly from my experience in the legal field in our modem-day Australian Defence Force. The laws of war have been evolving since the Nuremberg trials. In 1925 there was the first attempt to make some sort of international treaty or agreement on conduct of armies during international conflict. It was quite interesting that at that stage it even led to different treatment of prisoners of war when the Germans captured English paws as compared to Russian paws, because they had a treaty with England and they did not with Russia. 7342 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 28 August 1997 Nuremberg put paid to all that, and came up with the concept of a crime against humanity. From the Second World War there were some very obvious examples, universally accepted today, about what is a crime against humanity, but we are still working towards a closer definition of acceptable conduct during conflict. The protocols that we are discussing here today in terms of the use of laser weapons and the use of antipersonnel landmines are two areas in this evolution of the law. We run a very professional Australian Defence Force. They have a number of standards. Right from recruit training, they are given numerous lectures and training and indoctrination in acceptable conduct for a professional modern-day military force. They are also involved in international conventions, courses and conferences, at which they spread ideas to other armies. Over the years of my involvement in this area, I have seen various nations-in our region, especially-adopting the laws of war. It has not only been their chiefs of staff: I have seen them gradually inculcating that right through to the lowest ranking serving members. This is what is so important in modern warfare: the sense of professionalism and what is acceptable and what is not. The international treaties we are discussing today go a long way towards setting up that humane standard for everyone to follow during times of conflict, when a lot of ordinary intercourse or everyday life is incredibly disrupted. An obvious example of that is antipersonnel landmines. They have attracted a lot of coverage since Vietnam, when they were most effectively deployed, and subsequent to that, when the cost on civilian life came to be counted. That human experience has led to the current major campaign for an international ban on antipersonnel landmines. They are not designed to kill people-merely to injure them; because a military force can be disabled much more effectively if members are injured rather than dead. The injured are assisted by their comrades, whereas the dead are simply buried. Antipersonnel mines have had a delaying effect in terms of restricting areas which armies must have personnel to defend. They could cover one flank with a minefield and set up their offensive operations on another flank. These days, in modern warfare with armoured personnel carriers and anti-mine tanks and vehicles, it is very easy for opposing military forces to breach minefields. These days they are not even a delaying factor. Armies can move at pretty well ordinary military speed across most minefields with the right equipment. That leaves the mines behind after the conflict has moved on for agricultural workers, for children looking for firewood, for women and children and civilians to suffer the awful consequences of nondetectable antipersonnel mines. Many things can be done to deploy mines. The military has come a long way in the evolution of mines, mainly looking at the security of their personnel. For instance, mines can deactivate or self-destruct after a certain time or have a time limit on them. There are all sorts of methods. Given the technology available today, you have to wonder at the strategic advantage of having mines at all. In 1997, they have very limited use, even as a delaying tactic at best and certainly not as a defensive military weapon. The Red Cross has led the major campaign against mines. Obviously, they are left behind, after most wars, to pick up the pieces of humanity-the terrible injuries to the children and the amputees. It does not matter whether there are 500 mines in a field or only one. They all have to be surveyed and cleared. Australia has an incredible record in its UN operations in terms of demining areas in Afghanistan, Angola, Cambodia, Laos and Mozambique. We have also had involvement in Pakistan and Namibia and in the Middle East conflicts. Thursday, 28 August 1997 MAIN COMMITIEE 7343 Our ADF's ability to demine areas has made a significant contribution to UN efforts in wartorn zones and in the re-establishment of law and order in those areas. It is a skill that we would wish our ADF personnel to retain. However, it is something that we want to take the lead on. The ministerial statement last year on this matter quite clearly led the world on this and made a great leap forward for Australia in finally proposing these protocols. The numbers of mines in the world today is something that really needs to be emphasised and considered. It would take something like 1,000 years to clear all the active landmines already in place. It will cost about $US33 billion to rid the world of all the mines that are there. For every 20 that are laid, only one is cleared. As many as five million new mines may be laid in anyone year. It can cost between $US200 and $US1,000 to clear each mine. It is a massive social problem left behind after conflict. Although conflict is the complete breakdown of law and order, the ultimate objective of any professional army is to return to law and order, to return the established systems where there is safety and security for all. The use of antipersonnel mines in an undetectable and indiscriminate fashion during conflict has a horrific aftermath and a cost to civilians, who, quite clearly, since 1945, have not been the target of any attack or military objective. Mines are incredibly cheap to make. They can be built in garages, fields or kitchens. They generally tend to be the preferred weapon of choice in underdeveloped countries. The time is well past for Australia to take a stand in leading the attitude to a professional deployment of military power. The statements by the minister to date have gone a fair way to doing that and Australia's ratification of these protocols heads that way, as well. The other protocol mentioned concerns laser weapons. As yet, we are still feeling our way in this murky field of law to come to some understanding and standards which will be considered humane. Man's arms race is certainly ahead of itself on this one. We currently use lasers to designate targets for guided bomb systems. What is the effect of those? What is the effect from that of now moving forward to developing the laser itself as the projectile rather than a bullet, with the terrible consequences of blindness or the aftermath on the civilian population in a conflict? This was clearly seen with the use of mustard gas in World War I. Loss of eyesight and the subsequent consequences to society in dealing with the costs of blindness and retraining and reskilling people who have lost such a substantial part of their independence have already been seen throughout history. We must move slowly towards finding acceptable standards and uses for this technology that comes up every day from our scientists and engineers, who are constantly pushing back the frontiers of science. It is something that I feel very strongly about. I think Australia should be leading world opinion. Without the modern armies doing so, we have little hope of underdeveloped countries taking the same professional attitude to the deployment of military power. That has an adverse consequence on our military personnel when they come up against an opponent who does not comply with the laws of war. That was clearly seen in the recent Gulf War in the Middle East. The Iraqi military forces had used chemical weapons against the Iranians in their previous eight-year war, but they failed to do so in the Gulf War. They respected the discipline of the forces that were there, in an acknowledgment that they would not use chemical weapons. A balance was achieved in terms of warfare that was conducted quite clearly within the bounds of the laws of war, the Geneva conventions, the subsequent protocols and all the other treaties that we continually develop in the international sphere in the hope of attaining some form of international 7344 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 28 August 1997 agreement on what is the definition of a crime against humanity. I commend the report to the House. discussion of the report that I was very proud to have played a part in compiling. The fifth report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties is certainly worthy of debate here today and its discussion is a very important national as well as international matter. Restrictions on the use of blinding laser weapons and land mines: 5th report is the name of the report. The joint standing treaties committee will next week table its ninth report in less than a year. I have to say it was privilege enough for me to have been elected to this place to represent the good people of the electorate of Moreton. It was an unexpected honour to be appointed by the parliament to the joint standing treaties committee and to participate in a very important process, the deliberation and consideration of the international linkages that Australia has. Certainly, a criticism often offered to me in the lead-up to the last election was that there were just so many agreements that Australia had with other countries and other entities around the world and that there really was no accounting back to the parliament. It is a great credit to the Prime Minister( Mr Howard) to have embraced an agenda first put forward by Senator Rod Kemp of Victoria-now Assistant Treasurer-to have this treaties process. It is very important that the consideration of treaties and international agreements of all types is not just the domain of the executive or the foreign affairs club. We have been able to break through the obvious and natural barriers of the bureaucracy in the committee process to expose a number of very important issues to date. The committee's work range has included everything from tuna fishing through to the rights of the child, which is the current inquiry. This report before us is one that I was very pleased to be part of for a number of reasons. I will mention a couple of them. It helped me to keep faith, as a member in this place, with a lot of people who wrote to me prior to the election looking for some action on just this issue. People from Catholic Social Response, the International Red Cross, Amnesty International and others all have an interest, naturally enough, in the use of landmines. They are simply one of the most cowardly forms of weaponry used by armies around the world. I am very pleased to be part of a government whose Minister for Foreign Affairs( Mr Downer), on 15 April last year-in essentially one of the first acts of the new governmentdeplored the use of landmines and stated very clearly Australia's position. As the honourable member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) just said, we have a vital leadership role in our region, particularly to show countries such as Cambodia-with not just its killing fields but also its maiming fields-that we do not believe the use of landmines is good enough. I join with the honourable member for Lindsay, and I am sure others in this place, in calling on the government to get even tougher on the use of landmines. They are simply horrendous weapons. They leave in their wake children, particularly, who, after conflicts, may wander into fields, into what would normally be productive areas, and trip over these things. They are not designed to kill; they are designed to maim. They were designed to maim sections of the opposing army because it paralyses an army. It is bad enough when a soldier is killed, but when a soldier is injured two other soldiers are then taken out to carry that injured soldier. There is at least a triplication effect with these sorts of weapons. So we now have in countries in our region children innocently tripping over landmines and losing limbs. The photos in this report provided by Dr William Maley are just too horrendous",130,Representatives Main Committee
269,Mr Hardgrave (Moreton) (11.34 A.m.),"I am very pleased to participate in theThursday, 28 August 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 7345 to contemplate, with large rafts of skin being torn off innocent children. Landmines have to go. Landmines are quite easy to make. They are literally being made in people's kitchens and underneath people's homes. In fact, it is quite astonishing to note, and we received evidence to suggest this, that some of the very best electrical companies around the world have their components stuck inside some of these landmines. I am not about to advocate that we should be putting a ban on products that are also produced by these companies-because I suspect, in their defence, a lot of the materials used are simply cast off components that have been picked up by those who want to make these bombs and who do so, literally, on the kitchen table. They are everywhere. As the honourable member for Lindsay has alluded to, and this is contained within the report, antipersonnellandmines total 400 million since the Second World War. The US State Department has estimated that there are more than 85 million uncleared landmines scattered in 62 countries around the world, and five million new landmines are being laid each and every year, with a cost of up to $US 1,000 to clear each mine. There is evidence from the International Red Cross that for every 1andmine cleared 20 additional are laid. It would cost in the vicinity of $US33 billion to rid the world of this scourge. We are not about to get rid of landmines tomorrow. I certainly wished that I could have been part of a process that had got rid of landmines but I think the important part about this report is that it states very clearly the view of the parliament. I am glad to see the government is going down the same track. Landmines are dreadful devices and they should be taken out of the play, as far as the world is concerned. I think it is also important to note the evidence of Dr William Maley with regard to some of the ways that these landmines are quite deliberately being used. The last thing a retreating army does is to lay landmines in and around hospitals, schools and fields that can be used for food production. It is a quite deliberate and cowardly device used by a retreating army to inflict horrendous psychological and physical damage on the opposing side when they reclaim the land. As I said, I was proud to be part of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties in the compilation of this report. I am very pleased that we have discussed this here today and I urge the government to continue its efforts to rid the world of these mines. Also, in closing, I wish to register my praise for the role of the Australian defence forces, who quite rightly maintain a small stock of landmines here in this country in order to train and to maintain their expertise in order to continue their important role in ridding the world of these devices. Australian Defence Force personnel are amongst the best in clearing landmines, and God speed to their work. that this report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties is being given time for debate in the Main Committee today. This was, of course, a very important inquiry by the treaties committee. The committee was required to respond to a proposal by the government to sign these particular protocols, but it was also a very heart-wrenching experience for the members of the committee. As the previous speaker mentioned, the committee was exposed to really horrific photographic evidence of the effects of landmines, and a couple of those photographs were reproduced in the committee's report.",136,Representatives Main Committee
270,Mr Truss (Wide Bay) (11.41 A.m.),"Ijoin the previous speakers in expressing satisfaction7346 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 28 August 1997 In addition to that we had to deal with fairly complex issues. Whilst everyone has a horror of war and a horror of the tools of war, there is a recognition of the fact that our country cannot leave itself defenceless in the event of our nation being subjected to some kind of threat. So it is important to strike a balance between a desire to act humanely, even in times of war and national distress, and being able to adequately defend our country. It is, perhaps, a reflection of the fact that these issues were difficult that there was a minority report. I think that this is the only report of the treaties committee that included a minority report and I want to talk a little bit about the issues in that minority report in my contribution today. We have the benefit during this debate of having also at our disposal the government's response to the report. So we have the evidence of not only the six recommendations, but also the way in which the government has responded to these proposals. Whilst the government has not accepted all of the recommendations, I think the response has generally been reasonable. The first matter dealt with by the committee was protocol IV dealing with blinding laser weapons. It needs to be emphasised right at the beginning that blinding laser weapons are still in the developmental phase and there is no evidence that they have ever been used in conflict to date. In prohibiting a yet to be invented-yet to be fully developed-weapon, protocol IV is dealing with largely experimental or unexplored territory. But it is recognised that this is a major advance. It is obviously far better to ban a horrible weapon before it is used than to merely respond to international outrage after it has been used in conflict. So in that regard this protocol breaks new ground, and it is very pleasing to note that Australia will be amongst the first countries to assent to this protocol. One of the witnesses to the committee made the point that the protocol actually bans only the use and transfer of blinding laser weapons and not their actual production or development. So we could still see some degree of experimental work being done, although to no avail for those countries who have actually signed the protocol. The risk with this protocol-indeed, with all rules of war-is that the despotic regimes who are perhaps less concerned about humanitarian issues, those who might be most likely to use these kinds of weapons if they could gain access to them, are the ones that will not sign the protocol. So countries that have a more responsible attitude are naturally concerned about the exposure of their troops or their people in wartime to a weapon that they have voluntarily chosen not to use. So, in a sense, many countries are adopting something of a defensive mechanism by saying that they are prepared to work on the technology but will not actually use it when the time comes. There is also no absolute ban under protocol IV on the use of lasers in wartime, merely on the use of blinding laser weapons. There has already been use of lasers in guidance systems, and I think there is likely to be a lot more development in that regard. I am not sure that is necessarily inhumane. Lasers provide considerable enhancement to the accuracy of weapons, and that is likely to make them better able to target a military objective rather than indiscriminately slaughtering humans. I think there is likely to be substantial further development of laser guidance systems, and that will probably be an advancement rather than a disadvantage. Australia has indicated that it will be moving to sign this protocol and to commit our country to its obligations. Thursday, 28 August 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 7347 The other area that has been covered has been the question of antipersonnellandmines. This has been a matter of considerable distress, widespreadA division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 11.46 a.m. to 11.58 a.m. of landmines and the committee's report on amended protocol II, which deals with mines, booby traps and other devices. It again needs to be pointed out that this protocol does not actually talk about banning these weapons but merely talks about prohibiting or restricting the use of particular mines. The Australian government has responded in a positive way in relation to this protocol. Antipersonnel landmines contained in the Australian defence stockpile basically comply with the restrictions required under the revised protocol II, although I understand that the M14 mines would need minor modification if they were ever to be used in the future. Affairs( Mr Downer) announced a unilateral suspension by Australia of the operational use of antipersonnellandmines by the Australian Defence Force and that the measure would take effect immediately. It is important to note that Australia does not actually produce or export landmines itself. The government indicated that the suspension would, for all intents and purposes, be permanent. It would be subject to review only in the case of a substantial deterioration in our strategic situation. The Australian government is retaining a national antipersonnel landmine stockpile to provide a defensive capability in the event of substantial deterioration in Australia's strategic circumstances, The committee, as I mentioned earlier, was divided on the issue of the extent of Australia's response on antipersonnel landmines. The majority of the committee recommended that Australia destroy its stockpile of antipersonnel landmines, except for a small number to be retained for training purposes to ensure that the Australian Defence Force retains its skill. In other words, the committee was recommending unilateral action by Australia to destroy its stockpile, an action which I understand Canada has already taken. It would certainly provide a very strong lead to the world that Australia regarded the use of these sorts of weapons as unacceptable. There was, however, a significant minority report which recommended that Australia should declare its willingness to destroy its landmines, except for training stock. It should only destroy the rest of its landmines once a substantial number of significant nations in our region have committed themselves to this course according to an agreed international timetable. The question arose as to whether Australia should undertake the symbolic act of destroying its landmines to demonstrate to the world that these weapons were regarded as unacceptable, or whether our assurance not to use them and not to review that assurance unless we were subject to significant threat is a more reasonable response. I have to say that, on balance, I come down on the side of the government's position. I do so because Australia is a vast country. It is a nation that is not threatened at the present time. Frankly, I doubt that our country will be threatened in the future. I certainly hope that that is the case. We need to do all that we can as a nation diplomatically to ensure that we retain a cordial relationship with our neighbours. But there is a possibility that our situation could deteriorate. Any prudent country will always plan also for the circumstances when it must",137,Representatives Main Committee

272,"On 15 April 1996, The Minister For Defence ( Mr Mclachlan) And The Minister For Foreign","7348 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 28 August 1997 defend itself. To unilaterally disarm when no-one else in our neighbourhood would be taking such action would be regarded by many as foolhardy. We also need to recognise that our nation has a very large coastline that is almost impossible to defend with traditional armaments, no matter how powerful our defence forces might be. Of course, we have the benefit of wonderful new technology, early radar defence systems and the like. But it is conceivable that, if an invasion was threatened, with the availability of the sorts of weapons that we know exist at this time, Australia may need to use antipersonnel landrnines to defend itself from a military invasion. Such weapons should only be used in those sorts of circumstances. There are a wide range of other rules in protocol II, and in the various rules of war, about the way in which landmines should be used. Sadly, it has been an ignorance of those laws which has been a part of the destruction and damage and injury to people in Asia and other parts of the world. The existing protocols have not worked in many of those countries. Sadly, for the same reasons as I referred to at the beginning of my remarks, there is a risk that the new protocol rules may not work in those countries as well. The government has made it clear that it regards the use of these weapons as unacceptable, and that Australia itself will not use landmines. The government has also indicated its willingness to look at the second part of the committee's recommendation, which was that Australia should prepare for consideration at the December 1997 meeting in Canada a proposal for the creation of an agreed international timetable for the destruction of antipersonnel landmines of all nations. This takes up the point of the minority report. Australia stands ready to destroy its own landmines, but would like to act in concert with other nations so that our whole region would be rid of these appallingly destructive weapons. As was mentioned earlier by the member for Lindsay (Miss Jackie Kelly) in particular, this is a weapon that is designed as much to harm innocent civilians as it is to stem the flow or advance of an army. Such a deployment of landmines is a clear abuse of a whole range of Geneva conventions, but those conventions have not prevented it from happening. They have not prevented the appalling injuries that were referred to earlier. What we do need is a strong diplomatic offensive to seek an agreement by all of the countries of our region-indeed, hopefully all of the countries in the world-to move to eliminate antipersonnel landmines. Australia has indicated that it is prepared to act cooperatively with other countries in that regard. I commend to the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Foreign Affairs the proposal that they should pursue this objective strongly when the meeting occurs in Canada later this year. Mr Deputy Speaker, these two protocols have the potential to help make the world a safer place, to free the world of the threat of some of the most potentially and actually horrific weapons that are used from time to time in war. Australia has an honourable record in defence of our country and in wartime. We have been involved in conflicts, however, where the conventions have frequently been ignored. I hope that there will be international effort to ensure that our world is made safer by the elimination of these sorts of weapons. Debate (on motion by Mr Griffin) adjourned. Thursday, 28 August 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 7349 National Crime Authority Committee Report Debate resumed from 27 August, on motion by Mr Reith: That the House take note of the report. Committee on the National Crime Authority's report on organised criminal paedophile activity, which has followed the publication of the report in November 1995, is a timely one. It comes at the same time that the Wood royal commission has released the final report into its inquiries into paedophile activity and other aspects relating to the corruption in the New South Wales police force. I was a sponsor of this particular inquiry, and visited the National Criminal Intelligence Service in the United Kingdom last year. I might point out to those who may not be aware that this is now considered to be one of the authorities for material related to research into organised or other paedophile activity. I might also point out that the recommendations of that particular report coincide neatly with the findings of the Wood royal commission with relation to the extent of organised criminal paedophile activity, and also some other aspects. I must say this, though: one of the things I would strongly object to in relation to the Wood royal commission's findings is the proposal to reduce the age of consent for homosexual behaviour to 16 years. I would strongly oppose that for a variety of reasons, which I might touch on later if I have time. The most important thing is to look at the circumstances surrounding the release of both the report and the response by the federal government. The report came at a time when there was considerable debate and speculation in the community about the extent to which organised criminal paedophile activity was operating in the community. At the same time we were perhaps 10 months down the track from the introduction of legislation that made it an offence to participate in child sex tourism-some groundbreaking legislation. In fairness to the previous Labor government, it was initiated by the Labor government, under Minister Kerr at the time, and has proved not to be a blinding success, but at least it has been available as part of the array of weapons against the sort of behaviour that most people would find totally reprehensible. Australians unfortunately were beginning to get the reputation for being some of the worse offenders in the cases where, because of our proximity to some of these areas of attraction, tours were being organised and people were visiting these particular areas solely for the purpose of accessing juveniles for sexual purposes. When we made these recommendations, there were some concerns about the extent to which the Australian law enforcement authorities were getting cooperation from their counterparts overseas, in particular in Thailand. One of the recommendations was to look at beefing up the relationship, the liaison, between the Thai police and the Australian Federal Police. At the time, the Thai police had something in the region of 150,000 police officers but only four were allocated as liaison officers to the Australian Federal Police. Considering the amount of drug trafficking investigation and detection which was taking place, this tended to give the impression that they viewed the child sex tourism area with a very low priority indeed. In fact, there were a number of allegations-to us and elsewhere during the debate that gave rise to the child sex tourism legislation in the first place-that corrupt officials, corruption within the",139,Representatives Main Committee
273,Mr Filing (Moore) (12.08 P.m.),"The government response to the Joint Statutory7350 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 28 August 1997 criminal system within Thailand, impeded the investigative work of people trying to get to the bottom of, or trying to investigate, particular cases. We are now halfway through the term of the Howard government, a government elected to strengthen the role of the family in the community. Paedophile activity is very closely related to this. For instance, the statistics from the Wood royal commission show that 46 per cent of proven victims are assaulted by family members. Fifty-four per cent of proven victims are assaulted by a non-family member; of those, 44 per cent are assaulted by an adult known to the family. In this case, one can clearly see that there is a very strong need, a very serious need, to strengthen, not weaken, the opportunity for the family unit to be able to be an influence against paedophile behaviour. It is also a fact, not refuted, that many assaults are undertaken in the case of de facto relationships by a de facto stepfather on a stepdaughter. This is another area of concern. But what concerns me most is the fact that, notwithstanding the commitment of the Howard government to beefing up the family unit as the principal source of comfort, care, love and education in our community, there are aspects of government policy that are undermining and weakening substantially the opportunity for families to be able to combat the influence of paedophile behaviour. I can give you a few examples from my own electorate, ones that have occurred very recently. Amongst some more recent ones was a case where two 14-year-old girls ran away from home. They met up with some youths in town, who then persuaded them to come and live at their place, which was like an open house, effectively under the control of a woman who was seeing a number of men. These girls moved there unbeknownst to their parents. They were believed to be participating in drug taking, in sexual activity on the premises. One of them ended up getting assaulted, their health suffered and their condition and welfare were seriously under question. The interesting thing was that, notwithstanding the fact that their father reported the girls missing immediately, the police could not tell the father where these gids were. The police would not act to bring these girls back home. Under the circumstances, I would have considered that to be entirely reprehensible. At the same time, the state department-that is, the family and community services department of the Western Australia government, another coalition government, I might add, in its second term of government-also failed to act, under the act which it has responsibility for administering. So we have the situation where the father appeared on the Howard Sattler program-one of Perth's popular radio talk back shows-and quizzed the Premier one month after the girls had actually disappeared. The Premier said that he would get the minister to act immediately on this. Within the period that the Premier was informed and the matter came back to my attention, one of the girls had been assaulted so badly that she had to have stitches around her eye. We understand that there were other men coming into the household and sexual activity had taken place with these girls, who were 14-year-old twins. In fact, when one went to a doctor's surgery, she collapsed from malnutrition in the doctor's surgery. Interestingly enough, when the woman that was acting in loco parentis, so to speak, for these girls went to the Department of Social Security in her local area-a federal department-she was able to get family allowance payments for the girls. Then the Department of Social Security wrote to the parents and told them they had to repay the money they had received as family allowance payments. Eventually, after contacting the minister, we got an apology Thursday, 28 August 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 7351 from the minister's office for what is, in my view, entirely reprehensible behaviour by the Department of Social Security. It gives an indication of just how serious the problem is. If a parent is conscious of their child being under threat or if the child leaves home before they are of the age of sexual consent, then they have little to no influence over that child's welfare-to such an extent that a government department would be very reluctant to retum that child to the home, even if they were of the opinion that that particular child was engaging in under-age sexual activity. Where we have the government yesterday saying that it wanted to do something about this terrible problem of paedophile activity-and it is a terrible problem-we have the situation where, within its own departments, it is in fact encouraging the very behaviour through its own lack of support for the role of the parents. The other problem is: what does the government do under the circumstances? The government has responded to a range of recommendations made by our committee and in most cases they have agreed to them. In particular, of course, the most important of those, as far as the Commonwealth government is concerned, is in the circulation of information relating to the activities of paedophiles. It is quite clear that paedophiles, by their nature, gravitate to their place of opportunity-to the place where they can access their prey. In many instances, they move from place to place. You would be perhaps totally unfamiliar with the fact that across the road from your children lived somebody who may have been convicted for sexually assaulting children-who may have served a prison sentence and come back to live in the community. We have seen in the United States a considerable social movement, a popular movement, to have legislation enacted by President Clinton to in fact make it mandatory for local authorities to inform the local community in the case where somebody with that sort of criminal background moves into the community. We have seen instances where people of that particular nature have moved back in and recommitted offences. People who were living across the road, or in that community, did not know because the authorities would not tell them. We have this similar problem here in Australia, where, for instance, a parent, in anguish, goes to a government department, state or federal, asking for help to get their daughter or son away from a situation in which they are in sexual activity with people who are over the age of consent or adults-in other words paedophile activity. They cannot get any help, notwithstanding the fact that there is legislation there to actually guide them or to provide that power. There is a policy in the family and children's services department in Western Australia not to enforce it-not to return the child to their home. In fact, the policy is to take the view of the child if the child wilfully wants to engage in this activity. One of the reasons why I strongly oppose the reduction of the age of consent for homosexual behaviour is that it is a well-known fact that adult homosexual males prey on juvenile males in a way that contributes to the behaviour. In fact, many of them are more prosperous or they spend lots of money and do things to try and smother the person or to make the person feel comfortable or happy in their company and then use that to break down any perhaps resistance or natural concerns they might have about behaviour. It is quite clear, particularly when you look at some of the evidence that has arisen as a result of the New South Wales royal commission, that in fact this is still going on today to a wide extent. 7352 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 28 August 1997 I personally would like to congratulate two people who have done a good job in relation to their parliamentary duties in New South Wales. They are on the other side of the fence politically from me, but they are people who have taken a stand on it and have actually done something. I think that members of parliament have a duty to act where they feel that it is in the interests of the community to act. I refer to Franca Arena and Deirdre Grusovin, who were reviled in the media at one stage and then praised at another. They took it upon themselves to use their parliamentary privilege, something that is a privilege to all of us, to act on behalf of their constituents. That is what it is for. In both cases, in my view, they have been shown to have made a contribution. It is quite clear that, in the absence of action and in the absence of people taking it upon themselves to act, the problem has gotten out of hand in New South Wales and has given rise to this royal commission there. I would like also to make an observation in relation to the problem that we touched upon in our particular report relating to Cambodia. World Vision gave evidence to us in Melbourne that there was the very serious problem of paedophiles accessing World Vision child sponsorship programs, becoming a sponsor and then going to the country where the child lived and accessing that child for sexual purposes, knowing full well that in many instances, both culturally and because of their particular circumstance of poverty, the parents may well not resist the overtures made by that particular paedophile activist. I have also been very disappointed over the period of time since the allegations were first raised about the role of Australia's mission in Cambodia in relation to paedophile activity because it is now clear that under the circumstances there was substantial negligence in relation to that activity in Cambodia, activity that the World Vision organisation brought to the attention of the committee at an early stage during our inquiry. I might also say that, unfortunately, the government says that it agrees that it needs to cooperate with countries like Cambodia. It said: ... the Government has now removed the need to negotiate treaties in all but the most exceptional circumstances. While the Government is not prepared to pursue treaties with Cambodia and other South East Asian countries, it considers that the changes it has made to the scheme of the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987 will remove significant impediments to, and thus facilitate greater cooperation with, countries in our region in the investigation and prosecution of child sex offences. It did say in its response that it felt that the liaison efforts of the AFP would assist. Unfortunately, in the case of Cambodia, when the allegations were made in the case of a member of Australia's diplomatic mission, the AFP was forced to do an inquiry here in Australia, offshore. The AFP did not even send personnel to Cambodia, and it did not give rise to a prosecution for some time down the track. I know that the Australian Federal Police Association was particularly disappointed with the response made by the government at the time and by the fact that there was not an onshore investigation in the country where the offences were alleged to have taken place. In conclusion, I want to make the following point. Nothing that can be done by the federal government in relation to paedophile activity will succeed unless we give the family unit the opportunity, the support, to be able to combat the problem in the first place. I might say also that it is highly disappointing that some of the government's own departments, particularly the Department of Social Security, may well be contributing inadvertently to the problem in the first place. Thursday, 28 August 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 7353 Filing) for that speech. It was an excellent speech and I agree very strongly with most of his sentiments. It is a pity that events in the Western Australian Liberal Party prior to the last election led to his being a loss to our party because I know on these sorts of issues that he has very strong views, and views with which I agree very strongly. It is interesting that this debate is occurring here today. I would have thought that there would be a list of speakers 25 or 30 long taking the opportunity to speak about this matter here in the Main Committee, given the current climate. I suppose it emphasises the importance of this committee to members. There are other matters on the agenda here today that are equally important in a lot of respects. The Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs report on youth suicide is also on the agenda. There are a limited number of speakers. In many respects this debate should be going on in the House of Representatives chamber itself because of the fact that it is such an important issue. I am not necessarily being critical of my colleagues, but somehow the processes and the opportunity is not getting through to people, and on this particular issue of paedophilia I would have thought there would have been a lot more speakers. The member for Moore has a great deal of credibility in respect of what he has had to say this morning. For a start, he was on the committee during its inquiry and he is the only member of the committee who is still on the Joint Statutory Committee on the National Crime Authority, the committee which I currently chair. He was on that committee at the time that it brought down this excellent report, but more than that, as I understand it, he actually drove the committee on this report. It was his knowledge of this subject, as a former policeman, that drove this report. It is really quite amazing that here we have a report that was brought down in this parliament on November 1995 on a subject that this day is on the lips of every Australian. In 1995 I think most Australians would not have been able to spell 'paedophile', let alone know what it was all about. Yet today we have this debate not only following the Wood royal commission but within a couple of weeks of the report of the Children's Commission of Queensland to the Queensland government, entitled Paedophilia in Queensland. I do not want to overdo it, but let me tell the parliament that the member for Moore has made a very significant and relevant speech here today and he deserves a great deal of credit for the committee's work on this subject. We are dealing now with the government's response to the report. I note that the government has accepted every recommendation made by the committee in its report, but this is only the beginning of a role for the Commonwealth on this subject, because of its importance-which, as I said, has been underlined by events in the last few days. I do not think anyone would suggest that paedophilia is new, that it is something that has just started to happen. The evidence is that it has been going on for a very long time, but it has been one of those subjects that people have not wanted to talk about. It is not a very nice subject to talk about and I suppose those of us who have had some responsibilities and opportunities to talk about it have probably abrogated those responsibilities by not being prepared to do that. We now understand, as a result of events in recent days, the extent of this problem and, probably worse even than the extent of it, the actual nature of it, which Justice Wood spelt out not only in his report but in subsequent interviews.

But the Queensland Children's Commission report makes the point, in relation to Queensland, that: The existence of a hard-core group of some 300 active paedophiles in the State is cause for a considerable concern. That has to be an understatement. The report goes on: When it is recalled that a single paedophile may sexually abuse on average 150 victims, an estimated 45,000 Queensland children consequently are destined to carry the scars of sexual abuse by this 300. To these figures of course must be added many thousands of Queensland men and women who, during their adulthood, are now also bearing the emotional and physical scars of sexual abuse as children. Studies relied upon by the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence (ABCI) provide a basis for assessing the statistical magnitude of paedophile activity in the State. These studies suggest that one in four girls and one in eleven boys are sexually abused by the time they reach the age of 18 years. Out of Queensland's population of persons aged 0-17 years, some 150,000 will consequently carry the emotional and physical scars of sexual abuse throughout their adult lives. This number will augment the number of existing adults who in their childhoods were also subjected to sexual abuse. That number of persons now over 18 years of age in Queensland is of the order of 420,000. When it is recalled that 70% of persons in psychiatric units of some of our hospitals are known to have been sexually abused as children, we can begin to see the true dimensions of the societal scourge which paedophilia constitutes. That report came out on 5 August, just a couple of weeks before Justice Wood brought down his report into the New South Wales situation, which is equally as bad, maybe even worse. So we have a problem that is not only in Queensland, is not only in New South Wales, but, by any estimate, is an Australia-wide one of enormous proportions. I want to say that the member for Moore is absolutely right when he puts this in the context of family and family breakdown. I do not know whether there has been any research done about this. Paedophilia has probably been going on for a long time. Certainly, family breakdown in society has contributed to the extent of paedophilia. It is interesting to talk about abuse within the family. There is a headline in my local paper today 'Fathers top list for child abuse'. 'The most common child molesters are fathers and stepfath6rs', it says. I would contend-but I do not have the statistics to back it here-that most of that abuse is being inflicted by stepfathers or by a parent in a de facto relationship. That is my contention. Let me base that on this fact: as far as I can see the abuse of a child by a natural father is at the absolute horrific end of the scale. We are not downplaying other parts of this scale of abuse, which are equally concerning. My guess would be that abuse of a daughter by a natural father would not be a frequent occurrence. Therefore, when we start to see headlines like 'Fathers top list for child abuse', I believe the real emphasis is probably going to be on stepfathers and parents in de facto relationships. One of the problems that the member for Moore touched on is that this sort of debate provides fertile ground for the anti-family element in our society to get in and say that children are all abused in family relationships and, therefore, families are bad and the sooner the children are taken over by someone outside the family, where they will not get abused, the better. That is what really worries me about where this debate may ultimately go. WhatI am sure of-and I have given a lot of thought to this over the years-is that we have in our society a very great problem with the breakdown of family. It leads to all sorts of other Thursday, 28 August 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 7355 problems. Children are hurt by divorce in many ways. Whilst for a while there was trendy evidence coming out to tell us that children are better off if their parents get divorced, the latest evidence and the most persuasive evidence is that that is not the case, and that children suffer from divorced parents for a very long time in their lives. Now we are seeing very strong evidence that when divorces occur and we have these blended families, and blended families on blended families, the capacity for paedophilia-abuse of young children-is magnified because of that many times. It gets back in my view, as the member for Moore made very clear, to a concern about the state of families in our nation. Whilst he was mildly critical of the performance of the government of which I am a member, I would defend the government. I think this government was elected with a very strong mandate to support families. I believe that we delivered on that commitment and we are further in the process of delivering on that commitment. I am coming very much from a concern as a pro-family person in this parliament. Aspects of our policies have not moved quickly enough, but this issue may well galvanise us into further action. The question which has been raised, and it was raised in the Queensland commissioner's report, is what the national response ought to be. The focus therefore comes back almost the full circle on the National Crime Authority and what role, if any, it ought to have in this. In fact, the Queensland commissioner says: Within the past decade a number of agencies established to focus on crime and its link to corruption of public officials in particular has addressed their role in combating paedophilia. In Queensland, this has involved the CJC and, at a national level, the NCA. In examining their jurisdictions for paedophilia, both agencies seem to have taken as a starting point, their mandate in relation to organised crime. They then proceeded to address the question as to whether the available evidence regarding paedophilia suggests an organised activity. As a result of certain specific characteristics of organised activity these agencies have concluded that paedophile activity does not qualify as an organised activity in the terms of reference specified by them. From the standpoint of the relevant agency such an approach may be justified but, from the wider perspective of community interest and welfare, it does not seem very helpful and it constitutes something of an academic exercise. I tend to agree with the Children's Commissioner there. The issue of whether there is a role for the NCA in this has exercised my mind. The NCA has completed a strategic assessment of paedophile activity in Australia and the Attorney General( Mr Williams) currently has that on his desk. My committee has asked to be briefed on the outcome of that assessment. We have asked for the assessment but there will be some very sensitive areas and we may not get the actual assessment. But, of course, we are looking forward to having a briefing on it. I think we can then look closely at whether there are some definitional problems in terms of whether it is organised criminal activity for the purposes of whether the NCA ought to be involved, and we may well proceed to address those particular issues. The NCA has proved its effectiveness because it can cross jurisdictional boundaries, and so on, in combating a lot of aspects of organised crime. I believe it would be counterproductive to get bogged down in the question of whether paedophile activity is organised crime. The NCA committee, under my chairmanship, will continue to address the issue. The report that the committee did in 1995, driven largely, as I said earlier, by the member for Moore, does 7356 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 28 August 1997 I think totally vindicate the concerns he had and his committee had then. Here it is, as I say, two years down the track and suddenly we have on our hands a recognition that we have here a very serious national problem. As a result of all of those considerations, the NCA committee will continue to focus on the issue. We look forward to seeing the outcome of the strategic assessment. I understand that it largely confirms the findings of this report and indeed confirms Justice Wood's findings which indicated that paedophilia, whilst it was a great concern, was not a nationally organised activity: it was occurring on a local level, within the context of family relations, and it existed in fairly close networks. But, in my view, that should not be, as the Children's Commissioner in Queensland says, the ultimate determiner of whether we address it on a national issue. The government responded a little further in the parliament yesterday in response to a question about the Wood commission. I would like, if I had time, to deal a little further with the suggestion that there be a national council for the prevention of child abuse. Time will beat me on that but I am pleased that this has been listed for discussion here in the Main Committee today. (Time expired) Debate (on motion by Mr Griffin) adjourned. Industry, Science and Technology Committee Report Debate resumed from 27 August, on motion by Mr Reid: That the House take note of the report. Committee this afternoon on this particular report of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. I think most members of this House would know that I have always been a great supporter of the role that parliamentary committees can play in advancing ideas to government. In this particular case, I think this is not only a timely report but also one which this government needs to respond to quickly. Again, I put on public record that the Australian Labor Party will give swift passage through both the House of Representatives and the Senate to any of the recommendations requiring legislation arising out of the committee's report. I have said that publiCly. I have put that on the record in a number of different forums around this country in the last several months as we have talked to people in small business but I think it is the first opportunity that I have had to record it here in the parliament. I think it is important that that be said. I do not think anybody who has participated in discussions with small businesses, particularly small businesses and franchisees in shopping centres, could be left untouched by some of the stories that these people tell about the complete and disproportionate amount of market power working against the interests of small business. I have travelled around in my capacity as the shadow minister for small business in the last two months-in the break-and spoken to people in shopping centres in Rockhampton, Wollongong, Melbourne, Newcastle and the Gold Coast. The stories I was told were mirror images of the stories which colleagues who sat on this committee heard in evidence which they received. They were the stories of small business people, micro businesses, and mums and dads operations: in Australia some 50 per cent of businesses are operations run by one or two people, often family members, that do not employ anybody else.",145,Representatives Main Committee
275,Mr Martin (Cunningham) (12.39 P.m.),"It is a great pleasure to speak in the MainThursday, 28 August 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 7357 They told stories about the way in which market power was being used by shopping centre management and by owners of shopping centres to disadvantage them, and stories about being forced to relocate within shopping centres to areas where less passing traffic was going to mean a slashing of profitability for that small business and, in many cases, was going to cause it to go to the wall. They told stories about ways in which new tenancy agreements were struck and the way in which the small business person was disadvantaged in those negotiations with a virtual 'take it or leave it, and if you do not like it then you are out the door' type of arrangement. When you talk to franchisees of the common franchises that we see in shopping centres about some of the master franchisors they tell stories about the way some of those franchisors-not all of them, but some of them-deal with people. They tell stories about the up-front fees and the increases in outgoings which small businesses in shopping centres have to put up with. In one shopping centre I went to in Melbourne, the total cost of outgoings-the moneys that shopping centre tenants pay for things like joint advertising, cleaning, security and so on-was $600,000 in one year. The next year that was put up to $1.2 million. There was no consultation with the tenants. The centre management simply said, 'Here's your new bill and you are going to have to learn to live with it. Of course, you will be levied an increased fee for the privilege of having your premises cleaned, guarded and advertised in joint publications.' These are the sorts of issues which are out there in the ether. These are the sorts of problems facing small business. Much has been said about small business in this country over the last 12 to 18 months and perhaps longer. There are two things I want to say. Firstly, we on our side of the parliament would be the first to concede that when in government we probably did not move as quickly as we should have to protect small businesses from unconscionable conduct, predatory pricing and some of the other issues which have been outlined in this particular committee report. I accept that, and we are moving to try to redress that-albeit, unfortunately, from opposition. Secondly, I think it is fair to say that in the election in March last year there was a clear expectation from small businesses that if they voted to put the coalition into government they would have friends in court and the coalition would move to support small business. Regrettably, they are telling me that that is not happening. They are telling me that some of the things the Treasurer ( Mr Costello) or the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business( Mr Reith) are talking about at the moment, like capital gains tax, rollover provisions for retirement, unfair dismissal provisions and so on, whilst they are important to some small businesses, are not the key issues. What small businesses want is a return to profitability. What they want is business confidence. What they want is more people coming through the front door. But they also want protection. They want protection from unconscionable trade practice. They want protection from some of the activities that certain shopping centre managers embrace as part of their running of shopping centres. In fact, what small businesses are saying is that they want to find a balance. They want to redress the imbalance that presently exists between the small shops and the people that own the shopping centres and manage the shopping centres. They want to make sure that that balance is redressed, with equality in terms of negotiating power at least. This report makes specific recommendations about that. As I have said, this report goes to issues like franchising and retail tenancy legislation. And, importantly, it says that in both of 7358 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 28 August 1997 those instances, we should have legislation through changes to the Trade Practices Act underpinning codes of conduct. We could not agree more. Giving small businesses the opportunity to take on landlords who are unscrupulous, in a fair, reasonable and equal arrangement, is critical to the improvement of small business and its operation. I think that it needs to be said, also, that access to justice and the cost of access to justice are disproportionate-and examples are given in this particular report. It is very easy for the Woolworths and the other major shopping centre operators in this country to throw a ton of money and a truckload of lawyers at a small business person and bankrupt that person, causing marriage breakdowns and all sorts of difficulties for those people, and not think anything of it. On the other hand, if there were access to justice through tenancy tribunals, an equalisation of that power relationship which presently is so unequal would occur. Quite obviously then small business would feel much better off and would, in fact, be much better off. They are the recommendations contained in this report. Much has been said over the past several months about small business. In fact, it cost the former minister for small business, the member for Forrest( Mr Prosser), his position in this government, and we have a new minister now. This minister has said that he is going around talking to people. We all know that the government's response to this report was due last Tuesday. We have said to the minister that if he wants another couple of weeks because he is only new to the job, that is fine. He said that he wanted to talk to people to get an overview of what was going on. But while he is doing all that, of course, his bureaucracy is out there drafting the response that the government will bring down to this report. I know that there are members of the government parties-those members, particularly, who were part of the committee inquirythat will be doing their utmost to ensure that their government upholds every recommendation to the last word to ensure that small businesses do get a fair go. As I said, on 2 March last year there was an overwhelming depth of support for this government by small business. They expected to get something. They expected to see opportunities for small business to be improved and, as a consequence of this report now being released-it being known to so many in the small business community-they can only hope that the government will be true to its word. Not unexpectedly, the other side of the equation-best described, I guess, as the landlordsis fighting back. The landlords have asked Access Economics to produce a contrary view to the parliamentary committee report. This contrary review was put out a couple of weeks ago and it was called Tipping the balance. We all know in which direction that balance was proposed to be tipped when this analysis was done by Access Economics and came out on behalf of the Property Council of Australia. It was tipping it back towards the landlords. Quite frankly, the criticism that this document levels at a parliamentary committee-almost claiming that a parliamentary committee of the House of Representatives was unprofessional in its approach to an issue-is laughable. I know that someone like you, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, who is as committed as I am to the way in which this parliament is seen as being so important to the nation's future and, to the fact that our committee system can make, and has made in the past, a tremendous contribution to changing government laws, would be just as offended as I am by some of the comments that are contained in here. Thursday, 28 August 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 7359 This creates an enormous problem for my good friend the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. On one hand, he has a parliamentary committee and his own colleagues saying unanimously that small business has got to be looked after. They are saying, 'Look after the small business community that voted for us. They deserve an equal chance.' On tre other hand, you have got a report from the Property Council of Australia which says, 'Don't worry about them; most of them are whingers anyway. Free competition is what it is all about. After all, Minister, the Property Council of Australia translates as landlords, and that translates as plenty of good donations around election time.' That is the balance that this minister is going to have to address. Much has been suggested about issues arising in this committee report. I am pleased to say that a number of media commentators have picked up on it and have reproduced some of the horrendous stories that were contained within it. But at the end of the day, it is simple for this government. They have a unanimous government report. They have the support of the opposition-and the Democrats, I might say-for enacting the legislative changes recommended in here and the other issues which are required and that will help small business. There is a win-win situation. This is one of the truly great moments in Australian politics, where all sides of the political fence are quite prepared to say to the small business community, 'We will help you. Here is the document that recommends how that will be done and here is the legislation going to pass through both houses of parliament with the support of every major political party.' I think that it is probably a bit of a rarity in this place to get everybody agreeing with each other. On the committee, I know my good friend the member for Scullin( Mr Jenkins), who was a very active member in this and played a very real role, and also my colleague the former minister for small business and the member for Rankin( Mr Beddall), had a lot of time and effort which they were prepared to expend with government members in arriving at that joint position on fair trading. If one quote illustrates the sorts of problems that small businesses have encountered as a result of this inequality in market power, it is the one that appears on page 4 of this report. I would like to have it read into Hansard. It is from an unspecified retailer because quite clearly she did not want to be identified. It reads: I once had a thriving business in an industry few could match my enthusiasm for ... [What the retail leases tribunal could not consider is the devastating effect the past five traumatic years have had on me and my family which not even our once rock solid 27 year marriage could survive. We were once confident, positive thinking go-getters but now we're broke and dispirited relics of our former selves with several stress related health problems, not the least being acute depression, insomnia, nervous tension and obesity. I went through premature menopause and my once cheerful, workaholic, loving partner is now an angry, aggressive alcoholic. Our children suffer too, helplessly watching both their parents fall to pieces before their eyes and their quality of life diminish. At 50 years of age, we've been left with a massive business debt, which we have insufficient earning power to repay, and ... we now face the real prospect of being homeless as well. The chains have been allowed to gobble us up and the landlord is allowed to trample us down. Our pleas to politicians fallon deaf ears and the legal system treats us with contempt. The end result is the tragedies exposed almost daily in the national news. Why must it be so? We too are entitled to our place in the sun. [The Fair Trading inquiry] has within its power to recommend that justice is done and if I believed in God anymore, I'd pray that you will ensure it is. 7360 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 28 August 1997 That is from the heart of a retailer who has suffered grievously because of past policies of all governments. Here, with this report, is an opportunity to redress those sorts of problems. The Labor Party, for its part, will help in that process. I have travelled extensively. I have spoken at retail rallies involving 500 people in Newcastle, 100 on the Gold Coast and 1,000 in Melbourne. They have told me what they want. Yet the minister for workplace relations came into this parliament yesterday and said what people want is capital gains tax rollover relief so they can pocket $500,000 on retirement. The only small businesses that could do that would be people that owned a McDonald's franchise or something similar, not the bulk of small businesses in this country. Respond to this committee inquiry report and justice will be done. (Time expired) committee that the children in the public galleries are from the Nambucca Heads Christian Community School, the jewel of the electorate of Cowper. Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia, a report which has been brought down by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. I also welcome the contribution made by the member for Cunningham ( Mr Martin), who has just left the room. WhilstI recognise and acknowledge his helpful gesture in putting into place the recommendations that have now been handed down in this report, I am a bit at a loss as to why he and his government had not done just as much in their previous years of being in government. It is rather a bit too late. I must say that, whilst I welcome his gesture of helping, it does seem to be a little bit hypocritical to change his mind so quickly in such a short time. Like the member who spoke before me, during my past 13 years of campaigning I too travelled very widely throughout my electorate. During that time. I became extremely aware of the fact that small business was very, very adversely affected in a number of areas, particularly in matters concerning franchising, retail tenancy and justice. There is no doubt that some small businesses were getting the rough end of the stick. In my discussions with those business owners I could sense the frustrations that they were experiencing as a result of what I would often consider to be very U):1scrupulous business practices. They were forced to work under conditions which were, to say the least, very exploitative in several instances. There is no doubt that as a committee we heard many stories of anger, disillusionment and complete despondency from small business people due to the treatment they received from big business operators. I believe that small business should be given the opportunity not only to survive but also to prosper, and to be free from the types of predatory practices and standover tactics that they have experienced from these people in the past. I am very proud to have been involved in such a concerted attempt to provide a fair and equitable report. One of the members sitting opposite me was on the committee as well and I am sure he would agree with me that we spent many, many hours listening to some very horrendous stories. I would also like to point out that I am one of only three women on this committee. Whilst it is personally rewarding for me to acknowledge that an increasing number of women are entering into the small business area, it is also good to know that in the main they are the people who are making a success of their businesses. And perhaps, without wanting to get involved in the gender bias argument, there is something here that our male colleagues could learn from women in business.",148,Representatives Main Committee

277,Mrs Johnston (Canning) (12.54 P.m.),"I welcome the opportunity to speak today onThursday, 28 August 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 7361 The issues that this report seeks to address are based on a real commitment to secure a better deal for small business, which after all is very important in the revival of our economy. When handing down this report, I-along with other committee members-was very much aware of the need to keep to the terms of reference set out by the then minister for small business, the member for Forrest( Mr Prosser). The brief included investigating and reporting on unfair business conduct and dealings, as well as on the social and economic implications of major business conduct issues and their subsequent outcomes. I would suggest that this report is very timely. For far too long governments have failed to listen to the concerns of small business. Indeed, action to ensure that acceptable and fair business conduct is practised in Australia is now critically important for the successful future of this country. The committee received an overwhelming number of written and personal submissions. It would be less than honest to say that in most of those cases, small business operators did not ask for special protection or special treatment; they simply asked for the opportunity to get a fair deal. The evidence provided to the fair trading inquiry suggested that small businesses are often very frustrated by what they believe to be unfair commercial conduct when entering into business dealings with larger and more powerful companies. Such behaviour was alluded to as being present in all states of Australia, and, in particular, it centred around tenancy agreements, as we have already heard. Claims were made that major retailers were in a position to insist that developers exclude certain other retailers, and claims were made that franchise agreements were one-sided, more often than not in favour of the franchisor. In my own electorate of Canning, many constituents have complained to me about such practices. One retailer situated in a shopping centre was advised several years ago that the centre would be increased in size and revamped. It was suggested that he should be relocated. Since that time absolutely nothing has happened in that centre except that since then this small business operator has been on a monthly tenancy lease. I defy anybody in this room, let alone outside this House, to run a business on such a basis. In another case, a franchise operator was required to buy his stock through the franchisor. When the franchisee complained that part of the stock was inferior and damaged, he was told that he had no option to refuse it and it was suggested that he should sell his stock at a discount price-a ridiculous practice, I would suggest, for anybody to enter into. Another proprietor of a small business at a local shopping centre, neighbouring my electorate, advised the committee of action taken at the shopping centre against the property manager. She alleged gross overcharging in relation to variable outgoings and promotion levies. I have mentioned these examples as just a few of those that were brought to the attention of the committee as we travelled around the country hearing submissions, that were subsequently printed in the report that was handed down. The issue of retail tenancy is a matter of much contention, with a need for uniformity and security for tenants. I would suggest that this is a high priority. Predatory practices of big business are just not acceptable. The committee has recommended the need for contractual certainty to be paramount and for unfair and inequitable agreements to be done away with. It also recommended that a uniform tenancy code be developed to enable utilisation around the country and that this be underpinned in the Trade Practices Act. Establishing merchants' associations in shopping centres and regular statements of expenditure on outgoings and promotions was another recommendation which we believed to be highly desirable. 7362 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 28 August 1997 With regard to franchising, many people see buying a small business as an attractive option for securing a job and as an investment for their future. Indeed, some people decide to buy a business once they receive a redundancy payment. The committee's recommendation that proper business education and research are required when one embarks on franchising-or, for that matter, buying a business-is in my opinion very desirable and should be given a lot of thought. An argument was put before the committee that part IVA of section 51 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 should be amended to strengthen the stance on unfair conduct. The report outlines an amendment to the act that will incorporate a new provision dealing with unfair conduct in commercial transactions. Again, that is a recommendation that is very desirable. I believe that all businesses deserve a fair go. Small business should not be excluded from this. I concur with the previous speaker, the member for Cunningham, when he said that there are many small businesses that have been subjected to some dreadful exploitation and standover tactics by larger and more powerful businesses. We do need a balance in business practices. We do need fair play for all dealers. We do not want to have business conduct in this country which is skewed to one side or the other of the market. We all have to work harmoniously together and we should never really forget that it is the many thousands of small business operators that actually contribute to the well-being of this country. They are the people that provide the employment to our future generation. Unless we are able to find a balance in that situation, I am afraid that we will have some very nasty consequences to face. I therefore commend this report to the members here and to the government, and I do hope that we will find a fair balance in future trading for businesses. Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia, by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. Developing the report and the inquiry was a very educative process for me and I am thankful to a number of members of the committee who played a great role in the inquiry and assisted me to understand the problems that confront small business. I also thank those that came before us for their assistance in that education. One of the dismaying aspects of the whole inquiry process of this report was that so many of the people who came before us came very fearful of retribution. I have never been involved in an inquiry where so many people have asked for their submissions to be kept confidential and for their evidence to be given in camera. I think this reflects the type of atmosphere in which small business operates out in the real world, the way in which they feel concerned about the imbalance in power between small business and bigger business. I reflect on a person who operates a very successful small business in a shopping centre in my electorate. He came to me with a story that illustrated the problems that he had as a trader within that shopping centre and the problems that he had in operating a franchise. Incidentally he also has another arrangement, which is by way of licence, and there are problems with each of those arrangements. I said, 'You have a story that would be of great benefit to the committee. It would be very helpful if you could put it to the committee as a submission and then come forward and discuss that submission.' I was very distressed when a couple of weeks later I got the feedback that this gentleman, who could have been of great assistance to the inquiry, had decided not to go forward with his submission. He had decided not to take the offer to have a confidential submission or to come before the committee in camera basically because he was too scared of what it might",152,Representatives Main Committee
278,Mr Jenkins (Scullin) (1.04 P.m.),"It is a pleasure to be able to speak to this report,Thursday, 28 August 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 7363 mean down the track for him in his dealings with not only the shopping centre managers but also those who hold the franchises. The sort of atmosphere that this inquiry was conducted in was in a way surprising. One of the principal people, a leading figure in one of the small business associations, in the last week of the last session said to me, 'What was your expectation? What did you think was the situation out there? Was it as bad as you thought it might be?' I had to admit to her that it was much worse. We held public hearings in all of the mainland capitals and a number of public hearings were held here in Canberra. The thing about the stories that we were told was that they were consistent right around Australia. Wherever we went, people came forward who had tried to put in place small businesses but had failed not just because they were perhaps lacking in skills but because their aspirations were crushed by those who were more powerful. In saying that, I stress that we have to acknowledge that, in the way in which the market operates, there will be people who will go to the wall no matter how well intentioned they are. This report is not talking about those cases: it is talking about the people who, because of the imbalance of power, were not given a chance from the start. Let us look at the recommendations that we have made about a uniform national retail tenancy code. We have tried, as a committee, to set down in the report recommendations and suggestions that deal with matters that should be covered in a uniform tenancy code to ensure that we redress the imbalance that is there between the tenants and the shopping centre owners and managers. The code would be about simple things such as the need for full disclosure when a tenant goes into a situation about matters that might relate to that person's tenancy. At the start of the inquiry, I thought the way things should operate was fairly straightforward and simple. I was shocked that, in practice, it did not occur, with great detriment and consequences to some of those people, who took up tenancies understanding certain details about the operation of the shopping centre, which they found had changed. They found that the basis for the number of people attending the shopping centre, and things like that, was overestimated. Professor Alan Millington, who operates out of one of the New South Wales universities, gave us evidence and, in his submission, he said: Above all, there is a need for retail property owners to accept that the success of their investments, and their shopping centres in partiCUlar, is ultimately completely dependent upon the success of tenants trading from them. Without successful retail tenants there would not be successful shopping centres. To have successful retail tenants owners must allow and assist them to prosper by working in partnership with them, rather than seeking to punish them for their success by ... persistent demands for ever higher rents irrespective of the ability of retailers to pay such rents. I thought that what Professor Millington said should have been self-evident. It seemed fairly logical that the relationship between the property owners and their tenants should be to the benefit of both. But in practice there were just too many stories from tenants about the behaviour that they had had to endure and we would wonder why it occurred. In so many cases in evidence brought before the committee, we wondered why there was this behaviour that forced tenants out, forced tenants to fail and forced tenants to go to the wall? When we spoke to the property owners and managers, of course, they said that the relationship should be as the professor stated, because it is obvious that, in a relatively symbiotic relationship between the two parties, both can succeed. But there were just too many 7364 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 28 August 1997 stories for the committee to ignore the fact that this was not the case. As the honourable member for Cunningham ( Mr Martin) has said, it was of concern when the peak body of the property owners and managers came out with their own study and suggested that we were not balanced in the way we treated the evidence and that, in some way, the inquiry lacked professionalism. I say to those people that, if the complaints that were put to us were not real-and I believe that the overwhelming majority are real and have substance--even if the complaints were based on perception, those property owners and managers have a big problem. As has been illustrated in this discussion and debate, you can still go to a shopping centre and quite easily get together a number of tenants that will come forward with stories of hardship and complaint. For instance, earlier in the month, the shadow minister went to a meeting at a shopping centre in my electorate. I was absent and could not be there. Thirty tenants came forward to describe to the shadow minister, the honourable member for Cunningham, the experiences they were having. Those experiences surrounded things that are difficult for property managers to handle. This particular shopping centre has undergone a three-phase increase in the amount of space that is available. It has meant that tenants have been shuffled around the place as this work has been done. But it has been the way in which those matters have been handled that has caused angst. For instance, simple things such as the parking arrangements for the shopping centre have been changed unilaterally. Longer term parking had been changed to short-term parking for people that were rushing in and out to the local supermarket. This affected neighbouring businesses because they relied on people coming into shopping centres, lingering and looking at the goods. There are all these intricacies that have to be taken into account and they can only be taken into account where there is a partnership. As has been said often in the discussion of this report-and it is one thing that I think the committee wants to emphasise-small businesses are not looking for special protection. They do not want anything particularly special in the arrangements that are put in place for them. They just want a fair deal. They want to be able to operate in the knowledge that they are getting that fair deal. The type of suggestions that we have put forward about changes to the Trade Practices Act and about legislating that people can take action where they believe there has been unfair conduct are important aspects of the way in which small businesses can feel that, through the legislative process, they have some backing. There has been some criticism of the actions of the former Labor government in regard to the matters that have been discussed in this report. A number of us would acknowledge that, yes, they are matters that perhaps should have been redressed. But given the emphasis that there is at the moment on voluntary codes of conduct, I think that Labor in government was willing to say, 'We will give them a go.' I have to say to you it has failed, and we are acknowledging that. The honourable member for Lowe( Mr Zammit) nods his head. He was somebody on the committee that emphasised that this was the case. He gave people the opportunity to say, 'Show us where they have succeeded.' of other members of the government on the committee, as the honourable member for Rankin( Mr Beddall) said when he spoke on the day of the tabling, has been very courageous in putting forward recommendations that might have been difficult for some of those in leadership",154,Representatives Main Committee

Some recommendations would go against the orthodoxy of thinking of government. I appreciate that it is often difficult when you are in government when you know that you are out of step with those that are down in the ministerial end of this building. But the committee came up with a unanimous set of recommendations that I would hope the government considers closely. The opposition has indicated that they are quite willing to support legislation based on the recommendations in the report. I am pleased that that has been the indication by the opposition. This report was a very careful discussion and investigation of matters surrounding the way in which small business is treated. The urgency of these matters is illustrated time and time again. At the moment, the people that have franchises with Shell have concerns because the arrangements that had been made about the pricing of fuel from Shell have been unilaterally changed. If the franchising code had been working properly, this would not have been allowed. But what we need to see is a legislative basis for franchising so that the codes of conduct can be enforced by legislation. We need some arrangements whereby the franchisors have to register so that the franchisees can comfortably feel that they do have some legitimate basis that will give them protection. I hope that, in the next few weeks, when the minister discloses the government's reaction to this report, they accept the recommendations that have been handed down by the report. (Time expired) Main Committee on the report of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia. I must say that this is one of the most balanced reports I have ever had the pleasure of being part of. It comes from a committee of 15 people, all of whom are dedicated to trying to find a way to assist small businesses to have a fair go, which I think is one of the major Australian traits. I have been a member of parliament for some 18 months in the federal sphere, and for about 12 years before that in the state sphere. I have been involved by shopkeepers and tenantsreluctantly, on my part, but with no choice but to represent my constituents. If ever there was a tragedy of strong arm tactics being employed by those who have all the aces in the pack, this is one of the cases that I think should not have been allowed to go on for as long as they have. The opposition has said that it gave voluntary codes of conduct a go. I appreciate that, but it has not worked. One of the questions we asked of all the people who came before us and who recommended the continuation of a voluntary code of conduct was: 'Name one industry where the voluntary code of conduct has operated.' They could not, satisfactorily. No-one could, because it just does not work. There is no doubt that you need to underpin it by legislation, and that is one of the recommendations. Where a retail tenant or a shopkeeper in a major shopping centre feels that, for whatever reason, they have been treated in an unfair and unconscionable way, there is nothing available to them, to fight back, other than to take legal action. But we all know that they cannot do that without going bankrupt. They just cannot take on the major shopping centres, with the tremendous facilities available to them-unlimited amounts of money, legal advice, and so on-and walk away without being hurt very badly or ending up being bankrupt, which is just as bad. I recall a particular instance in one of my shopping centres, where I came to know the owner of the shopping centre quite well and I found that person to be a very reasonable person. He",156,Representatives Main Committee
281,Mr Zammit (Lowe) (1.19 P.m.),"I am very pleased to rise to enter the debate in this7366 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 28 August 1997 is not an Australian national, and he had to leave the running of the company in the hands of a real estate agent who claimed to have management expertise in dealing with difficult situations. I struck up a relationship with this person. I had to bypass the managers of the shopping centre because I was getting nowhere with them. I was fortunate in that he was very willing to listen to me and very willing to come to some agreement. In some instances, that just could not happen. I well recall getting a phone call from the centre manager in one of my shopping centres. In fact, I mentioned publicly in the inquiry that this person contacted me. She said, 'Your request' -for whatever it was; I do not remember the exact matter'has been denied.' I said, 'I'm not very happy about that, because I think what you did was unjust.' She said, 'But let me warn you. You could be up for very serious charges. You mayor may not have seen the New South Wales act that specifically stops someone from entering as a third party into a dispute between two other parties in a shopping centre arrangement.' I must say that I found that intimidating. I found it insulting, in the implied threat that she was going to arrange to take legal action against me for representing my constituents. I recall receiving a phone call from the company involved. They apologised for any such threat, but they claimed that the threat was not made. I said, 'It's your word against mine, but I would suggest that you have it investigated.' They wrote back to me after about a week and they talked around the subject, but they did not deny that I had been threatened. I then phoned the general manager of the company and said, 'I've got my own advice. If you try and stop me ever again from carrying out my duties as an elected member of parliament, then I will take my own appropriate action. That sort of action is not the sort of thing that would be useful to you or to me, or to the parliament, but you leave me no choice.' If these people can act towards me in the way that they have, you can imagine how much more intimidating it must be for the shopkeepers and the tenants. Let me give you specific examples of some of the things that have occurred. I know of a person who, in a shopping centre, owned a delicatessen-type shop and was selling cheeses and ham and all the sorts of things that are sold in a delicatessen. The shopping centre allowed the extension of a supermarket and allowed it in such a way that, within three metres of the shop, there was a delicatessen-type set-up. I suppose you can say that competition is competition, but I say up to a point. If there were any goodwill involved from the centre management, they would have said to the supermarket, 'You can go ahead and sell all the things that are sold at a delicatessen but not so close to the entrance of this other shop.' But they refused to do that. When I asked them about that they said, 'We have no right to intervene in how a supermarket runs its business.' ThenI pointed out to the supermarket that on an hourly basis they would put specials out to undercut that little shop that had been there for 15 years. As soon as the little shop put their specials out, within an hour the supermarket would put their specials out, undercutting them. I refer to the recommendations that the committee inquiring into fair trading brought down. I must say that it was very unique that we were totally united in our view on how to deal with this issue. The recommendations are to allow all little shops like the one I mentioned to do something about unfair and unconscionable conduct-which no doubt is what it is. Of course, the thing that holds these shops back is that they cannot go to court. First of all, they have reached a stage in their lives when they are having difficulty paying the rent and having difficulty meeting the competition. The last thing they can do is find another $40,000 Thursday, 28 August 1997 MAIN COMMlITEE 7367 or $50,000 to go to court. Even if they went to court and won they would have to fight the shopping centre, which would say, 'We think we've been unfairly treated by the court, and we'll appeal.' That means that the small shops would have to find another $40,000 or $50,000, and of course they just do not have that sort of money to fight back. This is a very complex situation that is facing Australians. I want to refer to a couple of specific recommendations that I believe are extremely important. One is recommendation 2.3, regarding dispute resolution. The committee has recommended low cost mediation. In other words, the committee has said, 'Let's not run off to court all the time; let's put in place a mechanism whereby an aggrieved party can go to someone and say, ""You're an independent arbitrator; would you arbitrate between us?''' We request that, whichever side the arbitrator comes down against, the arbitrator do the right thing without anyone having to go to court. We want to stop Australia heading down the path of some other nations of the world where they go to court at the drop of a hat to resolve difficulties that they may encounter. I think that that is one of the most important things that the committee has recommended-to allow low cost dispute resolution. Also, the committee has said that it is very important that, in the event that the dispute resolution is not satisfactorily resolved, there be some mechanism by which an aggrieved party can go to a court without it costing them an arm and a leg-in other words, it does not do away with their right to defend themselves against something that is seen by them to be unfair and unconscionable conduct. That is not available to them at present. I think that that is one of the most important recommendations that we need to have a look at. The other thing that I want to raise is the question of uniform retail tenancy acts and a contract that is uniform throughout Australia. With all of these different jurisdictions-six states and two territories-having their different rules and regulations and contracts, it is very important that there be one contract Australia-wide that everyone understands. People want to know how it can be used to resolve difficulties. They want the contract to be clear so that nothing is left out that may be used against a person who, unwittingly, may have signed a contract. We had solicitors appear before the committee who admitted to us that despite all of their training, the thing that concerned them was not what was in the contract, but what was not in the contract. That was the difficulty. They admitted to us that they were not able to advise their clients satisfactorily because it was not just what you read, it was what was not in it that could cause grave difficulty. I also want to talk about the lack of relocation clauses that apply to retail tenants. One of the things that concerns a lot of retail tenants is the fear of relocation. A shopping centre manager can go to a shopkeeper who has been there for a very long time and say, 'We are going to move you.' They might reply, 'Well, if I have to, I have to.' The manager then says, 'You don't have a choice; you have to because that is the decision.' Then the shopkeeper asks, 'What does it involve?' and the manager says, 'We're going to move you around the back, around the comer.' The shopkeeper then says, 'But no-one will know where we will be,' and they say, 'Well, that's too bad.' The shopkeeper finally asks, 'What about the fit-outs?' and the reply is, 'That's too bad. You're going to have to pay for the fit-outs as well.' That can be a tremendous drain on a retail tenant, and in m<'.ny instances it virtually destroys them. It is not just the relocation of the shop from where they are known to another place 7368 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 28 August 1997 where they are not known and which is perhaps difficult to find; they also have to find the money to do up the shop to the satisfaction of the centre management. I feel that this is a very important step that the committee has taken in outlining all of the difficulties involved in running a small business. I feel that the recommendations that are made here are very sensible and moderate, and they are going to help small and medium sized businesses tremendously. They are also going to help property owners because they will be able to have some stability in the way they run their businesses. There will not be the threat of legal action back and forth on both sides. I am very pleased to have contributed to this debate. Debate (on motion by Mr Slipper) adjourned.
