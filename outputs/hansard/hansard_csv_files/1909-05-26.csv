The CLERK laid upon the tablePapuan Lands Privately Held-Return to an Order of the House, dated n t h December, igoS. House that, at the summons of His Excellency the Governor General, I attended in the Senate chamber, where His Excellency was pleased to deliver his opening speech, of which for greater accuracy I have obtained a copy, though, I presume, it will not be considered necessary for me to read it (vide page 5). That a Committee, consisting of Mr Roberts, Mr Hall, Mr Frazer, and Mr Catts be appointed to prepare an Address-in-Reply to the speech delivered by His Excellency the Governor General to both Houses of the Parliament. OrderedThat the Committee do report this day. The Committee having retired, re-entered the Chamber, and presented the proposed Address-in-Reply, which was read by the Clerk, as follows :MAY We, the House of Representatives of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled, beg to express our loyalty to Our Most Gracious Sovereign, and to thank Your Excellency for the Speech which you have been pleased to address to Parliament. move. That the Address-in-Reply to His Excellency's speech, as read by the Clerk, be agreed to by the House. I recognise that the Ministry, in doing me the honour of asking me to submit this motion for the consideration and, let us hope, the adoption of the House, followed the ordinary custom of giving that opportunity to the last man to be elected to the Chamber. If , during the course of my remarks, r happen not to follow the custom ordinarily observed in submitting similar motions to the House, I am confident that honourable members will do me the honour of believing, at all events, that the departure is not due to any disrespect for those who have preceded me in discharging a like duty, but is made under the belief that at times a change may be acceptable. The labour movement, if I understand it at all, develops the very highest and best individuality in every man, provided that individuality is compatible with the general good. That is in marked contrast to the form of individuality to which we raise, I hope, reasonable objection-that shown by some persons who acquire wealth by the poverty of their brethren. Consequently, if in submitting this motion. I do not follow the ordinary custom it will be recognised that in my view some slight alteration may be acceptable to honourable members, and the responsibility will attach entirely to myself. I should like to express my regret .that the honourable member for Kooyong is not with us to-day; for I sincerely hope that his severe illness will be of short duration, and that we may have the pleasure of soon witnessing his return. I can extend my sympathy also in the direction of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro. We remember-som e with pleasure, others, perhaps, in no pleasing mood-tiie ' able and vigorous address with which he last favoured us, and regret sincerely that he should have been laid aside so long as the result of the energy he then displayed in tlie conscientious, discharge of his public duties. Let me say that I can conscientiously regret the absence through illness of the honourable member for Kooyong, notwithstanding that we have been recently on opposite sides IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCYin respect of an industrial trouble. I take this opportunity of expressing my sincere regret that after the decision of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration the directorate of the Broken Hill Proprietary should have thought fit to victimize certain citizens of Australia for I no other reason than that those citizens, acting in conformity with the laws of their country, had taken office in certain associations of workmen. I should not like at this juncture to say anything severe, but I feel that with few exceptions it will be agreed throughout the Commonwealth that such conduct is reprehensible. I hope that unions and associations of workmen, being legal institutions in Australia-and practically throughout the Empire-and their officers therefore entitled to respect and consideration, it will not long remain in the power of any private individual to",14,Usher Of The Black Rod Being Dated Ist April 1909

13,Mr Roberts (Adelaide) [3.1],"say that although the law is conformed to -that although the individual has broken no law or rule of his country-h e can still be so victimized that the bread is taken from his mouth and the mouths of his wife and children. When I remember the Australian Federation of Employers and remember, too, their black list which circulates throughout the Commonwealth, I cannot but repeat that the victimizing of these citizens' is most reprehensible. Honorclearlv as, I think, it can be put in a speech able members will not expect me to cover the whole length and breadth of the Speech withwhich His Excellency the Governor General has been pleased to open Parliament. I have scarce had time to read it member obtain an advance copy ? time to read it in the light of being able to debate it with the honourable member for Corio. It is possible that in other directions honourable members will not be too severe when they remember that the Speech was read but a few moments ago, and that necessarily one of such a lengthy character, embracing as it does many and important subjects, requires serious and careful consideration. There stand out in .it four or five items of marked! importance, to which the attention of honourable members may be briefly directed. I do so, not that I presume that they will follow in my footsteps, but because they appear to me to be of paramount importance. We cannot fail to recognise that the Ministry durin the various States should, notwithstanding the recess have been particularly atten. tive to their duties. the country. tion. people of Australia like their public men to tour the Commonwealth; they like to know and see and understand them, and I am confident that it is the duty of public men to know and understand the people. How is that possible if honourable members remain secluded? becomes some honourable members more than publicity. The Ministry have displayed an energy and determination that future Ministries will desire to emulate. At any rate they hrve ftdl confidence in the policy that they have submitted, and they have not been lacking in detail in submitting it to the consideration of the country. I wish here to offer in public my congratulations to them for their energy and determination, and for the confidence they have displayed in their policy, and to express the hope that it will not be long before we see that policy put into operation. There stands out in this speech one prominent feature-that Ministers have recognised the obligations of the Commonwealth, and have expressed their intention, as at the opening of Parliament, that those obligations shall be honorably and fully met. They have shown that, particularly with respect to finance, we shall not in the future, as in the past, be prodigal only to find prodigality in return where the money has been going, while unduly restricting expenditure in national directions where it is urgently required. There is also in the speech a recognition of the value and necessity of taking over the control of the States debts. We have had considerable discussion about the subject, the papers have teemed with proposals regarding it, and past Ministries have been prolific in suggestions, but scarce anything of a concrete character has yet been submitted that is likely to find favour with the people of Australia. I welcome the advent of a Ministry which practically says that it is prepared to take over the States debts, and discloses distinctly the fact that that course will result in a saving of very many millions of pounds annually to Australia. It is re'grettable that persons in responsible offices ing the possible saving, still so persistently refuse the terms offered them, and refuse even to submit proposals of a character likely to be acceptable to the people generally. Buti f there is one proposal more important than any other, to which we might direct our attention, it is that of immigration, for bound up with it are two other proposals-that of finding land for those who emigrate to our shores, and that of defence. The three questions seem inseparable. Juggle with words, howyou may, decry one proposal how you like, the three are inseparably But perhaps seclusion combined. You cannot with justice to yourselves, or to the immigrants, ask them to come here unless you can give them conditions superior to those they propose to leave-unles s you can reasonably say to them that there are in Australia opportunities of employment, for putting their mental and physical abilities into practical operation, so that they may obtain for themselves",16,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply

19,Mr Roberts,"I believe that theGovernor-GeneraVs Speech: and those dependent upon them a living a little superior to that to which they have been accustomed in other parts of the world. At this juncture, I regret to note that, while other parties are putting forward prominently the subject of immigration, they are forced at the same time to admit that there is no land available in Australia for immigrants, and that there are thousands of people to-day-bon d fide farmers, capable men, born in our own country, with some little capital in addition to their practical experience-hungril y seeking land and unable to obtain it. always green. Singularly enough, despite the fact that Victoria has a population of only a little over 1,300,000, people are leaving this State because they cannot obtain land. Does the honourable member assert that the land in this State is being put to proper use when there is no land available? Do we indulge ih legislation of a national character? Is it just, is it honourable, is it creditable, shall I say to the Parliament of Victoria, for instance, that her sons, her yeomanry-and in this connection I. recall the well-known linesBut a bold peasantry, their country's pride, When once destroy'd can never be suppliedshould be seeking land in other directions, going east or west as the case may be? The honourable member knows as well as I do that there are millions of acres of land in this State monopolized by a few persons, whose superfluous wealth is not always used in the direction in which it might be used. others who refuse to put into operation anything of a practical character, and who, when spoken to on this particular subject, invariably say, "" Go east, go west, go somewhere else, but touch not the cancer at hand."" tion. ment, at any rate, is representative of the whole of Australia, and what shall we say to those men? An honourable member representing a portion of Victoria may say, ""Go east,"" or ""Go west,"" but what shall the Federal Parliament say to those who Queensland, or South Australia, are crying out for land? You can name no land of a suitable character upon which there is a reasonable hope of finding even a pittance,, and which is put forward by any State Government for application, for [2]2 [26 MAY, 1909.] Address-in-Reply. 35 which the number of applicants does not exceed by scores, by hundreds, the number of available blocks. What shall we in the Federal Parliament say to those men? , Can we send them to any particular spot? Shall we not touch the trouble? Shall we not endeavour to put into force legislation that we may reasonably hope will have the effect, not merely in one particular sandy portion, but over the whole of Australia, of opening up the available lands now monopolized by a few persons, and not out to a truly effective use of opening them, not only to those whom we have .here now, ready and able, to occupy them, but also to the thousands who are willing to come here and put their practical experience into use for the benefit of Australia? It seems to me that when honourable members continue to employ cries of that description, say-, ing, ""Go east,"" or ""Go west,"" refusing to touch the difficulty in their immediate centres, and looking always at the fields and pastures that are far away, they are neglecting a public duty, and that neglect must reflect seriously upon them, if not at the present moment, at any rate, in the immediate future. I , as a Labour man, am indeed anxious to see the population of Australia increased by men of our own colourour own kith and kin, I say emphatically, in preference, but men of our own colour, certainly. I believe-indeed , I knowthere is room for them in Australia, and that there are opportunities, if our .various legislatures but recognise the difficulty and apply the surgeon's knife.. I know that immigrants could .be suitably settled on The honourable member is like lands to their own benefit, and to the benefit of the Commonwealth, particularly for defensive purposes. And so I say again that the three subjects, while they may come for the moment under different headings, are inseparably bound up with That is practically the situaeach other, and that immigration is, I Fortunately, however, this Parliashall not say a practical impossibility, but is approaching a crime until .we are prepared with lands on which to settle the immigrants-unti l we have brought about the opening up of those lands, I hope by means of a progressive land tax. Following on that will come the establishment of a in Victoria, Western Australia, defence force of a character likely to meet any .attacks that may be made on the Commonwealth. When I look around for anything of a tangible character from the gentlemen who are almost violent in their opposition to a progressive land tax-, I find that for a number of years they have",17,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply

21,Mr Roberts,"Distant fields arebeen crying out for immigrants-that this has been one of their leading subjects. The honourable member for Ballarat quite recently deplored what he thought was the absence of prominence given to this subject in the speech of the Prime Minister. On looking back over the records I find that for some seven years the honourable member for Ballarat has held office as a Minister, of the Crown in the Common-, wealth; and the only practical outcome in this direction is a submission of a proposal to' the States Premiers or the States Parliaments that they shall provide the lands while the Commonwealth provides the men. States never replied. whether that be so or not, but they should have had the courtesy to reply, if only in a letter of acknowledgment. mere acknowledgments. liaments constituted as they are-eac h subject to. and practically in the grip of, a Legislative Council composed of land monopolists-ther e is no more probability of that proposal being accepted or bearing practical fruit than there is of a man flying from here to England. I venture to suggest that after a trial of some years, and, with a knowledge of how the Legislative Councils are composed-wit h a knowledge of the bitter and strenuous opposition every Legislative Council has shown to the opening up of the lands on a reasonable basis-it is not merely 'futile, but it is knowingly playing with the subject of immigration, and with that of the acquisition of land, to put forth such a proposal. It seems to me that the honourable member for Ballarat has frankly acknowledged that the subject of immigration and the land policy are inseparably bound up together; and that, therefore, it would be neither fair nor honourable to introduce immigrants unless land is available for them. Notwithstanding this, the ears of the public are continually tickled with the same old proposal, which is the only one that those in opposition to the policy of the Labour Party have seen fit to submit; and I repeat that thisis not merely futile, but knowingly playing with the subject. I venture to remind the honourable member for Ballarat that, while there is an admissiona frank admission, shall I call it?-that immigrants should not be brought here unless land is available, and that, while there is an amusing proposal submitted to the States Premiers, nevertheless efforts are being made to attract immigrants. It necessarily follows that the persons responsible for this, while they admit that land is not available, are acting neither creditably to themselves nor justly to the immigrants. We have had some very sad illustrations of persons coming to Australia, and finding that the rosy pictures painted by paid advocates in England and elsewhere are not quite ""up to sample."" They have found that the stories told, and that the advertisements, as is not uncommon with advertisements, are scarcely borne out in realization. Sad to say, some of those immigrants have returned to the old world; and I venture to think that the manner in which they will speak will be an advertisement of a character that this country can ill-afford, and will counteract to a verylarge extent the pictures painted by those who are attracting people here, without considering as to what is likely to be their fate on arrival. The recent agitation in a certain direction for immigrants seems to have started some twelve or eighteen months ago. If I remember correctly, a gentleman of the name of Morgan came here from some, part of England, as representing the Chamber or Association of Manufacturers; and he distinctly stated in his public utterances that for the employing section-wit h whom he was apparently more intimately associated-to be successful, they must have, not merely a sufficiency, but a surplus of labour. Though honourable members may be indifferent to what that means, we ought not to be indifferent to the sufferings of the surplus. If manufactures cannot be carried on unless there be a surplus of labour-whic h means that a section of human beings shall starve continually, knocking at the door, and asking for employment at whatever wages the owner chooses to give-w e are neglecting our duty, and showing an. indifference to suffering which ought not to be countenanced by public men in Australia, at any rate. Only a few days ago I noticed that Dr. Arthur was proceeding to England for the purpose of advocating immigration. That gentleman, with his painting of all manner of patriotic pictures, and urging the need for immigrants, failed to rouse any enthusiasm in the minds of his listeners, who were the members of the South Australian Chamber of Commerce, until in his last few words he",18,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply

Almost immediately his auditors seized on the "" business proposition,"" because it meant that they would have a surplus of labour; and some commercial knowledge seems to start and end with the -consideration of how little can be paid in .wages, and how many hours men can be -employed for the small pay.

It is only by that means that we can populate Australia, and it is only with population that we can properly defend our land. acquainted with the details of the Ministerial proposals relating to defence; but, in my opinion, every male in Australia should have a knowledge of drill and the use of the a-ifle, and should be disciplined, so that, should the occasion arise, he may be a potential force for the defence of his country. -disciplined army is in every way preferable to a patriotic raSble, which is what our people must be if they remain undisciplined, and without skill in the use of firearms and weapons of warfare. But I am not piepared to compel men to leave their avocations to acquire the rudiments of drill, nor do I know to what extent the leader of the Opposition has modified his views in that direction, though probably we shall soon be enlightened on the subject. I am prepared to commence by drilling our boys. When Australia instituted compulsory education, the Parliaments did not drag men' of twenty-five or thirty from their work to the schools. We regretted that part of the population did not enjoy the advantages of early education, but we thought it sufficient to confine our schooling .to the boys and girls. I suggest a similar commencement in regard to defence. Putting my views into concrete form, I would say that we might start with boys at the age of ten years, and subject them to drill compul-sorilv until they reach the age of nineteen years. This nine-year period I would break up into three equal portions of three years each, devoting the first to preliminary drill, the second to advanced work, with -the use of small or dummy rifles, and the third to training in the handling of real guns, the acquiring of field experience, skill in scouting, and general knowledge of military work, to enable the lads to assist in the defence of the country should any attack be made upon it. There might also be a militia force 'which men over the age of nineteen -could join. HadI the power, I would abolish the present volunteer force; and I know of no man in military service,, with the exception, perhaps, of some of the volunteer officers, with whom I am not in agreement on the subject. A volunteer force and a militia have never worked toWe require such legislation as gether satisfactorily. I would suggest the establishment of a militia,, in which men could serve for five years after finishing their period of compulsory training. It would be similar to that in which we now have three years' service. For men who had gone through the militia, there might be a I am not yet semi-reserve force, which they would join for a period of six years, by which time they would have reached the age of thirty years. Then, while every male in the community might not have gone through the militia and reserve forces, there would be none who had not received compulsory training of a character enabling him to assist in When there is need for defence, a the defence of his country. ThoughI do not commit myself to agreement with these proposals in detail, I am glad that the Ministry has put forward defence proposals. The cost will be a little more than the estimate of the cost of the proposals put forward by the last Administration. While the Deakin Government found itself unable to finance a militia of 23,000 or 24,000, or, if we include the volunteers, a force of 30,000, on an annual expenditure of ^SoOjOoo, it proposed to create a defence force half-a-million strong on an expenditure of jQx, 100,000. ' But we remember with deep regret that, having expended a few pounds in New South Wales in welcoming the American Fleet, it could not find funds to provide the ordinary Easter Encampment for the forces of the State. Therefore, we may reasonably conclude that its estimate was ill-considered, and put forward merely for the purposes of the moment. Some of us were prevented from speaking on the Defence Bill last year, and I therefore take this opportunity to express my deep regret that the late Minister of Defence, when introducing his Bill, used words insulting to the officers under his control. His remarks were of a character to reflect upon him discreditably, for they applied to officers who could not reply to him, and who were wearing a dress for whose details he was at the moment solely responsible, since matters of dress are controlled by regulations, which a Minister can at all times alter, if he so new about it. It is the old Protection. desires.

Why all this marching and counter-marching?

Returning to the fact that there has been no objection to the Ministerial programme, I should like to point out that the honourable member for Parramatta is reported to have saidHe objected to the Labour Party beine in office at all. He did not know why he did so, but he objected. It was another case of "" I do not love the, Dr. Fell.""

46,Mr Roberts,"Perhaps the honorber for Swan. He was another who was prepared to give a Dreadnought, and I think submitted the proposal in his customary flowery language, with several quotations about Nelson, and the Union Jack, .and the dear Old Flag. Yet somehow, when he was hurrying over to the fusion (negotiations a couple of weeks ago, and was interviewed in Adelaide by one of the .gentlemen of the press, his reply was'"" Yes, I was in favour of it a few weeks .ago, but at the present I cannot say what I am prepared to do until I see my ffriends."" Similarly, the honourable memrner for Parramatta is not prepared to say what he can do until he sees his new 'leader. Singularly enough a portion of the interview granted by the right honourable member for Swan in Adelaide took -the form of denouncing the members of -the Labour Party because of their lack of independence, their inability to do anything without consulting each other, and -their working in unison to an extent that he said was inimical to the interests of -the State. he had so far left his independent mind 'behind, or perhaps got it so mixed up in the folds of the flag that he was waving, that he was unable to say then what he was prepared to do about giving a Dreadnought. the 31st day of March, according to the 'honourable member for Parramatta, this Ministry did not represent the people be-cause they would not give away a Dreadnought. To-day the honourable memberto use his own language-does not represent the people because he is not prepared to give away a Dreadnought. not prepared to do it? -process of reasoning if on the 31st day of t March certain men were not representative -of the people because they refused, then manifestly the men who refuse to-dav are not representative of the people. -giving the honourable member back his own words. Those men scarcely know their -own minds for two or three weeks, yet they claim to be the representatives of the people and deny that title to other men, who, despite the outcry of the moment, declined to take that form of assisting in the defence -of the Empire. Yet those'are the only two reasons that the honourable member for Parramatta could advance in the whole of his. -searching address for objecting to the JLabour Ministry holding office. The real reason was, as a matter of fact, put very plainly in the Age, which to-day is master of the situation. I offer my sincere con* gratulatiorts to that powerful paper. It has not merely brought the Opposition down to the ring-bolt, but it stands to-day on top of its local contemporary, and on top, also, of the Sydney Morning Herald, the Daily Telegraph, the Courier, and the lot of them. The whole of them have been brought down to the ring-bolt, and the Age stands to-day absolutely master of the situation, dictating terms as never previously David Syme dictated them. I do most sincerely and without adulation or flattery offer my congratulations to that newspaper for the masterly manner in which it has succeeded. A leader in the Age of yesterday or to-day shows clearly that the Opposition is prepared for anything if only it can put the Labour Party out. I would like to submit the question to the people of Australia on that basis. If the Opposition can find no reasonable objection to the various planks of the Labour Party's platform, if it cannot give Yet in the same interview publicity to its reasons for seeking to out the present Ministry out other than the fact that it merely wishes to turn them out, that is an attitude which will .scarcely appeal to the people of Australia. give any reasons for turning the Deakin Government out ? give reasons. I am now respectfully asking the honourable member for Parramatta for some explanation of his intentions. We merely said to the Deakin Government, in language that could not be cavilled at, that so far as we were concerned support was withdrawn. The Ministry, with the assistance of the Opposition, seemed to collapse, but I wish to say on their behalf that they sought an opportunity for discussion by submitting a motion that would have permitted it, but that the Opposition to a man prevented discussion, and so prevented the I am Labour Party from giving expression to the reasons for their action. Probably the Opposition did not desire it. It was not in their tactics at that particular moment. There has been some talk of fusion. If I mav bring "" alliteration's artful aid "" to my as-sistance, I would say that in the preliminary efforts the usually diplomatic Deakin dived desperately down into the dark depths of coalition decline, and came back with despair writ large upon his face.

50,Mr Roberts,"We were not asked to find coalition consolation, and went back with consternation on his face, for he had failed, whereupon the fretful Forrest forced his way into the proposals, and returned foiled. It is a comical position. I scarcely remember, in my political career, extending as it has over a number of years, anything more comical than the desperate desire of the three honourable members not to put a policy before the country, not to find fault with the Labour policy, not to explain in any way how it was inimical to the interests of our country, not to submit anything definite in its place, and not to give a reason for their action, but simply to come together in this particular manner to put the Ministry out. The honourable member can talk round the subject from week end to week end, but there exists no other reason than that. All this business of plot and counterplot is merely to put another Ministry out of office. ting when the Labour Party, put the Deakin Government out? reasons were so palpable that even the men then in office did not require them to be uttered. Certainly the Opposition declined by, specific motion to allow us to give our .reasons, in that they-^I will not say , gagged us-bu t prevented a motion Being submitted that would have permitted discussion. Now we have the curious feature of the defeat of Deakin, the consternation of Cook, and the., failure of Forrest Apparently those honourable members had some qualms of conscience, and were considering their constituents, and had some thought for the principles they had previously professed, for with all their practical knowledge and political experience they were unable to come to a satisfactory understanding. Apparently the whole thing was at an end until other gentlemen came on the scene. Their constituents were not consulted, but one or two manufacturers were brought ---in .to assist the process of fusion. It might almost be said that they were called together over a little Joshua 'spirit, and as they appear to have been under its controlling influence at the particular -moment, I hope that in their interests it will not have the ""Boomerang"" effect'--it is very likely -to have. But not even the spirit was sufficient to do the dark, deed, -and so a little music was brought in. Beale's music, and under the mellowing influence of Joshua's spirit, this process of fusion was taking place. I can understand very well how the politicians would be listening acutely for fear that any one should be objecting to what they were doing; and that, on hearing a voice through the keyhole saying, perhaps, ""What about our country?"" the right honourable member for Swan, with that customary indifference of his, would pass it away,' with "" T u t ! tut! let's have another Joshua."" If the mellowing influence of the Joshua was not sufficient, I can understand the leader, who had protected the musical instrument, saying, "" Strike up another tune, Octavius""; and I can imagine what the tune would bea favourite old tune, and the use of it on such an occasion an insult to it-in the interests primarily of the honourable member for Parramatta, namely, "" Crush them, crush them, one and a l l . "" That is evidently what was played; and for what purpose? For the purpose of strangling in its infancy the Labour Ministry, which they dare not attack in any other form. It seems to me somewhat discreditable that politicians of their experience, not having succeeded, should allow themselves to be persuaded from the path of rectitude and duty, and from the promises that they gave to their constituents, by the interested statements of two or three citizens. to say, were supposed to be formulating proposals for the benefit of the workmen. member had given the employers big duties. ber will admit that, so far as I am concerned, I had no hand in that. The thrust, I admit, in some directions is deserved; but the honourable member must be reminded that those at whom he thrusts were justified in believing that the manufacturers of Australia would prove honourable men, and adhere to their promises, and that their efforts would be directed to now protecting the workmen, as they had previously been directed to protecting themselves.

82,Mr Roberts',"-When -the time o fGovernor-Generals Speech: Treasury bench a Ministry supported by an absolute majority, whose members will be bound together by a national policy which they will not fear to expound in any company or in any place, and, united in the love of their country, not merely fused to turn out a Ministry. that the tide may turn as honourable members opposite do not expect. mind them, without egotism, that, while eighteen years ago there was not a Labour member in any Parliament in Australia, there are now in the various Parliaments 183 or 184 Labour members. During the life of the Labour Party its representation in Parliament has increased, on the average, by about ten members each year, and a similar increase in the representation in this Parliament next year will bring about the result for which J hope-the establishment in power of a Ministry supported by a strong majority, pledged to give effect to national legislation. to some words spoken last night by the honourable member for Ballarat. in putting forward the Liberal policy which is about to be accepted by the Conservatives. spoke clearly and calmly, but with his customary indefiniteness, so that even the Age says this morning that he might easily have been more explicit. Perhaps these glorious generalities will be more easily disposed of in the future than precise statements. A l , though a few weeks ago the honourable gentleman soundly rated the Labour Ministry in regard to its programme saying that it was all very well to dress the shop window, but goods must be marked in plain figures, when, in his turn, he makes a statement of policy to the public, he is told by the newspaper which has always been most kind to him that he might have been more explicit, that he should mark his goods in plain figures, proving him to be guilty of that for which he blames us. ment with which I wish to deal is the denunciation of the Labour Party as governed by a dominating caucus. He said that we in this Parliament do not represent the people, or used similar words calculated to injure our organization. I remember that after he had spoken in like strain on another occasion, he came here and partly apologized for the words he had used. apology. it was a part apology to the members of the Labour Party then present, who were pre[26 MAY , 1909.] Address-in-R&ply. 45 pared to debate the matter with him. Notwithstanding his . flood-like eloquence in denunciation of the Labour caucus, the honourable member is at present occupied in establishing a similar organization. He has stated that his party requires not It seems to me merely organization, but some firm, strong control, so that if candidates are not to be I may reselected according to the critical methods of the Labour Party, at any rate, confusion at elections, by the nomination of two candidates for the one constituency, will be prevented. He desires an organization to control the members of the party, and to dictate to them in a manner in which the Labour organization does not dictate to its members. Every man in the Labour Party is free to, do what he believes to be best in fhte interests of the country. AlthoughI am a Labour member no other member of this Chamber is more independent. The only thing that binds me or any other Labour member-and the honorI wish how to refer able member for Ballarat, notwithstanding that he continues to repeat his misrepresentations, is aware of the fact-is the pledge honorably given to the electors.

92,Mr Roberts,"I should have themanner as does the Labour Part}'. I presume, too, that each pa#ty abides by the decision of the majority. The caucus of the Labour Party has absolutely no power over any one member, and this is so well known to the honourable member for Ballarat as to justify, not a raking, but a scathing reply, if one felt disposed to give it. When he speaks to the contrary he knows that each and every member of our party is free to do as he thinks fit. If he thinks it is best to abide by the resolution of the majority he does so, and if he does not he suffers no penalty. ber tell us what the pledge really is? able member may read it for himself. I am afraid that by merely listening to its being read he will scarcely comprehend it. I wish to repeat that the methods of the Labour Party are open to the world, and that if-jus t as was the case when the honourable member for Ballarat, a few days ago, declined to give information for tactical purposes to the press-everythin g that is done is not published at that moment, the party is but acting in conformity with the method of every other section of the Parliament. The caucus has absolutely no power. We simply unite in the interests of our country, and do our best according to our lights to give practical effect to our views. about the statement that the caucus ""plays the tune"" and Mr Fisher has to dance to it? made it was not true. 2,000,000 males in Australia, and we are told by the honourable member that one of them has said that the caucus "" plays the tune "" and we have to dance to it. tune"" in the case of the honourable memhas made regarding the Federal Capital, ber for Fawkner, and he has to dance to and in this I thought I should be joined it. >ber for Fawkner will take my assurance described in a novel that I read some years that the person to whom he refers has ago.

As soon as he are dancing to it tune, and they approve of it. seen. I do not wish to detain honourable members any longer. Replying to statements respecting the independence of Labour members and their attempts to do their duty, may I say briefly that we have had submitted to us a defined, clear, and definite policy, unmistakable in its national character; and that throughout the last five months-despit e the ability and eloquence of honourable members of the Opposition-ther e has not yet been published a definite objection to any one line of that policy. We have now proposals for bringing together various parties for the one and only purpose of putting out the Ministry. We shall have the knowledge that, if it goes out, it will go out on principle. We shall have the knowledge that if it is made to leave the Treasury bench for the time being it will leave it with the flag flying, and that on the first occasion that there-is an appeal to the country we shall be able tp put to the test which tune is more acceptable to the people-the tune of a clear and a national policy, or the tune of fusion, merely for the sake of grasping the Ministerial benches. The process, evidently, is not quite over; the leaders are at work and the music is still tingling in their ears. In the circumstances I may perhaps with greater confidence submit for the consideration of honourable members, in the hope that it will meet with acceptance, the motion that the Address-in-Reply to the opening speech of the Governor General be approved by the House. pleasure that I rise to second the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply to a Speech which I think has in it proposals more calculated to truly affect, the peonle of Australia than has any that has yet been submitted to this Parliament by a representative of His Majesty.

103,Mr Hall (Werriwa) [4.52],"It is withtators who had been asking for their fulfilment tried to -bring about his death. That seems to be the position in regard to the Federal Capital. number of honourable members who usually sit in Opposition, but who, I am informed, at the present time are engaged in their caucus deliberations, have been agitating for some time, and have lived largely upon the* alleged wrongs that have been done to the Mother State. They have complained continuously, and, I think, with good cause, that year after year the settlement of the Federal Capital question has been deferred, and that New South Wales, instead of having the Capital, as promised, has been steadily cheated out of it. To-day we have in office a Prime Minister who has set himself to the task of giving what they say should have been given years ago, and, like the agitators in the novel, these honourable members are afraid that their stockin-trade will disappear if the promise is fulfilled. That being so, they are seeking as quickly as possible to despatch the Prime Minister who promised, and has so far fulfilled the promise, to give New South Wales the Capital. forth that negotiations regarding the Federal Capital are coming to a successful issue ? If that be so, why should we complain ? It is the honourable member who appears to be annoyed. trary, I am glad that the position has been changed, and that the Capital Site question will soon be settled. On the other hand, the honourable member and his party are dissatisfied. They are anxious to destroy the Prime Minister who has done something to settle it, and to substitute for him one who has done so much to put off its determination. ber aware that the honorary Minister-the honourable member for Hindmarsh-sai d that the Government was in no way responsible for the choice of Canberra? the least affect the position. The honourable member and his fellow representatives of New South Wales on the opposite side of the House know that once the Federal Capital question is; settled five-sixths of their stock-inhtra.de will go. It is for that reason that they do not wish it to be settled. They are anxious that the honourable member for Ballarat should once more be installed as Prime Minister, and that there should-be further delay. We have heard a good deal regarding responsible government in this country, and have been told how necessary A it is that it should be re-established. I ven ture to say that we have witnessed during the last three months an exhibition of responsible government the like of which has not occurred in Australia before, and would not have been seen if the present Prime Minister had not been in office. We have heard also a great deal regarding the presentation of a Dreadnought to Great Britain. about that matter now. when the proposal was hot-whe n the hysteria was at its height-ever y member of other parties was demanding that the Prime Minister should at once cable to the British Government the offer of a Dreadnought. For the first time to' my knowledge in the history of Australia a press-organized proposal of this kind has been defeated. In the past, if the Age, the Argus, the Daily Telegraph, and the Sydney Morning Herald decided that something should be done it was straight way done Fortunately we have now in office an honourable member who has at least allowed Parliament an opportunity to settle the .question. I trust that, whether the life of the Fisher Government be long or short, the precedent which it has established will be followed by those who succeed it-that others will follow the principle adopted by the present Ministry of allowing Parliament to do its own business, and refusing to permit that business to be done by a few newspaper editors. We cannot say now whether or not there is to be submitted to the House a motion regarding the presentation of a Dreadnought to the British. Government. The one question concerning which honourable members who were negotiating for fusion are apparently unable to agree, now that they have had a conference, is whether they will do that which they all said ought to be done. They are prepared to do many things which they all declared ought not to be done, but, although they agreed that a Dreadnought should be presented to the British Government, they are now singularly silent on the subject. The ex-Prime Minister, in the great oration that he delivered last night, was strangely silent in regard to it. Representatives of other States have not the experience that we have had in New So.uth Wales. There we have had in existence a Dreadnought Fupd.",29,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply

I do not wish to detain the House, because I feel that already sufficient attention has been devoted to the moving and seconding of the Address-in-Reply. refer briefly to the speech delivered by the honourable member for Ballarat last night. In that speech the honourable member is reported as saying :I say that when some of your representatives go into a room, and a division is taken, say, amongst ai members of Parliament, supposing n vote on one side and io on the other-al l voting according to their judgment and conscience -the io come out no longer as representatives of the people.
