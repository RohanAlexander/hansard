Adermann) took the chair at 2.30 p.m., vernments at present share the conviction and read prayers. to give the honourable member for Adelaide an answer to a question which he asked concerning a report that there had been radio-active rain in Adelaide since the Monte Bello explosion. I have identified the source of the report as the Adelaide University. slight rise in radiation, which was quite insignificant and, so I am advised, almost certainly not due to the Monte Bello explosion. As I have said before, we have already operating in various places throughout Australia about 30 sampling posts, and we have received reports from all of them. Some, near the Western Australian coast, report a slight rise in radiation background-agai n insignificant-and the post at Woomera records a still slighter rise. As I have also told the House, the Scientific Safety Committee reported, after the Monte Bello exploour other tests, was carried out without sion, that the very rigid requirements imposed by it for meteorological protection of safe-firing conditions, and for examining the subsequent radio-active fall-out by sea and air operations, were fully met by those in charge of the tests, and that the operation was carried out without any hazard whatsoever to life on the. mainland, to ships at sea, or to aircraft. It must be remembered that mankind is at all times subject to what is known as natural radiation. If , anywhere in the world, air is sucked through a filter paper, activity will be detected, and this fluctuates very greatly-as much as ten times-du e to various natural influences, and is not in any way dangerous. Every time one takes an aeroplane trip to an altitude of, say, 10,000 feet, radio activity increases considerably. So, too, when one goes to the doctor to have an X-ray or, indeed, if a geiger counter is applied to one's wristlet watch at any time a high counting rate is recorded. On the question of radiation in relation to atomic tests, Sir Anthony Eden recently told the House of Commons after his talks with President Eisenhowerthat the radiation dose to human beings arising from the testing of these weapons at the present rate is insignificant compared with the radiation dose rising from natural causes. This accords with the view, which I have already quoted in this House, expressed by Sir John Cockcroft to the House of Commons committee recently. In the same connection Dr. Eddy, the chairman of the United Nations Organization Radiation Committee and a very celeI t reported a brated X-ray expert in the Department of Health, informs me that the information presented to the committee. . . by the delegations of India, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States regarding measurements of fall-out which had been made in those countries over a considerable period indicated that tlie radiation to date from fall-outs was only a fraction of the natural background. I sum the matter up in this way: the Government's scientific advisers, who are men of great eminence and responsibility, say that the Monte Bello test, as with all any risk whatsoever, present or future, to life or property in Australia and in surrounding countries. We shall continue to act on their advice in such a way as to ensure that there is no risk whatsoever in the future. The source of my information to-day is Professors Martin and Titterton and Dr. Eddy. document the Minister has read in his answer ? document, the contents of which are based on information supplied to me by Professors Martin and Titterton and Dr. Eddy. reply from the Minister for Supply to-day, it will be recalled that the same situation has arisen in New Zealand since the Monte Bello test. I say that, whilst the Minister's report states that no relationship can be proved between the tests and the radio activity of rain in certain places, it must be admitted that it is",6,Setup

5,Mr Chambers,"Followmg theextraordinary that, notwithstanding the advice of the experts, rain which has fallen in South Australia has never before shown radio-activity. The matter cannot be lightly passed over, when it is only a few days or a week since the test was held. What is the honourable gentleman's question ? think the document should be made available to the House. I do not think that this is a laughing matter, because I have seen in Japan the results of radio-activity Russian socialist system and for his on human beings. It is certainly not a laughing matter, but this, after all, is question-time. like to ask the Minister foT Supply whether he will lay on the table of the House the document in relation to the reports issued by the experts to whom he has referred. man yesterday, presumably as a matter of urgency, because it was during the time for questions without notice, asked me a question on this matter. I undertook to get him an immediate reply. I have just given him a reply, which is based on information furnished to me by the very distinguished scientists, Professors Martin and Titterton and Dr. Eddy, and I have told the House precisely what they have to say on the matter. Each of them has given his approval to my answer to the honourable gentleman in the words used. As to the question of rain in New Zealand, the honourable gentleman is a little confused in his mind. Does he not remember that there was a hydrogen bomb explosion in the Pacific some time ago? Mr J. R. ERASEB -Blam e the Yanks! old Australian for the alleged radioactive fall-out in New Zealand. Honourable members interjecting, If the House will not come to order, I shall call on the business of the day. tion to the Minister for External Affairs. Has the right honourable gentleman's attention been drawn to recent top-level administrative adjustments in Russia which will particularly affect a highranking diplomat whose name I may not mention in this place during questiontime, but which, I understand, means "" hammer "" ? As this particular diplomat would now appear to have far more time to attend to his overseas correspondence, would this be an appropriate time to write and ask him for his ideas on the opinion about his Russian colleagues who, fortunately for them, remained in Australia in 1954? Opposition members interjecting, on'ce, I must fail my friend from Corio, in that I have not access to information that would enable me to answer his question, largely by reason of the fact that I am not sufficiently in the confidence of Mr Molotov to be entering into private and confidential correspondence with him. If I might venture to suggest to my friend from Corio that he might possibly feel inclined to recast his question and address it to some one other than myself Honourable members interjecting, the honourable member for Corio does not need any advice from me in these matters, but perhaps I might suggest to him that, in recasting his question and seeking the information that he clearly wants, he might preface it, if Mr Deputy Speaker were agreeable, with a question at large, which he might put into this form: Is there a doctor in the House? Minister for External Affairs a question which is not pre-arranged and which he should be able to answer of his own knowledge.

In view of the fact that the recommended to the British Government family referred to has been in Australia that it should deny control of internal only sixteen months, and does not owe security to Mr Marshall and his arrears of rent, will the Minister confer Government of Singapore.

BAN K ADVANCE S FOR HOUSING. question to the Acting Prime Minister. [ direct the right honourable gentleman's attention to a statement attributed to the alternate general manager of the Bank of New South Wales Savings Bank Limited to the effect that the bank will make available £4,000,000 a year, to be increased as deposits with the bank increase, to finance the purchase and buildfor Gwydir.

I ask him to proceed with the question. it now. Will the Acting Prime Minister confer with the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia with a view to having the Commonwealth Savings Bank abandon its present policy of restricting housing loans and adopt a liberal policy of making advances to depositors who desire to build or purchase homes? monwealth Bank of Australia has been most generous, and as liberal as the circumstances will permit, towards home^ builders in Australia.

I shall discuss the matter with the Governor of the bank. for Social Services given consideration to the general question of a contributory national insurance scheme covering social security for the aged? Has the Minister any information about the value of schemes of this kind which are in operation in other countries, and have any calculations been made of the cost of a contributory national insurance scheme adequate to provide the social security benefits we in Australia now enjoy? may agree that this is a tall question from the lofty and honourable member answer it. Officers of the Department of Social Services are constantly carrying out investigations into compulsory contributory national insurance schemes that are in operation in other parts of the world, and I am bound to say that the investigations have not been reassuring. There is nothing to indicate that those schemes are any better than our own system of providing social service benefits. After all, compulsory contributions are only another form of taxation. Whereas income tax is levied on different incomes at different rates-and , indeed, not at all on some incomes-compulsor y contributions are arbitrarily imposed on every insured person, and no cognizance is taken of the ability of the person to pay.

I ask the right honourable gentleman whether, in his own judgment, that anxiety is well founded. Is he aware of any medical authorities elsewhere in the world who have criticized the fluoridation of water and described it as being injurious ? question of the fluoridation of water has been considered by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia, which expressed the opinion that an optimum amount of fluorine in the water was of benefit in reducing the inciand as such is retained. My recollection dence of dental caries and that so long as it was kept at the right amount it did no harm. Of course, this is a fairly wide question. The fluoridation of water is not merely a matter of putting fluorine in the water and leaving it at that. It involves constant supervision and estimation of the amount of fluorine in the water. The prevention of dental carie3 depends on other factors being taken into consideration as well as the supply of fluorine. I am not aware of any adverse reports from responsible authorities elsewhere in the world, but I understand that the fluoridation of water supplies is practised to a considerable extent and supported by responsible opinion in the United States of America. for Supply Avhether the Government, has continued the policy of stockpiling strategic materials which was initiated when the Government's official view was the likelihood of war in 1952.

We would have gone in for more purchasing for stockpile purposes except"" that, at that time, everybody else in the world was trying to do the sameand the supplies were not available:. We stockpiled some millions of pounds'"" worth of rubber from Malaya and somemillions of pounds' worth of aluminium ingot, and some other materials. Those stockpiles have been retained with one small exception which I shall mention, later. Our stockpile of rubber is"" turned over "" from time to time. Thai is to say, it is released to the tradeso that it will not deteriorate, and fresh supplies come in.

43,Mr Harold Holt (Higgins,"Minis received by him under the last preceding subrecognize the existence of a conscientiously held belief in this regard. There is a precedent for the course we propose to take in the behaviour of other parliaments in regard to this matter, in New Zealand, New South Wales, and, I understand, Queensland. There is also a precedent, in principle at any rate, in the way in which we have legislated in relation to trainees under the National Service Training Scheme. In the amendment I have not gone as far as was desired of me by those persons who made representations to me and to other members of the Government. This proposed provision will exempt an employee, but it was also put to me that there should be a corresponding provision exempting an employer from the obligation to observe preference where the employer held a conscientious belief in that regard. It may be that beliefs of that kind are seriously entertained by employers, but frankly I found it somewhat difficult to convince myself that the holding of beliefs of that characRegistrar is more likely to be fully alive ter in relation to one aspect of an award of a court, namely preference, might not be said to apply with almost equal force to almost any other provision of an award. I do not feel the same obligation to extend the kind of relief sought to the employer as I do to the employee. The case of an employee is that of a man gaining a livelihood and having to maintain a family. He might be prejudiced in respect of that livelihood if preference were exercised against him solely on the ground that he entertained a conscientious belief against accepting membership of a union. It may be said that an employer, too, would experience some embarrassment, financial or otherwise, but, subject to hearing the views of the committee, I do not think that the argument holds with the same force. This is a question on which we need not, I think, express ourselves in purely party, terms. It is an important and interesting question of social and political conduct, and there should be a frank expression of views on the part of members of the committee irrespective of where they sit in the chamQueensland court went, a little further ber. We have given recognition to the fact that persons who are members of a union have made some contribution to the conduct of the union and the union, by its conduct, has perhaps been able to secure benefits which are of value to its members. In accordance with the practice that has grown up in other parliaments that have dealt with this sort of problem, we take the view that a person who is given the benefit of exclusion from the preference provision should not at the same time be relieved of the financial obligation which he would otherwise incur as a result of membership of the union. In this case, provision is made for a contribution to the Consolidated Revenue Fund, through the Registrar, of an amount that will correspond to what the person concerned would otherwise have paid into the funds of the union appropriate to his occupation. The establishment of the fact that a conscientious belief is held will take place before the Registrar of the court. J think that is preferable to requiring the fact to be established before a magistrate, as happens in certain other cases. Thp to the industrial implications of a particular situation than is a magistrate. He is more likely also to be able to assess realistically the existence or otherwise of the conscientious belief which is the basis for exclusion from the preference provision. I believe that the amendment will commend itself to most of the members of the committee, and I offer it to them for their consideration. [3.12] -We offer no objection to the amendment proposed by the Government. We take the view that people who have a genuine conscientious objection to joining a union should be given some relief. The Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Harold Holt) has indicated that the corresponding decision in New South Wales was a parliamentary decision. As a matter of fact, the proposal was put forward by the party to which I have the honour to belong. In Queensland the decision was made by the Arbitration Court of that State, but, if my memory serves me correctly, the than did the New South Wales legislation tn ensure that persons who souprht exclusion from the preference provisions were actuated hy gpnuine conscientious beliefs.

44,Mr E. James Harrison (Blaxland ),"to the appropriate trade union, plus 10 per cent., should be made by people who applied successfully to the Eegistrar for relief, on conscientious grounds, from the provisions of awards which gave preference to trade unionists. I agree largely with the point of view expressed by the Minister. An attempt must be made to give relief to people who have genuine conscientious objections to joining unions, but, at the same tinio, we must give to the trade union movement the maximum possible guarantee that this provision will not be allowed to become an avenue of escape for people who want to break down trade unionism and disorganize the relations between trade unions and employers' organizations within the framework of industrial arbitration in Australia. We believe that the amendment will meet the position of the employee. With regard to the employer, some though the whole of the benefits under an people take the view that he should not be award have been won as a result of the required to enforce the preference providiligence, study and research of union sions if he has a conscientious objection officials. to doing so, but our view is that such freedom of choice would throw wide open the possibility that some employers would point of view, and I do not intend to not attempt to maintain the principle of vote against the amendment.

I say at the outset that I am an enthusiast for compulsory unionism, which has prevailed in my profession, journalism, for more than a quarter of a century, certainly in relation to employment on the metropolitan dailies which have representatives covering the activities, of this Parliament; but I contend also very strongly for the right of conscience, and I believe that that is a right which this Parliament must act to protect. That is a very difficult problemto solve, and I congratulate the Minister for-Labour and National Service( Mr Harold Holt) and his officers on having made an attempt to provide protection for those people in tha community who feel themselves impelled by conscience to belong neither to a.trade union nor to an employers' association. I agree that the benefits that are available as to conditions in industry have been won, in th6 main, as a result of direct action by industrial unions, by agreemenit between employer and employee organizations, ov by awards of the CommonAvealth Arbitration"" Court on questions affecting those two groups. Jt is true that every employee to-day gains thebenefit of conditions that have been won by trade union activity of one sort or another over very many years; but it is undeniable that there is in the community a very considerable body of people who, as I have said previously, because of their' religious beliefs, are impelled by their-consciences not to belong to either nn Binployer or> employr.e'""'C>rganization. ; [6 JTJI s, 1956.J ArSUrdlion'Bill. 2837 I'think the amendment proposed'by the Minister provides protection foi* the ""employee who feels, by conscience, that he must not become a member of a trade union. .He is required,to gain, and the amendment provides that he shall gain, no. financial benefit from, refraining from joining a trade union.. ' It is provided that the .equivalent of the.trao'e union membership, .fee must be paid to Consolidated Revenue by the conscientious objector. Let me say .that I think that it requires very strong conviction and very, considerable courage for people in this community to say that their consciences will not allow. them to join a trade union or an employers' association.

Those Avho have spoken to me on this matter have pointed out the position of individual employers.

It has been discussed by the Opposition, which reached the conclusion that it should not be opposed. One can easily understand how a political party which has been largely founded on the sacrifices of trade unionists must approach this question carefully, lest what appears to be a concession and recognition may be subject to abuse. I believe that what has won the day, so to speak, in this particular case, as has already been indicated by my colleague, the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory ( Mr J. R. Eraser), is the obvious sincerity of the gentlemen who made representations in connection with the matter, not only to the Government, but also to members of the Opposition. They are obviously sincere men, and they have their conscientious beliefs. They are people who would, I should imagine, satisfy any tribunal appointed to deal with conscientious objection in this I can give of the way a similar provision particular matter. Whilst the Australian Labour party has stood for trade unionism and, in a sense, trade unionism has been the foundation of the Labour party, our great struggle has been associated with the difficulty of getting recognition of trade unionism, especially in the early days of the Labour movement. That 5"" the point that the honourable member for Hume( Mr Anderson) forgets. Indeed, his attacks from time to time on trade unionism in this chamber have been very bigoted and very unjust. I do not want to cross swords with him unnecessarily, but when he refers to the United Nations declarations he must also read these declarations as a whole. There is one result of the Charter of Human Rights that is never understood or appreciated, and that is that the taking of a particular right to too far a conclusion tends to destroy the very right which the Charter of Human Rights was designed to protect. So far as trade unionism is concerned, the honourable gentleman should know, in connection with the shearing industry, that great efforts were made by the wool growers' organization to destroy the trade union in that industry by the actual establishment of bogus trade unions subsidized by the employers. That is the type of thing that is felt, and 13 not forgotten, by the trade unions. I am proud of the way in which this matter has been approached by the Opposition. We looked at the position in the various States of the Commonwealth, and in a moment I shall refer to one example which supports the acceptance of this amendment. The subject-matter of the proposed amendment is clearly preference to members of trade unions. Before any exemption can be obtained, the person concerned, in order to obtain a certificate, has to satisfy the Registrar of the court that his conscientious beliefs do not allow him to become a member of a trade union. Provision is made that the person concerned shall pay to the Registrar the fees that might otherwise be payable to a trade union by one of its members. The fees are paid, not to the trade union, but to Consolidated Revenue, and there is no direct pecuniary gain to anybody who obtains a certificate under this provision. I shall give the best illustration that works. I shall read from the Queensland Industrial Gazette of the 30th June, 1948. The Industrial Court of Queensland, presided over by Mr Justice Matthews, and of which Mr W. J. Riordan and Mr T. E. Dwyer were members, had to deal with an application by certain persons for exemption from the obligation to join certain industrial unions of employees under the various awards of the court. We should remember that in Queensland it is not merely a question of preference; it amounts, in many cases, practically to an obligation to join a union. The motion was on behalf of certain persons and the grounds were that the applicants objected on conscientious grounds to being members of an industrial union or any society or body either political, sporting or public. The conscientious objector in that case did not want to have his freedom restricted, not only so far as trade unions were concerned, but also in relation to any society that might attempt to control him in any respect whatsoever. In its judgment the court saidProvision for such people has heen made elsewhere in the Commonwealth and in New Zealand. We think it would be a very dangerous principle to adopt without adequate provision to ensure its application only to those who are genuine in their conscientious objections.",20,Conciliation And Arbitration Bill 1956
59,Dr. Evatt (Barton,"Leade r of theThat is to say, there must be safeguards. The judgment continuedWe think that if tliese safeguards can be provided relief should be given. We therefore make a general order that if any person has objection on conscientious ground to being a member of an industrial union, he shall on satisfying the Industrial Registrar or an Industrial Magistrate that his conscientious objections are genuine and on payment to the Industrial Registrar or the Clerk of Petty Sessions in any district of an amount equal to tlie subscription fixed by thc industrial union covering the culling in which such person is from time to time employed, plus an amount of 10% of such subscription, be issued by the Industrial Registrar or the Industrial Magistrate wit h a certificate. To make a safeguarding clause, what was required was a contribution not merely cf the union subscription but an additional percentage of it . That is not required here, but apparently it was included in the first place to stop any abuse of the law and to protect bona, fide trade unionism. The judgment went on to saySuch certificate shall permit such person to work in any industry under award wages and conditions, and the production of such certificate on demand by the employer, union official or industrial inspector, shall be sufficient to exempt him from the preference clause of thc relevant award. All moneys collected under this order shall be paid into Consolidated Revenue. The form of certificate is shown on page 1012 of the Queensland Industrial Gazette 1948. The amendment is, in principle, along the lines of that part of the Queensland legislation, and it certainly bears strong resemblance to provisions since incorporated in New South Wales and in New Zealand. Taking that point of view, we feel that those who made representations to the Government -man y of whom have put their case before Opposition members-hav e made a deep impression, believing that they are completely sincere about this matter. But we feel equally that they would be the first to recognize that such a provision is capable of abuse in certain circumstances. I do not say that there is any proof of that at all, but that is the reason why trade unions must look at such a provision with care. I believe that a solution for the immediate problem has been found in this amendment, and it is on that footing that I have made this statement on behalf of the Labour party. debate on this proposed amendment and on the principle that is at issue indicates again the trouble that we make for ourselves when we introduce a wrong and then attempt to remove some of the consequent action that results. The mere fact that somebody who is a conscientious objector to compulsory unionism has to make an application to an authority for exemption implies, in the first place, that rhat; person accepts the principle of compulsion, but merely objects to the mechanics of it . does not relate to a situation of compulsion at a l l ; it is the preference provision. tion. Where preference w ill be given to a trade unionist, there is a degree of compulsion. Preference will be given to a person who is a member of an organization and I see very little difference between actual compulsion and that compulsion which makes it necessary for somebody to be a member of an organization. The mere fact that a person desires to receive exemption indicates that he has accepted in principle the compulsion that applies to him. In other words, it means that this Parliament of the people of the Commonwealth is applying compulsion through preference as a basic prin ciple and everybody must accepti t as a responsibility. Forcing people into any organization against their w ill is where we break down. I am a strong believer in trade unionism. Even friends of mine on the opposite side of this chamber who have been with me at various functions, particularly naturalization ceremonies, w ill recall that I have told the people whom I have addressed that I consider it a responsibility for every man to be a member of the organization that applies to his calling or occupation, whether in the employer or employee class. I have said that he should be a member of that organization. I sav that because I believe it is natural; I say it to people who desire,.",22,Conciliation And Arbitration Bill 1956

62,Mr Leslie,"It comes into the queson religious grounds, to have this amendment. It is natural for people who have a common objective and a common ideal to band themselves together in a voluntary effort to -obtain the things that they believe are desirable. Trade unionism built on that principle is successful trade unionism. It means that everybody who has joined that union voluntarily is an ardent worker for the improvement of the conditions, not only of himself, but also of all those with whom he is associated. It can be a Christian work. But when compulsion is appliedand compulsion is applied through preference-so many join a union who merely contribute to its funds, or join an organization which may not be a trade union, such as an employers' organization, and they have not the faintest interest in its affairs. But because they are members and are compelled to subscribe to union funds, they are building up in the hands of someone else a powerful machine which could be used against them if at any time preference were abandoned. I agree with the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Edmonds), who asked where the matter would end if the principle of conceding exemptions were established. It comes back to my point that we are trying, by. half measures, to remove -the consequences of the adoption of a basically wrong principle. ""Where will it end? All my life, I have be3n a member of a union and, along wuh thousands of others, I have contributed to the union funds. I am speaking now of Western Australia, where the unions are affiliated with the Australian Labour party. Because affiliation fees are paid to that party on the basis of membership, every member of a union there is automatically a member of the Australian Labour 'party. The honourable member for Herbert quite rightly said that there are'^probably in the unions people who are compelled to contribute to Labour party funds and, thereby, to become members of the party,, although they object to its principles or are members of either the Liberal party or the Australian Country party. There may be Labour, supporters who contribute to other organizations that help the Liberal party and the Australian Country party; I do not deny it. But this merely indicates what I am trying to point out': Once this principle of compulsion is applied, a tragic wrong is perpetuated. member says, it is an evil. All we are attempting to do now is to repair the damage we have done by applying a wrong principle. I am opposed to compulsory unionism or to any principle which applies compulsion indirectly. If preference is given, automatically people are compelled to become members of unions. We might as well write into the arbitration law provision making it compulsory for a person to join a union or some other organization in order to obtain benefits. At the present time, a person must be a member of a union in order to obtain employment. Once such compulsion is introduced, we immediately make a rod for every one's back. The need for this amendment is an indication of the evil and the wrong that are done. I cannot conceive that any of the honourable members who have supported the amendment would object to a conscientious objector voluntarily joining a union, an employers' organization, or any association formed for the purpose of providing benefits for some one. I support the amendment, because, unfortunately, we in Australia have got ourselves into a shocking situation. We believe that we are giving the people more freedom, whereas we are steadily taking freedom from them. By the moving of the amendment, we are being encouraged to believe that there is still a little freedom left. That is the unfortunate position in which we find ourselves. There is only one proper remedy, and that is the removal of any possible semblance of compulsion. ter for Labour and National Service and Minister for Immigration) [3.50] I wish to mention only two points at this stage.

65,Mr Hahold Holt (Higgins,"Minis«hare the view of my friend, the honourable member for Moore( Mr Leslie), in relation to the award of preference. That is not necessarily a bad thing, nor is it -based on an unsound principle. In the operation of the industrial system, there >uould be disclosed many instances in which, for the protection of good employers and good employees, the proposed -Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, or, in the past, the existsatisfied that other provisions of the ing Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, or perhaps a conciliation commissioner, may well have made an -award of preference in relation to a particular industry. -to abolish preference to ex-servicemen and snaintain preference to unionists. how that matter comes into this discussion. I am familiar with instances, in -other legislation of this Parliament, in which preference to unionists has applied, in conjunction with preference to ex-servicemen. But let us not be mistaken .about the award of preference. I believe it is a useful and valuable instrument in the hands of an arbitral authority when dealing with a particular association. The clothing trades are frequently mentioned as a case in point. They are in an industry in which it is by no means easy for the employer or, for that matter, the -employee, to ensure that award provisions are observed, and it has been found useful to provide that preference shall be given to those employees who are members of the union and who will be bound by an award. The second comment I wish to make arises partly from something I said at the outset about the situation of the employer, and partly from the question raised by the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory ( Mr J. R. Fraser), who, if I may say so, made a very thoughtf u l and useful contribution to the discusthe tart shop. In this instance, they have sion. I understand that, although we are not making legislative provision specifically for the employer, he will not be without remedy in this situation. He will not be bound to give preference unless he is bound by an award. Therefore, he would be able to approach' the commission seeking exemption from the operation of the preference provision if he were able to persuade the commission that there were reasons why he should not be bound by it. This would afford the commission the opportunity to question the applicant for exemption and to ascertain his views in relation to other aspects of the award. It might well happen that, if the commission were convinced of the sincerity of the beliefs held by the applicant, and were award would be observed, it would exempt him from the preference provision. At any rate, I am so advised, and I put the matter to the committee on the basis that protection is available to the employer. I entirely endorse what the Leader of the Opposition (Dr, Evatt) has said about the evident sincerity of those who have put their views on this matter to the Government. I consider that they can take considerable satisfaction from their very real accomplishment of persuading all sections of the National Parliament to give statutory recognition to the rights of conscience in this matter. delay the committee for only a very short time to comment upon this provision. It seems to me that there is agreement between the Government and the Opposition on the need to allow conscientious objectors to avoid the compulsion of having to join an industrial organization. I think it is very good to exempt them. Any community should, and must, be able to provide, in circumstances such as this, facility for people who object conscientiously to joining an organization to avoid joining it. But on this matter I take issue with the honourable member for Hume( Mr Anderson) and the honourable member for Moore( Mr Leslie). When these two honourable members are required to give assent to a Government measure, they are very often in the position of the boy dragged squealing from endeavoured to. raise this matter to the level' of a question of principle. The honourable member for Moore said, I think, that it was wrong for members of affiliated unions to be required to contribute to the funds of the Australian Labour party, as they do when they pay their ordinary union membership, fees.",24,Conciliation And Arbitration Bill 1956

68,Mr Cairns (Yarra) [3.54],"I shallThat may be wrong in the minds of the honourable member for Hume and the honourable member for Moore, but I would remind them that a great many people in this community are compelled to pay income tax, and so to contribute towards activities with which they do not agree. There are many people who are pacifists, and who, in time of war, are conscientious objectors, who are compelled to pay income tax, a substantial part of which is spent on war or defence. What is the view of the honourable member for Moore and the honourable member for Hume? Do they say that it is wrong for members of trade unions to be compelled to contribute to Australian Labour party funds if they conscientiously object to doing so? If so, do they agree that the many people-and there may be a great many in the community-wh o conscientiously object to the spending of millions of pounds on war or defence measures, should have the right to refuse to pay income tax? Are these honourable members prepared to be consistent when they raise this matter to a fine level of principle? I should like to say something else to the members of the Australian Country party who have spoken upon this measure. They have talked of freedom as though the only matter involved is the restriction of freedom. That is one way-and an important way-of considering freedom. It is important to ensure that reasonable conduct in society is not unreasonably restricted, but I remind honourable members that there is a good deal more to freedom than the absence of restriction upon actions. There is a positive factor in freedom, which is an ability to be able to do things, and that is a kind of freedom that is enjoyed by members of trade unions, and members of the working class generally, as a result of the work of unions. There is the freedom to live at a decent standard, and the freedom to work under decent conditions. Freedom to engage in these positive actions is enjoyed by the people who are members of or who support trade unions. It is a completely one-sided and facetious use of the argument of principle to criticize this measure by a suggestion that freedom is merely the absence of restriction. That is a very limited concept of freedom. One must take into account also the very positive way in which freedom is -enlarged by the creation of opportunities for people to live at a decent standard and to enjoy the freedom of action which is so essentially a part of freedom in its wider sense. I remind the members of the Australian Country party that they are not on completely sound grounds, philosophically or even politically, when they use the arguments that they have used in this debate. Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) has given the impression that I oppose trade unionism. That is not true. In uot one single speech that I have delivered in. this chamber have I opposed trade unionism. I have often drawn attention to bad practices in trade unions, such as intimidation, and I suggest that where there is compulsion there will also be intimidation. I ask honourable members to consider the position in the TJnited Kingdom, which is the home of trade unionism. They would no more bring in compulsory unionism there than they would fly to the moon. Yet honourable members opposite talk of trade unions in Australia as being the only instruments in the country that have improved the lot of the worker. I have never heard such addlepated reasoning as that which was shown by the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Cairns) a few minutes ago. He talked tibout compulsory unionism, and then he talked about political coercion by means of making a member of the Liberal party or the Australian Country party supply funds for activities of the Labour party with which they did not agree. Where is there any freedom in that? The honourable member does not understand the first principles of freedom. Tf one adopted his reasoning, one might be able to argue that Hitler and Stalin werefirst-classfreedom-loving persons. I support this amendment. I support trade unionism very strongly, but I support free trade unionism. I suggest that if we continue to introduce compulsion into trade unionism we shall destroy it, in the way that the Australian Workers Union is now being destroyed.",25,Conciliation And Arbitration Bill 1956

Clause 10 makes provision for the establishment of the Commonwealth Industrial Court. This is the authority that w ill exercise the judicial poAver previously vested dn the CommonAvealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, and which was taken from that court by a decision of the H i gh Court. Our principal objection to this clause is the provision of power to impose penalties. I know that it has been stated, and probably Avill be stated again, that Avhen the Conciliation and Arbitration Act was amended in 1947, making the Arbitration Court a court of superior record, that court Avas automatically given the power to deal Avith persons for contempt of court, and also to make orders and grant injunctions. Certainly, when it was made a court of superior record the particular functions that might be exercised by the court Avere not stressed in the legislation of the time. To all intents and purposes, it apparently was realized by the existing government that the power given in 1947, in itself, was not sufficient because in 1951 the present GoA'ernment introduced the paragraphs Avhich are contained in proposed section 37 (1.). Those provisions empowered the court to take certain action and the powers that are contained in proposed section 37 (1.) to which the Opposition objects are theseThe Court is empowered(a) to order compliance with an award proved to the satisfaction of the Court to have been broken or not observed; (b) to enjoin an organization or person from committing or continuing a contravention of this Act or a breach or non-observance of an award; (c) to make such orders as the Court thinks just as to the costs and expenses (including the expenses of witnesses) of proceedings before the Court.

70,Mr Clarey (Bendigo) [4.2],"Th etime, apparently believed that unless tbese provisions were inserted, tbe particular powers of a court of superior record would not be put into operation. Eor that reason, the Opposition strongly objects to all the penalties that are provided by this legislation. I want to make clear the position of the Opposition in respect of this matter. We object to the double-barrelled nature of the penalties which could be imposed upon the trade union movement under this legislation. There are two sections concerned in this matter. The first is section 59 of the existing Conciliation and Arbitration Act, which deals with the enforcement of orders and awards and applies both to employers and employees. Under that section, just as an employer can be prosecuted for a breach of an award, so can the trade unions. Indeed, prior to the legislation of 1951, on more than one occasion trade unions which had indulged in stop-work meetings, strikes, -Order! The honourable member's time and other forms of industrial unrest had has expired. been prosecuted under this section and fined. That section still remains in the member has risen, I shall take my second act. ""We have not sought the elimination period now. When the officials of the of that section.

Our objection comes from the seamen's strike of 1918, the president of fact that, in addition to the -penalties the Seamen's Union, the late Tom Walsh, provided by that section, this proposed was imprisoned for three months.

My time is very limited, and all I want, to say at this stage is this: The Government may believe that it w ill reduce industrial unrest or make relations in industry better by means of legislation of this sort, but it w ill find that its legislation w ill be null and void. Looking back over a long period of time, one has never seen any industrial dispute, any stoppage of work, any hold-up of industry in the Commonwealth ever prevented or settled as a consequence of fines of this description. I can go back in my memory to the strikes which took place in the coal mining industry in 1909 and 1910, when the officials of the union were placed in gaol and the union was fined. The TEMPORARY CHAIEMAN.

75,Mr Clarey,"As no other honourable-I suppose that the timberworkers' strike ing that .this Governmentalone is was a good illustration of that fact. The strike continued for six months and the penalties imposed had absolutely no effect on that dispute. Eventually, the employers' organization and the employees' organization had to get together ""and, as a consequence, they found a settlement. All -that I am pointing out is the futility and firmly ask ourselves, "" Are we satisof this type of legislation in trying to bring about the settlement. of disputes or'better industrial relationships. I suppose that we are all of a similar build and that the more we are threatened the more we are inclined to dig our toes in and tell the other fellow to do his worse. When men are stubborn as individuals they will be found to be even more stubborn when they operate in the mass. SoI suggest to the Minister that the inclusion of this provision' in the bill will not help better relationships in industry. In introducing this bill, the; Government is wielding a big stick, but its action will achieve nothing satisfactory in industrial relationships, or in the interests of conciliation and arbitration, or in the promotion of better feeling between employer and employee, and between management and men. The Government would be wise to drop this portion of the legislation altogether. port the remarks of the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Clarey) in relation to the amendment which if accepted, I take it, would remove Part IV . of the principal act, but would not substitute in its place the provisions of the present bill under which there will be a Commonwealth Industrial Court witb power to impose penalties-particularl y contempt of court penalties. It seems to me that the Government has chosen to rely increasingly upon authority imposed through tlie arbitration system. It seems also tliat it is willing to retain what admittedly is a continuation of one of the essential features of arbitration in Australia-compulsor y arbitration. As the committee has been reminded on many occasions during the debate, Australia is perhaps the only country in the world in which such stress has been laid upon compulsion in the development of MM arbitration system. 1 am not'-su^fest1 responsible. As the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Harold Holt) has pointed out from time to time, there has been a trend in this direction; but the Government has accentuated that trend in recent legislation. I suggest that this is the time when we should clearly fied that by continuing to accentuate the existing degree of compulsion, authority, or penal power ih our arbitration system, we are doing the right thing? "" The honourable member for Bendigo quite rightly, has pointed out that there is an alternative, and that alternative is the course for which the Australian Labour party and the Australian Labour movement stands. During the last few weeks, I have taken the trouble to speak to, not only officials of the trade unions, but also rank and file members, and 1 can assure the Minister' that there is a i almost universal, strong feeling against any increase of compulsion in the arbitration system. I have discovered that rank and file members, if not some of the leaders, of the trade union movement are ready to play a far more responsible and positive part in the conduct of industrial affairs. I suggest that such action is necessary in order to achieve an efficient and effective industrial system. I suggest, too, that the centralization of authority in the hands of the Commonwealth Industrial Court and in other industrial tribunals, as a result of which rules of-, thumb are imposed upon the labour force, is a retrograde step. Many of the powers invested in the various tribunals are not much more, than rules of thumb. It would be wrong to call them principles or to invoke public interest in their defence. I believe that, if we took the initiative in making a different approach, and attempted to increase the significance of agreements and conciliation, we would, get a vastly better result. If that is not to be the approach of the Government, if clan justify its action by saying, first, 'that it is only doing what has been done for 50 years!"" ' That is generally a sufficient 'defence' for a Conservative tory government. ""-Although, unfortunately, -the -Miniltci--""-scnini'rl -' to",28,Conciliation And Arbitration Bill 1956
76,Mr Cairns (Yarra) [4.15],"I supresort to that defence frequently last night, I should have imagined that he would be one of the last to avail himself of it. If that is not the reason why the Governmeut is introducing such legislation, one can easily see other reasons why it is doing so. In times of full employment when labour is short and when a trade boom has reached its highest point, as it did in 1928 and 1929 and at other stages of Australia's history, authority is more firmly exercised by governments against the trade union movement. At such times, because of a scarcity of labour, Labour does not discipline the workers in a manner that is satisfactory to employers and to governments, which are charged with the responsibility of maintaining law and order. In the absence of this discipline, invariably governments and authorities have turned to greater penal powers and repressive measures in the industrial field. Provision was made in 1928 and 1929 for dealing with such a situation, and it resulted in men being fined heavily-me n who, within a short space of time, were able to remove from ofiice, at an open election, the then Prime Minister of Australia. Their action on that occasion exemplified the fact that the people generally were not in favour of this kind of compulsion. The Prime Minister of the day, who now sits in the House of Lords, was removed from the political arena for all time. I suggest that the Government is puthearts, know that the provisions would ting itself on the side of those who believe have no effect of any consequence at all. in compulsion, just as did other governments, in times of economic crisis, with the intention, whether they recognize it or not, of imposing authority upon the Labour movement in order to advance the interests of employers and businessmen. with that.

The Opposition advocates, in effect, the wiping out of the Commonwealth Industrial Court as a whole or, in other words, the wiping out of all judicial powers under the arbitration system, including the enforcement powers. I take it that what the Opposition really has in mind in submitting its amendment, is merely the elimination of the enforcement powers, but the effect of the amendment would be to wipe out the Industrial Court altogether. I hope I shall not need to go into very much detail in dealing with the suggested elimination of the exercise of judicial power from the industrial conciliation and arbitration system. Quite obviously, the system would be disadvantaged if no judicial power could be exercised. I have already explained how we have proceeded in this measure. We are constituting one tribunal to exercise judicial power and another tribunal to exercise arbitral power. I shall move on to what I consider to be the real burden of attack by honourable gentlemen opposite in the manner in which they present the story to the committee. They accept the need for some enforcement provisions in the system, but enforcement provisions of such an inadequate order, that they, in their adequate. trial arbitration--as they all do-and",29,Conciliation And Arbitration Bill 1956

The fact of the matter is that in Victoria, the most stringent provisions apply in relation to strikes which are believed to create an emergency situation, unless my recollection is completely astray, and I do not think it is. sions are not contained in the normal provisions were never enforced.

Each parliament of I do not agree the Commonwealth has taken action to guard the community against irresponsible, damaging, and wanton acts of industrial lawlessness. The provisions may be found in one act in one State and in another act in another State, but the result is that each parliament has set out to protect the community, and here the public interest comes into the picture very prominently indeed. As members of the Parliament we all have supported the principle of compulsory arbitration, and if we accept that principle I suggest that it follows necessarily that the orders of a system of compulsory arbitration must be capable of enforcement. The manner of enforcement and the adequacy of the powers may be open to argument, but surely the principle cannot be open I shall not to argument. If honourable gentlemen opposite wish to argue that in certain instances the heavy howitzer has been used where the 18-pounder might have I can assure the Minisdone the job, that is a matter ou which one might hear them and perhaps agree in an instance or two. The members of the judiciary who have administered these provisions are only human beings, and particularly where they themselves It has never applied. have been caught up in the arbitration process there is a danger, I concede, that the emotional atmosphere which develops might affect the judgment applied to the matter of penalty. I thought that we had taken out a great deal of the objection in relation to that possibility, or at least a great deal of the risk which might develop in that regard under the revised system, whereby the sanctions are administered by the court and the arbitral decisions and considerations are retained I am sure in another part of the system. Whatever objections honourable gentlemen opposite may have to a system of enforcement, I am quite certain that if they were prepared to declare their minds and hearts openly they would agree that there is less cause for objection now than existed previously.

93,Mr Clarey,"The point is that theat all with that statement. Taking a <juite realistic view, I believe that the existence of enforcement powers has in many instances either brought about a settlement or reduced the severity and ambit of a particular industrial dispute. I think that that is a not undesirable result. I accept the proposition that a heavy responsibility of judgment is thrust the view of fair-minded persons outside upon the judges of the industrial court when such weighty weapons as the power of injunction and the contempt power are in their custody. As I said a few years ago, when discussing one of the amending bills then before the Parliament, I view these powers as reserve powers, not to be exercised lightly by the tribunal, but powers which we can expect members of the tribunal, with their judgment and good sense, to apply only when the occasion requires it of them. The honourable member for Yarra( Mr embarked upon a novel discussion. This Cairns) has claimed that these powers seem to be exercised freely only during periods when the bargaining power of the employee has been greatly strengthened by a situation of prosperity or of shortage of labour. That may well be the case, but it does not necessarily follow that the state of mind of the person applying the penalty has been equipped or conditioned to meet that situation. I think that one is rather the consequence of the other, that the employee and the union which is representative of the employees, finding themselves in a position of strong bargaining power, believe that they can, with impunity, reject the awards of tribunals and embark on a course of direct action. At the outset they have accepted the process of arbitration, but when a decision is perhaps not all that they would have wished or demanded they reject the process of arbitration and embark on direct action in order to enforce demands which an impartial hearing and determination have not conceded to them. That is not an unfair statement of what has happened time and time again in such circumstances. Are we to be told by honourable gentlemen opposite that in a situation where unions have sought awards of tribunals, have had a fair hearing and impartial, decision, and are then determined for their own purposes to reject' that decision, there should be no reasonable safeguard and protection, in the hands of those who represent the public interest in these matters? That may be the view of honourable gentlemen opposite, but I doubt if it is a view which they hold very firmly. It is a view which they may be presenting here. Whether or not it is their view, I am convinced that it is not the Parliament who believe that not only is the public interest to be safeguarded but also that public order is to be maintained. Public order will become impossible if powerful tmions are able to indulge, unchecked, in industrial lawlessness, without regard for the public interest, the convenience of their fellowcitizens or the protection of the economy. JSTO one could argue seriously that the powers proposed to meet that kind of situation are excessive. I shall not labour the point further. We have no! matter has already been thrashed out on several occasions, but, in view of what had been said by honourable gentlemen opposite, I thought it desirable to make our position known. While I am on my feet, I want to refei the committee to three amendments to this clause that I shall move later. I do not think that any of them is controversial. Proposed section 29 begins as follows:During the absence on leave of tlie Chief Judge, or during a vacancy in the office of Chief Judge, the next senior Judge not absent on leave shall act as Chief Judge. . . We propose that the words ""not absent on leave "" be omitted, and that the words "" who is not absent on leave and is willing to act"" be inserted in place thereof. That amendment is designed to meet the kind of situation which has occurred in the past. The next senior judge, perhaps because he is already engaged in a case, may not be willing to act, as the Chief Judge, in another case in which he is invited to act. I do not think that proposal will present any problems to honourable members opposite. Proposed section 37 defines the powers of the court. We propose that paragraph:",31,Conciliation And Arbitration Bill 1956
94,Mr Harold Holt,"I do not agree^e) be omitted. That paragraph states ithat the court is empoweredrto make such orders as the Court thinks just ias to the costs and expenses (including the ""expenses of witnesses) of proceedings before ithe Court. We shall pick that up in the next amend<ment. Proposed section 44 statesThe Court may award costs in all matters -before it , including matters dismissed for want -of jurisdiction. We suggest that that provision be omitted nnd that the following be inserted in its place:The Court may make such orders as it -.thinks just as to the costs and expenses (including the expenses of witnesses) of proceedings before the Court, including proceedings dismissed for want of jurisdiction. I have mentioned those amendments at this stage so that, when we come to them, it will not be necessary for me to make .further comments on them. Agreed toThat, in proposed section 29, the words -"" not absent on leave "" be omitted with a view to inserting the following words i u place -thereof:-""wh o is not absent on leave and is willing to act"". That, in proposed section 37, paragraph (e) -he omitted, proposedThat proposed section 44 be omitted with a vie^ to inserting tbe following section in >place thereof:"" ' 44. The Court may make such orders as it 'thinks just as to the costs and expenses (including thc expenses of witnesses) of proceedings before the Court, including proceedings dismissed for want of jurisdiction."". -Opposition opposes this amendment. We -agree that proposed section 44 should be -deleted, because we feel that in any matter involving conciliation and arbitration, -even if the proceedings take place before a tribunal described as an industrial court, it is not desirable to award costs.

I do not propose to discuss this matter at length. We are opposed to orders for costs in cases involving conciliation and arbitration. We shall vote against the amendment, because we think it undesirable that the provision proposed by the Minister should be inserted in the bill. Question putbe agreed to. The committee divided.

If the legislation which this Government is forcing through the Parliament is to be taken as a guide, the present administration could well be declared the most anti-union government ever to occupy the treasury bench. This Government, which speaks so glibly about the spirit of conciliation, is not prepared to put away the bludgeon that it needs in order to force the trade unions to obey its dictates and accept without question the terms and conditions of employment set down by the various tribunals. The Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr my opinion, the workers of this Harold Holt) implies that because the Labour party supports the principle of arbitration, the workers must necessarily accept as satisfactory the decision of every arbitration tribunal. Such an acceptance would mean that the award wage would be not merely a minimum wage but a miximum wage, and we have never accepted that. I agree with the Minister that there must be some provision for dealing with breaches of an award, but there is a great difference between an individual failing to carry out the conditions of his employment under the terms of an award, and a workers' organization refusing to accept an award that it regards as unjust. This provision is intended to deal with such a situation. It is very interesting to hear the Minister speak about what has been done in the States of the Commonwealth, but our approach must be to decide whether this is a fair and reasonable decision for this Parliament to make. In mv opinion, it is class legislation. However it is examined, it is seen as legislation designed to operate against one section of industry only. That has been Labour's experience of the application of such savage penalties. It is perfectly true that the Minister may be able to point to an isolated instance in which a penalty has been inflicted upon an employer, but there can be no doubt that these penal provisions have been inserted Evatt, Dr. H . V . for the purpose of forcing the trade unions to accept conditions of employFraser. Allan ment that they regard as unjust. They Russell, E. H . D . are designed to take away from the Calwell, A. A. worker the right to strike. The honourable member for Hume( Mr Anderson) was, not so long ago, concerned about the liberty of the individual to determine whether he ought to belong to a. union. I suggest that tbe person with only his labour to sell should be equally at liberty to decide whether he will sell it under the conditions laid down by the employer, or the arbitration tribunal. Surely that, too, involves the liberty of the subject. It is not enough to say that because some arbitration tribunal has rejected a particular claim by a trade union that is necessarily a just decision and that the workers ought to accept it without protest. In country would be foolish if they ever gave away the right to strike. I know that there are in this community many foolish people wbo believe that every strike is lost. No intelligent member of the Labour party would deny that the strike weapon should be used oniy as a last resort. The workers realize that if they go on strike they will inflict great suffering upon their dependants, but they also realize that periodically the workers must make a stand if they are to preserve their living and industrial standards. Many people who examine the value of strikes miss that point. If those who preside over arbitration tribunals were perfectly satisfied that the workers would accept any decision without protest a much lower standard of living would obtain in this country. So long as they know that there is a limit beyond whicb the worker cannot be driven without resisting or striking, they will hesitate before going past that limit. I believe that that consideration has an important effect upon the decisions of the arbitration tribunals. We must examine how power such as this has been used in the past, and then consider how it will be used in the future. The Minister referred in his second-reading speech to the fact that only in recent years had such powers been used with",33,Conciliation And Arbitration Bill 1956
99,Mr Ward (East Sydney) [4.49],"any frequency against a section of the Australian workers. On the other hand, he admitted that in recent years there had been a period of comparative industrial peace. What does that imply? If the Government intends to inflict these savage penalties in a period of comparative industrial peace, what are we to expect during a period marked by what the Government would describe as "" l a w lessness "" among the industrial sections of the community. It is proposed to use this machinery. Why otherwise would the Government establish this tribunal to deal specifically with the infliction of these savage penalties? Let us look at how used the powers placed in its hands, because that is important. Do honourable members regard it as just that men should be ordered to work under conditions which they regard as unjust, and, if they refuse to do so, that action should be taken along the lines mentioned by the honourable member for Hume? The court can decide, and this Government would support its attitude, that men must be forced to work. Why should the workers of Australia be the only people against whom these penal powers are to be used ? Take the decision of the court in reference to a strike at Mort's Dock in New South Wales when one section of the workers decided to pass round the hat in order to collect a voluntary levy-voluntary , I repeat, and not compulsorily imposed by the trade union concerned-to help support thc. dependants of the men who were out on strike-wome n and children ! The trade union concerned had nothing whatever to do with the collection of the levy, although I personally would not have been opposed to the union's imposing a. levy, because I think that it is a reasonable proposition that when any section of trade unionists is fighting for some trade union principle, every trade union ought to respond, come to its support, and help it to succeed in its struggle. On the occasion to which I have been referring the union took no action to impose a levy, but the court decided that the union was not doing sufficient to prevent its individual members from contributing voluntarily to the support of the women and children dependants of the striking workers. In my opinion workers w ill never be prevented from adopting the age-old practice of passing the hat round on the job and collecting a few shillings from each man's wages at the end of the week to support the women and children of other trade unionists who are on strike.. That can never be prevented because that is one of the principles of trade unionism which are recognized by the community. The provision in this legislation for the imposition of savage penalties w ill not prevent strikes designed to improve the conditions of workers. Let me repeat something that I said in reference to another proposed sub-section of the legisthe court has, in the past, lation. 1 referred to the remarks of Mr. JusticeK i r by when a savage penalty was imposed on the Boilermakers Society because some of its members had collected a voluntary levy The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Lucock) -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. for the A r m y ) [ 4 . 5 8 ] I have a few words to say about this matter, because I think that in the attitude of the Labour party to this proposed amendment we have an indication of the true intentions of the party, which differ from the intentions of the Labour party in days gone by. I remind the committee that the amendment is vital to the whole bill. The design of the Opposition is to reverse the Government's intention to establish an industrial court. The effects of suncess by the Opposition would be far-reaching. Its success would completely destroy the whole idea of arbitration as expressed in the bill. The purpose of the Opposition amendment is to obliterate completely the provision for the establishment of the Commonwealth Industrial Court. That clearly indicates, as has been indicated by many of the speeches made at the second-reading stage, that the Opposition is placing most emphasis on the penalty provisions contained in this proposed sub-section. That shows that the Labour party has completely deserted its old support for arbitration. It is no longer relying on arbitration, as I shall prove in a few moments. The Labour party is not now concerned with what it once called wage justice.",34,Fairs
100,Mr Cramer (Bennelong,"Ministe rI t is now concerned only with complete control of industry by the use of the big : stick or, in other words, the strike-weapon mentioned by the honourable -member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) a moment ago. In effect, honourable members opposite propose to deliver the whole of the workers ' of Australia into the: hands of trade union bosses. That is what their proposed amendment means. We realize, of course, that the greatest pressure which conditions the attitude of the Labour party in relation to this matter comes from left-wing unions and we ' know, therefore, just what we would be in for in the future if the Labour party had its way. ' Warnings have been given by honourable members opposite in relation to the implementation of this measure. I , too, want to give a warning to the workers of Australia to be careful of where the Labour party is leading them, dominated as it is by the left-wing trade unions of this country. I warn the workers that they have to be careful of that, because all the benefits that have accrued to the workers of Australia have come"" to them as a result of the effective working of arbitration. I say emphatically that arbitration is the bulwark that shelters the workers from the tyranny of trade union bosses. Nobody can justly deny the truth of that statement. The standard of living of the.whole of the people depends on the increase of production. Everybody agrees with that. Our standard of living can be measured only in terms of increased production, and increased production depends, of course, in turn on the efficiency and capacity of both management and men We know that conflicts arise between management and men from time to time. It is not often said, but it is a fact nevertheless, that really very little trouble arises between employers and employees in Australia. In the majority of cases the employers treat . their employees quite well, and the men have no .complaints. It is only in respect of a few powerful and militant trade unions that any great trouble arises in industrial affairs We have been going through a time 6f great prosperity in recent years, and t l if a c t has led to a certain change of 1 approachto our arbitration system om the part of certain trade unions. In times of economic recession or depression in a country, trade unions regard it as a great thing to be able to' rely' on the justice meted-out-byindustrial courts;: but when things are good for the employees, when there is a surplus of jobs,, trade unions are inclined to say, "" Wedo not want arbitration"". I refuse to believe that the average decent worker,, 1 the average decent citizen of Australia,, is prepared to take the benefits of arbitration when it suits him and to deny the need to abide by the decisions of'arbitration when it does not suit him to do' 30. simply because he is in a position to drive a harder bargain owing to the employment' position. ' That is not the spirit of the people of Australia, although it is the spirit of the Labour party at preseut, because if is dominated by left-wing trade unions. In those circumstances, how can we get peace in industry, which is, of course-; a most"" important requisite for the development of Australia? I say quite frankly that the terms of this bill are reasonable in every respect, and mean justice for the workers as well as the employers. I dp not think that anybody can reasonably ask for more than that. It has been said-and the Oppositions proposed amendment proves it-and it will be said again because there is another amendment to come before ' us later which also deals with this most important matter, that the unions do not want the enforcement provisions in this bill. The honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Clarey) and the honourable memer for Blaxland( Mr E. James Harrison) are reasonable men, and will admit that arbitration cannot be effected without enforcement provisions. Without such provisions the arbitration system, as such, would be completely destroyed. I cannot understand how the supporters of trade unionism can', ih one set df circumstances, claim entitlement to the protection of the arbitration law, andin another set"" of circumstances' resist the implementation of the'powers' of the law. The""law must operate as a whole. If : trade unionists'wish to'derive benefits from the arbitration system they' must abide-by the rules laid 'down 'for-that system. If r we delete from the bill the provisions for the imposition of penalties in .order to enforce the arbitration law, we shall simply destroy the structure of arbitration. T want to take time to'refer to some -of the inflammatory statements that were made by one of the leaders of the Opposition when I sat at this table the other night. That occasion is what has in fluenced me to speak now. The honourable inember for ' Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde -Cameron) made an attack upon the judges and upon the courts. He made an inflammatory speech which indicated that if the occasion arose he would lead revolution in this country from the point of view of industrial chaos. That is quite true; there is no doubt about it . To prove my words, I shall quote some of his statements quite extensively because I want to put them on record and remind -all honourable members of just what was said. .Tn his criticism of judges, he said, . In the glorious isolation of the magnificent -courtroom, ancl in the glorious serenity of the atmosphere of the court, he proceeds to pontificate on what is good or bad for the people who have only their labour to sell. Did you ever hear of such a statement in your l if e ! The same statement was made by the honourable member for East Sydney -a, moment ago. When he was referring to this matter and the system, the honourable member for Hindmarsh saidI t is a system under which the court has imposed savage penalties . . . He referred to them as savage penalties, and then continued-on unions under contempt of court provisions in the present Arbitration Act. Again, the honourable member for Hind marsh saidWhen the court has the sole power to determine these things Who else would Are referred to a np one else has tlie right to upset its decisions because the judges That, of course, was an attack upon the judges. He went on to sayThey need not care two hoots about public opinion. We believe that that is entirely wrong. But .what, about this for intimidation! He saidI invite the Minister to pay careful attention now to what I am saying because I have been authorized by the secretary of the Australian Workers Union this afternoon to state to the House that immediately this bill is passed, tlie Australian Workers Union will take out a writ in the High Court of Australia challenging the validity of the section. He said further. . . the right to strike is the one thing that differentiates the free man from the slave. Opposition members interjecting, endorse that statement. Surely arbitration has preserved the freedom of the workers of Australia, just as all other forms of law have. But the honourable member for Hindmarsh made this statementArbitration is dead in Australia Yet Labour stands for arbitration. The honourable member also used these words. . . the right to ask the court to force a union to allow some scah to join its membership. He made further inflammatory statements of that kind and incited the workers to revolution. He saidI f this Government wants to bring about industrial chaos and industrial revolution, J suggest that it should continue to act as it if acting now. The TEMPORARYCHAIRMA N (Mi-. Freeth) -Order!

This Government proposes, with its penal clauses, to shake a big stick at the trade union movethe goodwill of the trade union movement. law a.nd order. I shall convince him, by using his own words, that it is otherunions left wing or right wing, against wise. I want him to listen to this. He has said that when things are bad, it is good for the workers to depend upon the protection of the court. I should like to remind the Minister that in 1929 things were not too good in the mining industry and the mining companies locked out the miners. So much for the protection of the court! After a lot of agitation by Labour members at the time, they persuaded the then Prime Minister, Mr the other in the same bill is to makr* Bruce, to institute proceedings against Mr John Brown for locking out the miners-a n infringement of the arbitration law at that time. Naturally we thought the court would protect the workers when things were bad, and they were bad then. But then Mr Bruce made the amazing declaration that, in the interests of industrial peace, he had decided to withdraw the prosecution against Mr John Brown. So much for the protection of the court and for the prototypes of the Minister for the Army, who were in control of the destiny of the country at that time. It is balderdash for the Minister to say that when times are bad the workers can rely on the protection of the court. The Minister said also that tbe Labour party was dominated by the left wing unions, and that that was why we were opposed to this legislation. But at the last four or five conferences of the trade union movement, motions were carried protesting against these measures. The most moderate of unions protested most vigorously and vehemently against the provision which the Minister for the Army lauds so vociferously this afternoon. The Minister said in one breath that we must have an increase in production as a means of solving our economic problems, and in the next breath he proceeded to advocate savage repression for those whose co-operation is necesfrom settling a dispute, produces the sary to get increased production if they do not like some particular arbitration law or phase of it. The Minister cannot have it both ways. Increased production can be obtained only by getting: ment. This legislation will have the reverse effect. Instead of getting the goodwill of the trade union movement, it will' produce the unedifying revulsion of the whole trade union movement, be the this legislation. Honourable members opposite certainly speak with their tongues in their cheeksThey have dilated at length throughout, the discussion on this bill upon its conciliation features. But they also talk about the punitive provisions in the bill. To talk about conciliation measures on the one hand and punitive measures on an utter mockery of the system of arbitration as we should know it in this chamber. The Minister tried to convince honourable members-and he certainly was not very successful-that arbitration court awards must contain enforcement penalties. The honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Clarey) has repeatedly pointed out during the debate on this measure that what we object to is the dual penalties contained in' this bill. I always think that dual penalties cut across the very essence of British justice. Yet this Government, which is supposed to uphold British justice, says that there will be two sets of penalties for anybody who is not prepared to abide by arbitration awards. History has shown that when penalties are imposed, they are imposed on one section only, and that is the working class. Surely this Government is conscious of the lessons of history. The lessons of history in the economic and industrial spheres have proved conclusively that when repression is exercised on the working class, the employers do not achieve victory. The reverse happens. There is a perpetuation of bitterness between sections of the community. The workers become determined that they will never relent or give up in any circumstances in an industrial dispute. Repression, far opposite result. A dispute is accentuated and prolonged. Mention has already been made this afternoon that it has never been",37,Fairs

104,Mr Bird,"The Minister says it isproved that the imposition of a penalty economic maladministration. If it wishes on a trade union leader has meant the. to promote an era of industrial peace, the termination of a dispute. Section2 of the principal act sets out its objects, one of which is to promote goodwill in industry. It almost makes me laugh to read that. Surely no Government supporter, not even the honourable member for Mallee( MrT u r n b u l l ) , who, at all times, is ready to make the most extraordinary pronouncements, would suggest that this clause w ill promote goodwill in industry. There is not the slightest suggestion of goodwill in the imposition of the penalties for which it provides. I am sure the honourable member for Mallee w ill agree w it h me on this occasion. During the last few years, the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration has sunk lower and lower in the estimation of the trade union movement, and, if this bill becomes law, as it will apparently do, because the Government has the necessary numbers to vote it through, the proposed Commonwealth Industrial Court also will certainly sink low in the estimation of the trade union movement. The proposed court w ill be, instead of an institution to give justice to the workers, merely a watchdog workers. It has ostensibly a number of purposes, but its primary purpose w ill be to penalize, by fine or imprisonment, workers who kick over the traces because they are expected to work under unjust conditions. If the Government wants to do the decent thing by the trade union movement, it should consider the fundamentals of this issue. It pays l i p service to the object of doing the right thing by the trade union movement, but it always seems to be sadly lacking in action designed to achieve that object. The clause w ill merely scratch the surface, and w ill ignore the fundamental cause of the present trouble. For the last five or six years, the workers have been disputing decisions of the present court. Why? The Government's maladministration has resulted in economic conditions that have allowed prices to get out of control. The workers wish only to keep up with prices. The continual industrial trouble that we are having to-day is the result of the Government's first thing for it to do is to the Government w ill not follow it . It is hanging grimly to what w ill inevitably be its last term of office. It is living on borrowed time. If it wishes to do the right thing, it should not use the proposed court as an instrument to bring pressure to bear against the workers. That is the whole purpose of this measure, which was introduced recently because the High Court of Australia had upset the decision of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration in the Boilermakers case. The TEMPORARYCHAIRMAN Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Vice-President of the Executive Council ancl Minister for Defence Production) [5.18] -Of course, t h is a contentious r provision, which is likely to arouse the ire of Opposition members. We wonder why, and we look for what is behind their protestations. They are going back to discipline recalcitrant over the whole of the gro»nd that Labour has so carefully cultivated down the years. It has accepted the principle that a law must be capable of enforcement if it is to be effective. Labour knows that, because it has applied sanctions in the past. On this occasion. Labour members seek to sidestep sanctions. It seems to me that, since the adoption of the unity ticket, they have decided to go back over the ground they have cultivated for years, and to oppose sanctions. I propose to prove the truth of that statement. From what I could gather from the speeches that were made by Opposition members at the second-reading stage, Labour desires to go back to the Evatt act of 1947. How natural it is for the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. E v a t t ) now to try to go ba""k to the 1947 act for which he was responsible, and which he said was designed to eliminate delays and streamline arbitration! However, it had the very opposite effect. I well remember that, before that act became operative, from January to September. 1947, 1,041,617 working days were lost.",38,Fairs

107,Sir Eric Harrison (Wentworth,"but from October, 1947, when the act was proclaimed, to. June, 1948, 1,45.8,288 working days were lost, an increase of approximately 40 per cent. That was the effect of an act ostensibly designed to streamline arbitration and to overcome delays! The Labour Government took punitive action uncler the measure that the Leader of the Opposition would now like to have brougbt back into operation. Heaven forbid that that should happen, because the trade unions would bave nothing to do with it, whatever the political wing of the Australian Labour party may say. That is proved very conclusively by the figures relative to working days lost that I have just cited. I shall now deal with sanctions. The New South Wales Labour Government does not turn its back on sanctions in the office. I suppose the 1949 coal strike was State arbitration system. 'The New South Wales Industrial Commission fined the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen's Association of Australasia £700 in March last for taking part iu illegal strikes. That penalty was imposed not by a Libera] government but by an instruCommonwealth Court of Conciliation, ment of a Labour government. Therefore, one wonders what all this clamouring of Opposition members is about if it is not for a purpose other than that which it purports to have. Of the fifteen trade unions that have been fined by the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration between July, 1951, and the present time, thirteen were either Communist-dominated or Communist-influenced. Possibly this is the reason that underlies the clamouring of Opposition members. This fact is rather significant. Opposition members make a plea against sanctions not on behalf of the moderate and decent trade unions, but in support of the Communist-controlled unions. Let us consider the position in more detail. The Blacksmiths Society of Australia was fined £150 on one occasion. The Amalgamated Engineering Union (Australian section) was fined on seven occasion sums of £150, £450, £250, £500 three times and £250, respectively. The sheet metal workers' union was fined on two occasions. £150 and £200, respectively. makers Society of Australia was twice fined £500. 'The Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, on one occasion, was fined £500. We have only to examine those figures to understand what is behind the behaviour of Opposition members on, this occasion. They are not concerned about the decent trade unionists.. With Mr Healy' sitting in the chamber, they are concerned with sponsoring a Communist-controlled policy. In other wordsj they are making the pay-off for the adoption of a unity ticket at the Hobart conference of .the Australian Labour party. They should reconsider their position, because they will certainly ""have something to answer for when the decenttrade unionists outside this Parliament know what has happened. Let us see whether some of the present Labour members supported sanctionswhen the Labour government was in. the most costly strike in recent years.' It was caused by the Labour government's appeasement of. Communist-dominated unions, and that government was required to take, strong action to break itLegislation was introduced to enable the and Arbitration to freeze union fundsDid that amount to the imposition of sanctions? The Labour government imposed sanctions of the highest order, but Labour members, under the direction of communist-controlled leaders, now opposesanctions, and they will have to answer for it. In order to break the 1949 .coal strike, the Labour government, despite Labour's platform, put troops into theopen-cut mines. On the 7th August, l9'49j Senator Ashley, who was Minister for Shipping and Fuel in the Labour government, and the present honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Chambers), who wasMinister for the Army, indicated that the Army might work its own mines. That was a step further. They said that, in. doing this, the Army would be "" performing a great national service. . . helping to build a reserve of coal that will save us from being threatened as we are to-day by miners refusing to work"". This bill provides for nothing so drastic as that. I have mentioned occasions on which The Boilera Labour government took the most stringent action, such as freezing union funds, sending troops to work in the open cuts, and proclaiming the possibility that soldiers would' work mines that would he owned hy the Army. The miners' federation at that time, of course, was Communist-controlled. On the very day that these measures were announced, the federal president of the Australian Workers Union, Mr Nicol, said that he would support any move for members of that union to work open-cuts. The position is rather different to-day when, hecause of the adoption of the unity ticket, Communist-controlled unions can direct the policy of the present Labour Opposition in this Parliament. What happened in 1949? The Labour Government at that time did not' want to use the anti-Communist unions to break a Communistinspired strike. It took action itself, and the speech of the honourable member for it imposed sanctions of a most extreme kind. Let us not have any more of tliis nonsense about the imposition of sanctions by means of this legislation, because the members of the Labour party have in the past imposed much more severe sanctions. At present, they are trying to deny that that is so. They are seeking to maintain a foot in both camps. They are seeking to maintain their position by enlisting the assistance of Communists, and by means of the unity ticket. Under the direction of Communists, with whom they have combined in the unity ticket, they are prepared to ditch their trade union supporters. What will be the result? More and more control will be exercised over trade unions. More and more Jackie Browns will be restored to positions where they can tie up the transport industry in Victoria. More and more of those things are likely to happen, and honourable members opposite want to give greater control to the Communists as a pay-off for thc way that they helped the Labour party in past election campaigns. The liaison has already paid dividends. Jackie Brown has gone back. ticket put him back. The unity ticket is having the same result in a number of trade unions in New South Wales today. On that ticket, more and more Communists will creep back into the trade unions, and honourable members opposite are seeking to protect them by opposing sanctions. They are seeking to give the Communists' a free run, and to ensure that no action can be taken to enforce the judgments of the Arbitration Court in the industrial sphere. I hope the Labour party knows where it is going.. I do not think it does. I do not think that honourable members opposite knew where they were going when they were led along the road to Molotov. I do not think they knew where they were going when they contested the anti-Communist legislation in the courts.' I do not think they knew where they weregoing when the splinter group broke away, and I do not think they know wherethey are going to-day.

Where a man can make application, he should make application himself. There should be no need for him to say to an employer, "" You make application for me"". If a man who is worthy of becoming a trade unionist wishes to be admitted to union membership and become a bona, fide employee, he should make the application. If the employer were to take the necessary steps, the man's employment would be damaged immediately. We think that, in the interests of the employee and of peace in industry, this olause sliould be omitted from the bill. ter for Labour and National Service and Minister for Immigration) [5.46] -In the normal course of events, when a union is only too willin g to admit a man to membership, such a problem almost certainly would not arise. The kind of situation that the bill is designed to meet is one that has occurred from time to time and in which a union has closed its books to additional membership. An employer might wish to engage a particular person, for example, in a coal mine, but he might find that, because the industry is 100 per cent, unionized and because the union has closed its books, he cannot employ that person. Bendigo( Mr Clarey) has suggested that in such a situation the person affected should take up the matter with the union. He would be a. very hardy person who wa3 willing to suffer the inconvenience, unpopularity, and perhaps the expense, of undertaking a David and Goliath fight with the union. Tf the prospective employer were willin g to make the move and to accept responsibility for it , his action would have result in either an order of the court and of his employing the man, or of opening up negotiations with the union so that admission might be granted. I do not claim for one moment that that represents a perfect solution of the problem, but what is the perfect solution in a situation where a union, contrary to the provisions of the law, says that, The it intends to close its books and not admit anybody else? The Government believes that this will be a useful provision. I have heard what has been said about the unpopularity of the employee concerned. He may or may not be unpopular, but the fact that a union denies a man the rights to which he is entitled under the law of the land, and proceeds to victimize him if he avails himself of the legal processes open to him. does not say very much for the state of mind of officials or members of that union. [5.48] -This provision involves a very definite principle. It is all very well for the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr HaroldH o l t ) to say that it could affect a coal-mining employee. His selection of the coal mining industry is a very bad choice, because at the nvjsent time there are many members of t h coal-miners' union who would like to get a job. when men from the north were trying to get jobs in the southern coal mines, the union closed its books. MrE . JAMESHARRISON T h a t was the time to introduce this kind of legislation, if necessary. The Minister said that the union's action in refusing union membership to a particular person would mean that the employer could not employ the man he wanted.

121,Mr Ward,"The courts have not the waterfront industry, what is one of the declared principles underlying the fixing of a' quota ? It is that there shall be an equitable spread of work and, having regard to earnings in the industry, that the men shall receive a decent wage and maintain a decent living standard. Does that principle not apply in respect of any industry? If a union closes its books, it does not do so for any other purpose than to ensure that there shall uot be an over-abundance of labour available in the industry to permit an employer to depress the living standards of the members of the union. We say that an employer has no right to approach a eourt or any otlier body to try to force ii union to admit members. The Australian Labour party desires to see full employment maintained. We wish to ensure that every man shall have the right to earn a livelihood, and to maingestion, not in this debate, but to me on a tain a decent living standard. We do not suggest that persons should be excluded from union membership when work is available. A union would be only too happy to admit additional members if it found it did not have sufficient members to perform all the work that was offering in an industry. There is not one trade union in this country which would not be other than reasonable in this matter. If any union considered there was need for additional labour it would open its books. When a union closes its books it has a good and adequate reason for doing so. The unions must resist the kind of coercion that is contemplated in this amendment. It is evident that the whole trend of this Government's thought and activity is against trade unions. We hear members on the Government side saying, one after another, that they support trade unionism, but in their actions and votes, whenever anything that the unions value is in question, they line up with the rest of the tories in this Parliament to vote against provisions which we regard as vital to the trade union movement.

Coal-miners will naturally resent such a provision, as is embodied in this clause, and particularly the suggestion that they may be shifted from district tb district. The Minister has made that sugprevious occasion. Coal-miners have established their homes on the coal-fields near their work and they are unwilling to have to seek new homes in other districts-that is, if they can find new houses in the present housing shortage. I desire to refer particularly to tbe Bellbird lockout. relevant to this measure. but if this provision can apply to one section of the community it can apply to others. The coal-miners work under the jurisdiction of a tribunal which is governed by this legislation. Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. of the sitting, in dealing with this clause I asserted that in matters concerned with conciliation and arbitration the coalminers would come within the jurisdiction of the tribunals established under this legislation.

125,Mr James,"Before the suspensionEor many years past, even before I was born, conciliation and arbitration t r i bunals have endorsed tbe principle that displaced employees in an industry have the first right to jobs in that industry. The miners' federation bas already closed its membership books, because 560 men have been cavilled out at Bellbird colliery and other men have been cavilled out at other collieries. The proposed provision is most unjust and it could lead lo victimization. The coal-miners have fought against victimization all their lives, and so have men in other industries. It has been said that coal-miners in one district who are unemployed can move to other districts. lead to victimization? locked out. Under present circumstances, if an employer said that he wanted to employ Rowley James at his mine, the men could say that they would not have Rowley James there, and the union could refuse to admit hi m to membership. Wheni t is suggested that unemployed miners can move to other districts, we should remember that many miners hav< invested their life savings in homes near the mines in which they worked. Therefore, as houses are scarce, a move to another district would inflict great hardship upon them. If the Minister were a colliery owner and he said that he wanted me at his mine, I should have to take over the home of the man whom I displaced. expect from the Vice-President of the Executive Council( SirE r i c Harrison), as a Bondi miner. I should have liked to speak during the second-reading debate, but, because the jsras: was applied, I was unable to do so. The Minister has asked how victimization w ill occur. Let me explain. Members of the miners' federation in the northern district, for instance, should have the first right to employment in the industry in that district. The principle that the miners have always followed is that the first man to come should be the last to go. But, under this legislation, the boss would have the r i c ht to select me, for instance, for employment in his mine, rather than somebody who had previously been, employed there for years. The view of the miners is that we should uphold the principle that displaced employees shall be re-absorbed into the industry before newcomers are admitted, but that w ill not be necessary under this legislation. The penalty for infringement of these provisions by a union w ill be in the vicinity of £100. That is a great injustice. I never thought that I should live to see the day when an arbitration and conciliation bill would be introduced into this Parliament that provided for the infliction of such a penalty on the working class. The purpose of the measure that we are considering is conciliation and arbitration. Therefore, I am astonished to find in the bill a provision which w ill not promote conciliation and arbitration. In view of the advice that has been furnished to the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr HaroldH o l t ) , I am at a loss to understand why he .'s seeking to inflict upon an organization j people whom the organization may believe are not necessary for the trade or calling with which it is concerned. that under its compulsory unionism legislation in New South Wales. cerned with what has occurred in the past. I submit that we should apply ourselves now to the task of trying to perfect industrial relationships. If we discover that the effect of a past action has been to produce ill w i ll between employers and employees, it is our duty, a* responsible members of the Parliament, to correct that defect and t r y to establish conditions that w ill be acceptable to all people in industry. The Minister referred to the coal mining industry. I should be ""astonished if any employer in the coal-mining industry had sought to acquire the powers that will be vested in him by this legislation.

If the public good is being given full consideration and if harmony exists between managements and men, surely it is the duty of the Government to dc everything to ensure that those conditions will be maintained. As the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) pointed out in his very pertinent remarks, from the dark aud difficult days of the beginning of the coal mining industry in this country, the miners' federation has asserted its right to protect its members and do everything possible to ensure that men engaged in the industry will be able to earn a reasonable living. The federation has taken the view that it will admit to membership persons whom the managments wish to employ, if those persons conform to certain standards. The employers have accepted that view. Some employers even have left it to unions to seek employees of a type suitable to the unions, and have been happy to accept those persons. ""When there are happy relations between managements and meu, it is not uncommon for managements to suggest certain men as suitable for aJmission to a union and for the union, without demur, to accept those men as members. I cannot conceive of a situation in which the principle that we are discussing now would be extended to the British Medical Association. I cannot believe for a moment that the Government would take the view that if a town council, for instance, insisted that a certain medical practitioner be enrolled as a member of the British Medical Association, that practitioner should, of necessity, be so enrolled. between employer and employee, between management and men, should not be disturbed merely because the Minister, seeing a certain situation that he thinks calls for correction, wants to crack a nut with a sledge-hammer. There is no necessity for the proposals of the Government and the amendment of the honourable member for Bendigo should be accepted.

Tbis afternoon tbe Vice President of the Executive Council( Sir Eric Harrison), in discussing another clause, said that in his view certain things happening in the trade union movement would elevate to office certain people whom he described as Communists. In relation to Victoria, he made special reference to J. J. Brown. There are two reasons why J. J. Brown was re-elected to office in that State. The first was this Government's 1951 legislation and the second was the continued attacks made by the Government upon the arbitration laws of Australia. In the 1949 legislation we provided that if it were claimed by even one member of a union that irregularities had occurred in a union ballot, machinery could be set in motion whereby, if the claim were proved to be justified, the ballot would be upset. I hope that the honourable member for Hume( Mr permanent employment, entitled to Anderson) is present because he will be interested in the history of this matter. The first thing that this Government did when it came to office was to interfere with the election of union officers. It was not satisfied with having interfered with ballots generally. On the very first page of its 1951 legislation it amended the definition of "" office"" as it related to trade unions. Following the judgment of the court in the Miscellaneous Workers case, that had the effect of depriving every union in Australia of the opportunity to determine whether its officers should be permanent, or merely appointed for a certain period. That decision of the court in the Miscellaneous Workers case, and the 1951 legislation, imported into the trade union movement controls that had never been believed possible. As I listened to the wild outburst of the Vice-President of the Executive Council this afternoon, I could imagine that Jim Healy was not crying in the corner, since nobody knows better than Jim Healy that the type of legislation introduced by this Government makes his position secure-becaus e every time the workers are attacked, as they are being attacked by this legislation and as they were attacked by the 1951 legislation, which took from them the control of their own affairs, the extreme left in the trade union movement is encouraged. It is because of that fact that we say that the time has arrived toreturn to the unions some of the freedom that they had under the 1949 legislation r although I consider-and I say it frankly -that even that legislation went too far in imposing controls on trade unions. I make that statement because I believe that ofiicers elected to permanent positions in trade unions should have security of tenure in those positions, and should not be at the mercy of any group which for its own purposes may organize the preparation of a petition to the court pleading for a new election. I could recite the names of dozens of trade unions which take the attitude that once their permanent ofiicers have been elected tooffice, and have proved themselves to be efficient in their capacity of leadership,, those officers are, like everybody else in security of tenure. I can cite many cases of trade union officials in New South Wales and other States who, because of that very security of tenure which existed in the past, gave the members they represented a quality of service and leadership that is not possible under the provisions of this Government's 1951 legislation. Mr Justice Wright did not hesitate to say in the Miscellaneous Workers casethat it was unfair for new members of a trade union organization to find that there were already in ofiice in the organization officers whom they had had no part in electing. As a result of that judgment great difiSculty has been experienced by trade unions in getting some degree of stability in respect of their leadership. The Labour Government provided in its legislation of 1949 that the councillors and those directly associated with the rank and file of trade unions should be regarded as officers who would be subject to re-election; but this Government, in its 1951 legislation, in the very first page of the bill destroyed the liberty of the trade union movement that had been enjoyed for many years.

James Harrison (Blaxland),"Government that, so long as this legislation remains as it is, so long as the judgment of Mr Justice Wright standsand there will be no shifting it now so long will the employment of trade union leaders be mere casual employment. That may be said to be a good thing, because thereby the rank and file of the union are given an opportunity to say who shall lead them; but the Government in its legislation carried this prinfor the Minister for Labour and National ciple further, so as to divide the trade union movement by giving any particular group, which might have all sorts of reasons of its own, the opportunity to go to the court and ask for a ballot at the Minister knows full well that the parent expiration of the term of any official, as under Mr Justice Wrig'it's decision. Then what happens? In the conduct of trade union ballots the court need have no regard to the union's rules. Because of that, men of the capaci'y of Jack"" Brown and others can be removed from office without good cause. This kind of legislation which takes away the rights of trade unionists to decide how their organizations shall function plays into the hands of small groups, left or right, that wish to impose their own wills on trade unions.

They have freedom in respect of the control of their own organizations and, as a result, they have due regard for the responsibilities that they carry. Even the Labour Government's 1949 legislation did not give the same freedom to trade unions in Australia as is enjoyed by trade unions in Great Britain and many other countries. It is of no use Service to say that 60 per cent, of workers in Australia are trade unionists whilst only 40 per cent, of workers in Great Britain are trade unionists. The body of one of the great metal trades unions of Australia-the Amalgamated Engineers Union-is in England, and he knows very well that that body in its leadership and in its purpose is just as powerful in England as the Amalgamated Engineers Union is in Australia; but, because it is not saddled with the type of restriction that applies in this country, its leaders in Great Britain are fully seized of their responsibility. The TEMPOEABY CHAIRMAN -",48,Orhanizations

135,Mr Ward (East Sydney) [8.27],"Icapably as can the officials of other organizations conduct their affairs. Thererore, I say that tbe present slipshod methods being adopted by those who are deemed to be more competent to conduct trade union ballots than are trade union officials themselves, will bear no examination. If we are to have a ballot in a trade union on any occasion, why should it not be conducted in accordance with the trade union's own rules? But what happens? When a petition is served by some members of a union asking for a supervised ballot to be conducted the people charged by this Government to conduct it do not even take the trouble to find out whether the members of the union who have signed the petition are financial members. All they do is to ascertain whether the names on the petition are listed as members on the books of the union. No check is made as to the financial status of the signatories. No check is even made as to whether the signatures on the petition are genuine. Anybody could sign such a petition and, as far as the only people who are now deemed to be competent to conduct the ballot are concerned, such persons need not be financial members, and the signature on the petitions need not even be genuine signatures. Having listened to the speeches in this Parliament any one would imagine that what the Government had decided to do was to supervise trade union ballots with electoral officials acting on behalf of the Government, and that the trade unions officers elected as scrutineers, and the trade union returning oflicer were going to play their parts in the conduct of the ballot. But that does not happen. What happens is that the trade union returning officer is allowed to call for nominations. After he receives them he makes a report to the electoral official conducting the ballot, and that is the last part that he plays in the conduct of the ballot until Tie is notified of the result of it. There are no trade union scrutineers. Why, even in ballots conducted for the election of members of this Parliament-co7i ducted by the very same people-w e are permitted to have scrutineers because we must be satisfied that the ballot is conducted in a proper manner. So it is not an unreasonable proposition to ask that the scrutineers of the trade unions should have the opportunity to watch the conduct of the ballot and the count. Bui the trade union scrutineers are not permitted to take any part in the conduct of the ballot at all. There is an abundance of evidence that electoral officials on occasions have favoured particular minority groups in some of the unions to give them some advantage in the conduct of the ballot. The trade unions have to be satisfied that the ballots are conducted properly. Let me remind honourable members of what happened on one notable occasion when a ballot had been completed, tbe count made and the result declared. Some time afterwards, a bag was discovered at the Haymarket Post Office containing a number of ballot-papers which had been returned but which had never been included in the count. Oould anybody regard that as a satisfactory way of conducting a ballot? It was only by accident that the bag was discovered in the post office and found to contain ballot papers. As everybody will recall, there has been so much criticism of what was happening in regard to ballots in the trade union movement that the postal officials to-day refuse to allow the post offices to be the repository for the storage of ballot-papers. They say that they are not a storing agency, that they merely receive and deliver. What happens today? When ballot-papers are returned to a post ofiice, they are received and then promptly collected. I am given to understand that the people who call to accept delivery of the ballot-papers are members of the Commonwealth Security Service and that when they collect the ballot-papers there are no union scrutineers present to ascertain that the seals on the bag are in order and that there has been no tampering with the ballot-papers themselves. Under those conditions, how can the trade union movement be expected to consider that that is a competent and efficient way of conducting trade union elections. I put it to all members of this chamber: If they belong to any organization do they consider that there should be any interference in the conduct of their business in the absence of any evidence that they are not competent to conduct their own business and their own elections? And trade unions are in that category. Why are not they given the opportunity to conduct their own ballots in accordance w it h trade union rules? But they are not! As I have said, there is no member of the trade union movement who believes that there ought to be ballots, the conduct of which could be regarded as questionable. If malprad idis proved, we say, "" Yes, let us have another ballot; let us have some form of .supervision"". But we certainly reject the idea that no trade union in this country is competent to conduct its own business aud its own union ballot. Let me deal w it h one other aspect of this matter, and that is the cost of courtcontrolled ballots to the trade unions. It is perfectly true that the Government involves itself in some expense in the conduct of ballots, but the major proportion of the cost must be borne by the trade union. This provision in the existing act does not mean that the only ballots that can be court controlled are those for the annual or triennial election of trade union officers. It means any ballot conducted by a trade union itself. A minority could use its power under this provision to embarrass financially its own organization. It is wrong in principle. Let us get back to what the Labour government proposed, and did, and that was that the way was open for anybody or any group within a union that could prove malpractice to get a new court-controlled ballot. That is all that this Parliament ought to be expected to do in respect of trade union affairs. The Opposition is adopting the right attitude in asking for the rejection of the proposal of the Government. Let us return to what thc Labour government of the day established on these matters a few years ago. [8.351 -There were some aspects of the of that trade union do not have the right speech of the honourable member for East that they should have, and that this Sydney( MrW a r d ) that I found a little Government wants them to have, of hard to follow. In 1949, the Labour freely and f a i r l y electing the officers Government introduced some provisions whom they desire. in regard to the conduct of ballots in trade unions where there had been malpractice. Those provisions were difficult to apply Government in its efforts to give to the nnd such a way that they would prove it to them; we cannot, of course, give it. impossible to apply. It is perfectly obvious from the tone of the remarks of honourable members of the Opposition that they resent any attempt to have impartial and fair ballots in trade unions. If those provisions were difficult to apply -and they were difficult to apply because the onus of proof was almost impossible to sustain-the n this Government has been wise and has acted correctly in making it easier for people in trade unions to have f a i r and impartial ballots. Let me remind honourable members that there is no need to prove that ballots in trade unions are very often crooked because the Labour party itself asserts that they are. The Labour party is at present split on the question of whether a ballot in one of its branches was crooked or not. We know by the Labour party's own admission that its ballots are very often crooked and that trade union ballots are very often crooked. If that is so-and the Labour party admits and asserts it -the n surely everybody should be on side with this Government in making i i easier to get free and impartial ballots properly conducted so that the members of the trade union concerned can properly eleet thc officers that they desire. Wc know that when a corrupt faction, particularly a Communist faction-becaus e the Communists have organized corruption inside trade unions-get s hold of the electoral machinery and is able to appoint the returning officer, there is no chance of a f a i r ballot. The Communists, will fake-in fact, their text-books demand that they sliould f ake-trad e union ballots whenever it is in the interests of the Communist party to do so. Do not let us be surprised at that. That is something which should be elementary. If such an electoral officercorrupt because he is a Communist or corrupt for any other reason-is in charge (Mackellar) of a trade union ballot, then the members The committee will surely support the they were probably drawn in rank-and-file trade unionists-w e can g i v",49,Orhanizations
136,Mr Wentworth,"to tbe rank and file of the Labour partythe right to eleet the ofiicers that they desire without corruption or coercion. That is the impact ol the Government's legislation. The honourable member for East Sydney made one point with which I feel myself in some measure of agreement. Since we are concerned with free and impartial ballots, there is no reason in my view why the candidates at those ballots should not in the normal course be able to appoint their scrutineers, who will be able to see what goes on. I see nothing wrong in that. 1 think the Government ' might, perhaps not in this chamber, but in another place, consider an amendment which would enable that to be be done. The Government has introduced this measure with only one object in view; that is to ensure that the rank-and-file trade unionists shall be able to elect the ofiicers they desire free from the electoral corruption which always characterizes the actions of the Australian Communist party, and which often characterizes the activities of the Australian Labour party. [8.40] I am a little tired of the continual allegations made by Government supporters about scandals and irregularities in ballots in the trade union movement and in the Australian Labour party. I should like to tell the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) that I have had long experience in the taking of ballots in both the trade unions and the Labour party. Very few men have had more opportunity to gain experience as a returning officer in such ballots than I have had. The honourable member for Mackellar seemed to regret, if one can judge by his words, that this Parliament cannot lay down conditions for, and conduct, ballots for the election of officers of the Labour party. I suppose he criticizes no one more than he criticizes thc waterside workers. My experience of them and the ballots in which they have elected Mr Healy year after year as their secretary is that those ballots are the most meticulously conducted that I have known. The honourable member talked also about Communist-dominated unions. This sort of talk makes me feel a little sick at times; I hear so much of it. 1 do not like communism. I do not want it to thrive in this country, and the Communists know it, but I cannot accept the suggestion that, because the waterside workers elect a Communist to the office of secretary of their union, it is Communist-dominated, and that the Communists control the ballots. In my own district, time and time again, a mere 10 per cent, of the members elected to the executive of the local branch of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia are Communists, and the other 90 per cent, are genuine members of the Australian Labour party who have been well known and highly respected for many years. Government supporters have suggested that this bill is needed so that the union members may elect the officers they want. 1 was president for some years of a branch of the Transport Workers Union of Australia, and I can assure the honourable member for Mackellar that any member of the union who wanted to participate in a ballot could do so freely. W P never had any difficulty over it. Thp biggest trouble I found .was that many of the rank-and-file members, whom Government supporters say should be ablp freely to elect the officers of their choice, would not bother to vote. Throughout the trade union movement, union members are free to elect the officers they want. The allegations of the honourable member for Mackellar are a slur on honest unionists and Labour men. Time and again, Government supporters have hurled at the Opposition the claim that the AntiCommunist Labour party is trying to do the proper thing and endeavouring to ensure clean ballots, and that it will do the job. I defy the honourable member for Mackellar or any one else to conduct cleaner ballots than I have seen conducted, and have conducted myself, in the Labour movement and in the tradr unions. Government supporters do not play the game when they cast this slur upon practically the whole Labour movement merely because some members of .i union have claimed that they were intimidated or that something wrong was done. The Government has the numbers it requires in the Parliament now, but it will not always have them. I have left",51,Orhanizations

I listened with considerable interest, with not a little concern, and even with dismay to what has been said by honourable gentlemen opposite in the course of the discussion this evening. I could not help thinking, as 1 listened to them, that it would be very interesting indeed to conduct a secret ballot of honourable members opposite on the question of whetlier or not these provisions should be retained. I gravaly suspect that if we could conduct a secret ballot we would not find the same unanimity on this matter as appears from the tenor of their remarks this evening, to prevail amongst honourable members opposite. In point of fact, those of us whose memories go back a few years w ill remember that the real weight of pressure for the introduction of this secret ballot legislation came not from our side of politics but from rank and file unionists and from members of this Parliament on the Labour side, some of whom wore destined at a later period to sit on the corner benches and represent a division of view in the Labour party at that time. As I look across this chamber to-night, and see the honourable member for Lang( Mr Stewart), the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Luchetti), and the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr. Minogue), and I think of the absent bnt not forgotten member for Grayndler ( MrD a l y ) .

I wonder what views are held on that question by Mr Short and his colleagues of the Federated Iron workers Association, who would not be in offiee to-day, after having rooted out the Communist leaders of that union in its various sections, had they not had available to them the provisions inserted in the legislation by this Government. Honourable members can consider the situation in any of the trade unions of this country. In those instances in which the union leadership remained under Communist control there is at least the knowledge on the part of the members of the union that if the Communist leaders get too f a r out of line with rank-and-file opinion, the secret ballot may be used to remove them. I do not deny that there are in Australia to-day Communist union officials' elected to their positions by the members of the particular unions. I accept, for this purpose, the honest vote for a word to indicate an honestly conducted ballot. I am not suggesting that there are not Communist officials who have been elected by tbe free vote in an honestly conducted ballot of their members.

It is of no use for the honourable member for Port Adelaide to say that these things do not happen or did not happen. They did happen, and it was because they were known to have happened that the honourable member's own former leader put certain provisions on the statute-book in order to provide some relief. However, as the honourable inember for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) has rightly pointed out, those provisions were inadequate. They threw a. tremendous and hazardous burden of responsibility on individual trade unionists who were sufficiently hardy to undertake to challenge their union leadership by the processes that were then provided. This Government took the element of risk ont of those procedures, and, if I had the statistics available to me, I could demonstrate to the committee the greatly increased frequency with which these provisions have been used by unionists all over Australia.

I heard them speaking on the Stevedoring Industry Bill, and the same tone has been employed by many of them in their speeches on both measures. It has not been the tone of democracy. It has been the tone and the language of men inflaming individual people in this country to resist the processes of democracy, and to resist the democratically determined decision of this Parliament. I say to honourable gentlemen opposite, in all seriousness, that the time may not be far distant when they will have to make up their minds whether they believe in parliamentary democracy or in industrial anarchy in this country. 1 make that comment because of the feeling that is developing in Australia, and is being encouraged to develop by the incitement of honourable gentlemen opposite in their speeches in this chamber. What this Government has set out to do, by means of this and the associated measure now before the Parliament, is to carry out policies on which it was elected, policies for which we believe we have a mandate, and with which we have been returned to office on the last four occasions that we Lave gone before the people. We are trying to carry out honestly and fairiy what we believe the people intend us to do. If honourable members opposite object to our policies, they have a remedy, and should not resort to inciting the people of Australia to resist the law of the land.

145,Mr Claret (Bendigo) [9.0],"It isHarold Holt) make the extraordinary statement that we are approaching a state of industrial anarchy. This statement has come from a member of the Government which, on more than one occasion in this chamber, has claimed that during its period of office a greater measure of industrial peace has been achieved in Australia than ever before. Now, he has told us that we are rapidly approaching a state of industrial anarchy. Honourable members deplored the making of inflammatory speeches in this debate, but I cannot recall a more inflammatory speech than that which was made by the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Sir Eric Harrison) earlier to-day. I think that neither the Minister nor the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) bas done justice to himself or to his part in the extravagant and extraordinary statements which each has made. The assertion that ballots are rigged and faked in the trade union movement indicates a complete lack of knowledge of the trade union movement and it:machinery of government. It is claimed that irregularities take place, but I have never known a federal general election, a State election, a municipal election or any other election to pass without charges of irregularities concerning the conduct of it. We in the trade union movement are anxious to keep ballots clean and pure and I can say, after a lifetime of experience in the trade union movement, that the greatest measure of security is taken by the organization concerned to ensure that a ballot is conducted correctly and in accordance with its rules. If , now and again, somebody does stray from what the rules provide, we should also tell ourselves that the same thing has happened in connection with public flections on more than one occasion. The late Prime Minister, the Right purpose of protecting the interests of its Honourable Ben Chifley, and my present members. We act in accordance with leader, the right honourable member for the principles of free trade unionism Barton (Dr. Evatt), were approached by which have been shown by the unions in the trade union movement in respect of New Zealand, the United States of the insertion of some provision in the America, Canada, the United Kingdom Conciliation and Arbitration Act so that, and elsewhere. We are intolerant of where irregularities were proved, action government control. As free organizacould be taken to see that anything that tions, they have the right to function was wrongly done could be set right. without constantly being subjected to One does not accept as correct every proscriptions, rules, or legislation that charge that irregularities have occurred in connection with this -or that ballot. One needs, first of all, to see that the irregularities are proven. Wheni t is proven that irregularities have occurred, it is time for action to be taken. As a consequence of the representations that were made by Mr Monk, the then secretary of the Australian Council of Trades Unions, myself as president, the late Mr Croft and others, the legislation opposite have of 1949 was eventually brought down. That legislation was so framed as to protect the interests of those who had suffered as a result of the irregularities,, once they were proven. The legislation went as far as to provide that persons who, through lack of means, could not check the material in relation to the cbarges that they made, should be provided with means to do so. The honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) and the Minister for Labour and National Service were totally incorrect in stating that that legislation could not be put into operation. It was that legislation that resulted in the cleaning up of the Federated Iron workers Association of Australia. Mr Short, the secretary of that union, owes his position to the fact that the 1949 act was invoked. The same applies to the Federated Clerks Union of Australia. Again, it was that act, not the 1951 act or the 1952 act, that brought about the change in that organization. Yet responsible members of Parliament, including a responsible Minister, have risen in their places and suggested that this effective legislation was innocuous and of no use whatever. What has been done by the Minister in later legislation has certainly brought about the resentment of the trade union movement. We claim to have in this country a free and independent trade union movement which exists for the auterferes with their internal affairs. We tihall always fight for that right to be a free and independent trade union movement, entitled to conduct our own affairs in accordance with our own rules. It is because of that fact that we objected to the legislation in 1951 which deliberately aimed at taking out of the hands of those who are held responsible under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act for the carrying on of unions-the federal executive and the federal conference and the -committee of management-the right to administer their own rules. That legislation put in the hands of a small number of members of any union the right to override the governing and controlling authority of the organization. The result of taking the administration of the unions out of their hands and placing it in the hands of somebody -else has been that, instead of unions being able to carry on their own affairs and protect their members, factions within the unions have utilized the legislation introduced by the Minister for Labour and National Service for the express purpose of obstructing the affairs of the organizations and endeavouring to secure control of the unions in order to use them for their own purposes. That was the action, that was the tactics, that was the strategy of the people who sat on the corner benches in this chamber last year and whose opinions were so little respected by the people that at the last general -election they all were dislodged from their seats in the Parliament. Now, WR have been told that they are the people who represent the trade union movement and who speak as the voice of Labouri n this country. The extent to which the Government fails to appreciate the opinions, views, traditions, objectives and aims of the great trade union movement of Australia is ridiculous. As a trade union movement, we have retained our right to carry on our organization as we think it should be carried on. I believe that the total number of trade trolled ballot.

Yet a mere handful of men belonging to these organizations is trying to destroy the trade union movement and the Australian Labour party by utilizing the provisions of the act which the Minister so generously praised to-night. The type of legislation which the Government has introduced and which it believes will bring about some form of sanity in industrial relations in Australia, will destroy any chance of better relation?, and will indicate to the trade unionists who desire their organizations to function in their interests that the Government is determined by its legislation to weaken and smash the trade union movement of Australia in the hope of being able to reduce the conditions of labour and the standard of living for the Australian people.

The honourable member's time has expired. honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Clarey) argued very forcefully in favour of the right, of trade unions to conduct their own affairs. He put forward a strong argument against the ability of factions within trade unions to approach the Arbitration Court in an effort to obstruct the affairs of the union and to gain office. His argument sounded most impressive, but when one boils it down, one finds that all that those factions do is to seek a court-controlled ballot. If the honourable member had shown exactly in what way, other than by the perfectly democratic means of using the processes of the court, the factions seek to gain control, his argument would have been much more impressive. As it is, he has only left in the minds of honourable members the impression that those people who fear the implementation of this legislation are the persons who fear the use of a cleanly conducted court-con-",55,Orhanizations
146,Mr Freeth (Porrest) [9.10],"Th einvoked. No very great degree of dissatisfaction has been expressed on behalf of the trade union movement in relation to those occasions when the court assisted certain groups of union members. I wish to make one further observation. The honourable member referred at some length to the legislation that was introduced by the Australian Labour party in 1949; but he omitted to state that that legislation was forced on the Labour party because the present Prime Minister( Mr Menzies), as Leader of the Opposition, had introduced a private member's bill. The force of public opinion was such that the Labour party could not avoid doing something about the matter, and it went a little way towards introductheir problems, recorded their votes, and ing a measure of control over irregularities in trade union affairs. The plain truth is that it did not go far enough, and hide my light under a. bushel. Indeed. when this Government assumed office it introduced the 1951 legislation. Since then, there has been nothing but approval of the Government's legislation, except from the Labour party inside this chamber and the Communist party outside. One must deplore the line of debate that munism does not in any way tie me or has been followed to-night by the Minisanj of my colleagues to the bandwagon ter for Labour and National Service( Mr of the Government in relation to this oi Harold Holt), who, instead of addressing any other measure that might be introhimself to the matter before the comduced. mittee, sought to single out individual members of Her Majesty's Opposition and to ascribe to them points of view that were untruthful and unfair. That action future, when consideration is being given was completely unworthy of the right to such matters, he should exclude from honourable gentleman. In regard to the his remarks references to persons who subject-matter before the committee. sit on this side of the chamber. He ought Opposition members are as one.

We believe in an educated democracy, and we also believe that it cannot be achieved unless the working people, in their trade unions, play their part as free and unfettered as the laws of this country permit. As one who in past years was the returning officers for the Western Miners Federation of New South Wales, I say that the ballots with which I was associated were conducted in a scrupulously fair manner. There was no question of any malpractice, and the greatest good for the greatest number was the paramount consideration.

147,Mr Luchetti (Macquarie) [9.14],"protestations about democracy by honourable members opposite form part of their smokescreen and of their assault upon the trade union movement, and it is of no use for them to try to hide that fact from their colleagues or from us. The honourable member for Swan( Mr Cleaver) and thc honourable member for Forrest( Mr movement. Why is there all this talk Freeth) may think that, when they support assaults on the trade union movement, they are standing for democracy; but the fact is that they are in the hands of people who do not know what democracy means ancl who are resorting to every possible means to overthrow it. When people attack the trade union movement, they attack part of the core and tradition of the Australian way of life. The trade union movement has been built up on a voluntary basis. Members of the trade unions have a tradition of mateship, of working together, and of sticking together on the principle of one out all out. Honourable members opposite will not understand and cannot understand that because it is in conflict with the very things for which they stand. When the Minister for Labour aud National Service( Mr Harold Holt) issues a challenge in relation to secret ballots, he ought to look at his own house. Many days have passed since the Ministry of which he is a member faced a secret ballot in the party room. He has no right to point a finger at Opposition members. speaking about democracy and ballots! Tlie members of the Liberal party have come a long way in 100 years. It is only 100 years since their interest in trade unions was associated more with public hangings than with secret ballots. Apparently, if a trade union leader takes a ballot-box away and burns the ballot papers, that is bad, but if a Liberal politician gets to work a.nd draws the boundary lines of electorates in such a way that his opponents cannot possibly win. nothing is said against him. If he establishes a legislative council in such a way that an elected government cannot possibly govern properly, Liberal supporters do not think too badly of him. Probably they make him Premier of South Australia. Those are the principles at stake. I am not at all interested in the details down to the last full stop. I am interested in the principle that applies. Governmeut supporters, one after another, have spoken of secret ballots. They have been doing this for six years. They have confused all those members of the Australian public who do not happen to belong to the trade union of secret ballots? What unions have no: had secret ballots since their very beginning ? Such ballots have been a principle in the conduct of the democratic procedures of the Labour party and the Labour movement. Government supporters are dishonest. What they are attempting is the taking away of control of trade unions from their own elected officers. unions. trade unions, because when they split the trade union movement they split thc rock upon which this party stands. When they split this party as they succeeded in doing by fostering and nurturing the persons who formerly sat in the corner-and I am here because those persons were supported by the Liberal party-the y are splitting the protectors and the sponsors of democracy in this country, and there is no denying that fact. When the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Freeth) associates us with the Communists-w e do not expect anything different from the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Fancy the Liberal party Wentworth)I throw the lie back in his teeth. I am prepared to debate that proposition outside with any one. It is absolutely astonishing that a majority of the electors of Australia have been able to be fooled by this line of talk. The Minister mentioned the iron workers' ballot. That ballot and the election of office-bearers which flowed from it was the result of the 1949 legislation. Such facts as these are obscured by smoke-screens of propaganda, and it is time that Government supporters acknowledged that fact. It is time that they rose and spoke for the things they stand for. They have continually fooled the Australian people but that cannot go on for much longer. We have been warning them, for days.

164,Mr Beazley,"I quite agree thatsome others became disgruntled. The situation there now is of complete bitter resentment, and I am pretty sure that in that well-known situation we will find that the smashing of that union by tbe full coercive powers of the New Zealand Government two years ago, at the time of that crisis, will have embittering consequences on the New Zealand waterfront for many years to come. I remind the Minister that he has talked in his speech about the bitterness of traditions dating from the foundation of the waterfront industry in this country. Anybody who went to a pick-up centre before the war would have seen the most degrading conditions. I know that a lot of shipowners would disagree with that statement; but I say that it was a pathetic spectacle. When there was a pick-up one could see men jumping over one another's backs in order to be picked up by the man who was making the selection. It was like a selection of animals. That was the kind of thing that was happening on the waterfront. There is nothing particularly violent about that. It is not what one would call an embittering element in trade union relations. But there did develop, with lots of other clashes, this sort of less than human way of conducting affairs on the waterfront. Government supporters ask whether the turn-round of ships is as quick and the handling of cargoes as good as in 1949. They never examine the statistics of waste that were involved in the past in the constant unemployment on the waterfront, the non-utilization of surplus labour, and the physical condition of the children of waterside workers in those days which I , as a school child, saw in the two wars has gone, I think, and we may school I attended. I am not impressed by complete comparisons of efficiency in an industry which are arrived at by statistics of the turn-round of ships. There are also some things that have to be said about the conduct of shipping operations which the Minister might well have mentioned. I am speaking, for instance, of ships arriving at Fremantle from overseas which sometimes had he + cargo destined for Sydney loaded on top of the cargo destined for Fremantle. The result was that the cargo destined for Sydney had to be unloaded before the cargo destined for Fremantle could be removed from the holds, and then the cargo for Sydney had to be reloaded before the ships could leave. There are a good many things like that which did not make for efficiency on the waterfront. The Minister said that the loss of time in this industry is 30 times as great as in the general run of Australian industry. Nobody would pretend that this sector of the Australian economy is satisfactory; but unless the Minister is satisfied exclusively that the explanation for this bad industrial record, in comparison with that of other trade unions in Australia, is entirely due to Communist leadership, or that the waterside workers are an inferior species-whic h I cannot believe, knowing many of them-h e must surely recognize that the bad tradition that has developed in this industry will not be met by machinery bills like this one, but will be met only by a constant effort on ihe part of the Government, and of all governments in Australia, to show, as I . think the Labour government showed, that they regard this as an essential industry, an industry in which a man can get a living with dignity, and that they will take steps to decasualize the industry to see that employment on the waterfront is stable and continuous. If those things are done, over a period of time, we could hope to see developing in that industry a better industrial tradition than has existed in it in the past. That has already been done to some extent. The tradition of violence and instability which was so characteristic between the look, if the Minister will continue his legislation in the tradition started by John Curtin, for a continuation of the development of that atmosphere in the industry. able gentleman sits down I should like to ask him a question.

That is, perhaps, a great tradiction, because, after the Minister has tragedy, because it gives those who are spent a great deal of time and effort in in charge of the Waterside Workers -stabilizing the industrial situation in Federation the opportunity to play on the Australia, surely it would be foolish of faults of the opposite side and pass over kim to bring in a bill, knowingly, that their own mistakes, their own faults and -would disturb thc industrial position. their own failings.

167,Mr Lucock (Lyne) [9.58],". I want waterside workers and the stevedoringthat there was some improvement. Althoughi t is acknowledged that there has been an improvement, that improvement does not take us back to the position that existed in 1938. The improvement, if 1 may put it this way, has been an improvement on a position that had deteriorated. So a great deal of commendation will not be warranted-thoug h there may be a little-uuti l the turnround in shipping gets back more closely 1,0 what it was in 1938. We must concede that there have been improvements in the conditions and in the machinery for the handling of cargo, which should allow us to improve the time taken in the turnround in shipping. The secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation and members of tbe Opposition tell us of the dire consequences that will follow the passing of this legislation. To-day, meetings were called to discuss a 24-hour strike, and the reports that are coming in show that the support for those statements is not as strong as the secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation would have us believe. The members of the union in Fremantle voted to return to work at six o'clock this evening Western Australian time. In four ports in South Australia they voted to strike for only four hours. In Melbourne, about half, or less than half of the members of the union attended the meeting of protest that had been called. That is an indication that the exaggerated statements of members of the Opposition certainly cannot be supported. should also not forget that at these meetings, the worse possiVe point of view would be put forward by the leaders of the union who were addressing the men. It has been alleged that short-term and supplementary labour w ill undermine the union and the working conditions of members of the union. Yet any one who studies the b ill w ill see that it goes to great pains to ensure that both short-term and supplementary labour w ill be used only in particular instances and in cases of emergency. Short-term labour has been arranged for situations such as occur in Hobart and in north Queensland. The second thing that has been exaggerated is the claim that this bill w ill set up another union. Again, anybody who reads this bill w ill see that that is not so. It stresses the fact that it is to preserve the existing union, but it is also to allow for the possibility that at some stage-for example, on the north coast of Western Australia-the Australian Workers Union may be the union concerned in the waterside work. Clause9 has been inserted in the bill to cover that possibility in the future. Another thing that has been said is that harsh disciplinary control has been kept for the waterside workers and that no penalty has been provided for the shipowners. If this bill is studied, it w ill be seen such a claim is not correct. There is the provision for fines of up to £1,000 with a minimum of £100 on shipowners. Yet, those people who desire to destroy this bill, and harmonious relations in the industrial field, say that penalties are directed only against the workers and not against any one else. No greater balderdash has ever been spoken. Surely the benefit, of the policies that have been put forward by this Government must be realized, even if one does not always agree with those policies. Surelyi t must be admitted that, in the main, they have been for the advantage, the progress and the development of this country. I said I wanted to mention the economy of the situation. As I have pointed out, conditions on the waterfront vitally affect Australia's economy. We should consider that fact carefully when we think and talk of the difficulties that confront us in We relation to our overseas balances at the present time. I recall that, not very long ago, the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) said the honourable member for Lyne was a lion when he spoke, and a mouse when he voted, because I had criticized the economic policy adopted by the Government at that time. I say, without wishing to appear in any way conceited, that I believe my colleagues and I achieved something on that occasion. We showed that many of us felt the Government was not makincr the right attack on the problem, and T believe that, as a result, the Government altered some of the proposals that were to be included in the economic statement that the Prime Miniser( Mr Menzies"") made shortly afterwards. Tf the honourable member for Parkes thinks a government supporter should cross t""<? floor of this House and vote against the Government, I , should like to ask him what is the alter1890. Unfortunately, tbe pattern of the native to the present Government. helieve that, unfortunately, the Auslias unfolded itself from time to time in tralian Labour party must take its share recent years, is unfolding itself again in -of the responsibility for any shorthis opposition to this bill and to another comings in the Government. As I have which was introduced a little earlier. said in this House on a number of occasions, in a democracy, a strong Oppotives of the Australian Communist party, sition is needed to keep the government at any stage, is to use any person or on its toes.

Minister pointed out in his speecli that the But, when they attacked the Communists, record of the industry was one of turbulence, they in turn were attacked by the leader and that is true. But he must be careful of the Australian Labour party, although before using phrases like that because that is not a phrase which has been applied only he had worked with them when he felt recently to the industry. It is a phrase that they could be of value to him. As soon was applied by Mr Justice Higgins, who, as they became, in his opinion, no longer more than 40 years ago, made the first award in this industry. Would the Leader of the Opposition say enemies. that this industry is not turbulent at the present time? The inference to be taken old catch-cry: "" The workers are starvfro m the statement.

Opposition members whether such conditions really exist in Australia to-day. Members of the Opposition once more seem to contradict themselves. On the one hand, they say that the measures adopted by this Government will prevent rhe workers from buying refrigerators, wireless and television sets, motor cars, and other new articles as they become available, and, on the other hand, they say that we are now back almost to depresbackground, and, secondly, because of sion conditions again. Surely any one with a thought for the welfare and future «f Australia must realize that no one section of the community can advance to the detriment of any other section. If we think one section can advance alone without detriment to the others, we shall hamper Australia's progress. We often talk about rights and privileges. Those things are important, but I should like io hear a little more talk about responsicould be brought before the Parliament. bility and purpose. Just as the workers have certain rights and privileges, so have certain other sections of the community. In common with other Government supporters, who have mentioned this matter previously, 1 also have been :i member of a union. Members of unions have not only rights and privileges but MISO responsibilities and duties. This constant preaching of class hatred .ind the constant emphasis placed upon it by Opposition members time and again, either intentionally or unintentionally, in an endeavour to stir up feelings of hatred and distrust, will not work in the interests of any one section of the community. It will work only against the interests of the community as a whole. It matters not. whether I am a member of this Blouse, great as the privilege may be. The most important thing for Australia is its progress and future development. arguments that have been used by honourable members opposite in tbeir attacks on this measure, and the otlier measures we have recently been considering, are designed merely to stress emotional aspects and to stir up hatred and bitterness. In adopting that attitude the Opposition is doing a disservice to the unions and to Australia. As I said at the outset, I support the I ask bill. I congratulate the Minister on the work that he has done in the last six yearsin an endeavour to achieve peace in industry, and I hope that he will continuethat work in the years ahead. Mr O'CONNOR (Dalley) [10.21] The measure that is before the House isone of the most extraordinary bills that we have seen in many years. I say that it is extraordinary, first, because of its the manner in which it was introduced into this House. In November, 1954, a committee was appointed for the purpose of inquiring into certain aspects of the stevedoring industry. As time went by,, the members of the Government and the Cabinet became a little impatient, and finally the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Harold Holt) sent a letter to the committee, asking that it submit an interim report, so that a bill This measure is extraordinary, because although that committee of inquiry was established, it has not yet finished its task,, and still has a great deal of work to do. Notwithstanding that fact, the Government has brought down a bill which isbased, allegedly, on a recommendation of that committee. Another interesting feature of the interim report is that the committee has not made any mention of some of the matters that it was asked to inquire into, such as the matter of charges and freight rates. It may be merely a coincidence that the interim report deals only with the aspects of the stevedoring industry that particularly affect the trade unions. I should also point out that during the committee's sittings the shipowners were asked to present to the committee certain documents dealing with profits and charges. I think it is true to 3ay that the The shipowners have not complied with the requests that have been made from time to time, and their non-compliance has delayed the work of the committee. The delay that has occurred can be attributed, at least in part, to the attitude of the shipowners in this regard. Apparently they are quite content to have the most minute examination of the trade union movement, but they adopt an entirely -different attitude in regard to any -examination of their affairs. I should also mention that the committee has stated that the representatives of the Waterside Workers' Federation have complied with every request to furnish evidence to the committee. I understand .also that the shipowners have asked that any information that they give regarding profits should be treated as confidential. [ do not quarrel with that attitude, but it ment proposes to make upon it. This seems that the committee itself proposes ""to keep the information completely confidential, because we have no hope of finding out what aspects the committee has considered, or how it proposes to proceed in the future. I direct attention to the attitude adopted by the Minister and the -Government on every occasion that a bill of this kind, relating to the stevedoring industry, comes before the House. The Minister has tried to give the impression that he is something of a reluctant dragon in this matter, but the fact is that every time a bill dealing with the stevedoring industry is brought -down by this Government, it contains an attack on the Waterside Workers' Federation. While the Minister is prepared to introduce legislation that will have a punitive effect on the union, he sits back and acknowledges the fact that he is unwilling to do anything about dealing with the shipowners. I am reminded of the stevedoring industry charge legislation of 1954, which reduced the stevedoring charge from l i d . to 6d. a man-hour. I asked the Minister at that time what action he proposed to take to ensure that the benefit of that reduction would be passed on to the public, and he blandly asked me what ActionI could suggest he might take. The Minister thus admitted his incompetence -and displays his unwillingness to interfere in any way with one section of the industry, although he proposes to deal with the other section in the manner suggested in the bill we are now discussing. The Opposition opposes this bill because it is a straight-out attack on the trade union movement, and because of the punitive and penal clauses that it contains. realize that the worker has only his labour to sell, and everything affecting his employment is very important to him. This side of the House is more concerned with matters that will prejudice the livelihood of workers than with questions of whether the shipping combines will make a profit of 20 per cent, or 25 per oent. per annum on their capital. The trade union movement will never submit to attacks such as the GovernGovernment has attempted for the past, two or three years to convert ordinary industrial offences into criminal offences, and it is idle for members of the Government to say that such a policy is not an attack on the trade union movement. The Waterside Workers' Federation has been blamed for most of the disturbances that have occurred in the industry. I admit that there are occasions when legitimate criticism can be levelled at the federation, but on every conceivable occasion when a disturbance occurs iu the industry the Government tries to capitalize on the situation by making exaggerated charges against the federation. One need only have listened to the speech of the honourable member for Lyne( Mr Lucock), who preceded me in this debate, to realize the truth of my remarks in this connection. His speech consisted purely of propaganda. Every time this House is called upon to debate an issue such as this, the phantom of communism is trotted out. There is not the slightest doubt that this Government is attempting to make political capital out of the issue of communism. The motives of the Government in bringing down this bill are suspect. The bill is resisted by the trade union movement because it is basically an attack upon the unions themselves. The members of the Government who have participated in this debate have followed the usual pattern of blaming the federation for every disturbance that has occurred in the industry. I just want to make some reference to some of the inquiries that have been held before in regard to this industry. The Minister for Labour and National Service was at particular pains to quote, in part, the interim report upon which this bill was The Government must based. I point out that there have been other inquiries into this particular industiy in the past, and that many of the conclusions that have been reached by competent men differ radically from some of the conclusions that appear in the interim .report. Not so long ago, the Government incurred the expense of bringing out from England an acknowledged expert in this matter, Mr Basten, who studied the industry and submitted to this House a comprehensive report whii-h now lies in the archives of the Parliament. I think it is interesting to remind the House of some of the conclusions that Mr Basten reached as a result of his inquiries into this industry. It will be found that his conclusions differed very radically from some of the opinions and assertions that have come so glibly from the other side of the chamber. In the concluding paragraph of the foreword to his report, dealing with the delay relating to thc turnround of ships, Mr Basten saidThe principal causes of delays to ships lie in tlie inadequacy of many berths in the ports, in the halting pace at which goods are removed from or brought to wharves and in the industrial practices of the stevedoring industry. Por the sake of clarity these matters are discussed separately, but it should not be overlooked tliat it is common for all three to be exercising their adverse influences simulget some return for it. That is their taneously; equally common for two of them to be at work and less common for one to be the sole cause of slow turn-round. We have been criticized in this country for a slow turn-round of ships, and I -say quite definitely that the Government's approach to this matter will bring about no improvement. Rather than attempt to solve the problem in a practical way and demonstrate its bona fides t,o those who are interested, and rather than demonstrate its determination to deal with this subject impartially, the Government has dealt with it by means of this legislation. How can the members of the federation or the trade union movement be impressed by the Government's protestations when they hear .speeches of the kind to which we are subjected when measures of this kind are brought into the House? As I have said before, Government supporters make every attempt to lay at the feet of the federation every shortcoming in the industry. I was interested in that part of theinterim report which dealt with some of the causes of the loss of time in the industry. The Minister made only a passing reference to the subject. 1 was astounded, on reading the interim report,, to find that the committee set out that 5.5 per cent, of the working time, that is, paid labour time, is lost because of the occurrence of rain. The last report of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board shows that 6.6 per cent, of the working time was lost through disputes,. &c. I think it can be said that if all the periods when rain occurred weretaken into considei a tion, the figure of 5.5 per cent, would rise considerably. At this point, the question arises,. "" What are the shipowners, in particular,, doing to remove this anomaly that obtainsin the industry?"" 1 know that the federation has tried, down the years,, to get the shipowners to act with it in an. attempt to overcome this difficulty. It is interesting to contrast the attitude of Australian shipowners with the attitude of shipowners in other parts of the world when they are faced with a problem of this sort. Unfortunately, in Australia., the shipowners apparently are not prepared to spend one halfpenny unless they attitude to almost every problem that arises in this industry. When the subject of wharf space comes up for discussion, the shipowners dismiss it on thc ground that it is a matter for a State instrumentality. On the subject of amenities, it can be truthfully said that no class of employers has had a more disgraceful record than the shipowners in* this country. The conditions that prevailed in some Australian ports before the advent of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board were positively shameful. It is true that there has been an improvement in some of tbe amenities in Australian ports, but the shipowners cannot take any credit for them. Those improvements have occurred as a result of the policy of the board. I join with my colleague from Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) in pointing out that the waterside worker is an ordinary human being. He is a person who hasresponsibilities and who is trying to do the best for his family. He is an ordinary Australian, trying to measure up to his responsibilities and do the best he can in very difficult circumstances. However, when we listen to some of the propaganda that is spoken from time to time, we could be excused for thinking that the wharfies, as some people call them, are something out of this world. It is true that the leaders of the Waterside Workers Federation are Communists, but it is also true that the Australian Council of Trade Unions has allied itself with the federation in opposition to the measure before the House. The honourable member for Lyne( Mr. Lucock) tried to argue that, because the bill provides penalties for the employers mittee is open to criticism, first, because as well as the employees, the bill, of necesof the length of time that it has taken sity, must be impartial and just. But the committee to present it ; secondly, when we examine the processes that have because of its contents; and, thirdly, to be followed in order to impose a penalty because of the failure of the committee on an employer, and then ascertain the to report upon some of the matters upon processes that need be followed to impose which it was asked to report. If the penalties on the worker, we realize that committee had made reference even to the position is just too silly for words. the question of increased freights, tbe It seems to me that many honourable memreport would not have been open to bers who support the Government, and the criticism I am directing against it . some Ministers in particular, have sucBut the committee has made absolutely no cumbed to the clamour of certain back reference to increased freight rates or benchers in this matter. determined that this should become a tions. Why has it presented a report political matter and that they should which deals mainly with the activities of extract from it the maximum advantage the federation ? I point out that the prothat they can for themselves and so, in visions of the bill, too, are directed their speeches, we have heard the hacklargely against the federation. To my neyed term "" Communist"". Anyone who mind, the report is suspect. I say without, attempts to oppose the impositions of this hesitation that the Government is attemptb ill is immediately lined up by Governing to capitalize on the shortcomings of ment supporters. I submit to them thar their attitude is doing their cause no good. The mere fact that the leaders <.f the federation are Communists does not in any way j u s t if y the infliction on the members of the federation of the which everyone concedes exist in the treatment that this bill proposes to hand industry. If this Government or any «ut to them.. It represents a departure from all stevedoring industry, it cannot afford to accepted ideas of conciliation and arbibe so partial or vindictive, or so comtration. The Government, in effect, propletely lacking in stability, in its poses to stand over the men who work in approach to the matter. The viewpoint this industry and wbo, if the measure of the Government as expressed in the becomes law, will have no alternative Minister's second-reading speech, in the but to accept the penalities that w ill be course of which he attempted to lay at. imnosed. A government that introduces the door of federation responsibility for fluch a measure, the chief characteristic all the shortcomings of the industry and of which is its penal provisions, can hardly appeal for conciliation. Its claim that it is concerned merely with the state of the national economy falls to the ground. Not only have employee organizations a responsibility to prove good intent, but also, I submit, the Government has a responsibility to prove that it believes in better conditions than those that are prescribed in the bill. This measure will be resisted, not only by members of the federation, but also by the whole trade union movement. This Government has taken a retrograde step in attempting to impose such penalties upon members of the federation. The interim report of the Tait comThey have costs associated with stevedoring operathe industry, and that it has demonstrated that it is more concerned about trying to gain political advantage than about remedying some of the shortcomings other government wishes to accomplish anything in such an industry as the to close his eyes to the failure of the shipowners to do something about it, will not tend to convince the public of its were circulated:impartiality. Finally, I say that the bill should be rejected, because basically, besides seeking to impose penal measures, it strikes Development, upon noticeat the right of members of the under federation and every other trade Division are located in King's-road, New unionist to strike.
