We feel very deeply for Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Kent and her children, who have sustained such a great personal lossa loss which is shared by Their Majesties the King and Queen, Her Majesty Queen Mary, and the other members of the Royal Family.

We were sad event has removed from his family, fellow members in this Parliament, and and from a large circle of friends, a man colleagues in the Government during the who had for many yearn been associated war of 1914-18 and in the post-war with the public affairs of this country.

He was of Representatives for Nepean, New an excellent organizer and administraSouth Wales, at the general election in tor, acid as Minister iu Charge of 1913 and was re-elected in 1914 and Recruiting rendered valuable service 191:7. He was a member of the Federal to the Commonwealth during a period of Parliamentary Recruiting Committee in intense strain. It may be truly said of 1917-18, and in his capacity of an Assistant Minister from March, 1918, ho was specially in charge of recruiting. He visited England at the invitation of the United Kingdom branch of the Empire Parliamentary Association in 1916. He resigned ministerial office on the 31st January, 1919, and retired on the expiration of the seventh Parliament in 1919. Apart from his notable work in connection with the campaign for recruits for the Australian Imperial Force during the last war, into which he threw all his enthusiasm and organizing ability, he will be principally remembered for his work as a member of the Australian Broadcasting Commission from the 26th May, 1932, until the 31st December, 1939. He was specially fitted for the duties associated with the functions of the Broadcasting Commission by virtue of his special interest in, and knowledge of, music and drama.

I sincerely regret minently during the intervening period his death, and extend my heartfelt sympathy to his widow and family in their bereavement. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. Mr 01011111 Minister) -With deep regret I inform honourable members of the death of rhe Honourable James Newton Haxton Hume-Cook, a former member of the Mouse of Representatives and a Minister of the Crown, who passed away at Melbourne on the 7th August, 1942. The late honourable gentleman also had the distinction of being a member of the first Commonwealth Parliament; of those who shared that honour, very few remain. He served his parliamentary apprenticeship as a member of the Legislative Assembly in Victoria, to which he was elected in September, 1S94, to Boroughs, which seat he held until November, 1900, when he was defeated. At the general election in 1901, he was elected to the House of Representatives for Bourke, Victoria, and he was re-elected in 1903 and 1906. He became whip to the first Deakin Ministry, and served as a member of the Select Committee on Decimal Coinage in 1901. H». was appointed an honorary Minister from the 2Sth January, 1903, to the 12th yovember, 1906. He was chairman of the Royal Commission on Postal Services 1908-10-unti l December, 190S, whan he resigned his seat on the commission. He was defeated at the general ""lection in 1910. The late honourable gentleman was born in -New Zealand, and as a youth he took an active interest in local government matters, and after a period of service in the Victorian Stato legislature, transferred his activities to the Commonwealth sphere on the establishment of federation. Although it is more than 30 years since ment, his name has stood out proin connection with many public movements. He was closely associated with the Australian Natives Association, and the Australian Industries Protection League, through both of which organizations he worked with enthusiasm and energy towards the advancement of Australia, and the prosperity of its people. These labours made a material contribution to the develop(Fremantle--Prime ment of Australian industries. The deceased gentleman also took an active part in the administration of a number of societies established for the health and social welfare of the peopK-. He gave unsparingly of his time and labour over a long period in the service of his country.

Loader of the United Australia party) I second the motion, and desire to associate myself and my colleagues with thp Prime Minister in expressing regret at deep sympathy with his widow and family in their bereavement. The late friendship, extending over 40 years and ripening as the years went by, remained unbroken to the end. He was, like myself, a member of the first Commonwealth Parliament, and remained a member until 1910.

11,Mr Hume,"Cook was my friend-and ourof public affairs. In tbe Commonwealth Parliament he proved that this reputation was well deserved. He spoke well and clearly, developed hi arguments logically, and pressed bis poinfcThome. As an organizer and administrator he took high rank. A master of detail, he had a range of outlook that enabled him to deal with matters in their broadest aspects. He believed in Australia, and was never tired of chanting its praises and advancing its interests. He was a life member of the Australian Natives Association, and until his death was one of the leaders of its governing council. He was a fearless champion of Australian industries. From his earliest years in public life he devoted himself to their development. For many years he was the seci-etary of HIP Australian Industries Protection League-a n organization established to promote the interests of Australian .secondary industries. He was a prolific writer on all subjects relating to. the exCabinet when it is considered that his pansion of Australian industries, and their present proud position is in no small degree due to his untiring labours. During his term of parliamentary life, I learned to know and to esteem him, and in later years, when our relations became still more intimate, to look upon him as a dear friend. The news of his death was to me a severe blow, and leaves me to mourn a man for whom I had conceived a sincere affection. To hi? wife and family I extend my deep sympathy.

I am sure wish me to welcome hack to the Parliament the Right Honourable the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt), who undertook a mission, on behalf of the Government, of the utmost importance to the Commonwealth.

21,Mr Archie Cameron,"I acceptMessages reported transmitting Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure and Estimates of Expenditure for Additions, New Works, Buildings, & c , for the year ending the 30th June, 1943, and recommending appropriations accordingly. Ordered to be printed, and referred to Committee of Supply forthwith. In Committee of Supply: [7.45] -To-da y completes the third year of the most momentous war in all history. It is not merely a conflict between peoples; it is a clash between principles. We fight to assert, the democratic life of personal liberty against the living death of a totalitarian system which enslaves the individual to party dictators. We tight to prevent the vast spiritual, social, political, economic and industrial progress achieved in past centuries from being thrown back into the chaos of a new kind of barbarism. Our effort is rising to new heights aud is becoming worthy of the great cause. This budget epitomizes that effort in facts and figures. These are eloquent. But behind them is something vastly moreeloquent, vastly more preciousthe spiritual zeal of our people, the readiness to sacrifice money, good*, labour and even life itself, as needed and when needed, to uphold the faith that is in us. The year just ended brought to us a new and nearer menace. We responded with a new and mightier effort-crystal lized in the expansion of war expenditure from £170,000,000 in 1940-41 to almost double that amount last year. For the current, year a further enormous increase is inevitable. Security reasons prevent me from giving in detail exactly what that means in the number of fighting men to be paid, equipped, fed and transported. But I can say that our fighting forces now exceed anything that we ever thought possible, and that our army of war workers behind those fighting men has risen to heights which seemed impossible. In our direct war effort we have more than three times n* much man-power as we had at any time in the last war. We are still expanding and this huge budget provides for payment of the financial price of that expansion. The major factor in the accounts ot last year was the great increase of war expenditure which reached the record total of £319,511,000. This was £98,001.000 more than the budget estimate, and £149,273,000 greater than the expenditure in 1940-41. The great increase over the budget estimate was due to the unprovoked attack by Japan, which threatened our very existence. A sum of £272,935,000 was expended in Australia and £46,573,000 overseas. Expenditure on munitions and supplies for other governments amounted to £43.309.000. of which £33,807,000 was recovered during the year, thus leaving £9,502,000 only as a charge on the budget. As can be well understood, the financing of nearly £320,000,000 was not easy. During the year, additional taxation was brought down by the Government on no fewer than three occasions. The new taxation imposed in connection with the October Financial Statement was estimated to produce £27,000.000 in a f u l l year, and £20,600,000 in 1941-42. In December, following the entry of. Japan into the war, supplementary taxation comprising war tax on individuals and increased company tax was imposed to produce £25.000.000 in a full year and £12,000,000 in 1941-42. In May a f u r ther increase was made in sales tax which was primarily intended to give additional revenue of £6.370,000 in 1942-43 but was also expected to realize £600.000 in 1941-42. As a result of these taxation increases, the revenue budget provided £108,635,000 for war purposes, £126,852,000 came from public loans and war savings certificates. £5.596.000 was financed by the temporary use of treasury balances, and the balance of £78,428,000 was provided by means of treasury-bills discounted with the Commonwealth Bank. The estimated revenue for 1941-42, including the taxation imposed after the budget, was £195,827.000. The actual revenue amounted to £210,041,000, or an",15,Return Of Sir Earle Page
22,Mr Chifley (Macquarie,"Treasurer )increase of £14,214,000 above this estimate. The chief items accounting for this insale in April, 1942. Proceeds at £659.000 crease were: customs and excise, £6,881,000; income tax, including wartime company tax, £2,414,000; and business undertakings, £1,456,000. The total receipts from taxation were £179,435,000, which compares with a pre-war taxation of £74,000,000 in .1938-39. Expenditure for purposes other than war was estimated at £103,455,000. The actual expenditure proved to be £101,406,000, or £2,049,000 less than the estimate. Details of the actual revenue and expenditure compared with the Estimates will be found in Table 1. Loan Transactions and Public Debt. Three war loans were raised in Australia during the year, the total amount subscribed being £119.873,000. In addition, a conversion operation was undertaken to deal with a 4 per cent, loan of £72,610,000, which matured on the 15th November, 1941. Conversions reached the very satisfactory figure of £66,300,000, representing 91 per cent, of the amount outstanding. Non-converters holding £6,310,000 were paid off from the National Debt Sinking Fund. The interest on all these new loans was 2J per cent, for short-term and 3i per cent, for long-term maturities. The large amount subscribed to war loans marks an appreciation by the public of tbe enormously increased needs of war finance, particularly since Japan came into tbe field. In the previous year approximately £84.000,000 was raised by public loans, and that, with the help of the trading banks, whilst in 1941-42 I without such help just on £120,000,000 was raised in addition to the conversion of over £66,000,000. Sales of war savings certificates during large increase because of the higher rates the year fell below the total of the previous year. amounted to a face value of £13,194,000,' bringing the total since tbe inception of the scheme to £35,706,000. Sales of war savings stamps amounted to an additional £121,000. Interest-free loans of £540,000 and gifts of £397,000 also were received, bringing the totals to the end of -Tune from these two sources to £6,055,000 and £1,374,000, respectively. National savings bonds bearing interest at 3 per cent, were placed on continuous were somewhat disappointing. The operations of the National Debt Sinking Fund for redemption of Commonwealth and States' debts continued on a satisfactory and increasing scale. During the year £14,647,000 wa3 provided, and in the current year it is expected that £16,S00,000 will be available for this purpose. The aggregate debt of the Commonwealth and the States at the 30th June. 1942, reached £1,629,000,000, being £718,000,000 for the Commonwealth, and £911,000,000 for the .States. The increase of £203,000,000 for the year is due to the war. The States' debt decreased during the year, due to the operations of the sinking fund and the fact that no public loans were raised for the States in 1941-42. State loan expenditure for tbe year was partly financed from the cash balances held by the States. Revenue for 1942-43, with present rates of taxation, is estimated at £235,881,000, an increase of £25,S40,000 over the collections of last year. The changes bringing about this nel increase are practically confined to four sources of revenue. Income tax, including war-time company tax, is estimated at £106,326,000, an increase of £28,762,000. This increase is mostly accounted for by the higher level of incomes and by the increased rates imposed last December operating over a full year. The uniform tax scheme passed in June will also contribute to the increase. Sales tax, which last year returned £26,830,000, would normally be expected to show a imposed last May. The volume of sales Certificates taken up will, however, be greatly reduced by rationing and the yield for this year i estimated at £30,000,000, an increase of only £3,170,000. On the other hand, customs and excise, because of import restrictions and shipping difficulties, is expected to return £6,780,000 less than last year. Gold tax is also expected to decline by £580,000 because of manpower restrictions. Taxation from all sources is estimated at £179,435,000 last year. The remainder of our revenue, which comes from business undertakings and miscellaneous services, is estimated at £30,689,000, which is about the same as last year. Detailed comparisons will be found in Table No. 2. In order not to obscure the comparison with last year I have deliberately omitted reference to a new item which will now appear in our accounts for the first time. I refer to that portion of income tax collections which will be received under the uniform tax plan and paid to the States as compensation. This will add £27,174,000 to income tax revenue, but there will be a corresponding addition to the payments side of the ledger. In addition, we shall collect this year on behalf of the States, £6,315,000 of arrears of State income taxes which with £27,174,000 mentioned above will make up the statutory payments. Uniform Income Tax Plan. This brings me to an event of outstanding importance in the financial history of Australia-the uniform tax plan. Although the legislation giving effect to the plan was only recently passed by this Parliament I consider it appropriate that it should be mentioned in the budget speech. The uniform tax plan will replace the former multiple taxing systems of the Commonwealth and the States, and will operate for the duration of the war and one year thereafter. It was implemented by four acts, viz., Income Tax (War-time Arrangements) Act 1942, States Grants (Reimbursement) Act 1942, Income Tax Assessment Act 1942, and the Income Tax Act 1942. The plan involves the imposition by the Commonwealth of a tax upon income to replace those taxes previously imposed by-the Commonwealth and each of the States. The Commonwealth will be the sole income taxing authority and will now collect income tax revenue formerly collected by the States in addition to it? £8,0S6,000 over the actual expenditure own taxes. In consideration of the States vacating the field, the Commonwealth will pay yearly to each State equivalent to the average of that State's Mr Chifley. collections from income tax for the £205,192,000, compared with financial years 1939-40 and 1940-41. The grants are as follows:£ New South Wales 15,356,000 Victoria .. G,517,000 Queensland .. 5,821,000 South Australia .. 2,361,000 Western Australia .. 2,546,000 Tasmania 888,000 Total .. 33,489,000 In the Income Tax Assessment Act 1942, it was provided that the Commonwealth should have priority over the States in the collection of income tax during the period of operation of the plan. The income tax law was also altered to preserve to the general body of taxpayers substantially the same concessions as they previously enjoyed under the income tax laws of the Commonwealth and the States. It is perhaps not inappropriate to record here the challenge made by four of the States to the validity of the legisla tion. The Full High Court of Australia in July upheld the validity of th*. legislation. All the States have since intimated to the Commonwealth their willingness to vacate the income tax field during the period of the operation of the plan, and the Government is now proceeding as speedily as possible towards the completion of the requisite arrangements with the States to enable the plan to operate effectively during the present financial year. The operation of the plan will greatly simplify the work of both the public and the Taxation Department, it will save man-power, and it will preserve to the Commonwealth for war purposes the increase in the taxable field which follows the expansion of war expenditure. WAR) 1942-43. It is anticipated that total expenditure for purposes other than war will amount to £109,492,000, an increase of last year; of this amount, £5,546,000 is on account of social services to which I shall refer briefly in a moment; and compensation £1,027,000 represents that portion of Post Office works which last year was provided from loan, but which has now been included in the Revenue Estimates. The balance of £1,513,000 is the net result of variations on all other items, details of which w ill be found in Table No. 3. Invalid and Old-age Pensions. In my financial statement of last OctoberI outlined the Government's proposals relating to invalid and old-age pensions. The proposal to increase the maximum rate to 23s. Cd. a week became effective in December. Further legislation was passed in May embodying the remainder of the proposals and also increasing the maximum rate of pension to 25s. a week. This rate is subject to variation in accorances for 1942-43 is £375,000. Last year dance with movements of the retail prices index, but it cannot be reduced below 25s. without parliamentary approval. accordance with the recent rise in retail prices the rate will be increased to 25s. 6d. a week on the 1st October next. Other important concessions appro%-ed in May relate to the increase of permissible income for a blind person, pensioners in hospital, extension of pension benefits to aborigines, and the liberalization of the provisions regarding maintenance by relatives. The total cost of the new benefits provided by fhe act as amended will be £925,000 this year. Allowing for a normal increase of the number of pensioners and the cost of living increase fro m the 1st October, 1942, the total cost of pensions in 1942-43 is estimated at £22,400,000. Last year the actual cost was £19,257,000. Widows' The Widows' Pensions Act which became law in June marks another step towards the fulfilment of the Government's plans for social security. The act provides for the payment, subject to a means test, of pensions and allowances to widows over 50 years of age, widows with dependent children, and, for a limited period, to widows under 50 yea -s of age and without dependent children, who find themselves in necessitous circumstances upon the death of their husbands. About 30,000 widows w ill receive heip under the scheme, and the cost for this year is estimated at £1,630,000. Child Endowment. Child endowment in its first year of operation cost £11,303,000. Now that i i is f u l l y established, the cost for a complete year is estimated at £12,060,000, or £757,000 above the actual cost of la.^t year. Maternity Allowance. The Maternity Allowance Act has also been amended in two directions. Tbe provisions regarding assessment ot income have been liberalized by disregarding any earnings of the mother prior to her marriage. Benefits have also been extended to aboriginal native.? of Australia. The estimated cost of maternity allowthe actual cost was £359,000. In Grants to Stales. Special grants to certain States will be made in accordance with tbe ninth report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission, which has been tabled for the information of honourable members. The payments recommended compare with those for the previous year as follows:11)41-42. 1942-4.'?. £ £ South Australia .. 1,150,000 SOO.OOO Western Australia 030,000 SOO.OOO Tasmania .. 520.000 575,000 2,300,000 2,175.000 In the opinion of the commission, the grants calculated in the usual manner on the basis of past budgetary results for South Australia and Western Australia, which would normally have been Pensions. recommended, are in excess of current requirements by reason of the improved revenue position in those States. There is inevitably a time lag between the year upon which the calculations are based, and the year for which the grant.? are recommended. The amounts recommended by the commission for thoje States have therefore been arrived at hy deducting from the normal grant £670,000 in the case of South Australia, and £170,000 in the case of Western Australia. The commission recommends that payment of these amounts be deferred until next year. On the other hand, the amount of £S00.000 recommended for South Australia, include? the sum of £250,000, whicli was deferred for similar reasons last year. The Government will shortly introduce legislation t i give effect to the recommendations of the Grants Commission. Wheat Industry. After reviewing plans which had been implemented for the stabilization of the wheat industry, the Government decided that the principle of control of acreage through the existing machinery should h maintained. However, it was considered that certain amendments should be introduced to apply to the 1942-43 wheat crop. The plan for the 1942-43 crop provides that the wheat-grower shall receive 4s. net a bushel, bagged basis, at sidings on wheat produced by him up to the first 3.000 bushels. The return to the small wheat-farmei will be substantially increased as the basis of payment for the 1942-43 crop represents an increase of approximately Is. a bushel for wheat produced within the quota of 3,000 bushels. Wheat produced by a grower above the 3,000-bushel quota will be placed in the pool in the normal way and the grower will receive a just price on realization. However, as the marketing of this wheat may be delayed the Government intends to make an advance against it at the rate of 2s. a bushel net at growers' sidings. This plan for the forthcoming harvest is to be regarded as a war-time measure suitable to the war-time needs of the industry, just as the wool purchase scheme, and other marketing plans for other commodities, meetfehewar-time needs of the industries concerned. About £27,500,000 will be required to meet the guaranteed price for quota wheat and the 2s. advance on the balance. It is anticipated that approximately £9,500.000 will be received from local sales, leaving a deficiency of about £18,000,000 until export sales are made. T nfortunately, the prospects of substanr tial export sales in the near future are not good, and the Government may have to face a substantial loss in connection with the schemr. Loan Council Programme. At the meeting of the Loan Council held on the 11th August a borrowing proMr Chitley. gramme of £7,328,000 for State works was approved. This provides for a gross spending programme of £11,416,000, about two-thirds of which is directly or indirectly related to the war effort. The only amount included for the Commonwealth is £150,000 to be raised on behalf of the States for Farmers' Debt Adjustment. Actual expenditure for all governments in 1941-42 was £15,524,000, including £1,200,000 by the Commonwealth on Post Ofiice works. In addition to the governmental programme, £1,524,750 was approved for local and semi-government bodies. I now come to the key item-wa r ex7 penditure. The estimate for 1942-43 is £440,000,000-£390,000,00 0 in Australia and £50,000,000 overseas. This is an increase of £120,000,000 over actual expenditure last year. The estimate is based on the current level of expenditure, with provision for known commitments. And in spite of its size, I must warn honourable members that the experience of last year may be repeated, and the figure exceeded as a result of the dire necessities of tlie grim struggle that lies ahead. For security reasons the usual detailed "" Estimates of Expenditure "" for Service Departments are not being given this year. The amounts for the Departments of Navy, Army, Air, Munitions, and Aircraft Production have been grouped and shown in one amount only, namely, £415,000,000. The usual details of other items, which aggregate £25,000,000, have been shown. The estimate does not include war equipment, &c, which will be received from the United States of America on lend-lease terms. On the other hand it does include a very substantial sum for the provision of supplies, services, &c, to American forces in Australia. This is known as reciprocal aid. Negotiations have been proceeding between the United States of America and Australia to place the provision of lend-lease by the United States of America and reciprocal aid by Australia on a formal basis, and it is. expected that an announcement will be made shortly. Pay of Members of the Forces. The Government is very conscious of the obligations of the country to members of the fighting forces. In October last, provision was made for increases of the pay of members and their dependants. The active pay of all members on special force rates of pay and of the Royal Australian Naval (Sea-going) Forces was then raised by Is. a day. The allowance for a wife was increased by 6d. a day and for a second child by 6d. a day. In March, deferred pay was granted to members of the Royal Australian Air Force and the Australian Military Forces serving in Australia after six months' service. After careful consideration the Government has decided to grant further increases in the basic rates of pay and allowances. The new scale provides for an increase of 6d. a day in the active pay of male members on special force or naval (sea-going) rates of pay and 4'd. a day in the active pay of members of the women's auxiliary services. The allowance for a wife is raised by Is. a day and for the first child by 6d. a day. These increases came into effect last month. A private soldier without dependants will now receive active pay of 45s. 6d. a week compared with 35s. in October, 1941, before the present Governm'eut came into office. A married private, after deduction of the compulsory allotment of 3s. 6d. a day, will receive 21s. a week, compared with 14s. in October, 1941. The weekly amounts received by the dependants of a private or non-commissioned officer who has made the standard allotment compare as follows:October, August, 1941. 1942. *. d. s. d. Wife only Wife and one child Wife mid two children.. 70 0 Wife and three children 80 6 Thus the total military income of a and 1942-43 is the first year in which family consisting of a private soldier their full effect could be realized. The with a wife and two children has inadditional amount estimated to be colcreased from 84s. to 112s. since October, lected last year was £33,200,000, but 1941. In addition, 14s. a week deferred pay full year were much greater, viz., accrues after six months' service, and in £58,520,000. Details are given in the common with other members of the comfollowing table which shows the yields munity each soldier's family receives child endowment of os. a week for each child after the first. In comparing the income of the family of a member of the forces with that of a civilian one should remember that food, clothing, accommodation and medical attention in the case of a married civilian have to be met from his pay, whereas these items are naturally provided to the married member of the forces. The latest increases will involve additional expenditure at the rate of £10,500,000 a year. Overseas War Expenditure. Our capacity to finance our overseas war expenditure depends upon the level of our London funds. In 1941-42 we financed £47,000,000 of overseas war expenditure, mainly out of current international receipts, but we had to draw on accumulated reserves to some extent. The Government's policy is to meet each year as much of our overseas obligations as the level of our international reserves permits. Under an arrangement made with the Chancellor of the Exchequer by my colleague, the Attorney-General, obligations which we cannot currently meet will be postponed for consideration after the war. It is impossible to forecast our trade balance with any certainty, but there is a fair prospect that we shall be able to finance out of current receipts about £50,000,000 of overseas war expenditure for 1942-43. Before dealing with new taxation proposals it is necessary to keep in mind that in the last financial year the Govern42 0 56 0 ment imposed additional taxation on no 59 fi 77 0 less than three occasions, viz., October. 91 0 December and May. Some of these taxes 101 6 could only operate for a part of last year, the estimated additional collections for a for 1941-42, and for a full year as estimated at the time the proposals were brought down:NTJiW TAXATION IMPOSED BY PRESENT Estimated Estimated 1041-42.

This has naturally been taken into consideration by the Government in connection with the further proposals now submitted. Concessions to Members of the Forces. As has been already announced the Government proposes to grant further taxation concessions to members of the forces. All members whose civil and military income is less than £250 a year are to be exempt from income tax. This means that members with an income in 1941-42 equal to or less than that of an army sergeant will be exempt from income tax in 1942-43. Incomes below that of an army commissioned officer wilT receive some tax concession compared with the civilian, because of the necessity for graduating the tax in order to avoid anomalies. These concessions will cost £1,000,000 in 1942-43. Income from Gold-mining. In view of the difficult position m which the gold-mining industry has been placed the Government has decided not to impose the uniform income tax on income from gold-mining. The existing gold tax based on production will be continued. Mr Ohifley. Entertainments Tax. The Government proposes to re-enter the entertainments tax field, which was one of the sources from which revenue was obtained during the 1914-18 war. After the last war ended the CommonRevenue Revenue wealth progressively relinquished this £000. £000. vacating the field in 1933 and leaving it wholly to the States to assist them in 14,400 28,900 their recovery from the depression. 3,200 3,800 At the present time all 'State govern650 ments, except Queensland, impose tax ""250 500 upon admissions to entertainments, but 500 500 they have agreed to suspend their legisla43,350 tion in this respect for the duration of the war and one year after. The Commonwealth has agreed to compensate the 2,500 9,670 States so doing upon the basis of the 1,500 2,000 revenue formerly derived by them. The Commonwealth expects to obtain 15,170 in a full year from its levy a gross re33,200 58,520 turn of about £3,250,000, out of which compensation will be paid to the States amounting to about £750,000, leaving a net revenue to the Commonwealth of about £2,500,000. For the current year the yield is expected to approximate £2,400,000 gross, and the compensation to be paid to the States, if the tax commences on the 1st October, 1942, will amount to £600,000, leaving a net revenue to the Commonwealth for the year of £1,800,000. The rates proposed commence at 3d. on admission charges of Is. and increase by 2d. for every sixpence by which the admission charge exceeds Is. up to 5s. Above 5s. the increase is 3d. for every 6d. by which the admission charge exceeds 5s. There will be a reduced scale of rates, approximating 25 per cent, below the general rate, which will apply to entertainments such as theatres, concerts, ballets, vaudevilles, &c, where the actors or performers are present in person. Customs and Excise. Certain increases of customs and excise are proposed. Details will be given tthe committee at a later stage. Pro posals will yield an additional revenue j f £12,000,000 in 1942-4)3, and £14,200,000 in a full year. These new taxes will bring the total additional taxation imposed by this Government to an annual value of an amount of £27,174,000 which is to be approximately £75,000,000. Taxation has been trebled since the the uniform tax plan and, together last pre-war year. It has grown from with an estimated £6,315,000 of outstand£74,000,000 to £221,000,000. The growth ing States' taxes to be collected, will bring year by year shows some interesting the payments to the 'States under that figures which I now give, distinguishing plan to the statutory figure of approxibetween direct and indirect taxationDirect Indirect £m. 1938-39 (pro-war) . . 1939-40 . . 1940-41 . . 1941-42 . . 1942-43 (estimate) * Includes war postage tax and telephone charges. This striking change in the relative importance of direct and indirect taxation is undoubtedly an improvement in fiscal policy. Direct taxation is to be preferred to indirect taxation, because the burden falls directly on the taxpayer, and the repercussions on costs and prices are far less than in the case of indirect taxation. I have now dealt with the anticipated expenditure for the current year and the taxation proposals of the Government. In order to present a clear picture of our financial problem, I now summarize the Estimates of Eevenue and Expenditure, taking into account the proposed taxation increases1941-12. 1942-43. Increase.

Thus honourable members will see that, £m. £m. in spite of the large increases of taxation 15 59 74 22 68 90 imposed since this Government came into 50 75 125 office, revenue in the current financial 94 87* 181 year, while providing £140,000,000 to125 96* 221 wards war expenditure, falls far short of the £440,000,000 required. The problem then is to find ways and means of providing the balance of £300,000,000. To appreciate the significance of this gigantic task we must examine the degree to which the Government has had to draw upon the nation's resources of manpower, factory capacity and raw materials and the methods which have been adopted. For the first two years of the war we were able to avoid entrenching on civilian consumption to any great degree. It took time to lay the foundations of our war machine, and we were able to draw on our stocks and unemployed resources. But in the third year of the war, with no reserves to draw upon, we added to the war effort as much as was accomplished in the two preceding years. To-day, something like half of our man-power Actual. Estimate. is engaged in full-time war work, botli £m. £m. £m. direct and indirect. 180 219 39 Within the past twelve months hun30 30 dreds of thousands of men and thousands 249 39 of women have entered our fighting services.

In 549 128 addition, the American forces in Australia must be provided with many of 211 300 89 these services. All this has necessitated a great transw much of tlic formation in our economic system. The production and use of non-essential goods and services have been prohibited; rigid control of the use of iron, steel, cotton, chemicals, and many other basic materials has been imposed; even many essential goods and services have been severely",16,Financialyear 1941 42
23,Mr Spender,-Ho,23,Budget Summary 1942 43
24,Mr Chifley,"A t least £200,000,000.restricted, and rationing has been extended. Here are some striking illustrations of what has happened: Twelve months ago 25 per cent, of our manpower was engaged in the war effort; to-day 50 per cent, is so engaged. Since the Production Executive of Cabinet was established last December more than 300,000 men and more than 50,000 women have been added to war activities. Before the war there were 540,000 factory workers in Australia, most of whom were meeting our ordinary peace-time needs. To-day there are 700,000 factory workers, of whom only 200,000 are engaged in civil production. Most of our iron, steel and engineering workers, half of our textile and clothing workers, almost all our building tradesmen, a large part of our transport workers, and thousands of workers in other trades, are now devoting their energies to war work of one kind or another. Civilian building has been reduced from about £50,000,000 a year to about £5,000,000; within the last twelve months production of civilian clothing has been reduced by about £40,000,000. pleasure motoring, and travel and other services-al l these have been cut. That is a brief outline of the position balance of £300,000,000 to be financed in terms of man-power and materials. It is by no means the final development of the war effort, and we must devote still more men, still more factories, and still more materials to war purposes. This explains our increase of war expenditure by £120,000,000 to the huge total of £440,000,000 in the current year. As we add more and more men and women to the large numbers engaged in war work, wo subtract them from tbi already reduced numbers engaged in producing goods for civilian consumption. Buti f our financial and economic system is to be kept in balance we must transfer the spending of incomes from civil consumption to war expenditure in approximately the same proportion as we have transferred man-power from pursuits of peace to pursuits of war. Owing to the great increase of employproduction, would increase purchasing ment and economic activity, incomes have expanded and spending power in the hands of the people is now at a rate greatly in excess of the flow of goods and supply of goods for civil consumption services that the nation can spare for it? not only creates the danger of inflation, If r . Ohifley. civil needs. The Government cannot allow this excess spending power to compete against the nation for the additional man-power and materials that are vital to our defence, or to bid up for the limited goods that are available for civil use, or to operate in "" black"" markets and so menace price stability. The Government is determined on this and will take such measures as may be necessary to impose its will. But whatever direct controls are established for this purpose, the excess spending power must be transferred to the Government in order to pay the fighting forces and for the labour and materials used in producing munitions and war supplies. This is the financial price which must be paid. Whilst relying to a large degree on the voluntary efforts of the people, the Government is resolved that its payment shall not be evaded. Effort and sacrifice of comfort by the civil population is the least part of the price. Many of those in the forces, many of the nation's sons, pay the supreme price of all. No financial price compares with that. Liquor, tobacco, In the current year, taxation will provide £140,000,000 towards our war expenditure of £440,000,000, leaving a by loans. Taxation and loans are the means by which the excess spending power in the hands of the people is transferred to the nation to meet war expenditure. There are some people who think that the war should be financed entirely by central bank credit. The Government is convinced that in that way lies grave danger. I have shown that we have already drawn on practically all our reserves of labour and equipment, and that the recent expansion of the war effort has been achieved by subtraction from peacetime production. I have made it clear that the further expansion of war activity means further reductions of tbe things that will remain for civil use. Expansion of bank credit, therefore, without a corresponding capacity to expand power without increasing the supply of goods and services. Increasing the volume of money without increasing the but also sets up serious competition bs tween demands for civil goods and demands for war requirements. Clearly, then, as further physical resources are provided by tbe nation for war, so must further financial resources be similarly provided from the savings of the people. This can be done only if every individual saves and contributes to the utmost of his capacity. The amount of loans required this year is large, but its provision is not impossible. Last year we doubled the receipts from public loans, and got £120,000,000. If we double them again we shall get £240,000,000, which will take us a long way on our journey. It will leave £60,000,000 to he provided from savings bonds and savings certificates. This is about the British rate of contributions to small savings, and with our higher wages should be capable of accomplishment. At the same time, the Government will of necessity have to continue to carry out unflinchingly its policy of prohibitions and restrictions on civil services. This will inevitably reduce the avenues for spending by each individual, and will make it easier for every body to contribute to the loans. It will mean a year of real austerity for all of us; the spending of every shilling must be watched, and avoided whenever possible. We must apply a very severe standard in judging what is necessary. The Government will, of course, indicate the directions in which its surplus investible funds a3 directed savings should be made. That is the purpose of the Government's austerity campaign, which will be launched to-morrow. The Government realizes that it i? placing a great responsibility on eacli individual. It is convinced, however, that given the opportunity the Australian community can realistically appreciate the necessities of the present emergency and make whatever financial sacrifices are necessary to ensure that the vigour of our financial efforts will be just as great as that of our fighting efforts. It is appropriate here to mention some figure of approximately 4 per cent. other items of the Government's policy for the current year. Mortgage Bank. The establishment of a mortgage bank fix maximum rates of interest in respect has been approved by the Government, of certain classes of loans and deposits. and a bill will be brought down at an early date. It is proposed that the operations of the mortgage bank shall be carried out by a new department of the Commonwealth Bank. The Government hopes that the mortgage bank will influence other lending institutions and mortgagees to reduce rates of interest on mortgages to primary producers. Banking Policy. In my financial statement in October last, I outlined the Government's policy for war-time control of banking. This policy has been embodied in National Security (War-time Banking Control) Eegulations, which came into operation on the 26th November, 1941, and National .Security (Economic Organization) Regulations issued on the 19th February, 1942. Under the November regulations, the business of banking may not be carried on in Australia without the authority of the Treasurer. Trading banks, in making advances, are required to comply with the policy laid down by the Commonwealth Bank. They may not subscribe to public loans or purchase securities without the concurrence of the Commonwealth Bank. To prevent the increased deposits coming to the banks as the result of war expenditure being used as a basis for further credit expansion, each trading bank is required to lodge with the Commonwealth Bank such part of by the bank in accordance with a plan approved by the Treasurer. At the 30th June, 1942, the total amount held by all banks in war-time deposit accounts with the Commonwealth Bank was £37,000,000, and the rate paid on these balances to cover administration expenses was less than 1 per cent. It has been a part of the Government's policy to prevent the trading profits of tlie banks from exceeding their pre-war trading profits, and I may add that banking profits last year were about 3 per cent, on shareholders' funds after paying taxation, as compared with the pre-war The February regulations gave to the Commonwealth Bank, subject to any direction of the Treasurer, the power to On the 13th March, the Commonwealth plans to cover the very difficult period of Bank fixed maximum rates of interest transition from war-time to peace-time on bank fixed deposits and overdrafts, conditions. savings bank deposits, and some other types of transactions. In general, the of the Treasurer, the Attorney-General., rates fixed provided reductions of existthe Minister for Labour and National ing rates. I may add that the GovernService, and the Minister for Social Serment has recently issued a regulation vices, has recently given special confixing, except with the approval of the sideration to the whole problem of postTreasurer, a maximum rate of interest war reconstruction. The Government for renewal of first mortgages at 5 pe' has accepted the committee's recomcent., or the pre-existing rate, whichever mendation that it is necessary to invest is the lower. During the year, the field of pric; -nation from the chaos which is likely to control was considerably extended. The result, unless the Commonwealth Parliablanket declaration made on the 15th ment is able to deal with post-war reconApril, 1942, by the Minister for struction on a national basis.

POST-WAR RECONSTRUCTION.

A committee of Ministers, consisting the Commonwealth Parliament with legal powers sufficiently wide to save the work of reconstruction. Broadly, our post-war aim must be Further, we shall have to deal with life, the transfer of munition workers from special war-time occupations '-o housing the people, the question of national insurance, national health, and broadly, the general problem of social and national security in the difficult post-war world. All these projects demand national organization in peace-time as effective and comprehensive as that required by the exigencies of war. It follows that the Commonwealth Parliament must be armed with full powers to carry out this programme of reconstruction. Our Allied leaders have laid down in the broadest terms the nature of the four freedoms for which the United Nations are striving-freedo m of expression, religious freedom, freedom from fear, freedom from want. This Government intends that the objectives shall not be a mere placard but shall be carried into effect. It will, therefore, ask the people of Australia to arm the Commonwealth Parliament with full power to ensure that the four freedoms shall be enjoyed throughout the Commonwealth and its territories. For all these great purposes a special constitutional amendment will be required, and the Government proposes to bring down a bill with that object in view.

(Company) Tax. We must resolutely face the fact that we are engaged in an "" all in "" struggle for our very existence. In that struggle physical resources will be the deciding factor. Those resources must come from the people. They must be used to the fullest capacity, and whatever sacrifice is necessary must be accepted. No legerdemain can produce the needs for war. Neither can they be obtained by easy financial expedients. The plain fact is that we are fighting with all our resources for the very right to commence afresh life as a nation. As this fourth year of war opens we are faced with the sternest struggle that has ever confronted our people. Never before have we been threatened with invasion and forced to meet a direct frontal assault upon the coasts that ring our liberties. Never before have we had need to achieve so much so soon. Never before has the nation sent out such an urgent call to its people. No selfish thought of personal comfort should divert us from the grim task that lies ahead. By vigorous self-denial, everyone can play a useful part in winning the war. The Government calls upon all Australians for a maximum contribution. Revenue. Budget Estimate.

55,Mr Calwell,"I have no time forhalf way through the appeal of one man, and told him that there was no case for him to answer. That man has since been released. The Attorney-General said that a statement would be made to Parliament outlining what the Government intended to do about those who had been interned and released and, presumably, about those who still remain in custody. I am no more associated with the Australia First Movement than I am with the Communist party, but I have the conviction that justice has not been done to many, if not all, of those persons who have been arrested, and action should be taken speedily to satisfy the public mind that nobody is remaining in internment in New South ""Wales, just because he happened to be wrongly interned in the first instance. The position cannot remain as it is. Those persons have to be either brought to trial on the charges levelled against them or released-honor against whom there was little or no ably released-and , if they have been wrongfully arrested, recompensed for whatever legal expenses they have incurred in trying to establish their innomatter until the AttorneyJGeneral has cence. expenses have been enormous. difficulties were placed in the way of their relatives interviewing them or even seeing them. They were held incommunicado for a very considerable period, and, if they have been wrongly dealt with, the Government ought to be prepared to pay compensation to them. At any rate, this method of arrest and internment is a procedure which can have very dangerous consequences. As one who knows something of what happened in the last war, I am particularly desirous that nothing like it shall happen of fact should be responsible for the inin this war, but it is quite possible that ternment of people upon suspicion only. in this waT things will be done even worse than were done then. I hope that at a very early sitting of this Parliament the Attorney-General will make a complete statement of the position, and say explicitly what the Government intends to do in this matter. These cases cannot be allowed to drag on interminably and, if there is no better evidence to justify the internment of the people in New South Wales than there was to secure the conviction of the people in Western Australia, I am satisfied that justice is not being done. At this stage, the Opposition does not desire to debate fully the internment of members of the Australia First Movement, but we understood from a statement in the press that the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) intended to make a ful l statement in the House regarding the various cases which have been heard and the decisions made. statement on that matter. apprehensive. The Minister for the Army( Mr Forde), some months ago, expressed in extravagant language views about members of the Australia First Movement who had been interned. British subjects, evidence to justify their internment, have been kept in prison for four or five months. We do not intend to canvass this made his statement, but we ask for an undertaking that we shall have an express statement in respect of the appeals heard, the grounds upon which the internees were released, and what justification there was for the statement of the Minister for the Army which rather suggested a great conspiracy throughout Australia amongst members of the Australia First Movement against the security of this country, so that Parliament shall have before it the information upon which a .responsible Minister interned British subjects. It is very important, it seems to the Opposition, that, in considering the liberty of the subject, particularly the liberty of a natural born British subject in this country, the responsible Minister in point internments were made on a statement prepared by the Military Intelligence which had the approval of the Deputy Chief of the General Staff.

62,Mr Spender,"As a Minister, Imore concerned as to whether as a responsible Minister, I had interned a person upon sufficient grounds. That is the gist of the matter. I do not debate this. I do not prejudge the Minister. It may be that there were ample grounds on which those people were interned, hut there are two important things to consider, first, the grounds of internment and, secondly, the length of time which elapsed before they were released. I am in complete accord with what the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) has said on this matter, but I say further that, whilst the honourable member for Warringah stated that, the Opposition wanted to know the grounds on whicli members of the Australia First Movement in New South Wales were interned, it is possible that a full disclosure may not be made in open Parliament. reason why tlie grounds for the internment of these people should be revealed in open Parliament. If there is suspicion that any individual is likely to prejudice national security, there is no doubt that he should be interned. suspicion, because the laws of this country have provided a tribunal to which an interned person may appeal to establish the fact that he has not been rightly in this House, he should attempt to interned. If there is the least breath of justify what he said on the occasion resuspicion with regard to a person, considerations of national security dictate that no chances should be taken with him., but he should have the right to appeal to a tribunal, and, if a tribunal recommends, on the evidence placed before it, that he be released, he should be satisfied. military officer's? constituted intelligence and national security organization on whose reports internments are made. The honourable member for Warringah, when Minister for the Army, used that organization to the full. The evidence that is made available to military intelligence and the national security organization is the evidence on which internments are made. WhatI am more concerned about, and what this House should be concerned about, is the statement that was made by the Minister for the Army( Mr Forde) with regard to these internees. I cannot agree with the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) when he sayB that these people should be released, and that they should then be given the right of an open trial. It is impossible, in time of war, to bring into open court every person interned because he thinks his internment is not justified. member for Melbourne suggested that these people should be either released or brought to trial in open court. They cannot be brought to trial in open court, because, if that were done, the whole of the ramifications of national security and military intelligence would be disclosed to those people who wanted to know our under-cover men and our espionage system. There is in existence a tribunal composed of eminent legal men capable of sifting evidence; and, if the evidence placed before the tribunal be sueh as to warrant the release of interned persons, they are released. For national security reasons, the evidence is not given in public. It is unfortunate that the Minister for the Army should have made the statement that he did. From his place ferred to. That is as far as I am prepared to go. I am not in accord with the suggestion that, these men should be brought to open trial. In time of war, many innocent persons suffer; the sufferers are not confined to internees. That is the fortune of war. The Minister has caused suffering to certain persons who may be innocent, and therefore he should attempt to justify his statement. name. the Minister of mentioning names, but his statement caused certain names to be mentioned in this House.

73,Mr Harrison,"I do not accusebeen prejudiced. It is unfortunate that some persons were interned without sufficient evidence being available; but they can now he released only by a tribunal. The point at issue is the responsibility devolving upon the Minister to attempt to justify his statement. There is only one aspect of this case to which I wish to refer. 1 associate myself in general with the remarks of the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr long periods of detention without Calwell) and I dissociate myself with the utmost alacrity and enthusiasm from the observation of the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) that in time of war the homes of decent citizens who are subjects of the Crown may be invaded or they themselves be thrown into prison, even though the place of detention be known by the more euphonious synonym of an internment camp, on the mere suspicion of some person. For my part, I should not be prepared to condemn a dog to his kennel, much less seize a respectable person and imprison him, on the mere suspicion of the honourable member for Wentworth that some offence had been committed. I do not agree that any person should be so treated. When the honourable member for Wentworth says that there are tribunals available for those who are interned, I take this opportunity to say that I fear that the processes of the law in regard to these tribunals are most sluggish in their operation, and that the availability of these tribunals to interned persons is more theoretical than real. I have in mind the case of a person in the city of Melbourne who is well known to me. He is, indeed, a fellow practitioner. He has been seized and placed in an internment camp in another State, apparently on suspicionthere has certainly been no trial-that he has been guilty of some subversive activity. I take leave to have my own suspicions about tlie case, namely, that the action of the authorities is absurd and preposterous. I admit that my view is based on quite insufficient evidence, but I do know the attitude of the gentleman in question towards the charges made against him, and I am sufficiently well acquainted with him to know in a general way what his outlook on international affairs is. I know, also, that he was an accredited candidate at the recent federal elections in a constituency not far removed from my own, and I venture to suspect that he is a decent British subject and an honourable citizen. I take this opportunity publicly to ask the appropriate MinisterI suppose it is the Minister for the Army-that the hearing of such charges before the proper tribunal be expedited, so that men may not be punished in advance of proof by trial. That is the charge which 'the honourable member for Melbourne has made, and which, I believe, expresses a view which is shared generally by members on both sides of the House. At least I hope that it is. It may be that the Minister, because of his multifarious duties, is not aware of the delays that occur. I intend to bring before him the case of the particular person of whom I am speaking. But what applies to him applies equally to others. I am confident that the Minister will not fall weakly into the habit of following the bad example set during the last war, when it was the regular practice of Ministers to quote as their authority the suspicions of certain highly placed military officers with regard to certain individuals, and upon those ex parte statements to deny to citizens, or indeed to aliens, the protection of the laws of this country. My principal object in speaking at this stag' j is to ask that those internees who h a v applied for trial before a tribunal shall have their appeals heard with the greatest possible expedition. It is foreign to our conception of justice to keep men in prison for long periods without trial, either in war-time or at any other time, even when they are suspected of serious offences. I hope, therefore, that those persons who are entitled to trial by a tribunal established for the purpose will be given a speedy trial and not be detained unduly without having been heard in their own defence. -There are some features of this case which have not yet been mentioned.

75,Mr Abbott (New England) [9.43].,"by the military censorship in tlie Liverpool Internment Campf or eighteen days before being sent to me. As a member of Parliament representing the electors, 1 regard that as a gross misuse of the censorship powers, particularly when not one word in the letter was censored. If the representatives of the people are to be treated in that way by the military censorship, I can only say that that censorship needs a thorough overhaul. I shall not say anything regarding what the Minister for the Army( Mr Forde) said about these interned persons. He has explained that he was guided by reports received fro m certain intelligence officers. I remind hi m that because a gentleman is dubbed an "" intelligence officer "" he is not necessarily an intelligent officer. I believe that the Minister has been grossly misled by the reports, but his chief and greatest sin is that he has allowed these people to languish in internment for five months without any proper trial, or without taking any steps to inquire into their condition. that they should have the right to appeal to the tribunal and that any appeal should be heard expeditiously. In the absence of the Attorney-General (Dr. E v a t t ) , the Solicitor-General, Sir George Knowles, promised to do everything possible to expedite the hearing. However, some of the people did not exercise their right of appeal. Of the seven of them who appealed two were recommended for continued internment and five were released. thing to say about the manner in which tbe trial was conducted.

The man was never informed of the charge laid against him. Certain extracts from his writings were read to him. Some of the matter was written before we were at war with Japan, and some of it before we were at war with Germany. The man was cross-examined exhaustively and an attempt was made to force him to admit that certain things he had written were capable of a meaning which he did not intend them to have. He has pleaded that he be given a f a i r trial. I do not ask that the trial be in public, because, undoubtedly, certain disclosures might then be made which should not he published, because of the risk of smashing our security organization.

I feel sure that if the Minister can be convinced that these men are innocent he will override the decision of any of these tribunals. If the statements made by the men that they had not had a fair trial are correct, it is high time that appointed. My second, and more importhey were given a fair trial. I am disinclined to agree with the statement of some honourable members concerning the action of the Minister for the Army (Mx. Eorde) in relation to this matter. I am satisfied that when the Minister made his statement to the House he had chapter and verse for everything that he said. inquiries and they believed the things they reported to the Minister to be true. I cannot see how the present Minister for the Army, or any other Minister, could be expected to make a personal investigation of the accuracy of all reports submitted to him by trusted officers. With due deference to the former Minister for the Army( Mr Spender), I do not think that he would have made any further inquiry into the matter if similar reports had been placed in his hands. My complaint against the Government in relation to these men is that it did not bring them to trial. Persons in Western Australia, who were charged with offences which, on the surface, were much more serious than those charged against the members of the organization in New South Wales, were brought to public trial. The Government could have applied, under the National Security Regulations, for the trial to be held in camera, but it did not do so. I complain, in the first place, that the persons interned in New South Wales were not brought to speedy trial. I do not think that this is the fault of the Minister for the Army, because, with certain representatives of the men who visited Canberra, I interviewed the Minister and he told us that he would do his best to provide an early trial. Unfortunately the tribunals have been very busy, but the work of tribunals of this kind should not be allowed to become congested. If necessary, additional tribunals should be appointed. I accepted the assurance which the Minister for the Army gave several times that everything possible would be done to expedite the hearing of the charges against these people. before anything was done. additional tribunals should have been tant, complaint is that some of the people who have appeared before these tribunals have been absolutely ruined. The prosecution made fierce and determined attempts to ensure that they should be kept in captivity without fair trial. One man who is involved is 73 years of age. He lost his wife not long before he was interned. She was an Italian lady whom he married during the last war, yet he His officials had made was asked in a most brutal way by the prosecutor1 can call him nothing elsewhy he married an Italian woman. Her death a few weeks before he was interned prostrated him with grief. Later he had to be removed from the internment camp to hospital for treatment as the result of the mental shock he had suffered. whether that is so or not, but it is quite likely that he is still interned because he refused to make an application in the terms prescribed. organization like the Australia First Movement? about people who are interned although no charge has been laid against them. charge against them. that although persons charged with much more serious offences in Western Australia were granted an open trial the members of the movement in New South Wales who were interned at the same time have been denied any trial. I do not believe that people who go out into the open to make speeches are of the stuff of which spies and traitors are made. These persons should be given an opportunity to vindicate themselves before a proper tribunal. The Crown should bear the expense of providing legal assistance to such persons, as it duej to persons charged with treason. The legal expenses of one man who appeared before one of these tribunals amounted to 200 guineas.",43,Adjournment Secret Meeting Op Senators An D Zealand Preference Members Days Of Sitting Orde R

106,Mr Spender,"Very promptly.files and reports in the cases of the two men whose appeals failed. I do not want to say that in all cases the recommendations -of the statutory committee must be adopted. That is too rigid a rule. There may be cases in which, after the statutory committee has made a recommendation, it may be the duty of security officers to put further matters before the Minister, in opposition to the tribunal's recommendation either in favour of release, or in favour of the continued detention of an internee. his discretion release an internee against the recommendation of the statutory committee ? matter broadly. When a statutory committee, composed of a barrister who has acted as a member of the Supreme Court Bench, and two other persons specially qualified to be members of such a t r i bunal, is set up, it is in the public in appealed to the statutory committee in terest, and a good general rule, having regard particularly to national security in time of war, to follow the committee's recommendation. I think that the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) will agree with that. Applying that, principle to the interned members of the Australia First Movement, what do we find? The only persons who approached the statutory committee and pursued their appeals, and whose, release was recommended by the tribunal, have been released. Two persons did not pursue their appeals; and they complained of the procedure before the tribunal. Those cases are now being looked into. The honourable member for Bourke( Mr. Blackburn) mentioned a man of letters. I gather that that man does not want to be released. subject to correction-that he prefers to remain in internment rather than to appeal. those men demand a public trial? have just referred was not one of those who demanded a public trial. A t the same time, the fact that no appeal has been made should not necessarily result in continued detention. That case is now being further looked into. I was abroad at the time these persons were interned; but at that time the position of the country from the point of view of security was very serious indeed. Four persons in Western Australia were arrested, and the evidence against them seemed to be cogent. Subsequently, they were charged with conspiracy to assist the Japanese in the event of an invasion of Australia. I am not saying that they were members of the Australia First organization which was formed in New South Wales. member stated in the press that they I am looking at the were not members of the same body. were convicted, one being sentenced to three years' imprisonment, and the other to two years' imprisonment; and two were acquitted. One of the latter Western Australia, which is presided over by a justice of the Supreme Court; and that tribunal's recommendation was against the appellant's release because of serious facts which came out against him at the trial, but fell short of implication in the particular conspiracy charged. As the honourable member for Wlarringah ( Mr Spender) will recognize, the fact of acquittal on a particular charge does not necessarily mean that the accused is notlikely to endanger national security.

Where the matter is doubtful, the Minister's proper course is to refer it further to some independent authority before he takes action on his own responsibility. The principle of the regulations governing internees has nothing to do with criminal offences. It is this: if the Minister is satisfied that the actions of any person are likely to endanger public security, that person may be detained. With the threat of invasion hanging over the country, it is the primary duty of Army and Security officers to protect the country. case of British subjects, however, there is a balancing principle which we must not forget, and that principle has been invoked by every honourable member who has spoken on this subject this evening-the Minister must look carefully at the evidence, and be sure that there is a real danger to public security. when the Minister has before him a report that some person should be interned and no real ground is revealed in the relevant dossier for such .action, such person should be interned.

Our object is to speed up hearings, and to keep their cost as low as possible. The possibility of granting legal aid to appellants will be considered. However, that may be difficult to inaugurate. I assure honourable members that I appreciate their anxiety over these cases. At the same time, there is a supreme duty which the Government cannot surrender, and that is to protect the country. I do not propose to go into any particular case. Some of these people have been adjudged by the committee as not being dangerous to national security. However, the offence charged in the Western Australian oases was a plan or plot to assist the Japanese, if the opportunity offered. At the time the Minister for the Army made his statement, it was not known that there was no guilty association between the four persons who stood their trial in Western Australia and the In the Australia Eirst organization in New South Wales.

The Minister has the right, and it may be his duty, also. men have not appealed? [10.15] -Honorabl e members will feel easier in their minds after hearing the statement of the Attorney-General regarding the intentions of the Government, hut there are certain aspects of the Australia First Movement which leave a doubt regarding the propriety of the action that has been taken. I do not attribute anything wrong to the Minister for the Army( Mr Forde), but I have not been able to understand why he came into this House and made what was obviously a prepared statement regarding the internment of these persons. Hundreds of persons have been interned since the outbreak of war, but Ministers have not seen fit to make statements about them. tions in Parliament about them. the Minister was not bound to answer them. That statement of the Minister was really the root of the whole trouble. Without it, public attention would not have been focused on the matter, and the Government would have been able to deal more expeditiously. General Staff was of the opinion that, in the interests of national security, a statement should be made. that the Minister acted in good faith, but the Minister is of I am still at a loss to understand why the statement was ever made. If further internments should take place, I trust that no statement will be made in this House while cases are sub judice. It is a well established rule in Parliament that no reference should be made to a case while it is before a court of law. In these cases, unfortunately, action without precedent in the history of Parliament was taken by the Minister for the Army. I cannot, understand why the Government handled these cases in one way in Western Australia and differently in New South Wales. In Western Australia, four came out at the trial which was likely to prejudice the security of the Commonwealth. 1 cannot believe that there was any sound reason against the holding of similar trials in the criminal courts of New South Wales, if only the Commonwealth Attorney-General had felt so disposed. It is well to state afresh the fundamental difference between the rights and obligations of enemy aliens in Australian territory and of our own citizens in time of war. Enemy aliens, as a matter of fact, have no rights at all except what we choose to give them. A citizen, on the other hand, has both rights and obligations. If the citizen fails in his obligation-and one of them is loyalty to his country-ther e are laws enough on the Statute Book under which he may be tried and punished. I can understand, of course, that cases may arise in which the character of the person concerned is such that it is wise to keep him under restraint. I know something regarding I had been asked questhe cases of some of the men who have been interned.

141,Mr Archie Cameron,"I believeyears. Another man had a very good record during the last war, yet he is still interned. There are certain aspects of this case which do not leave one in a very happy frame of mind. I believe in the rule of law in this country, but in this and certain other cases there is too great a tendency -to depart from the law and allow laxity to creep in. and not military law. law is much more expeditious and just than is civil law, and much less costly. The prosecutor before a military tribunal has to put the case for as well as against the accused. He has to say what he knows in his favour, which is not the rule in civil courts to-day. If every lawyer had to argue the case in the light of what he believed to be fair and truthful, very different decisions would often be given. This case will not be allowed to rest where it is. It is so extraordinary Wales that they have no association with, that if certain aspects be not cleared up in the speech which the Attorney-General will, I hope, make next week, other parliamentary methods of reaching a satisfactory conclusion will have to be used. I proposed also to deal with the point, raised by the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott). My experience is not so bad as his, although it is somewhat similar. If a citizen of New South Wales has occasion to write to me or to the honourable member for New England, and there is nothing in the letter which should be struck out-and I have never had a word crossed out in any letter I have received-the censor has no right to hold it up. It is his business to pass such letters on at once to honourable members, who have certain responsibilities, not only to their electors, but also to the Commonwealth as a whole, responsibilities which we do not propose to surrender. On that point I agree for once with the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender). As I say, certain aspects of this case must be carefully looked into by the Government, because if the explanation promised be not satisfactory the House will have to reach some understanding in regard to, not only this case, but also the future handling of similar cases. The Prime Minister( Mr CuTtin) knows that I have not agreed with many of the methods employed for a long time past, but I have allowed them to pass without publicly criticizing them. At this stage I leave the case in the bands of the Attorney General, and hope he will be able to produce next week something which will satisfy the House that the Government is alive to the situation and prepared to take it in hand. 110.24] I think that the Attorney General and the House generally will concede that there are some points affecting those interned in this case that are not at all common. In the first place, those who claim to be members of the Australia First Movement in Western Australia would not have the sympathy of any section of the community, and certainly would not be supported by any member of the House, but it has been asserted by those in the movement in New South and do not know, the four people who made the foolish statements in Western Australia. I am not aware which of the internees in New South Wales has been released, but I know something of the president of the movement in that State. If he is still interned I say in the name of British justice that something should be done to assist him to a fair and open trial. I knew him long before he went away as a Rhodes scholar: I know what his activities were on the other side, and since his return to Australia no one can say that he has not lived a. successful and honourable life in the community. He claims that the public statements made in this chamber and published to the world really made him a criminal before he had an opportunity to say anything at all. He claims that he was one of seven among the sixteen internees of the movement who collectively signed a letter addressed to the Minister for the Army( Mr Forde) in the following terms:We the undersigned internees are refraining from appearing before the Advisory Committee established under regulation 26 (2) of the National Security Act because it is a secret tribunal.

144,Mr Bernard Corser (Wide Bay),"exculpated from all suspicion of indictable offence or any offence, and I say further that the Minister for the Army exceeded the powers conferred upon him by the National Security Act in making public statements of his reasons for believing himself to be satisfied to have me interned and to keep me interned without affording me any opportunity of publicly denying or rebutting the said reasons, which were in any case fallacious and absurd, and for the reasons set out herein I say that I am wrongfully and illegally detained, interned and imprisoned. He claims that he is detained contrary to the intention of regulation 26 of the National Security Act, ""which requires that the Minister be properly, reasonably, and correctly satisfied in his mind that a person is guilty before making an order for his detention without trial. He complains that he appears in the records as a guilty person, and is so regarded by the public. He quotes in his letter, which has been sent to each of us, a report in the Sydney Morning Herald of a statement by the Minister for the Army to the following effect:That tlie Solicitor-General had advised that no further action be taken against persons interned in New South Wales until they had taken the opportunity, if they wished, of lodging appeals against their internment. He says that the Minister meant that no charge would be laid against him in a court of law-and been charged-until first interrogated Committee 26 (2) of the National Security tions, and that such interrogation secret of a person suspected or accused of crimes or offences, for the purpose of endeavouring would be used against him in a prosecution or indictment, or to persuade him to incriminate law and practice of the Australian British constitutions and not in conformity with the intention of in enacting the National He submits that to attempt to clear himself in the manner Solicitor-General would be to act to his disadvantage, those associated with him.

I urge the Attorney General, in view of the position that has been created, to give these people a chance to re-establish their names before Parliament and the public, and to clear themselves if they are not guilty. This is a case of much ado about nothing.

160,The Mr Rankin,"The Country partythe Labor party will never achieve. In my opinion, the Minister would be very unwise to interfere with the functioning of the properly constituted tribunal which was appointed to deal with these cases. The chairman, as the result of his legal training, is accustomed to sifting evidence, and has an unbiased mind. the House for such a man. ber for Melbourne would not be my choice. It is essential that in war-time, the interests of a few individuals shall not be set against the safety of the nation. Some people are worrying about the internment of these few cranks, when they should be worrying about the welfare of Australians who have been interned in Japan and Germany, and of our troops who are enduring the rigours of prison camps or who are fighting for our right to exist as a nation. Why .should we waste the time of the House in discussing the internment of a few cranks? himself is delaying the House. as the honourable member for Warringah possibly he would be justified in making that interjection. As a tribunal has been created to hear the appeals of these people against their internment, I say without hesitation that it is absolute rot for us to waste the time of the country in discussing this matter. -The remarks of the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Rankin) indicate that, in his mind, and doubtless in the minds of many other persons, certain individuals have already been prejudged, although no evidence of their guilt has been submitted other than the evidence of their arrest by Military Intelligence. The speech of the honourable member for Bendigo makes it necessary for the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) to have this matter determined with all possible despatch. I have no quarrel with the action of the Minister for the Army( Mr Crown. But no evidence has been preForde), in the first place, in ordering the sented against members of the New South detention of these men. That was his obvious duty, in view of the Japanese menace to Australia. WhatI do take exception to is the manner of the announcement of their arrest, because it prejudiced a fair trial of those citizens. I remind honourable members that any individual might possibly be arrested and imprisoned by the order of the government of the day, just as these men were, without trial, and merely on the advice of Mdlitary Intelligence. I suggest to the Attorney-General that some distinction must be drawn between these cases, and the vast majority of internments. The Minister for the Army announced in this chamber that twenty members of the Australia First Movement had been arrested and that a conspiracy to assassinate certain prominent Australian citizens had been unearthed. Every member of the group who was arrested now carries the stigma of being associated with this assassination plot and with being a party to this conspiracy to overthrow the Commonwealth Government, regardless of whether he belonged to the Western Australian movement or to the New South Wales group. One of the things that seriously disturb those who value liberty and advocate a fair trial for an accused person is that an entirely different procedure was adopted in dealing with those who were arrested in Western Australia and those who were apprehended in New South Wales. One explanation for the differentiation was that more evidence had been collected against the accused in Western Australia. If that were so, it follows that less evidence was available against those who were arrested in New South Wales. Consequently, there was greater justification for taking prompt action to determine whether the members of the New South Wales group should be detained or released. Western Australia was a ""great"" character. He ought to have been in gaol himself. dence against the Western Australian group was pretty sketchy, in view of the record of the principal witness for the Wales group to warrant a verdict that they were parties to the conspiracy. properly constituted tribunal.",50,Adjournment Secret Meeting Op Senators An D Zealand Preference Members Days Of Sitting Orde R

In the meantime, this charge hung over their heads. for the Army inform me whether any citizen of the Commonwealth may be arrested by military officers, and thrown into an internment camp when there is not a tittle of evidence against him? no evidence or reasonable suspicion against him ? arrested on the order of the Minister, detained, and released later after a secret inquiry with a stigma that he is a traitor hanging over the heads of himself and his family. In such circumstances people would naturally wonder by what means he was released. Is that the position that exists? If it is it requires interest the statement should be made; some clarification. I agree that there may be some cases where internment is warranted on the grounds of suspicion, but a person so interned should not be kept in camp for two, three or five months, as were the members of the Australia First Movement, and then released because the suspicions were unwarranted. I sincerely hope that the Attorney General in his statement next week will completely clarify the position for the future. To a degree, I sympathize with the Minister for the Army for having been led in the way he was. I believe that he acted in good faith, but whether he acted in good faith or bad faith, the fact remains that a grave injustice has been done to certain citizens of this Comthroes of war, when there were definite monwealth. You and I and all our friends may be thrown into gaol tomorrow unless the protection of the Commonwealth is accorded to us. for the Army) [10.42] I have listened with great interest to the discussion, and I thank a number of honourable members for the fair and impartial manner in which they have debated this question. I think that the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) has set out the position very fairly, and I shall endeavour not to touch upon the aspects to which he has referred, but I was asked why I made any statement in regard to these internments. I made the statement because several paragraphs had appeared in the newspapers that members of the Australia First Movement had been interned, and because the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Watkins) asked on the 26th MarchWill the Minister for the Army make a statement to the House upon the reported internment of members of the so-called Australia First Movement? In order to make it definite, I should like to know whether it is true that any members of that organization have been interned? After what had appeared in the newscan be papers, I considered it very likely that some question would be asked, and in addition to the report prepared for me by the Director of Military Intelligence for Australia, I telephoned to the Deputy Chief of the General Staff, in Melbourne, and discussed the whole matter with him. He was of opinion that in the national but that it should not be broadcast or cabled overseas; and, consequently, the necessary censorship was applied to meet his wishes. I should like honourable members to bear in mind the atmosphere in Australia at that time, the middle of March, when every one considered that we were in imminent danger of invasion, when there was great apprehension everywhere, and when it was considered necessary to put the interests of the nation first. I should be one of the last members in this House knowingly to take any action that was unfair to any individual, or to deprive him of his freedom or of his rights as a British subject, but when we were in the statements that certain members of the Australia First Movement were engaged in subversive activities and definite recommendations to me as the responsible",51,Adjournment Secret Meeting Op Senators An D Zealand Preference Members Days Of Sitting Orde R

177,Mr Forde (Capricornia,"Ministe rMinister that they should be interned, I felt that it was my duty to approve the recommendation. March the honourable member for Warjingah ( Mr Spender) when speaking on this subject, saidThe entry of Japan into the struggle has made a substantial difference to the degree of proof required before an alien is interned, it seems to me that whereas previously some evidence was required before a person could be kept in internment, now the very least suspicion is sufficient justification for that action. The very least suspicion, he said, was sufficient justification for that action. He adopts a different attitude to-day. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Fadden) moved the adjournment of the House on that, date, no doubt with the f u l l approval of the Opposition, and went a good deal further than the Government would go in regard to internments. The Government's attitude was selective internment after very searching inquiries, and not mass internment. On the 27th March, it was thought that Australia was going .to be invaded. It is all very well to adopt a different attitude when there have been victories in the Coral Sea, at Midway Island and at Milne Bay. Then there is a suggestion of "" to the winds with all these restrictions and precautionary measures "". But this is what the Leader of the Opposition said in this Parliament on the 27th March, 1942The position of enemy aliens should be considered in parallel with the activities of the Australia First Movement. My considered opinion is that(1) Immediate action should be taken by the Government to intern aliens in Australia, excluding nationals of officers that that course was necessary in our allies and friendly nations. (2) Effective measures should be taken to investigate and restrict the activities of female enemy aliens. (3) An independent commissioner should be appointed to inquire into and report upon all naturalization certhat they should be given an early heartificates granted during the last five years. (4) In cases where the commissioner finds any circumstance which he considers suspicious, the person concerned should be interned. ""Suspicious"" is the word he used. There were no half measures. right honourable gentleman was referring to British subjects when he said, "" The fact that they are naturalized is not sufficient for me; I want to have all these cases reviewed for the last five On the 27th years"". There was a general criticism that the Government was not going f a r enough in its internment policy. I admit that there was some division of opinion. The honourable member for In d i ( Mr. McEwen) saidI endorse the action of the Government, and I am prepared to go so far as to say that no suspected person should be released from internment while there remain any grounds of suspicion against him. I was most careful in the course of my statement on the 26th March not to mention any names. The statement was worded in such a way as to indicate clearly that I did not imply that the subversive documents were found on all those who had been interned, but had been found in the possession of certain members of the Australia First Movement. TheM i l it a r y Intelligenee decided as a precautionary measure, in view of certain evidence, to have all members of the Australia First Movement interned. The military authorities had been investigating this matter not for a day or a week, but for several months. The Deputy Chief of the General Staff considered that it was wise to make a statement to warn people that, before associating themselves with any movement, they should assure themselves of its bona fides, and it was not an organization which, under the cloak of a pleasing name, was engaging in subversive activities. A t the time when these men were interned the position was very grave. They had been detained because it was considered by Intelligence the interests of national security. We knew not when our country would be ravaged by the Japanese hordes. As I said at that time, I did not wish 'to prejudge the persons interned, but thought ing. All relevant papers were forwarded to the Solicitor-General who was asked to advise whether prosecutions should be launched against those believed to be involved, and the House was informed of that at the time. In my statement on The the 27th March last I saidFor that reason it is unwise to prejudge cases. There are processes of law open to those who consider that they have been wrongly interned. They are entitled to appeal for release and have their cases heard by a tribunal which has already been constituted. That was the tribunal set up by tbe present member for Warringah when he was Minister for the Army. I believe that he was roundly criticized by the honourable member for Barker( Mr they were interned. On the 26th March Archiie Cameron) in connection with the setting up of some of these tribunals. Under the law as it stands to-day, any body who believes that he has been wrongly interned may apply to a tribunal which has already been constituted. There are two kinds of internment tribunals, one dealing with aliens and the other with British subjects. These are presided over by Supreme Court judges or ex-Supreme Court judges. I set out clearly what the procedure was as explained to me by the Solicitor-General, Sir George Knowles. All of the papers were referred to him, and upon his advice it was decided that the four persons who had been interned in Perth should be indicted. documents had to be examined in Perth and in Sydney. sheets of evidence had to be typed. Proceedings were instituted against the four persons in Western Australia and it was decided on the recommendation of the Solicitor-General that the others should not be prosecuted. a man has been interned does not mean that hp should be prosecuted under the Crimes Act; he should be permitted to appeal to the duly constituted tribunal. Two out of the four Western Australians were found guilty and imprisoned. The honourable member for Warringah knows that. He interned a large number of people when he was Minister for the Army, but he did not prosecute them. He set up a tribunal to hear their appeals in camera. of the discussion in March he said that the slightest suspicion was sufficient to justify internment, but now he protests and suggests that something unfair has been done. I do not desire anything unfair to be done; I merely want justice done. It has been the policy of the present Government, and it was also the policy of the last Government, to intern suspected persons merely as a precautionary measure, to which recourse is had in order to prevent them from taking Mr Forde. action prejudicial to the national interests. Many persons now interned have done nothing for which they could be changed in a court of law, but there were good grounds for deep suspicion. It is to prevent them from taking action that would be prejudicial, to public safety that last I set out the procedure that would have to be adopted by these interned persons in order to have their cases heard by one of the tribunals. On the 2nd June only three of them had failed to appeal. Six of them lodged appeals and subsequently withdrew them. Then others, appealed and their cases were heard. The tribunal recommended that two of the internees be kept in custody and that five of them be discharged. The evidence on which the recommendations for internment were made was very bulky, and the preparation of the cases took some time. Instructions were given by me on several occasions that the work was to be completed Voluminous without delay, even if additional staff had to be engaged. The appeals were Over 3,000 foolscap heard late in June or early in July, and after due consideration the committee made its recommendations. Since then the Attorney-General has been made the Minister responsible for national security, following the appointThe fact that ment of the Director-General of Security, on my recommendation, in March last. A decision was made during the regime of the last Government that there should be a Director-General of Security under the Attorney-<3eneral, and that officer was appointed as the result of a recommendation made by me to the Attorney-General. In addition to the compilation of dossiers in respect of each individual who had been interned, it was necessary to compile a general dossier on At the time the movement which covered 3,000 pages. While this was being compiled work was continued night and day, and no obstacle was put in the way by mc as Minister. Nobody had greater regret than I that it was necessary to intern any member of the so-called Australia First. Movement who was known to be a British subject. I did not know any of them. My only concern was for the security of Australia. I therefore collaborated with the Solicitor^General and urged that the appeal cases be heard with the greatest reasons that I have stated it was not possible to have the cases heard immediately. As the Attorney-General has said, there w ill be a Security conference on Saturday next. A f t e r my consultation with the Attorney-General that conference has been called. It w ill be attended not only by men at the head of M i l it a r y Minister had only one alternative-h e Intelligence but also by those in charge of national security throughout Australia. We should have foremost in our minds the security of this country, but we wish to ensure that every man and woman shall have a f a ir deal. The Japanese were knocking at the door, as it were, at the time those internments were ordered. That was the atmosphere in March last when the honourable member for Warringah said that people should be placed in internment camps if the slightest suspicion rested on them. The Deputy Chief of the General Staff considered that there was ample evidence to j u s t if y the internments of these individuals at the time. I did not wish to preiudge them. As I have said, the machinery was availible early in June to enable them to appeal. All but three of the internees appealed, and certain others withdrew their appeals. I am in favour of the others now appealing-somethin g they should have done months ago. An y action taken by me was taken in the national interest on the recommendation of the highest military authority. orable member's time has expired. Some time ago I interested myself in this matter with a view to obtaining some finality in regard to the internment of these people. I am not interested in them or in their movement, but I am concerned that a Labour government, which has always preached the doctrine of fair play, and has stood for British justice, should allow persons to remain in gaol for over six months without a proper trial. It is amazing to think that the Minister for the Army( Mr Forde) should admit that what prompted him to make the charges he did make were, first, that statements had appeared in the press regarding these people secondly, Australia's imminent danger at the time. questions in this House. ments in newspapers or the danger confronting this country should cause a Labour Minister to interfere with the freedom of the people. A t the time when he made his statement to the House the should not have allowed these people to languish in gaol without a trial, but he should have arranged for their speedy trial. If there was any justification for his statement on that occasion that was all the more reason why the persons concerned should have been brought to t r i a l without delay. In reply to a question asked by the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Watkins) on the 26th March last, the Minister saidDocuments and papers which have been seized purport to show that certain people in Australia intended to make contact with the Japanese army at the moment of an invasion of Australia. The documents set out deliberate plans for sabotage at vulnerable points in this country, and described methods calculated to make resistance to the Japanese impossible. The graver the danger to the country the greater the reason why these people should have been brought to trial immediately, in order that justice should be done. The Minister's statement on that occasion continuedPlans for the assassination of prominent people are set out. That statement prejudiced the possibility of a fair trial. It is true, as the Minister has said, that two courses are open to these internees: they may be tried before a specially constituted tribunal, or they may be tried under the Crimes Act. On the 27th March, the Minister saidSome British subjects were interned quite recently, and their cases are now under the consideration of the Commonwealth Solicitor General, who will advise the Government as to what action should be taken. We hope to have a report from that gentleman in the neav future, and, under the Crimes Act, those persons against whom it is believed that we have sufficient evidence, will be arraigned before a Supreme Court judge and jury for trial. Now we are told, in effect, that work in and, the Attorney-General's Department proceeds so slowly that after six months the department is not in a position to proceed",52,Adjournment Secret Meeting Op Senators An D Zealand Preference Members Days Of Sitting Orde R

181,Mr Rosevear,"Wot even statewith the trial. I suggest now, as I suggested some time ago, that the real reason is that no charge which may he laid against these persons could succeed before an ordinary criminal tribunal. Certain persons in Western Australia have been tried and sentenced. Is there any reason why the persons in New South Wales who have been interned should not have been tried at the same time, more particularly if they had any real connection with the persons tried in Western Australia? The Minister says that these persons have a tribunal open to them. I suppose that he knows that the methods adopted before that tribunal would not be tolerated in any ordinary court of law. Indeed, it was because some of the internees realized the futility of an appeal from Caesar to Caesar that they withdrew their appeals. This matter having been raised in the Parliament, I hope that the slur which has been cast on the Labour Government will be removed, and that these people will either be brought to trial speedily or released speedily. If we have to depend for their continued internment on the evidence of men like the Crown witness in Western Australia, it is a sad lookout for justice in this country. Under cross-examination, that witness admitted that he was guilty of practically every crime in the calendar. In my opinion, nothing but a public trial of these persons will suffice, because should they be released by a tribunal, the stain on their character will not be erased, whilst should they be released as the result of agitation in this Parliament, it will be said that political pressure was brought to bear. The only proper course open to the Government is to have them tried publicly. If they then cannot clear their names, no penalty is too severe for them. If , however, they are innocent, they should be released and compensated for the injury that has been done to them. Moreover, should they be released because of their innocence, those who were responsible for misinforming the Minister concerning them should be dismissed from the Public Service.

182,Mr Curtin,"On the Sth May, 1942,the uniformity of working conditions and arbitration laws as applying to workers at Glen Davis, arising from the grant of an increase in payment of an isolation or camping allowance. I now desire to inform the honourable member that Mr Morrison, Conciliation Commissioner, was instructed by Judge O'Mara to proceed to Glen Davis to deal with the matter under regulation 15 of the National Security (Industrial Peace) Regulations. On the 27th July, 1942, a conference between representatives of National Oil Proprietary Limited and of fourteen unions was presided over by the Conciliation Commissioner and an agreement was arrived at. The effect of the agreement is that the Is. 6d. a day or 10s. 6d. a week granted by Judge O'Mara on the 4th May, 1942, to metal trades workers camping at Glen Davis is to be extended to all employees except shale-miners, whether or not they live in cubicles, tents or houses, to be known in future as a "" locality "" allowance. The company, on a suggestion by the Conciliation Commissioner, agreed not to make any further deductions of Is. 6d. a man a week for cleaning camp. The shale-miners will still receive the "" special disability allowance"" of 3s. fid. a day or 17s. 6d. a week awarded to them by Judge Drake-Brockman as chairman of the Central Coal Reference Board.",58,Answe R To Question
