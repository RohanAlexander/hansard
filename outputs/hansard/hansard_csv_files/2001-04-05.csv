216,Mr Baird,"to move:Thursday, 5 April 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 26629 Thursday, 5 April 2001 ----Transport: National Strategy me that we do not have a national transport strategy in Australia and that our transport needs are approached very much on an ad hoc basis. This is not helped by the federal system in Australia. Each state seems to have its own priorities, and nothing emphasises this more than the different rail gauges that existed in the early days. It has taken years of effort and millions of dollars to get a somewhat uniform approach to rail, and the jealousies of the states in the early days have cost producers in this country millions of dollars. I am not one of those who argue for a road/rail approach-an either/or process. We need an integrated approach encompassing both road and rail, and implicit in this is that rail must receive proper funding and not be expected to compete against roads, as it were, with one hand tied behind its back. Some years ago the federal government accepted responsibility for some funding under the national highway program, but unless you are on that highway you are disadvantaged in regard to road. The Princes Highway linking Sydney to Melbourne along the South Coast should be declared a road of national importance. Just yesterday, the Prime Minister put a stop to that by saying that such a road would not receive federal funding, so deaths will continue on that road. Local producers will be disadvantaged, while the South Coast and Illawarra again miss out. You will appreciate, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, because of your campaign regarding North Coast roads, that there are more deaths per kilometre on the Princes Highway than there are on the Hume Highway. So there is absolutely no doubt that good roads save lives. Another part of my integrated plan is to have ports linked to the hinterland. ThusI have argued for many years for a replacement road to Macquarie Pass so that the port of Kembla can reach its full potential as an export development port to complement the work that the Port Kembla Corporation has achieved. I call on the Prime Minister and, indeed, the Deputy Prime Minister with his special responsibilities, to adequately fund the Princes Highway and to declare it a road of national importance. The whole Princes Highway network should be a road of national importance. It is good enough for the Sydney to Brisbane route to have two major roads and a railway. On the South Coast, the railway stops at Bomaderry. The only thing we have south of Bomaderry is a narrow deathtrap of a road. It should be adequately funded, because there is no other transport network there. The rail stops at Bomaderry and then you go onto the Princes Highway. I was on the Princes Highway last weekend. It is a narrow, dangerous deathtrap of a road. The statistics show that there are more deaths per kilometre on the Princes Highway than on the Hume Highway.

Inbound tourism is a major source of export earnings for this country. This year, the industry will generate $15.4 billion in export earnings. This industry represents big dollars for our economy. In light of Tourism Sunshine Coast’s support, coupled with intensive lobbying by the Australian Tourist Commission itself, I have chosen to write to the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, and the Minister for Sport and Tourism seeking favourable consideration of the ATC’s request for increased funding in the forthcoming budget. I have not taken that decision lightly, but the tourism industry on the Sunshine Coast is too valuable to the local economy for me not to act upon the concerns of tourism bodies and the community at large. It must be said that, during their 13 years in office, Labor’s attention to the Sunshine Coast and to Australian tourism industries was, to say the least, abysmal. Under Labor, tourism failed to meet its full potential and was undermined by red tape and poor economic management. Clearly, this government, unlike an ex union-organiser dominated Labor Party, contains many members who have a direct understanding-many from experience-of the issues that small business in the tourism industry face on a daily basis. The issue of the Australian Tourist Commission requiring greater funding is of considerable concern to me. That is a message I want Sunshine Coast tourism operators and the Sunshine Coast community to hear clearly today. I am acutely aware that this government is still under pressure to clean up the fiscal mess made by Labor while it lazed on the government benches, but I sincerely hope that the government can find the dollars and cents to make sure that the ATC operates to its full potential and keeps full passenger jets landing at Brisbane International Airport-and, increasingly, on the Sunshine Coast-for many years to come. I also want to briefly comment adversely on the remarks made by Premier Beattie in relation to the $40 million allocated by the Commonwealth government from the Federation Fund to improve the Sunshine Coast roadway access to Brisbane. What a hide, what audacity Premier Beattie has to claim that this money was for Brisbane. I wonder what the Labor candidate for Longman and the new Labor members on the Sunshine Coast would say to Premier Beattie’s denial that this important area rightly deserves the funds allocated by the federal government. Day, Geoffrey and Jane ents-Jane and Geoffrey Day-and Mrs Day’s two children, whom Mrs Day alleges were kidnapped. In May last year, while visiting her parents on Labuan Island off Sarawak in Malaysia, Mrs Day’s children, Alison aged three and Justin aged four, were removed from their mother and detained by her parents. It would appear that this was in response to Jane separating from the children’s father, Hong Kong resident Mr Alan Kwong Lun Chan, and beginning a relationship with Perth nursing assistant Geoffrey Day. This had infuriated her mother. Jane and Geoffrey have since married. In yesterday’s West Australian, Mrs Day told the paper’s Julie Butler that her mother had demanded that she break it off. Mrs Day went on to say: My parents refused to give back my children’s passports and locked them in a safety box, discussions with my family became quite heated, culminating in my parents assaulting me physically and throwing me out of my house. Mrs Day then returned to Perth without the children and has been fighting for their return ever since.

This was the first time in nearly 12 months that the mother had seen her children. They went to the children’s school. The school notified the grandfather and he came and took the children away. If the grandparents take the children to Hong Kong to see the father, the problem is that he may take them to mainland China where the Days will have little chance of bringing the children home, or even of seeing them again. I have been informed by the office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs that they are offering assistance to the Days. I thank and commend them for that effort, and I hope that they will continue to do so. The Days have also called on the Australian community to support them, and I urge them to do so. They hope that by going public other parents may avoid the same plight. The West Australian also reports that in 1999 150 Australian children were involved in abductions, either into or from Australia. I believe we need to do more to address this international dilemma, particularly when we are dealing with children who are Australian citizens and who have been detained overseas against the wishes of a parent. Whilst the grandparents should have access to their grandchildren, the parent should always have precedence. In this case, the father is not in Malaysia-I am informed that he is in Hong Kong-and therefore he is not involved in their upbringing. I also call on the Malaysian government to help prevent the spread of this practice and to facilitate the early return of these children. Health: Organ Donors journment debate about Australia’s organ donation: the fact that some 90 per cent of our countrymen support it but we have a very low donation rate, and the need to encourage contact between the families of donors and recipients. I want to put on the record some comments that I think will encourage families to consider the donation of the organs of their loved ones. I have here an excerpt from a letter from a recipient of donor organs. It says: First let me say how sorry I am for your loss. I of course have no idea how, or in what circumstances your loved one died. It must be difficult at the time of this first Christmas and coming up to the first anniversary when you wonder what might have been ... There are several very beautiful paragraphs in this letter, but I will just go to the one that I think is the most poignant. It says: I also think of your loved one constantly, but clearly in a different light. I think of someone who was so unselfish that they thought of what they could do for others at the time of their death. Such a quality is very rare in this materialistic society but it is a quality that has given me a new lease on life and it is one for which I will be grateful for all of eternity.

I want to talk today about the impact of the GST and the behaviour of major insurance companies on the smash repair industry and small businesses operating in that industry.

224,Mr Emerson (Rankin) (10.00 A.m.),"Yesterday I spoke in parliament about the impact26632 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 5 April 2001 because quite a lot of this industry’s costs are costs of imported items. With the dollar now below US50c, obviously the cost of imported material, such as paint, is now much greater as a result of the depreciation in the dollar. We were told before the GST was introduced that it would increase the value of the dollar. It has done nothing of the sort; the dollar, as we know, is now at an all-time low. In addition to that squeeze as a result of changes to the tax system, there is a squeeze on these small reputable operators within the smash repair industry by insurers themselves. They are forcing the small businesses to absorb the cost increases associated with the falling value of the dollar and also to absorb part of the GST. This is a very similar pattern of behaviour to that of the trucking companies which are squeezing drivers who are under pressure because of the GST and fuel cost increases. Insurers are also directing, in some cases, smash repairers to use non-genuine replacement parts, often without the knowledge of the owners of the vehicles. I call on the insurers to review their behaviour and their abuse of market power over these small and reputable smash repairers. We do not want the fly-by-night operators surviving and the reputable smash repairers going to the wall. The public needs to know what is going on-that is, a deteriorating quality of work, the use of non-genuine replacement parts and ethical operators being squeezed out by unethical behaviour. I link all of these realities to bankruptcy figures that were released just yesterday. In my home state of Queensland, bankruptcies are up to 21½ per cent in the three months to March compared with three months in the previous year. In addition, debt agreements are up by a massive almost 50 per cent. It was forecast by economic modellers that Queensland and Tasmania would be the states most adversely affected by the GST. Those forecasts are now becoming reality. It is not as if the government was not warned: even its own modellers predicted that Queensland and Tasmania would be the most adversely affected states. In Tasmania there was a massive 17.24 per cent increase in bankruptcies in the March quarter compared with the corresponding period for the previous year. Compare that with the Australia wide figure of 13.64 per cent. These are unacceptable figures. They are very high and, unfortunately, they are just as were predicted by economic modellers in the Australian Labor Party. Cook Electorate: Commonwealth Awards for Senior Citizens who received the Commonwealth Senior Recognition Awards. I want to commend them for their fine efforts in looking after senior citizens and for their involvement in the community. The following people were granted awards. The first recipient is Ron Barker, who runs the senior ministry at the Gymea Baptist Church. He oversees Turner Lodge in both an administrative and pastoral sense. Turner Lodge provides aged care places for senior people in our community-something there is a critical shortage of in the Sutherland Shire. Ron’s efforts are extremely valued. Ron is never slow to volunteer for countless tasks and also organises regular meetings and outings for his war veterans’ group. The second recipient was Allan Dunn, who has delivered meals to the residents of Sutherland shire every week for around seven years. He is one of the most consistent and dedicated volunteers of Meals on Wheels. It is not unusual for Allan to do four days a week, and sometimes two deliveries a day, to help out if a volunteer is unable to do their normal rostered day. He also often takes the extra step with clients: doing odd jobs, taking them shopping or on an outing-anything to make their day a little brighter. Allan is also a volunteer driver for the combined caring centres in the shire twice a week, and he still finds the time to visit clients who have gone into nursing home care that do not have regular contact with their family. The third is Albert Hawkes, who has delivered meals to the residents of the Sutherland shire every week since 1992. He is also a member of the management committee of Sutherland Food Services Meals on Wheels. His colleagues describe him as the type of volunteer",123,Representatives Main Committee
225,Mr Baird (Cook) (10.03 A.m.),"I rise today to commend those in the electorate of CookThursday, 5 April 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 26633 who will be the first person to put his hand up to volunteer for anything that needs to be done-from doing the odd maintenance type of job to helping out as an emergency driver at a minute’s notice. Albert is also a member of the New South Wales Police Legacy, where he assists 12 families in the Sutherland shire, and is a voluntary member of the Australian Softball Association Championships. He was also one of the very popular Sydney 2000 Olympic volunteers. Another volunteer is M’Liss Kerz. She is another one doing great work for Meals on Wheels in the shire. She has delivered meals for 26 years and is the type of volunteer who will go out of her way to assist clients in doing the shopping and other small tasks. M’Liss is one of the support group committee members at Meals on Wheels that fundraise to purchase gifts to give to clients for birthdays, Christmas and Easter. M’liss has a long history of selfless volunteer work. She continued working for the Ladies Auxiliary at Port Hacking High School for six years after her own children left the school. Patricia Monk has given years of service to the Cronulla Sutherland War Widows Guild. As many of you will know, the guild provides an important network for widows who lost their husbands while they were serving their country in war. Patricia is currently the president of the Cronulla Sutherland branch and has a position on the New South Wales board of the War Widows Guild. Previously she was vice-president of our local branch for many years. Patricia’s work is extremely highly valued by the members of the guild, both at local and state level. She is very actively involved in fundraising so that they can continue to do their excellent work. Celia Muirson has given long and tireless service to the Sutherland Shire Stroke Recovery Club, which she helped to establish. The club has now been operating at the RSL in Cronulla for around 14 years. It is made up entirely of volunteers, including previous stroke victims, their families and their friends. Stroke patients are referred to the club and then receive vital support with their socialisation and rebuilding their confidence in what can be an extremely distressing period for them. This group provides a service that is simply not available in other parts of Sydney. We are extremely lucky to benefit from the work of Celia and her covolunteers. Albert Peachey is the last member of the excellent group from Meals on Wheels. He has been assisting the senior members of our community by delivering them meals for eight years. He was also nominated because of his preparedness to take the extra step with clients. He gives a great deal of time to the service, often working four days a week, sometimes doing two delivery runs per day or four runs per week. He is involved with the local Cronulla RSL youth club, managing teams and publicity for them in the past 35 years. He was a volunteer driver during the Olympic and Paralympic Games. Marie Renneberg oversees two caring centres for the elderly at Gymea Baptist Church. Among other things, this involves coordinating the other volunteers who work there to ensure there is always someone to do the job. In all, the two caring centres care for around a dozen older Australians, and Marie selflessly gives up a great deal of her own time to ensure that these people are well cared for. Daphne Sheehan is very involved in the St George and Sutherland shire division of Legacy and has also given a great deal of time to the Curranulla Day Care Club. Daphne takes a great deal of personal interest in the ladies that she cares for, which is very important to them as many have little or no family support. Daphne’s generosity of spirit extends to giving up extra time to make home visits to those ladies she cares for. She has even been known to take them away for a brief holiday. Finally, there is Betty Whiffin. She has been an active campaigner on a number of issues over recent years. She has been pushing hard for the rights of elderly and disabled people on 26634 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 5 April 2001 aircraft since well before the recent media attention given to DVT arising from long haul air travel. She has also lobbied on behalf of the Sutherland Shire residents for the funding of the federal television black spots program, and she is an active member of a number of groups. (Time expired) Second Sydney Airport: Badgerys Creek aware of the need to listen to the people we represent. But in today’s political climate the words ‘listening’ and ‘acting’ have significant importance. Following the results in the Western Australian and Queensland elections and the Ryan by-election, the Prime Minister has said that he is listening. We have seen the government backflips on beer, petrol, BAS and Australia Post. All politicians and all political parties are now passionate listeners. To be fair, even prior to these election setbacks, the government has been influenced by public protests over airport proposals at Kurnell and Holsworthy and, indeed, by an earlier airport protest meeting in Western Sydney at Jamieson Park. Most definitely, one of the reasons that the government have not moved to build an airport at Badgerys Creek is to protect their Western Sydney seats. I will give a few reasons why I believe an airport at Badgerys Creek is not acceptable to the general public. One clear indication was that the New South Wales Labor government went into the 1999 state election on an anti Badgerys Creek policy and won in a landslide. The New South Wales government, in its submission to the Commonwealth Minister for the Environment and Heritage concerning the environmental assessment for the proposed second Sydney Airport, stated: The NSW Government is opposed to the development of an airport at Badgerys Creek and favours an airport outside the Sydney basin. The Government is particularly concerned about the impact on the health, environment and quality of life of Western Sydney residents. Furthermore, the Commonwealth continues to ignore the critical issue of funding for off-site infrastructure such as road and rail construction, required to provide for an airport at Badgerys Creek. The EIS fails to assess the likely environmental impacts of the required off-site infrastructure and has underestimated the cost of this infrastructure by about $3 billion. In an independent report titled Sydney Gateways in the 21st Century, prepared by Access Economics, it was stated that a second Sydney airport would eventually be necessary to serve the long-term growth in passenger demand. But passenger demand for Badgerys Creek would only become sufficient to generate positive economic benefits by the year 2020. By this time the population of Western Sydney would be greater than the rest of Sydney combined. Commencing operations prior to 2020 would, according to the report by Access Economics, result in negative economic benefits and require massive taxpayer funded subsidies. Coupled with this local assessment of the economic benefits, or lack thereof, of an airport at Badgerys Creek is the international experience of the operation of second airports in general. The 1985 site selection program gives some very interesting information regarding second airports. Second airports do not take on the role of the primary airport in a city. De Gaulle Airport in Paris is the busiest second airport compared to its dominant partner, with 84 aircraft movements for every 100 at Orly Airport. The site selection program goes on to state: This situation of traffic concentration at primary airports exists despite repeated efforts by many governments to distribute traffic more evenly. It goes on to state: In Washington for example it was expected that 50% of all passengers for the city would pass through the new Washington-Dulles international terminal by 1967, five years after its opening. However more than twenty years after its opening it has 10% of the total traffic. If the Paris ratio, the most favourable overseas figures, are transposed to the Australian context-that is, for every 100 aircraft movements at KSA, 84 would land at Badgerys, and with",124,Representatives Main Committee

A second airport in the Sydney basin is not a viable option, whether on economic, environmental or social grounds. Most importantly, it would not solve the noise problems at KSA. Australian Labor Party: Industrial Relations Policy Computer magazine, much was made of the TLA syndrome affecting the world-the threeletter acronym-and how it sums up some of the worries and frustrations of the general community around the world. Whilst a lot of people in the business community are still coming to grips with a change to their taxation and business approach circumstances brought about by GST and BAS-two three-letter acronyms-the thing that is worrying them most of all is the ALP-another hideous three-letter acronym that is threatening their very survival and viability. You have only to look at what the Australian Labor Party have done in this place in the last week or so, Mr Deputy Speaker. They have voted down, for the 10th time in the Senate, attempts by the government finally to sort out the unfair dismissals provisions within our industrial relations system to allow small business to have the opportunity to arbitrate on who goes and who stays, for a six-month trial period. After that, if it does not work out, a worker moves on. As a result of the ALP’s intervention on this front for the 10th time, small business in my community are unable to hire people. They fear hiring a mistake. In fact, while estimates from this government suggest 50,000 jobs are lying waiting to be created by a more confident and robust small business sector, even the local Southside Chamber of Commerce president in my electorate, Greg Jackson, says he believes that that way underestimates exactly what the potential job creation could be if small business were given the freedom they need to make those decisions to hire and fire. Of course, just last night, the Australian Labor Party, the ALP, invoked their hideous threeletter acronym approach yet again upon the small business sector in my community by voting down the secondary boycott provisions within changes to the Trade Practices Act. So small businesses now face the prospect of getting embroiled in disputes that have absolutely nothing to do with them. It is against that background that the Australian Labor Party need to account to my electorate as to why they are misusing the Commonwealth crest of this country to try to imply, in advertisements in my local paper, the Southern Star, that there is a federal inquiry into business activity statements. The advertisement features the crest, properly placed at the top of the ad. ‘Federal inquiry’ imposes the suggestion that there is something official about it. But when you work your way down to the fine print, you find that submissions are to be sent to Kelvin Thomson, the shadow Assistant Treasurer. It is all about the Australian Labor Party and their politicking in order to try and mislead small business. It is not an inquiry; it is simply a stunt. I think it is an abusive stunt regarding the use of our nation’s symbols, such as the Commonwealth crest. I think it is an abuse of this parliament in implying some sort of officialdom. Yet again, it is another cruel hoax on small business in my electorate. The member for Wills, Mr Kelvin Thomson, on 28 November last year not only was in favour of passing what the government had proposed as far as secondary boycott provisions were concerned but also suggested that these changes were very modest and that more action was needed in this area generally. Yet within minutes of his making that statement, the shadow minister for industrial relations, the member for Brisbane, told the parliament that the Labor Party did not believe that the secondary boycott provisions should be dealt with under",126,Representatives Main Committee

Why did the Labor Party change their minds? Why did members opposite, one after another, come into the parliament and suggest that they were in favour of the provisions that were being put forward by the government, that they were in favour of the findings of the Reid report and the joint committee report into the retail sector in general? Why is it that they turned their backs on the small business community in such a way? Who was on the other end of the phone? In the battle of big versus small business, it is not hard for the small business community in Australia to know who is on their side. They can see it day after day if they look at exactly what has been transpiring in this parliament in the last 10 days alone. The proof is that the Australian Labor Party believe in big business, big unions and big taxation, whilst those on this side of the House-the coalition government side of the House-believe very firmly in the mums, the dads, the individuals who put their house on the line, invest in their own ideas, invest in themselves and create jobs. With 50,000 more jobs standing by to be created, why won’t the Labor Party support the government’s program? (Time expired) Goods and Services Tax: Building Industry us that the GST would improve the economythe Australian dollar and promote investment. Every single one of these claims has now been proved false. The economy is slowing, the dollar is down, full-time jobs are falling, investment is falling, profits are being squeezed and business confidence is sliding. Even in the electorate of the previous speaker, the member for Moreton, small business is suffering. Unemployment in the Northern Territory has risen by about 40 per cent in rough terms, year on year. The Northern Territory building industry has been one of the hardest hit in the nation by this economic downturn that this government has created. The national downturn in new finance commitments in 2000 was 3.3 per cent. In the Northern Territory, it was 19.1 per cent. Residential construction commencements for 1999-2000 in the Northern Territory were down by 22.8 per cent. Residential approvals for February were down 74 per cent on last year’s figures-the lowest on record. This has led, not surprisingly, to the collapse and withdrawal of large building companies within the Territory, leaving many subcontractors and workers out of a job and even unpaid. The Territory is losing a mass of skilled workers and businesses. I will name a few: Bayview Homes, Hansen and Yuncken, Di Mella-gone. The Di Mella Homes collapse has left workers out of pocket by $250,000. I quote from a Northern Territory News article yesterday. You might note the heading: ‘Families hit as builders crash’. The article says: Sub-contractors were owed more than $250,000 by Di Mella Homes from one Palmerston public housing project alone, Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union secretary Joe Gallagher claimed today. Mr Gallagher said it was time the Territory Government properly registered builders to provide protection for sub-contractors. I concur absolutely with the views of Mr Gallagher. One of these workers was a subcontractor, a single mother of two who has not been paid for $15,000 worth of landscaping. An elec-",127,Representatives Main Committee

These are Territory small businesses, suffering as a result of the mismanagement of the Northern Territory economy by the Northern Territory government. This, of course, is on Northern Territory government contracts. The Department of Transport and Works in the Northern Territory is obliged to ensure the fair distribution of contract payment. Subcontractors have made purchases of credit, believing that a government contract is safe. No longer in the Northern Territory is a government contract safe. It is the government’s responsibility to ensure the financial stability of the companies it awards contracts to. There is no reason why the subcontractors working for Di Mella should be left out of pocket as they have been. Hansen and Yuncken have operated in the Territory for 30 years. Two years ago, their turnover was over $30 million. This year, it will be around $11 million. These are the worse economic conditions this company has seen or experienced in the Northern Territory. They will be offering redundancies, staff transfers out of the Territory, and the end of relationships with subcontractors. The fault lies with the government. The aggressive nature of the GST has hit Territorians the hardest. It is simple maths. If you add 10 per cent to the highest price in the country, you pay more tax; and every Territorian knows that when they put their hand in their pocket to make a purchase to participate in building activity they are giving this government, the Treasgiving them if they were living in Sydney or Melbourne. The major accomplice in this, the Treasurer’s and the Prime Minister’s major assistant in this exercise, has been the Northern Territory Chief Minister, Dennis Burke, who has said that he believes that the GST is good for the Territory. No-one in their right mind believes Dennis Burke. No-one in their right mind believes that the GST is good for the Northern Territory. And everyone knows that not only has the GST mugged the Northern Territory economy, as has been stated by the shadow treasurer Mr Crean, but it has in fact king-hit it. National Roads and Motorists Association: Smash Repair Industry the member for Rankin. Once you have actually peeled away some of the ALP political rhetoric that he went on with, he actually made some very fine points about the insurance industry and the smash repair industry. I have recently had cause to have a meeting with several smash repairers, mostly small family businesses, in various towns in my electorate. I might point out that most of those are established family businesses which have contributed for decades to sporting clubs and the strength of their local community. Members would now be aware of some of the difficulties being faced by smash repairers in their dealings recently with insurance companies but especially, can I say, with the NRMA. At the introduction of the GST, the NRMA unilaterally moved to slash the margins received by the repairer doing the work on NRMA insured vehicles. As if this were not enough, they have further embarked on a program to sign up special deals with some smash repairers and to actively discourage clients from using repairers that the NRMA have not made these special arrangements with-repairers that may have had a lot of business with a family over many years. Although they do not refuse to deal with these repairers, all inquiries are, I understand, directed to the repairers who have confidentially agreed to certain extremely stringent price and time conditions set down by the NRMA. The confidentiality of that agreement is one of the key points here, because the repairer is not allowed to discuss with the customer who owns the car the fact that they might be using non-genuine parts or that they might be working to a time frame rather than a quality frame. I am told that this could spell the end for many small businesses, especially in regional areas, who have always relied on high quality work and the use of genuine parts to ensure that consumers are provided with the best possible result on their cars. From the pushing for repairers to reduce the time spent on a vehicle and to use non-genuine parts, the consumer ultimately is",128,Representatives Main Committee

232,Mr Lawler (Parkes) (10.23 A.m.),"It is a pleasure to speak on a similar topic to that of26638 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 5 April 2001 the one who is damaged. My understanding is that the NRMA has also forced those smash repairers who have entered into a deal with the NRMA to provide their own lifetime guarantee, at no cost to the NRMA. This results in shoddy work due to the time constraints and the ability to use non-genuine parts, giving a saving to the insurer but causing the repairer to have the responsibility for the ongoing costs of touching up or making good any faults that subsequently appear. The NRMA has over the years built up a reputation for being a supporter of ordinary people. However, I fear that since its demutualisation, it has become another profit driven monster more concerned about its shareholders than about the people it was originally set up to represent. The level of intimidation has even reached the point where the repairers that I spoke to specifically requested me not to use their name in any correspondence, for fear of the NRMA taking further action against them. I understand the MTA has made several approaches to the state government, but I would like to add my voice to those calling for a fair deal. Tasmania: Regional Medical Services has made the recruitment of doctors in country Tasmania almost impossible. It is hard enough to get doctors to come and practise in Tasmania-yet this government is determined that those who are in the country are unable to get help. In my electorate I have two centres that have recently been reclassified from rural RRMA5 areas for medical provision to urban RRMA1 areas. One is Sorell, covering the south and east coast of Tasmania, and the other is New Norfolk, servicing the Derwent Valley. Apparently these towns are different from Devonportwhich retains its rural classification despite being a bigger town and being within a 10-minute drive of a hospital-and Huonville, which is a similar drive time away from Hobart. This is patently ridiculous. The nearest hospital to these centres is a good 45-minute drive away from both these towns and, unless you break the speed limit, the impact that this reclassification has on medical services has become critical. Doctors in these areas do not just service the townspeople. Both areas stretch out into the rural areas around them and provide a service all over the regions. It is becoming more and more difficult for those doctors to do their jobs, let alone try to cope with new patients. The New Norfolk situation is particularly serious, because one doctor has retired and two others are in their 70s. There are also two doctors who are overseas trained, and the one local who has remained has been run ragged and is almost at the end of his tether as he has lost his two OTDs and, if something is not done soon to help him gain some assistance, he is likely to throw in the sponge. This is another move to get rid of country services. The viability of the hospital, X-ray services, Corumbene, residential units housing ex-Willow Court residents, and Millbrook Rise is dependent on the availability of medical personnel. If doctors cannot work because of the barriers, these services could close. Australian trained doctors are given no incentive to be country doctors, so why would they put themselves into a situation of being overworked, with no time off and very little hope of getting assistance if they have to leave the practice for a short time? Therefore, many doctors still struggling to stay in their communities have opted to attract overseas trained doctors because they are allowed to work only in rural areas. Changing New Norfolk and Sorell to ‘metropolitan’ means that no-one will be prepared to take on such a practice. New Norfolk has now lost four full-time GPs, two as a result of direct federal government intervention. With the current barriers that are in place, there is no chance of these GPs being replaced. I have asked the minister twice for a solution, but I am only getting platitudes. Why was this system changed? Why isn’t the minister prepared to front the issue head-on and give us some proper answers? Main Committee adjourned at 10.30 a.m.",129,Representatives Main Committee
233,Mr Adams (Lyons) (10.26 A.m.),"I wish to point out to the House that this governmentThe following answers to questions were circulated: Canberra Electorate: Nursing Home Spot Checks (Question No. 2072) Ms Ellis asked the Minister for Aged Care, upon notice, on 12 October 2000: (1) Between March 1996 and August 2000, how many spot checks were carried out on nursing homes within the electoral division of Canberra. (2) How many complaints regarding nursing homes within the electoral division of Canberra were received by her in (a) 1996, (b) 1997, (c) 1998, (d) 1999 and (e) 2000. (3) Will spot checks be undertaken by her Department after a nursing home receives accreditation; if so, will they be done on a yearly, half-yearly, quarterly, monthly or random basis. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop-The answer to the honourable member’s question, in accordance with advice provided to me, is as follows: (1) Four spot checks were carried out by the Department on residential aged care facilities in the electoral division of Canberra between March 1996 and March 2001. (2) This information is protected under the Aged Care Act 1997. (3) Yes. Spot checks will be undertaken by the Department on a random basis. Family Court: Counselling Services (Question No. 2107) Ms Livermore asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 1 November 2000: (1) With respect to the recent and anticipated reduction of counselling services operated by the Family Court, how will counselling services which are, or until recently were, provided by the Family Court, be provided in future. (2) How does the Court propose to meet the needs of clients for whom they will no longer be able to offer these services. (3) What role will the community-based not-for-profit organisations, funded to provide counselling services under the Family Law Act, be expected to play in picking up those clients who would have been seen by Court personnel. (4) Where there is more than one community-based not-for-profit organisation which provides such services in a location in which services were previously provided by the Family Court, how will a decision be taken as to which organisation should provide those services. (5) Will these organisations be expected to increase their service levels from within their existing resources. (6) Will the Court be contracting out mediation or counselling services previously delivered by the Court, and what is the process by which such contracts have been, or will be, awarded. (1) The Family Court of Australia (the Court) advises that, over the last two years, it has adopted a strategy of reducing its pre-filing counselling services in line with the development of community based counselling organisations that are able to offer a range of services to clients. The Court continues to work with my Department, the Department of Family and Community Services, community-based not for profit organisations as well as referrers to ensure that clients seeking this service are offered a range of options. The Court is also concerned, particularly in regional areas, to retain a capacity to provide pre-filing counselling. (2) The Court advises that it has for a considerable period been working with community-based, not for profit organisations on joint strategies that would assist appropriate pre-filing clients to access their services. (3) Through the Family Relationships Services Program (FRSP), community-based organisations are funded to provide counselling and mediation services under the Family Law Act. However, it is",130,Representatives Main Committee
234,Mr Williams,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:anticipated that the role of some organisations will expand over time to meet the needs of clients of the Federal Magistrates Service as well as those of the Court. The Court has developed links with the FRSP service providers for client referral where they are able to provide similar services. In metropolitan areas, there are a greater number of community agencies to meet the demand for services. While there will be some capacity in the agencies to absorb additional work generated by the Court referrals, the different counselling and mediation model used by the Court will require different skills. I have recently approved the use of $1.75 million from 1999-00 Budget funds for community organisations in the metropolitan areas where Family Court voluntary counselling services will not be available. This amount will ensure that the community organisations are appropriately equipped to deal with the work formerly undertaken by the Court. My Department, the Family Court, the Department of Family and Community Services and industry representative bodies are working together to ensure a smooth transition of the skills and services from the Court to the community based organisations. (4) In the case of the metropolitan registries serviced by the Court, the Court advises that this issue is being considered in the development of the transition strategy. In all other areas, the Court offers pre-filing counselling clients a choice between the appropriate community organisations available in their location. This is done in consultation with the organisations concerned. (5) Community-based organisations are expected to be flexible in addressing their community’s needs. However, the growing demand for counselling has been recognised by the Government and counselling organisations funded under the FRSP have already received an additional, proportional increase in funds. In the 1999-00 Budget additional funds of $15.7 million over three years were announced for the expansion of primary dispute resolution services. In the 2000-01 financial year, funding will be available for targeted areas where a high need for primary dispute resolution is identified. These measures will result in greater availability of dispute resolution services from community-based organisations. (6) The Court advises that it will continue to provide court ordered counselling and family reports in all its locations. In the Rockhampton area there is a pilot being considered for court ordered counselling, in appropriate cases, to be provided by a number of community-based, not-for-profit organisations. It is proposed that a panel would be established in consultation with the organisations themselves and the local community. This pilot is in response to difficulties the Court has experienced in recruiting and retaining counselling staff in this location. There has been, however, no decision made to proceed with the pilot at this time. Aged Care Facilities: 75 Thames Street Hostel (Question No. 2192) Ms Burke asked the Minister for Aged Care, upon notice, on 29 November 2000: (1) How many complaints to her Department has she received about the 75 Thames Street Hostel since it opened. (2) On what dates were these complaints made and when were they acted upon by her Department. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop-The answer to the honourable member's question, in accordance with advice provided to me, is as follows: (1) Nine. (2) These complaints have all been finalised. Nursing Homes: Budget (Question No. 2217) Dr Theophanous asked the Minister for Aged Care, upon notice, on 5 December 2000: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 1803 (Hansard, 28 November 2000), is she stating that both she and her Department have no data regarding both ethnic-specific and multi-ethnic nursing homes and hostels. (2) If this is the case, how can she allocate the proportion of the Aged Care Budget for people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds in a fair manner which ensures that all communities are provided an equitable level of funding. (3) If this is not the case, can she supply the information as requested in question No. 1803. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop-The answer to the honourable member's question, in accordance with advice provided to me, is as follows: (1) The Department does not have specific data on ethno-specific and multi-ethnic facilities dating back to 1990. (2) and (3) The Department monitors access to residential aged care by using statistics on the proportion of residents from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds in residential aged care facilities compared to the proportion in the population aged 70 and over in Aged Care Planning Regions. Aged Care Facilities: Allandale (Question No. 2224) Mr Fitzgibbon asked the Minister for Aged Care, upon notice, on 6 December 2000: (1) How many beds at the Allandale Aged Care Facility in Cessnock are licensed to accommodate people with (a) high; and (b) low care needs. (2) What sum of Commonwealth funding did the Allandale Aged Care Facility receive in 1999-2000 for (a) high care; (b) low care; and (c) group home residents. (3) Is the Hunter Area Health Service receiving the maximum possible sum of Commonwealth funding for each of the 336 high-care beds at Allandale; if not, why not. (4) Has she or her department held discussions with the Hunter Area Health Service regarding proposals to sell the Allandale facility to the not-for-profit sector. (5) Have the Hunter Area Health Service and her Department agreed to reduce the number of highcare beds at Allandale by 120; if so, to where will the high-care beds go. (6) What mix of high care, low care and hostel beds has the Commonwealth agreed to fund under the Hunter Area Health Service’s proposal to sell Allandale. (7) How much more funding will a not-for-profit provider receive from the Commonwealth over a financial year period than the Hunter Area Health Service receives currently. (8) Has the Commonwealth imposed any condition upon the Hunter Area Health Service which leaves it with no choice but to sell the Allandale Facility. (9) Is the proposed sale likely to lead to a reduction in employment levels at Allandale. (10) Has Allandale now achieved full Commonwealth accreditation; if so, was there any delay in awarding accreditation or were any particular care-standard problems identified throughout the assessment process. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop-The answer to the honourable member's question, in accordance with advice provided to me, is as follows: (1) The approved number of places at Allandale Aged Care Facility is 336 high care places. (2) Total funding for 1999/2000 was $10,551,857.91. (3) Payments of Commonwealth subsidy are based on the assessed support needs (Residential Care Subsidy or “RCS” levels) of residents plus any eligible supplements, as set out by the service provider in monthly payments claim forms sent to the Department. (4) The Department has attended discussions with the Hunter Area Health Service regarding their proposal to sell the Allandale facility to a non-government provider. No sale or transfer of aged care places may occur without the approval of the Secretary of the Department. (5) I am advised that the Hunter Area Service applied in the 2000 Aged Care Approvals Round for restructuring assistance and the Department has allocated 35 residential low care places for the Allandale facility. Other questions should be referred to the Hunter Area Health Service. (6) and (7)I am advised that the Department has not approved any proposal to transfer places from the Allandale facility. (8) No (9) This question should be referred to the Hunter Area Health Service. (10) Allandale has been awarded the maximum three years accreditation. Aged Care Facilities: Fees (Question No. 2290) Mr O’Keefe asked the Minister for Aged Care, upon notice, on 6 February 2001: (1) What is the maximum percentage of Age Pension which can be classified as essential expenditure for the purpose of assessing fees payable in aged care facilities. (2) Does the Government encourage aged care residents to maintain private health insurance cover. (3) Are private health insurance fees regarded as essential expenditure for the purpose of calculating essential expenditure; if not, why not. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop-The answer to the honourable member’s question, in accordance with advice provided to me, is as follows: (1) Fees payable in aged care facilities are determined in accordance with the provisions contained in the Aged Care Act 1997. (2) The decision to take out private health insurance is a personal choice. The Lifetime Health Cover that was introduced in July 2000 includes a special provision for older people. People born on or before 1 July 1934 are not affected by Lifetime Health Cover. They are able to take out hospital cover with a registered health fund at any time in the future and pay a premium with no additional loading for late entry. (3) Private health insurance is generally regarded as a discretionary expense for the purpose of financial hardship assistance as Medicare provides medical services, medicines and acute health care for all Australians. The Commonwealth also provides a range of assistance to assist elderly Australians with their medical costs. These include: funding the residential aged care sector to provide a range of services to residents for no additional charge. These include items such as physiotherapy and podiatry for high care residents that are normally covered by private health insurance. As care recipients already receive these services at no additional charge, many choose not to take out private health insurance; the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and Health Care Card that ensure pensioners receive subsidised health items and pharmaceuticals; and for those care recipients who pay tax, the Medical Expenses Rebate is available where medical expenses, including residential aged care costs, are above $1250 per year. Education: Loans Scheme (Question No. 2336) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on Wednesday, 7 February 2001: Further to the Government’s announcement of a loans scheme for postgraduate courses, (a) will the scheme include scope for an upfront payment with a discount, (b) will the loans be repaid concurrently with HECS repayments and (c) what measures will the Government introduce to ensure that such a scheme does not lead to universities increasing the level of postgraduate fees. (a) Up-front payment arrangements are the responsibility of the individual higher education institution. (b) Yes. (c) It is expected that increased competition for a growing postgraduate coursework market and close community attention to universities’ pricing policies will keep prices within acceptable limits. I",131,Questions On Notice
235,Dr Kemp,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:have asked my Department to monitor the prices charged for postgraduate courses and to report on these annually through the higher education reports. There will not be a cap on the amount each student may borrow each semester. However, I propose to include in the Bill to establish the Scheme provision for the Minister to have discretion to determine a cap on the total level of students’ borrowings. I propose to exercise that authority only if experience indicates a need for a prudent financial limit on student borrowings or for a mechanism to dampen prices being charged. Regional Forest Agreements: Reports (Question No. 2341) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, upon notice, on February 2001: (1) In respect of each signed Regional Forest Agreement (RFA), (a) How many annual progress reports have been received to date by the Commonwealth, and (b) What was the date on which each report was received. (2) In respect of each RFA for which an annual progress report has to date not been received, when does the Commonwealth expect to receive the first annual report from the relevant State Government. (1)(a) Five RFA Regional Forest Agreement (RFA) annual reports have been completed to date, two of which cover more than one RFA region. As all the RFA milestones contain joint commitments, most RFA annual reports finalised to date have been developed jointly by the Commonwealth and the states. The exception is the Tasmanian RFA, for which separate Commonwealth and state reports were developed for 1998 and 1999. A report for 2000 has also been received from Tasmania. For Victoria, joint Commonwealth-state RFA annual reports have been developed for the East Gippsland and the Central Highlands RFAs (combined report for 1998), and the East Gippsland, Central Highlands and North East Victoria RFAs (combined report for 1999). (1)(b) RFA annual reports covering Tasmanian state-only commitments were received in December 1998, December 1999 and February 2001. All other RFA annual reports to date have been developed jointly by the Commonwealth and the states through an iterative process. The 1998 Victorian RFA annual report (covering East Gippsland and the Central Highlands) was agreed between Commonwealth and state officials in April 1999. The 1999 Victorian RFA report (covering East Gippsland, Central Highlands and North East Victoria) was agreed between officials in October 2000. The 1999 Tasmanian and Victorian RFA annual reports were tabled in May 2000 and February 2001 respectively. The 1998 Victorian RFA annual reports, and the 1998 and 2000 Tasmanian reports will be tabled in the near future. (2) First RFA annual reports are due for the Western Australian, Eden, North East NSW, West Victoria and Gippsland RFAs. To avoid duplication of effort, RFA annual reports have been combined and/or compiled simultaneously with other state reporting requirements. In some instances, this will result in the first RFA reports being delayed. For the Eden and North East NSW RFAs, the reports are now scheduled for completion in March 2001. Joint Commonwealth-state reports for 2000 are currently being finalised for the Western Australian RFA and all five Victorian RFAs (including first reports for the West Victoria and Gippsland RFAs). Veterans’ Affairs Portfolio: Procurement Policies (Question No. 2401) Mr Sidebottom asked the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, upon notice, on 1 March 2001: (1) Is the Minister’s Department, or are agencies within the portfolio, large purchasers or consumers of office papers.",134,Questions On Notice
236,Mr Tuckey,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(2) How are Commonwealth procurement guidelines being adhered to by the Minister’s Department and agencies within the portfolio. (3) What methodology or weighting criteria does the Minister’s Department and agencies use to determine the importance of the core principles which underpin the procurement guidelines, namely (a) value for money, (b) open and effective competition, (c) ethics and fair dealing, (d) accountability and reporting, (e) national competitiveness and industry development and (f) support for other Commonwealth policies. (4) What weighting criteria are used to implement the mandatory provisions in the guidelines which state that agencies must be able to demonstrate that Australia New Zealand (ANZ) suppliers have had a fair opportunity to compete. (5) In inviting suppliers to tender for the provision of goods, are suppliers advised that they must offer ANZ goods. (6) If the Minister’s Department or agencies within the portfolio do not have weighting criteria for determining the principles, will the Minister take steps to ensure that they provide an appropriate means to demonstrate their compliance with Commonwealth procurement policy. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) The Department of Veterans’ Affairs purchases about 60,000 reams of office paper each year. (2) In accordance with Commonwealth Procurement principles and guidelines, quotations for office paper are sought from suppliers as demand requires. (3) and (4) In assessing the offers from the paper suppliers, the Department takes into account price, conformity to specification, compatibility of the paper with its office machines, and suppliers’ ability to meet delivery requirements. Unsuccessful respondents are notified of the purchasing decision and purchases of $2,000 or more in value are publicly notified in the Gazette Publishing System. The Department ensures that in seeking supplies of office paper the specification does not exclude ANZ suppliers. The Department is seeking to include ANZ suppliers by having regard to the Industrial Supplies Office’s advice on which suppliers meet the requirement. (5) No. (6) In conducting its procurement activities the Department observes the relevant Commonwealth Procurement principles and guidelines. New South Wales Timber Industry: Funding (Question No. 2450) Mr Horne asked the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, upon notice, on 8 March 2001: (1) What sum has been provided by the Federal Government to the timber industry in NSW under the Forest Industry Structural Adjustment Package (FISAP) over the past five years. (2) Now that the Regional Forest Agreements have been signed by the Federal Government, will he give an assurance that FISAP money will start to flow immediately to the NSW timber industry for its vital reconstruction. (1) The Commonwealth has paid $18,445,618 to the timber industry in NSW since 1995/96 under the NSW FISAP. (2) The Southern Regional Forest Agreement (RFA) in NSW has not yet been finalised. It is my intention that FISAP in NSW will resume once the Southern RFA has been signed.",135,Questions On Notice
