216,The Speaker,"Order! It being 5 pm,Thursday, 17 June 2010 ----Sturt Electorate: Water plight of the residents of Skye, in my electorate, in relation to being connected to mains water. I know it sounds surprising that in a suburban electorate such as mine there are still households that are not connected to mains water, but in fact in Skye there are 140 households that have never been connected to mains water for various historical reasons. It is high time that the state government made the $3.7 million investment to make sure that those households are connected to mains water. There are two particularly important reasons for doing so. Firstly, the suburb of Skye borders the Adelaide Hills. It is in the foothills, an area in the Adelaide Hills that has been subject to fire danger in the last few decades. In fact, in 1983 the Ash Wednesday bushfire touched the foothills of my electorate. My own household was evacuated during the Ash Wednesday bushfires back in 1983. The suburb of Skye is in a dangerous zone for fire, and the Country Fire Service relies on mains water to fight dangerous bushfires. If a bushfire were to get into Skye, it would be very hard to stop it spreading to other neighbouring suburbs. For that reason alone it is important for the state government to invest in putting the households of Skye on mains water. Secondly, the water that the Skye residents have relied upon for about 40 years has come through a system of pipes which are now aged. The evidence is growing, according to the Skye action group, the SA Water appeal group, that there is a higher level of E. coli in the water that is being used in Skye than in other parts of metropolitan Adelaide. That situation may only get worse. It is exacerbated by the fact that most Skye residents have septic tanks rather than being connected to the sewer, because of how the suburb was developed. As a consequence, leakage over the decades has created a danger in terms of their use of bores and the local pipe system. So that is a second very important reason why it is important that the residents of Skye be given access to the SA Water mains water system. For that reason, the state government should act to spend the $3.7 million necessary to connect them. I have written to the Minister for Water, Paul Caica-whose seat is in fact in the electorate of the member for Hindmarsh, who is in the chamber-asking him to take that action as the Minister for Water. I look forward to a positive response from him. (Time expired) Wear It With Pride Campaign Ms PLIBERSEK (Sydney-Minister for Housing and Minister for the Status of Women) (9.33 am)-I am really looking forward-and I know you will be as well, Mr Deputy Speaker-to seeing the Wear It With Pride campaign that I am going to be involved with next week in Sydney. It is an initiative that has received funding from the federal government and will be run by the AIDS Council of New South Wales on behalf of the National LGBT Health Alliance. The campaign is designed to let members of the gay and lesbian community know about their rights following this government’s removal of discrimination against same-sex couples, lesbians and gay men from 85 pieces of federal legislation.

218,Mr Pyne (Sturt) (9.30 Am),"In my three-minute statement today I rise to talk about thestone, 85 designers are producing 85 T-shirts inspired by each of the reforms, which will then be worn by influential Australians to spread the campaign’s message to the community. The Wear It With Pride website says: These historic 85 reforms reward decades of protesting. I think it is really worth remembering that many of the people who will be participating in this campaign would have fought 20 years ago for the legalisation of homosexuality. They would have fought for the changes to the Commonwealth superannuation schemes, social security, taxation, Medicare benefits and so on for decades. They would have grown up at not just a time when it was a secret that you were gay or lesbian but a time when you could be arrested for simply forming a relationship with someone of the same gender. We have come a long way and it is a very proud day that these 85 reforms have gone through the Australian parliament and we are able to promote them in this way. In the last three years these reforms have covered many areas. In public office, same-sex partners are being recognised equally if they work for the government, the defence forces or as a judge. In parenting, families are regulated by the Federal Court in areas like parental responsibilities, child support, maintenance and so on. In the workplace, the Fair Work Act means that lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender employees under the federal system are protected from discrimination and specifically included in leave set aside for couples, like unpaid leave and carers leave. In relationships, same-sex couples are defined within de facto relationships for social security purposes, in financial areas like taxation and superannuation, and in health and ageing for purposes of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and the extended Medicare safety net. Couples will also be able to exempt their homes from an asset test when one member moves into aged care but the other remains in the home. Immigration is also included. I represent an area, as you do, I know, Mr Deputy Speaker Bevis, where a great number of same-sex couples live and I know these reforms will make an enormous difference to their lives. They are long fought for and hard won, and I am very proud to be part of a government that has delivered them. Mr Colin McPhedran House of the passing of Col McPhedran. Many of you would know him as the father of Ian McPhedran, a well-known journalist, three daughters and another son. Colin is also the author of a book, White Butterflies, which recounts the story of his escape from the Japanese occupation of Burma-where he walked as a young boy to India losing his entire family on the way. Colin died in the loving arms of his family in Perth on Thursday, 3 June. Last FridayI spoke at the memorial service in his honour, which was conducted in the Anglican Church in Bowral and as a gesture of respect was attended by a mix of all religions, including Buddhist monks. Later his ashes were scattered at Summataram Forest Buddhist Monastery just outside Bundanoon in the Southern Highlands of New South Wales, which he helped found and I opened some 20 years ago. Colin was born in Burma of a Burmese mother and a Scottish father. He adopted the religious belief of his mother and practised those philosophies throughout his life.

219,Mrs Gash (Gilmore) (9.36 Am),"It is with considerable sadness that I rise to inform thepolitician. His serenity masked a canny mind but a mind always tempered with compassion and tolerance. I am indebted to him for so much; all of it spiritual, all of it timeless and all of it precious. Colin came into my life about 35 years ago-at the right time. But to me, his leaving will always be at the wrong time. His compassion and beliefs made him an ideal mentor for me, a role he took on fully despite having an entirely different political disposition to mine. Yet he was on first name terms with John Howard and Kim Beazley, who launched his book. He saw me through my first forays into politics and was the invisible voice at my shoulder guiding me through the tangle of politics as I entered the field of federal politics. He assumed the mantle of my mentor-guiding, advising, listening and just being there when I was at my most vulnerable. His stabilising presence and quietly spoken counsel soothed my anxieties, allowed me to clear my mind and focus on the challenge at hand-and no amount of money can buy that. Col would often divide his time between Perth and the Southern Highlands, where we ran a guest house with Kay Jones and her family. Col was the face of Ranelagh House; it was there that he wrote his book White Butterflies. I am pleased to inform the House that it is presently being made into a film. He was generous because he knew that ultimately he did not actually possess anything; rather he saw himself as having been given the privilege of having a lend of things during his current life. As a Buddhist he believed in reincarnation and he viewed his life amongst us as part of the endless cycle of life and rebirth. It is a liberating thought-the knowledge that whatever bedevils us today is just a moment in time. He was truly a peaceful man and a man whose virtues far outshone his human vulnerabilities and failings. To those of us who are left behind, how fortunate we are to have known and shared his life, and I thank his family for allowing me to share their father. He was a good teacher to me. I deeply regret his passing yet I rejoice in the knowledge of having known him, loved him and shared this very special man who taught me that to live life you need love, peace, truth and righteousness. I wish had listened to him just that little bit more when he was here. Braddon Electorate: National Primary Industry Centre for Science Education mean not the pixies at the bottom of the garden but a terrific program that was initiated in my electorate of Braddon by David Russell and a number of his colleagues from the University of Tasmania. PICSE stands for National Primary Industry Centre for Science Education. It promotes science and particularly agricultural science and primary industries in our schools and encourages people towards science and particularly towards science as applied to the primary industries. It was a fantastic dream and idea of Associate Professor David Russell, and it finally received Commonwealth funding of a number of millions of dollars and now has spread nationally. I want to again congratulate David and his team on this fantastic program. Nationally in 2009 there were 223 schools engaged in this education program, 7,529 students actively signed up and engaged, 99 local industries engaged and 199 science teachers on professional development through the PICSE program. That is a fantastic story, especially as it encourages people not just into the sciences but particularly into the areas that affect primary industries. Let us face it: if we cannot grow our own food and if we do not have people involved in producing and growing our own food then we will be reliant on others. For food security, that is not a good story. MAIN COMMITTEE",131,Constituency Statements
220,Mr Sidebottom (Braddon) (9.39 Am),"I would like to talk about PICSE today-and IThe program has just done its major evaluation report and has a fantastic report card because of that. Some of the major activities undertaken by the PICSE program are as follows. There is teacher professional development, which is absolutely crucial to encourage teachers, and teachers are great influencers on students. There is a student camp and industry placement program, which is fantastic. They go out and do work experience in real, live industries. That is very important. There are science investigation awards to encourage people to take up investigative projects. Finally, there is the science education national forum. Some of the 190 investigation projects that were presented in my electorate in 2009 included titles such as ‘Acid rain affecting pea plant growth’, ‘Plant fertiliser-what’s hot and what’s not’ and ‘Do different detergents affect algal growth?’ (Time expired) Mr Grahame Rees who was a Comcar driver in this place. Grahame was born on 20 December 1950 in Canberra hospital to parents Beryl and Ken. For every one of us that works here and jumps into the cars with these extraordinary men and women-so often preoccupied as we are by what is on the radio news or what is on our mobile phone-it is important, I think, to pause and remember this incredible group of people who flank our building and make it work, who connect us to our lives while we are in the city of Canberra. Grahame was one of these people. You could not help but get in the car and have a chat. He was a man who had enormous passions-golf, fishing and his family-and I was one of the privileged few young members who got to meet him while he was driving. He was also a keen team mate of a gentleman by the name of Kevin Grace, whom I lived with for the first three years I was in Canberra. I will paraphrase the eulogy of his son Todd, which was delivered at the funeral. In Grahame’s early years he lived in Queanbeyan with his sister, Yvonne. The eulogy explained that their father Ken worked as the station master of Queanbeyan railway station. Ken was later transferred to Darling Harbour and their family home was built in Kogarah, where Grahame attended James Cook High. In his formative years his parents and the family became involved with the Uniting Church in Rockdale, and later the Salvation Army. Grahame met his wife in 1969 and they were married in 1972. He worked for Elders Stock and Station Agency and was transferred to Cooma in 1973. Three years later he began working with the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation-SMEC-and expanded his interest in sport by playing rugby, tennis and cricket. The last was a lifelong passion for Grahame. In 1988 his home was established in Spence and Grahame began his career in Humanitarian Aid. That allows me to pause and reflect on just how wide and varied the careers of many of the men and women who drive Comcars are. I am sure many of them have even more fascinating backgrounds than we do. In that time Grahame became involved with overseas aid organisations, frequently travelling to war-torn countries in Africa such as Rwanda, Somalia, Ethiopia, Zimbabwe and Kenya. The final part of Todd’s eulogy read: Dad assumed onerous responsibilities from coordinating supplies to refugees, which included food, clothing, tents and medicines. In recognition of this, he received the Humanitarian Overseas Service Medal in early 2000. MAIN COMMITTEE",132,Constituency Statements
221,Mr Laming (Bowman) (9.42 Am),"I rise today to remember the life of Grahame Rees,During our early lives, Dad coached our Soccer Teams and was thrilled when Grant began to share his passion for Cricket. Dad would often be seen umpiring or scoring when Grant began playing competitively and making ACT representative sides. Dads other passion was fishing and our family holidays were spent at Tuross Head’s in our grandparents’ holiday house. Dad taught all three of us (and Mum) how to fish, and in particular spent many hours with Todd and Pa beach fishing at all hours of the day and night. I know Dad was very proud of my achievements, especially when I graduated from University and started working with the AFP forensics team. Dad was very excited when my nephew Zac was born in 2005 just four days before his birthday, and flew to South West Rocks to see him when he was just a few days old. In the last seven years, Dad has been very involved with Gungahlin Lakes Golf Club-doing something that he really enjoyed. Being such a sports fan it seems appropriate if you are going to depart, then the golf course is as good a place as any. It was at the golf club, through Kevin Grace, that our paths crossed. Many of us have seen amazing contributions made by Comcar drivers, none more than Grahame Rees, and I am glad that I had the chance to meet this man. Blair Electorate: Schools Primary School. They received a new learning hub and a new amenities block under the Rudd government’s Nation Building Economic Stimulus Plan. Of course, Primary Schools for the 21st Century is a key element of that funding, as is the National School Pride Program. It was great to be there at the Lutheran community. While I was there Neil Schiller, the principal who has been there for many years, commended the Rudd government for this initiative, bringing forward, he said, their school infrastructure program by many years. The builder, Robin Fardoulys, the director of Fardoulys Constructions, told me that 200 jobs were supported across South-East Queensland by this project alone across the life of the project. We have 64 schools in the Blair electorate. Students in the western corridor and the West Moreton region will never get to study at a local trade training centre if the opposition is elected. In my electorate, Redbank Plains State High School is a very important school, one of the largest high schools in the Ipswich and West Moreton region. It, together with Woodcrest State College and Forest Lake State High School in the electorate of Oxley are joining forces to apply for a local trade training facility in Springfield, a satellite city which straddles the two electorates of Blair and Oxley. I strongly support that application to round 3 of the Trade Training Centres in Schools Program. If the coalition had their way, there would be no trade training centre in Springfield with these three great schools. Under the coalition this will all come to an end. Under the coalition in the Blair electorate the $3 million trade training centre run in conjunction with the two grammar schools-Ipswich Grammar School and Ipswich Girls Grammar School-and St Edmund’s College would also be at risk. There are also 44 library projects under threat, construction on seven classrooms would stop and some 1,056 students would no longer receive computers which have been promised to them. No school in Blair, no family, no student would be immune from the coalition’s cuts. All of the 64 schools in Blair would be at risk of reduced education funding.

(Time expired) Defence Procurement Dr JENSEN (Tangney) (9.48 am)-Last night on Lateline Tom Burbage, the Lockheed Martin head of the Joint Strike Fighter program, showed a total indifference to what is real and either misrepresented or, worse, lied about various aspects of the project. First of all he was talking about the cost of the project, realising that cost is merely one of the aspects used to build up the price. Tom Burbage said that in Australia we would get JSFs for $60 million. Quite frankly, if he thinks we can get a JSF for $60 million I say to the Australian government: ‘Buy the things. Buy 100. It will only cost $6 billion, and then we can spend the rest of the $9 billion or $10 billion to get to the $16 billion total to buy some real capability that we need.’ To give you some idea of how fanciful this number is, 24 Super Hornets cost us $3.2 billion or $150 million per aeroplane. He talks about concurrency-doing the development at the same time as actually building production aircraft-as being cost effective. This is something that is out of the trees. Car manufacturers, who have a far better handle on things-and cars are nowhere near as advanced as this-run the prototypes before they put the items into production. Burbage also talks about 4,000 to 5,000 aircraft. This is fanciful stuff. About 2,400 are currently proposed, and nations like the Netherlands are pulling out of initial operational testing and evaluation. He admitted that the earliest the aircraft would be in Australia is 2018. How is this giving us the capability we require? The performance of this aircraft is a dog. He is betting on a revolution that aerodynamic performance speed-what is called energy manoeuvrability-no longer counts. This has been bet on numerous times in the past, and every time the reality of warfare has come to bite it has been found that the fundamentals are important. This aircraft is not a true fifth generation aircraft. It does not have supercruise or the ability to cruise supersonically without using afterburner, and it certainly does not have superagility. It is not even as agile as current fourth generation aircraft. He did not deny that the competition flies higher and faster and can outturn and outrun the Joint Strike Fighter. He tried to say that they are only pictures of the competition. The PAK-FA-the F22 equivalent, which is far better than the JSF-is in flight test. The US House Committee on Armed Services has put budgetary requirements on the program to meet time lines in order to get full funding. And what has happened? The Secretary of Defense has said that it makes the program undeliverable. If anyone wants to find out any more about this, I suggest that they go to the Air Power Australia website. (Time expired) MAIN COMMITTEE Hindmarsh Electorate: Lower Murray Murray, the Lower Lakes and the Coorong in South Australia. I am pleased to see in here the member for Mayo, who has been very outspoken on this issue. As I said, the Coorong and the Lower Lakes rest in the hands of whomever forms federal government, as no South Australian government can extract or buy enough water from the eastern states to keep the river healthy, to keep the lakes from dying out and to keep the Coorong alive. This is very self-evident. South Australians need a federal government that will free up sufficient water to keep these systems and the communities that rely on them in South Australia alive. Our federal government’s Murray-Darling Basin Authority is preparing a basin-wide plan to allocate water where it is needed and where we need it. The plan will decrease the volume of water that can be drained out of the rivers, leaving enough water for our river system to remain healthy. It has become apparent that only this Labor government supports such a basin-wide plan, with upstream irrigators facing having their water entitlements cut. We have heard the Liberal-National opposition warn the country of an upcoming fight over water, a fight between farmers and the environment. They have lined up the environment in their sights and plan a bloody knock-them-down, drag-them-out fight to keep the water upriver in places in New South Wales and Queensland. They justify their fight by saying that irrigators upstream cannot afford to use less water. They even say that we, South Australians, cannot afford to have the upstream states use less water. The Liberal and National parties do not understand that it is not just the environment that they fight. In South Australia, when they fight the Murray they fight all South Australian interests. The Liberal-National opposition spokesman, the very colourful Senator Barnaby Joyce, believes that Queensland ‘actually extracts less water, I think, than South Australia or approximately the same amount’. This statement is very irresponsible. It shows that he has no idea. South Australia extracts substantially less water for agriculture than does Queensland, which extracts substantially less than does Victoria, which extracts substantially less than does New South Wales. Senator Joyce says that he has consulted with South Australians, and he says that he knows what we need. But he says that we in South Australia use more water than Queensland does, which is not true. Presumably, we do not need any more. Quite unapologetically, he says that he and his irrigator mates are looking forward to their fight with the river system on which we rely. Barnaby Joyce says he will fight it, and by that he means he will fight us-those in the Lower Murray, the Lower Lakes and the Coorong and all of us who stand up for them and the communities that from them derive life. If Senator Joyce’s opposition wants to fight South Australia, then so be it, because we cannot live without the Murray and we cannot live with the acidic destruction of the Lower Lakes and the death of our Coorong(Time expired) River Murray Mayo Electorate: Road Toll member for Hindmarsh made.

224,Mr Briggs (Mayo) (9.55 Am),"Firstly, I will speak briefly on a couple of points that thethe only people who are interested in saving the Lower Lakes. We are not interested in getting front-page headlines about fake water which does not exist to mislead people to win a state election; we are interested in actually fixing an environmental crisis in that area. The reason I have risen today is to speak about local roads in the electorate of Mayo. Unfortunately, in South Australia this year we have seen an extraordinarily high road toll, particularly in the earlier parts of the year, with 65 people having died. About half of those people have been in my electorate. The Adelaide Hills and the Fleurieu Peninsula have winding, small roads and unfortunately we have seen too many deaths due to a range of factors. One of those factors has been the quality of the roads and the lack of investment by the state Rann Labor government to keep these roads safe for the people who live in my area. I am talking about roads like the one at Crafers. I have recently done a survey of people who live in Crafers and there has been an overwhelming response about concerns as to the main street of Crafers, about people speeding up on it to get onto the South-Eastern Freeway, so using it as a launch pad. State Rann Labor government ministers have said there is no problem, although I am pleased that the new state minister, Jack Snelling, has taken this on board and is now looking at it after substantial community pressure. Over 10 per cent of people replied to the 700odd letters that were sent out into Crafers, which I am sure members would acknowledge as being an extraordinary number of people, and we sent that information to the state Rann Labor government minister. In addition to that, Kangaroo Island-which is often left out by state Labor, as the Rann government does not like KI; they like to use it as a tourism attraction but they do not like to invest any money down there-has enormous challenges with roads and we need to do more. There is a lot of attention always given to the Victor Harbour road-and it should be duplicated-and, equally, I think we need to pay significant attention-perhaps more attention-to the road that goes down from Normanville and Yankalilla to Cape Jervis. It is a major tourism attraction. I think it is a long-term challenge for South Australia that we upgrade that road to increase the capacity for tourists to get to Kangaroo Island safely and for locals to travel on that road safely. It is a burning issue and it will be an issue into the future that I will be fighting over on behalf of my community. Solomon Electorate: Education tic Building the Education Revolution projects that are occurring in my electorate. As there had been some conjecture and plenty of debate over the BER funding, I went out and spoke to the principals of different schools and collected some third party endorsements on how well this program has been received. I spoke to June Wessels, principal of the Bakewell Primary School, one of the biggest primary schools in my electorate with 680-odd kids. They got a new classroom block and they got an all-weather roof for basketball courts and outdoor stage facilities. She said to me that there had been excellent feedback from the community. Local businesses had been able to build a lot of the infrastructure that was very important to the people in my electorate. The Durack Primary School principal, Heather Stedman, got new extra classrooms and more library space. Once again a local company did the building and it had been received very positively by all the community. Certainly the Durack Primary School is growing. It is a very big school as well and this was very significant funding for that school. Even smaller schools like Ludmilla Primary School had work done. It had a library extension MAIN COMMITTEE",136,Constituency Statements
225,Mr Hale (Solomon) (9.58 Am),"I rise this morning to briefly outline some of the fantasand a new resource centre. Its principal said to me that the whole community was right behind the BER funding and these sorts of projects were very important to the school as it continued to develop. Even in the Catholic schools sector, the principal of Sacred Heart Primary School, Kathy Neely, was very positive about the upgrade of the classrooms and the library extension. Once again, it was a local company that did the work-on time and on budget. She said the community is pleased and the parents have been very much involved in the design and very much involved in the whole process there. Principal Kelly Smith, of St Paul’s Primary School, said the roof over an outdoor learning area was something that they had been saving for and she said it would have taken many fetes and many chook raffles to get that money to be able to afford to do the extensions at the St Paul’s Primary School. So there are many great stories out there about the BER funding. I think one of the threats, obviously, is that the Leader of the Opposition has made it quite clear that these projects will be cut. There is $20 million worth of projects in my electorate of Solomon alone, and I ask the Leader of the Opposition to come to Darwin and tell those schools that they are not going to be funded. I seek leave to table these third-party endorsements that I have received from principals. Leave granted. 193 the time for constituency statements has concluded.

I am just seeking an update on those total figures from those that are regularly published by the Department. MAIN COMMITTEE",137,Constituency Statements

As at 11 June 2010 there were 508 people being treated as minors-that is, under 18 years of age. Eight were in the community on the mainland under residence determinations, four in Queensland and four in Victoria. There were 292 in alternative detention on the mainland, including seven in New South Wales, 38 in Victoria, 68 in Queensland, 56 in South Australia, 63 in Western Australia and 60 in the Northern Territory; one in the community on Christmas Island under a residence determination; and 207 in alternative detention in the Christmas Island construction camp. With respect to those numbers that have been granted permanent visas, I understand that during 2009 there were 1,133 that were granted permanent visas. The figures I have for 2010 are a little old, but my last figures were 1,108.

House, which is appropriate to be followed here, is for the call to be alternated from government to opposition. Whilst it is open to any member of the government to seek the call, if the minister seeks the call then, in accordance with the convention, the minister receives the call. Hayne in the High Court held a directions hearing on 16 of the 17 matters on 4 June 2010. His Honour made procedural orders putting in place a timetable for the filing of evidence and amended applications. His Honour listed both matters for a further directions hearing on 25 June 2010. His Honour indicated the first available date for a substantive hearing before the full court of the High Court would be in the week of 23 August 2010. However, I am not sure that that date has been allocated by the court. I think there is still some discussion between the parties and the court about that matter. It seems that the court is likely to identify two cases as essentially representative of the issues in dispute in the number of cases that have been filed. Again, there is some negotiation between the parties. The basis of the claims is a challenge to the validity of the refugee status assessment and the independent merits review process applying to offshore irregular maritime arrivals. I cannot comment on the specifics of the issues raised in the proceedings. Regarding the issue of class actions, the Immigration Act specifically precludes class actions; hence, the filing of the individual matters. Regarding the issues in dispute, I am advised in accordance with the non-statutory refugee status assessment procedures, which were introduced by the former government in 2001 as part of the excision arrangements, that these applicants’ protection claims were thoroughly examined by an independent decision maker from the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. These claims were considered on a case-by-case basis and each person was found not to be owed Australia’s protection; hence, they have taken court action. These decisions were in turn reviewed by an independent reviewer in accordance with the independent merits review process, introduced by the Rudd government, to ensure greater fairness and integrity in the offshore refugee status assessment. The government’s position, which we believe is sound but obviously these matters are determined by the court, is that if an offshore entry person is moved from Christmas Island to the mainland it is simply a case of transferring detainees from one place of immigration detention in Australia to another place of immigration detention. The person’s status as an offshore entry person does not change as a result of that transfer. That was based on legislation introduced by the former government. One of the applicants in the case is, as I understand it, currently on Christmas Island. So in that sense the issue about whether the people are in Australia or on Christmas Island has not been dissected. The challenge is to the process, as opposed to where the people are currently located. Obviously these issues will be discussed in the court case. stand that what he is saying is that each of those actions that are being brought before the High Court are individual actions.

241,Mr Morrison (Cook) (10.13 Am),"On the matter that the Attorney just raised, I undermas Island will be assessed separately to the positions of those claimants who are making their claims on the mainland. I just want to clarify with the Attorney that each of these cases will be considered separately. It is not a class action; they are separate actions being brought by these individuals. So the claim of the person on Christmas Island will be considered in the courts separately to those who are on the mainland and have been transferred? of the cases identified as being one of the two to be determined by the court is of that person on Christmas Island. I do not have the information to identify that person. It appears likely, on my briefing, that matter 61 of 2010 and another case known as matter 69 of 2010 will be the leading cases that will be heard together. On 25 June the plaintiffs in matter S116 of 2010 and S121 of 2010 will be given the opportunity to say why their cases should also be referred to the full court for determination. Again, however, I am not sure whether either of those cases relates to the person on Christmas Island. He has indicated that his current view-this is at the time of the directions hearing-was that he could not see that these two additional cases would add to the points of legal principle that the full court needs to resolve in order to establish the legal principle applying to the cases that have been filed. Without speaking on behalf of the court, it seems that they are seeking to identify a common factual base that will enable the court to determine legal principle that can be assumed to have broader application. I cannot say, on the basis of information before me, whether any of those cases so identified by the court relates to the person on Christmas Island. Over the course of debate, the proceedings have taken on the character of question time-and that is quite appropriate; there is no reason why that should not be so. However, it is in fact not question time so it is not a circumstance in which the practice would be to call questions from one side then the other. It is in fact a debate. At the conclusion of that debate the resolution will be put. Because it is a debate, the normal practice is to give the call to a government member then to an opposition member, and where more than one government member stands, if the minister seeks the call then the minister will receive the call. I think we need to understand the practice of what we are going through. about-and the Attorney referred earlier to this-the number of people who have been transferred from Christmas Island, due to the overcrowding and unprecedented rate of arrivals, to mainland places like Leonora and the recently reopened Curtin detention centre. I understand that the government has received a range of propositions and applications from various places around the country in relation to where other potential detention facilities might be located to cope with the unprecedented rate of arrivals-three boats per week as opposed to three boats per year under the last six years of the coalition government. I would be interested to know from the Attorney in considering these appropriations how many additional places are required in the department’s view to cope with the increase in arrivals and the detention population as it stands and as it is expected to increase over the next 12 months? How many extra beds are they looking for and in what places are they seeking to place those beds?

244,Mr Morrison (Cook) (10.17 Am),"In recent times there have been a number of reportsditional beds will the government need to create to cope with the rate of arrivals? members for their questions. I went through details of movements to Leonora and to Curtin, and obviously the northern detention centre in Darwin has also been opened. I indicated that a number of families have been placed in other locations in Brisbane and Sydney. Obviously there is an issue occurring now with irregular maritime arrivals coming to Australia. The government has strategies in place to deal with those arrivals, in anticipation that there will be additional arrivals. Clearly, the government have devoted considerable resources to developing cooperative intelligence arrangements with our neighbours, including coordinating the intelligence in the home affairs unit and specifically in the Customs and Border Protection Service. Obviously there is an anticipation of additional boats seeking to enter Australian waters, and steps are being taken in that regard. However, the circumstances and the predictions as to how they are going to pan out over a longer term period are obviously dependent on a number of factors. In that respect, the planning, as I understand it, is taken on the basis of developing contingency arrangements with the officers of his department to identify potential locations. Given that we have imposed a freeze on the processing of people from Afghanistan and also from Sri Lanka, there will be a need to accommodate those people during the course of the freeze. The minister’s department is taking advice and examining alternative places of detention, and accommodation in the case of families. But, necessarily, there is no specific number given the circumstances that can impact on, firstly, those seeking to arrive in Australia and, secondly, the response once they arrive in Australia. In that context, and in answering a question from the member for Shortland, I indicate that the government have taken very strong measures. I think I said this the other day in the House. Our policy is one of excision of offshore islands, mandatory detention of persons for the purposes of checking their immigration and their identity, and of conducting security and health assessments. We also have compulsory return of those found not to be seeking asylum. The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship recently indicated that there has been in the order of a 40 per cent rejection rate of asylum claims from persons from Afghanistan. Clearly, we anticipate that at the conclusion of the suspension of the processing of those persons from Afghanistan and Sri Lanka, updated information from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and from in-country information will mean that more of those applications will be rejected. The government do not believe the opposition’s policy of introducing temporary protection visas will work. I think the history speaks for itself in that respect. There was a significant increase after that was introduced in 1999. Nor do we think the Pacific solution will be effective. We saw that 70 per cent of the people who were part of that were returned. In particular, the Pacific solution introduced by the former government was based on what was effectively indefinite detention on Nauru and Manus Island. I ask the opposition: do they intend, as part of their reintroduction of third-country processing, that there will be indefinite detention on those places or do they intend to process claims within a specified time limit? detention, and I will come to that in a moment.

247,Mr Morrison (Cook) (10.23 Am),"I note that the Attorney raises the issue of indefiniteans indicated that the estimated number of people to arrive in financial year 2010-11, which begins in just a couple of weeks, will be just 2,000-a 60 per cent decline on this current financial year’s number. Given that the budget estimates currently include a $1 billion increase from last year when the figures were introduced, can the minister comment on the following. If the current rate of arrivals-three boats per week and 600 people per month-were to continue in the next financial year, what impact would that be on the budget estimates and what would the likely further increase be? I also go to the issue raised of indefinite detention and the asylum freeze introduced by the government on 9 April. With the asylum freeze, I would be interested to know what advice was given, or if advice was given, to the government regarding the legal position as to the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and in particular article 3, which stipulates against discrimination due to a person’s race, religion or country of origin. Given that there is currently a six-month freeze for Afghan asylum seekers and a three-month freeze on assessment for Sri Lankans, and absolutely no certainty one way or the other on whether those freezes are to be extended, how does that sit comfortably with the government’s own stated detention principle that no-one will be detained indefinitely, when it is clear that those subject to those freezes have been discriminated against on the basis of their nationality and are indeed being detained indefinitely with no assessments being undertaken? as hypothetical, but, as I commented before, it is not questions; it is debate. member. On those detentions: our advice is that, while the Racial Discrimination Act prevents discrimination on the basis of colour, or racial, ethnic or national origin, the Federal Court of Australia has determined that making assessments-as we are in the case of our suspensions-on the basis of nationality is not equivalent to making a determination on the basis of national origin. We are in fact looking at the circumstances existing in Afghanistan and Sri Lanka in light of the state of hostilities in those countries, and at the re-engagement of the democratic system in Sri Lanka after the cessation of hostilities, and looking to receive that updated in-country information. I would also point out that in contradistinction to the government’s policies of these people remaining in detention during the period of suspension, as I understand it, on the basis of the opposition’s temporary protection visa arrangements these people would actually be released into the community, assuming that they satisfied the assessment criteria. More broadly, the figures quoted in the media about a $1 billion blow-out in processing are wrong. It seems that the media has referred to outcome 4, rather than outcome 4.3 dealing with the processing of irregular maritime arrivals. The total estimated cost for the detention and management of immigration arrivals in 2010-11 is $440 million. That includes Christmas Island and also onshore facilities. The estimated cost in respect of Christmas Island is $213.1 million. These estimates are agreed between the department of immigration and Finance. They are agreed on the basis of an averaging process of numbers, which I understand were the same budget and forecast arrangements that were used under the previous government. In respect of that, the previous government experienced again a very substantial peak in the costs that they incurred during the 1999, 2000 and 2001 years, which the honourable member MAIN COMMITTEE",142,Appropriation Bill No 1 2010 2011

249,Mr Mcclelland (Barton,"Attorney-General) (10.26 am)-I thank the honourablespoke of the other day. There was a substantial influx of arrivals into Australia during the period of the former government. I recall that the figure was then an additional $1.5 billion over those three years. These things are not unknown, and the arrangements between Immigration and Finance accommodate that potentially occurring. I note, for example, that the former government had estimated in its budget in 2002 that the construction cost of the Christmas Island facility that it eventually built would be $153 million. That blew out to $400 million. I also note that the opposition’s proposed arrangements for detention of persons at an offshore place or in another country would necessarily involve a very substantial expense. Indeed, from my observations, I doubt that the opposition has factored in that cost. For instance, it is my understanding that the costs of Nauru were well over $315 million. Again, considering how the opposition is explaining its policies, I wonder how those contingencies would be factored into its costings. ernment and the opposition parties for consideration of this matter has concluded.

They are right on that, but I am not sure they are always right about the internal workings of government. I have been engaged in discussions with companies both big and small. Strange, but I approach discussions on the basis that what is discussed in a room stays in the room. That is why companies have always been able to have discussions with me.

It is not merely pressure to say nothing publicly; there is also significant pressure to donate significant amounts of money to fund the campaign against the government. I do read the media. I do not always believe them, and perhaps I might be wrong on this, but I read an article in a national daily yesterday which referred to significant fundraising efforts out of the Western Australian branch of the Liberal Party relating to the current campaign against the government on the proposal to significantly change and reform the Australian taxation system. It spoke about the view in the Liberal caucus that their deputy leader has not always been that relevant to the future of the coalition.

Has the minister done any modelling in terms of the total revenue take-if in fact the level of the entry point into the resource super profits tax area is in fact increased? In particular, if a level of 10 per cent were placed in the definition, what would that mean in terms of the total take? My second question is one of jurisdiction, in a sense.

267,Mr Windsor (New England) (10.40 Am),I have two questions for the minister.,146,Appropriation Bill No 1 2010 2011
268,Mr Windsor,"I will attempt to bring some sanity back to the debate. One question isissues, particularly groundwater issues but also surface water issues, and the potential impacts of mining to the agricultural area and water resources. I know those areas in Queenslandwhich the member for Groom would also be aware of-where there are very real concerns about the jurisdiction of state governments. My question to the minister is: given that the Commonwealth has now moved into the policing and the end of valley caps in relation to the Murray-Darling system, does the minister believe that the state based planning processes that are currently in place are sufficient to safeguard the water resource and agricultural areas the Commonwealth is playing a much stronger role in? Mr Ian Macfarlane interjectingfor Tourism) (10.42 am)-Let us deal with the last question first. I think, to be fair, the member for Groom also understands the importance of this. As you know, with respect to projects such as those on the Liverpool Plains, other than the operation of the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, full responsibility for approval of mining has historically rested in the hands of state and territory governments. There has been a serious campaign in the Liverpool Plains area against BHP Billiton by a local community with respect to potential mining activity. We all appreciate that as a result of discussions BHP Billiton has now agreed not to mine on the plains and their mining licence has been adjusted on a voluntary basis to reflect that. There is then an outstanding question about a potential examination of water related issues, which, as the member for New England would appreciate, I have been having discussions about with our Minister for Climate Change, Energy Efficiency and Water, Senator Penny Wong. I treat the request for such an investigation seriously. I remind the member that he asked the Prime Minister a question in the House about three or four weeks ago concerning this matter and that he was given an undertaking that I would visit the Liverpool Plains area for the purpose of having discussions with the member for New England with respect to these issues. At that time, I would also like to talk to him and the local community about the potential to undertake an independent water study. It is not proposed at this stage that the Commonwealth government take over responsibilities for these matters. We all appreciate that on an ongoing basis these issues are going to get more and more difficult. It is something that is going to have to involve further state and territory and Commonwealth discussions as we go forward. But, with respect to the specifics of the Liverpool Plains, I am focused on that, as is the government, for good purposes. In terms of the long-term bond rate, my department has not done modelling related to the tax proposal because that is the responsibility of the Treasury. He appreciates, as does the member for Groom, who has primary responsibility for modelling relating to tax issues. I can confirm, because it is in the public arena, that a number of companies, big and small, have raised with me the proposal with respect to the resource super profits tax and the interface with the long-term bond rate. duties regarding tourism. Is the minister aware of the concept of inflation and the fact that the purchasing power of a dollar erodes over time? If the minister is aware of that concept, could the minister outline why funding to Tourism Australia under his stewardship has now fallen to its lowest level since 2003 in real terms? Would the minister also outline why he has provided MAIN COMMITTEE",146,Appropriation Bill No 1 2010 2011
269,Mr Martin Ferguson (Batman,Minister for Resources and Energy and Minister,147,Appropriation Bill No 1 2010 2011
270,Mr Ciobo (Moncrieff) (10.45 Am),"I question the minister with respect to his portfolioabsolutely no additional assistance to the tourism industry under the Long-Term Tourism Strategy-further, why in fact in real terms this year has the minister not supplemented the additional $9 million that was pulled forward from this year’s budget with new funds for this year? Additionally, would the minister also outline his government’s policy decision to impose $1¼ billion of new taxes on the tourism industry through predominantly the increase in the passenger movement charge as well as other ancillary charges? for Tourism) (10.46 am)-I think it is about 700 days since I last got a question from the member for Moncrieff on a tourism related matter. Firstly, on the $9 million, the industry asked that the government bring forward the $9 million to suit a short-term requirement to assist the industry to get through a very tough period. The government responded in a positive way to the request by industry. It was never suggested by industry that having brought it forward we then supplement it. The request has only come after the government agreed to bring forward the $9 million. I made it clear in bringing forward the $9 million that we would continue to seek to assist the industry through the global financial crisis. That $9 million in partnerships with industry and state tourism organisations was turned into $20 million, because in bringing forward the $9 million I was determined to get a multiplier effect by working with industry and state tourism organisations on the basis of at least dollar for dollar so that you got a bigger impact from the investment by government. Through the January, February, March period-especially the Chinese New Year periodthat was of substantial importance to the tourism industry, especially in areas such as tropical North Queensland, where they have been doing it very tough for a long, long time, including under the previous government, because of the collapse in the Japanese market. It is interesting to note that for the March quarter of this year, for the first time since 2005, tourism numbers out of Japan were up by three per cent. I can only hope that, as the Japanese economy strengthens, we return to some growth, but I will never suggest we are ever going to have the figures we previously had out of Japan into areas such as tropical North Queensland. The nature of the market has changed. So in terms that $9 million, the answer is no. The industry knows it because I told them at the time. More importantly, I turned $9 million into $20 million by working closely with industry. By the way, in terms of government expenditure, I simply remind the member for Moncrieff that he had better be very, very careful travelling around the country creating a view in the minds of people in the tourism industry that the coalition in the lead-up to the next election is going to meet all these half-promises that local groups are asking him for in meetings. Next week, we have the annual meeting of the national Tourism and Transport Forum to be held in Canberra. I remind the member for Moncrieff that he has an outstanding funding commitment to the transport and tourism community. During the course of the forum last year, he talked up-in a very strong way-abolishing the passenger movement charge relating to the movement of people between Australia and New Zealand. I do not know if he has done his sums on the cost, but I have booked it. It is quite a substantial amount of money that the coalition is going to have to come forward with to meet the promise he made to the transport and tourism foundation at its meeting here in Canberra, at Parliament House, last year. I would also say he has been going around the community making a number of other halfpromises about restoring TQUAL-about another $30 million over four years. Are you going MAIN COMMITTEE",147,Appropriation Bill No 1 2010 2011
271,Mr Martin Ferguson (Batman,"Minister for Resources and Energy and Ministerto meet that commitment, or are you going continue to mislead people about what you may or may not do in government? My relationship with the tourism industry is upfront. I tell them what I can do and I tell them what I cannot do. I am not particularly worried about that, because I have a view that that is what being a minister is about-not creating misleading expectations that you can do things when you cannot do them. I would also remind the member for Moncrieff that he has been out there making speeches about the need to return the budget to surplus. Our budget parameters return the budget to surplus in three years, half the time expected. You cannot have it both ways, going out there saying we should cut the cloth to suit the current circumstances and then going out there saying we should spend money. People soon see that you are an absolute hypocrite because they see through such half-baked speeches and promises. The member for Moncrieff can come in here and ask all the questions in the world, but it has got to a point where people understand that he is not serious about tourism because he is not prepared to call it as it is. He continues to go round telling them, ‘We’ll do this and do that,’ knowing full well that he has no capacity to do it. swers, where he admitted he was not aware of the proposal until it was announced and that he cannot nameMr Martin FergusonMr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: that is a deliberate misrepresentation of my views. resume his seat. of the tax before it was announced-as the Minister for Trade was not aware of it. He is also unable to name a single company that supports this tax, despite the Prime Minister’s statements in the chamber. But he has agreed that companies will be paying 47 to 48 per cent tax, because that is the figure that the Treasurer is using. CanI ask one question that he might be able to answer: can the minister give an assurance that the government will resolve the issues surrounding the supertax by the end of this calendar year? for Tourism) (10.53 am)-They are the same types of assurances that the member for Groom gave the government in the lead-up to last Christmas-that he would deliver the coalition rooms in support of a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. Not only that, he made very strong public statements that the CPRS is the best thing since sliced bread. That is what he said: the best thing since sliced bread. Here we have the member for Groom-who has a bit of standing and respect in the Australian community-fully understanding the complex nature of negotiations, because he himself went through them around the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme in the lead-up to last Christmas. Unfortunately, he failed miserably. I know it took him a long time to recover because, at about the same time, a new leader was elected. And, because he dared to stand in support of fundamental change in Australia, structural reform, he was sacked. member for Groom asked the minister the question, not vice versa.

In the same way in which the member for Groom approached detailed negotiations and meetings with the government over the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, I approach negotiations around the resource rent tax proposal: with goodwill and with good intent. I simply say to industry that, in many ways, the resolution of this and the timing are very much related to their negotiations and their capacity to engage in good faith and to assist to inform the process. I simply say to the member for Groom: do not always believe what you read in the media. indicated that there is not a single cent of additional funding for Australia’s tourism industry. It helps provide some clarity. I also noticed that the minister refused to address the fact that, under his government, the tourism industry has gone backwards, with $1¼ billion of new taxes, with funding for Tourism Australia cut in real terms to 2003 levels. I also notice that the minister comes from the school of thought that the best defence is offence, and I welcome him to attack the coalition’s strong record with respect to support for the tourism industry as much as he sees fit. Notwithstanding that, given that the minister has now confirmed that he will not be providing any additional assistance for the tourist industry through Tourism Australia funding and, indeed, does not have any real concern about the fact that his government imposed $1¼ billion of new taxes, I wonder if the minister could indicate whether the TQUAL program, which he spoke about earlier-a program that replaced the $29 million Australian Tourism Development Program; incidentally, Minister, I note you raced around the country for nearly two years announcing various projects around the country under ATDP funding-will be extended given the minister’s particular desire to constantly lecture Australia’s tourism industry about the need to invest in supply-side infrastructure and supply-side attractions. Minister, will the money match your mouth and will your government be doing anything with respect to extending the TQUAL program? Your indication of that or otherwise would be welcomed. for Tourism) (10.57 am)-Direct support for Tourism Australia stands steady. Let us go to the question of the tourism industry and how this government approaches it. Firstly, we turned it into a cabinet portfolio because we regard it as a key part of the Australian economy, something the previous government failed to do-and I know what you thought about your junior minister at the time, but I will not go there. In terms of the tourism portfolio, it is about time the industry and the shadow minister started to think about a whole-of-government approach. When it comes to the tourism industry, you also have to look at transport infrastructure. I just met with six councils from the Ocean Road area this morning. I was shadow minister for transport at the last election, and the most significant contribution they got to the further development of the tourism industry in that area previously was the Geelong Road bypass. We decided to put more in than expected to finish it and to enable the industry to go forward and further develop it, because it was a key hindrance to the development of the tourism industry in that area.

281,Mr Martin Ferguson (Batman,"Minister for Resources and Energy and MinisterPerhaps more importantly, in terms of the supply-side issues, have a look at the funding given to local councils by our government budget by budget through the department of local government and go through the list of projects and see how much of that money is actually being spent on tourism related projects. There are very, very significant amounts of money across the length and breadth of Australia. When it comes to supply-side issues, unfortunately, the member for Moncrieff is still stuck in the past. He thinks the key to future growth of the tourism industry in Australia is to spend more money on marketing. It is not; it is about attending to a long-term tourism strategy going to supply-side issues, including consideration of the skilling of the industry. How can the industry compete when a trades assistant employed at Gorgon receives $150,000 per year and a chef in the city receives about $82,000 per year? What is the importance of migration? What is the importance of aviation access? How do we get some of these airports to improve their infrastructure? They are the types of issues that will determine where we go in the tourism sector in Australia-that is, not whether or not we bring forward $9 million out of the Tourism Australia marketing campaign for a short-term opportunity with industry but having a long-term tourism strategy which puts tourism front and centre of the Australian economy. It was never thought about as part of the Australian economy. It was just a leisure opportunity for coalition ministers to travel the country, freewheeling and putting their feet under the table at every upmarket restaurant they could at taxpayers’ expense. The world has changed. We treat tourism as a serious part of the economy, not a holiday opportunity, as the coalition did for far too long. Proposed expenditure agreed to. Innovation, Industry, Science and Research Portfolio Proposed expenditure, $2,248,036,000 industry portfolio, so I will come back to the R&D tax credit, some stuff on the Automotive Industry Structural Adjustment Program and Commercialisation Australia. I do have some questions around the Green Building Fund and the linkages programs, so I signal those in advance. I appreciate that they are not in the minister’s direct portfolio, so it might be easiest to come back to them. Minister, in the budget there were some announcements in your direct area of responsibility. I am hopeful you might be able to shed some light on the budget announcement on mediation services relating to the various codes. In your media release you talked about an ‘introduction’, and you might have seen some of my commentary on the ‘introduction’ of services that are largely in place now. Then, in the body of your release, you talked about a continuation of them. CouldI have a clarification on whether the $2.7 million is for new resources on top of the resources that were already available for those services and what the aggregate sum looks like? The budget documents actually float another number, a $2 million number, so it is a little hard to follow what is new and what is an extension. Some guidance on that would be helpful. Also, could you tell me the extent to which those services are being taken up and whether you think that will help streamline the process through the consolidation? I would be grateful for an expansion on the business number and business name registration initiative. I note that a number of portfolios are party to that process-ASIC, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the tax office. There is some capital expenditure and the like as MAIN COMMITTEE",150,Appropriation Bill No 1 2010 2011
282,Mr Billson (Dunkley) (11.00 Am),"Minister, we were just discussing some parts of thewell as some for your own department. I would be keen to get a sense of how that is being apportioned, what processes and programs are going to work through that and how it may overcome some of the current business name challenges where, in some states, the ‘&’ symbol does not get recognised. We have had some examples of what I would call ‘ambush marketing’, where it might be ‘Craig& Bruce’s Small Business Advisory Service’, the ‘&’ symbol does not appear on some search engines and someone then gets ‘Craig Bruce’s Small Business Advisory Service’. There have been some problems in that space and I am interested in how they could be overcome by this measure. The other issue-and it is not directly in your portfolio but I am sure it is something you are aware of-was around the charge on respondents with reporting obligations under amount per transaction are really proving to be quite a concern for some of the smaller businesses-newsagents and the like-that handle cash transfer arrangements that are not very high margin. To what extent are you engaged with that subject and how it might be rolled out to deal with the small business impact? Dr EMERSON (Rankin-Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy, Minister Assisting the Finance Minister on Deregulation and Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs) (11.04 am)-I thank the member for Dunkley for the questions and the manner in which he has approached this consideration in detail. By way of general background on the mediation services, obviously I think we would share the view of the coalition in preferring to head off disputes rather than letting them develop into fully blown problems in the courts. This is the better approach and that is why we have sought to rationalise the mediation services that are available under the various mandatory codes of conduct. There is an extra emphasis on that first point of contact to see if we can resolve as many issues there as we can. You can then go into a formal mediation process where, if that does not work, the more formal legal processes have to take their course. We have found through the ACCC, for example, that the mediation services for franchising are of some value. The shadow minister knows that franchising is an area that tends to attract more controversy, misunderstandings and disputes. Anything that we can do to improve our performance in that area is a very important development. Regarding the program funding, we have got expenses totalling $533,000 in 2010-11, $498,000 in 2011-12, $503,000 in 2012-13 and another $508,000 in 2013-14. What is not absolutely clear to me from the table is the extent to which this is total net new funding or a reallocation of existing funding. I will get back to you on that. I think that is the best way of handling that. Again, it makes sense to try to centralise, or at least coordinate, the mediation services and the skills associated with it under the various mandatory codes of conduct, and that is what we are trying to do. The business names registration exercise is one of the 27 areas of regulatory reform under the national partnership agreement of the Council of Australian Governments to deliver a seamless national economy. The purpose of the business registration program is to move from eight state and territory systems to a single national system. We have been really encouraged by the cooperation of the states and territories here. I can relate to you the sorts of conversations that were held at the Council of Australian Governments meeting in July 2008 when we MAIN COMMITTEE accelerated a number of these reforms after having identified them in around February 2008. We compressed some timetables and I remember premiers saying to me: ‘Craig, this is ridiculous. Why would we have all of our own different systems for registering business names?’ There was a lot of cooperation, and that is continuing with the Barnett government in Western Australia, so it is not a matter of political partisanship here. Everyone recognises that we need to put an end to this kind of rail-gauge economics. I have heard the shadow minister say in the past that some of these reforms are really for bigger businesses and not for smaller ones, but I contend that new businesses that are setting up in Australia these days very often have a strong online presence. Once you have got an online presence, unless you are the Kosciusko Cafe in Cooma, you are probably trying to sell your goods and services across state boundaries. By the way, the reduction in fees will be dramatic. I have not got the figures in my head, but if you were operating in every state and territory you would have to pay eight sets of fees. Now you will have to pay one, and that will be a very important reduction in red tape and fees. The money that you asked about is basically the Commonwealth putting up money early to get the process underway for this single national system of registration. I will prefer to get back to you about the apportionment of money and take that one on notice, but we did provide for this in the agreement to create a seamless national economy under the national partnership agreement. The third set of questions you asked were on AUSTRAC. I am conscious of newsagents and other small retail outlets-for example, milk bars and 7-Eleven stores-where these transfers of moneys are an ancillary part of their activity. Where they are an ancillary part of their activity, they are not really making a lot of money out of the exercise. It may be, as much as anything, a matter of trying to attract a bit more foot traffic into the store or into the newsagent so people may buy some books or groceries. I am conscious of that and of the budget measure that involves a levy of $500, and $1.06, or a little over a dollar, per transaction. Can you let me take that one on notice. I have also met, as I suspect you have, with the relevant business interests there, and we will continue to engage in discussions. On the broader issue, I support the idea of a user-pay system for AUSTRAC but, as the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Small Economy, we need to have a careful look at these impacts. did very well covering the issues over the period of five minutes. tive input. In relation to the business names issue, could I get some breakdown on the effort? Some questions have been raised with me-though not hostile to the idea; nor am I-about the costs to the states in administering their schemes and how that washed through in that initiative. Where is that administrative burden and cost going to land? I could not work out from the material available to me and in the budget appropriation how that was being factored into that measure. Some insights on that would be good. Minister, on your point about the smaller operators, I was thinking in particular about A&J Floorsanding Pty Ltd. They are registered and operate in and around Sydney and have for some time. They are doing quite well. Then a totally unrelated business, not A&J but AJ Floor Sanding popped up, and there was an argument that there was sufficient difference in their MAIN COMMITTEE",151,Appropriation Bill No 1 2010 2011

284,Mr Billson (Dunkley) (11.11 Am),"Yes, I thought the minister was providing construcnames simply by not having the ‘&’ symbol. It turned out that it might have been a software problem to do with the ‘&’ symbol. I am curious as to how that may work out and the extent to which the initiative that you announced in the budget will help overcome and protect businesses from ambush marketing. In relation to other parts of the budget, we have inquired previously about business enterprise centres and the funding program that you are responsible for, Minister, and the work that was going on around performance objectives and KPIs-and I understand there was a process of developing those so there was clarity. How is that going? Do these appropriations foreshadow any new business enterprise centres? You would no doubt be aware that there is a perception that there are some gaps in the marketplace, that some geographic regions are not being serviced. A range of other influences were at play in the way locations were selected in the lead-up to the election-which tends to happen in the lead-up to an election. I am interested as to how that is going. I am also interested in the advocacy for small business within cabinet. Is Senator Carr getting adequate opportunity? I am sure you would like to be around the big table and be involved in those discussions. How is that working its way through? There is a sense that there has been an oversight of small business implications from decisions that are being made. I would like a sense of how that advocacy is being carried by Senator Carr in cabinet and then in the gang of four. I would appreciate your insights on that. Dr EMERSON (Rankin-Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy, Minister Assisting the Finance Minister on Deregulation and Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs) (11.14 am)-The member for Dunkley has obviously seen the breakdown of administered expenses and departmental funds for business names registration on page 20 of the portfolio statement. I am happy to provide any further detail we can on that. would perhaps be surprised to know that in some jurisdictions the systems are still paper based. I think you are talking about a software problem with the non-recognition of the ‘&’. The problems could even be worse than that in terms of still having paper based systems. The build of this national system is quite a sophisticated exercise. I would hope and expect, being a brand-new system in the 21st century, it will be capable of picking up these sorts of problems. It certainly will be a vast improvement on the systems that are now in place. I would like to go to the question about the business enterprise centres. I think it was in Senate estimates where there was a line of questioning to departmental officials-I know this did not come from you-as though there was something terribly sinister about a party in opposition deciding to fund a particular array of business enterprise centres, which at that time was 36 out of about 108. This meant, subsequently, further BECs being established. It was using the resources of opposition which, as you would be all too aware, are not extensive. Departmental officials were being asked about their level of involvement in the selection of these BECs. IfI had been at Senate estimates I would have said it was nil, because they would have told us where to go if we had approached the department as an opposition and said ‘Could you tell us where we might fund BECs’. WhatI did do in relation to that, which I thought was the best effort I could make, was to get a set of gradings, if you like, as imperfect as they might have been, from BEC Australia, MAIN COMMITTEE",153,Austrac For Some Of Its Anti Money Laundering Activities The $500 Annual Charge And The

286,Dr Emerson,"Yes, sure. What it involves is building a single national system. Youwho were familiar with them all. They said to us, ‘Look, these ones seem to be going especially well and these ones are going pretty well’. We did not stick to that religiously, but what I was conscious of doing was ensuring there was a reasonable geographic spread and anticipating the likelihood of the coalition asserting that they were all in marginal Labor seats. I wanted to assure myself that they were not. In fact, there was a very reasonable spread across coalition and Labor seats, marginal and safe. We just did the best that we could. The alternative, with the money I was able to get through our opposition budget processes, was to spread it across all 108 BECs, and they would barely have noticed the addition to their funding. I suppose another consideration is that the department would have had to administer amounts of, say, $25,000 in each of 108 BECs, so you can see the administration costs of that would have been higher. In terms of new BECs being added and so on, we have not in the budget identified any extra funding for BECs, so at this stage we need to stick with the 36 that we are funding. In terms of small business advocacy, I can assure the member for Dunkley that I have very good access to all of the relevant processes, including the Prime Minister, on small business matters. He was very supportive during the global recession of the small business tax break, and in fact he extended it, increasing it from 30 to 50 per cent. I must go more often to him with proposals, hoping and expecting that he will not only accept them but also augment them, as he did in this case! We do have the formal departmental processes as well, through coordination, comments and so on, where Minister Carr in a discussion would represent those views. In any event, a variety of formal and informal processes are available to me and I make sure that I take every advantage of those. I feel very happy that my views are heard and policies are developed in response. apologise to the member for Werriwa for missing the call before-and you were on my visionary side. I now call the member for Werriwa. you one-eyed. Minister, I am one of those who are very fortunate to have a funded BEC operating in my area-the Macarthur-Liverpool BEC, chaired by Bruce Hanrahan, a local solicitor. But, importantly, in my area of the south-west of SydneyI have approximately 10,000 small businesses. Quite clearly, the employment generator-and I suppose this is similar in most people’s electorates-is not going to be another big mining company. It is going to be the establishment of another small business and the development of those small businesses into larger ones. Minister, one of the issues we are often confronted with out there, in view of supporting small business, is particularly what is on offer to small businesses to encourage their development. The issue of tax reduction is always raised, and I know that has been addressed in the budget and I invite you to comment on that. Specifically to your portfolio in relation to small business online support and the small business support programs, these are matters that the BEC has indicated to me-for the people who use their services-have made significant inroads into developing and assisting small business to develop in my region of Werriwa. I would also like it if you could give us any information about the prospect of growth that is anticipated in the small business sector; how that is being monitored; and what further opportunities that we might have to develop small business, particularly in the innovative secMAIN COMMITTEE",154,Austrac For Some Of Its Anti Money Laundering Activities The $500 Annual Charge And The

288,Mr Hayes (Werriwa) (11.20 Am),"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I can never ever calltors. I am approached often about the issue of investment in innovation in the south-west of Sydney. It is an area which is developing. The fact that we have a very good infrastructure arrangement there between road and rail makes it a very clear area for the development of business operations in the south-west. Innovation is one of those areas which are being clearly targeted for localised investment. Dr EMERSON (Rankin-Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy, Minister Assisting the Finance Minister on Deregulation and Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs) (11.22 am)-I thank my friend and colleague the member for Werriwa for his strong advocacy of small business. During the global financial crisis we had a major forum in his electorate. It was very, very well attended and we were seeking to get tradies involved in the business of Building the Education Revolution and housing projects in the local area. I think that has been pretty successful. Regarding the Macarthur BEC and the other BECs, I met this morning in fact with BEC Australia and while I will not put any strong reliability on these figures-they are very, very preliminary estimates-the funding has enabled an increase in BEC activity of around 45 per cent. Interestingly, that is like a step-up increase. I also believe that the extended reach of the BECs is then built into their base ongoing growth because if you can reach further then more businesses will then seek to avail themselves of these one-stop-shop advisory services. The member for Werriwa asked about small business tax breaks. Also provided in this budget are two major initiatives for small business in terms of tax breaks. One is the availability from 1 July 2012 of an instant write-off of the value of any eligible asset up to an amount of $5,000. The instant write-off provides a benefit compared with pre-existing depreciation schedules because by writing off the value of that asset in the year in which it was purchased you get a cash flow benefit. Your taxable income is reduced and that is more cash flow for the business and a strong incentive to invest in productive assets. That is for every small business in Australia-all 2.4 million small businesses. The 720,000 small businesses that are companies would get a head start on the reduction in the company income tax rate from 30c to 28c in the dollar, starting on 1 July 2012. We know that those tax breaks are conditional upon the implementation of the resource super profits tax and, though I am probably whistling Dixie, I would urge the member for Dunkley to prevail upon his leader and change the coalition’s position on that matter, because small business deserves a tax break. It got a tax break from this government during the economic downturn, the small business tax break to which I referred in my earlier remarks, and we believe that as small business is moving gradually into the recovery phase it again deserves some support from the government in the extra incentive provided through tax breaks. The member for Werriwa asked about small business growth. I think the member for Dunkley would probably agree with me that small business overall is still struggling. The recovery is well under way, but small business has not fully emerged from that, by any means. Hopefully, over time as the recovery gains pace our small businesses will recover. I know small business retailers have been doing it tough in terms of the number of customers coming through the door and, interestingly, the amount that they are prepared to spend. You hear anecdotally all the time that customers these days are looking for discounts, so the margins on small business retailing have been reduced as a result. I think the reduction in hours associated with the economic downturn worked. Small businesses and other business did not so MAIN COMMITTEE much lay people off as negotiate reduced hours. Reduced hours mean reduced purchasing power, and so those consumers are becoming much more astute and discerning and therefore are seeking bargains-and that means lower margins for small businesses. In order to give the member for Dunkley a bit more time, I think I might leave it there. I would go on to the R&D tax offset otherwise; but I think in fairness we should give the member for Dunkley a go. garding the things in the industry portfolio that I alerted you to, it might be easier if I provide the questions and read the answers in the Hansard. Dr EMERSON (Rankin-Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy, Minister Assisting the Finance Minister on Deregulation and Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs) (11.27 am)-Yes, and then we will follow them up. end of next week? After that things move into a different mode. Could you see if you could get the replies back whenever you are able? It is not much use to us if the circus comes to town with electioneering and we have not got back any answers. A timely response would be highly valued. On the R&D tax credits, we are interested to know how much of the allocated funding will be spent on the administrative side of the new R&D tax credit program for 2010-11 onwards, specifically in relation to the changing staffing arrangements within the portfolio and an education campaign through AusIndustry to provide information to business about the new arrangements. Particularly given the sense that some of the novelty factors in the new requirements might be challenging for small business, I am interested in how that communication is going to be handled. In the automotive area, can the minister confirm that the structural adjustment side of the government’s Automotive Industry Structural Adjustment Program still has about $43.75 million assigned to it in 2011? We understand that about $7.8 million was paid on this side of the program in 2008-09 and we believe that there is approximately $18.9 million to be paid in 2009-10. It seems rather a large jump to $43.75 million, on the face of it, considering the period of time still to go. Can the minister outline why there is such a comparatively large increase in this financial year compared to the other years? Also, can the minister advise how many companies have received funding under the Automotive Industry Structural Adjustment Program. How many of those companies have merged and, if they have, with whom? I am interested to know how much revenue the government received from the luxury car tax in 2008-09 and 2009-10. That was not clear in the papers available to us. I know you have an interest in Commercialisation Australia, Minister. How many applications have been made for assistance through Commercialisation Australia since it was established? What is the total amount in funding that has been committed to successful applicants so far under the program? I have a similar question on the Green Car Innovation Fund. The budget papers seem to suggest the government has withdrawn about $200 million over three years from the Green Car Innovation Fund. I would like the minister to confirm that amount and outline the reasons for the cuts. I touched on the Green Building Fund earlier, and I would like an indication of MAIN COMMITTEE",155,Austrac For Some Of Its Anti Money Laundering Activities The $500 Annual Charge And The

290,Mr Billson (Dunkley) (11.27 Am),"Is there a chance we might get a reply before thewhen the round 4 grants might be available. I would like the minister to provide information on how much will be paid out in grants under round 2 of the ARC Linkages program and confirm that applications for funding under this round closed on 18 November last year. The successful projects were supposed to begin on 1 July but there has been no announcement of any kind and applicants are quite anxious to know whether they have been successful or not. Finally, I am curious about the funding commitment for the industry adjustment package for the automotive industry. That program is presented as transforming Australia’s automotive industry and it will involve some change in the way it operates. Is the government planning a similar adjustment package for businesses and staff that suffer dislocation as a result of the resource super profits tax? Is there a reference to that in the numbers that are being thrown around about the benefits of this tax? As the minister would know, it is not just the big companies like Rio and Xstrata that will be affected; it is also the small gravel pit operators, sand operators and those extracting fertiliser. Many small and family operated businesses will be deeply affected. I am just wondering whether, given the commitment to a structural adjustment package for the automotive industry, the government has an eye to a similar structural adjustment package for the resources sector. I will leave it at that. I thank the minister for his courtesy and his willingness to engage constructively in this process. Dr EMERSON (Rankin-Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy, Minister Assisting the Finance Minister on Deregulation and Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs) (11.31 am)-I will give a very brief answer because I am conscious of the desire of other ministers to respond to questions. In relation to the various questions you have asked about different programs, I will seek to respond but I cannot, in good conscience, give a date by which the department may be able to do that. I am not aware of any circuses coming to town, but if Ashton’s Circus is coming to town I am sure you will let me know! In relation to the resource super profits tax, I do not regard that line of questioning as being serious. We are still going through a consultation process as set out in the response to the Henry review. I would ask the coalition to reconsider its position opposing the resource super profits tax and, in the process, opposing small business tax breaks. The Liberal Party, a once great party that professed to be the party of small business, is now the party of small business betrayal. I think it is time the party rebadged itself, got on board and actually supported the 2.4 million small businesses in Australia that would benefit from the instant write-off of assets valued at up to $5,000 and the 720,000 small businesses that would get a head-start reduction in the company tax rate. Proposed expenditure agreed to. Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Portfolio Proposed expenditure, $655,547,000 ter. Minister, I have a series of questions. Firstly, can you guarantee that funding for agricultural research will not be cut as a result of the Productivity Commission review of RDCs? Can you also guarantee that primary producers and industry will continue to have a full say on what research is undertaken, without fear of government interference? By that, I do not mean that the government does not have individuals on the various bodies to have their say as everybody else does. Can you confirm whether the Department of Climate Change, Energy EffiMAIN COMMITTEE",157,Austrac For Some Of Its Anti Money Laundering Activities The $500 Annual Charge And The
291,Mr John Cobb (Calare) (11.34 Am),"I appreciate the opportunity to question the minisciency and Water has complaints lodged about work undertaken by any of the RDCs? Is it routine for any other department to comment or have input into the performance reviews of any of the RDCs, because the information we have is they have been making comments about what our various agricultural bodies have been looking into. On the issue of quarantine, has the minister seen a copy of the World Trade Organisation’s final ruling on the New Zealand apples dispute? If so, is there a good reason why it has not been released? Are media reports to the effect that the Minister for Trade has had a copy of it for some three weeks correct? For obvious reasons, we need to know what is in it and when it will be released and why it hasn’t been. If, as rumoured, it is an adverse finding on Australia’s biosecurity, will the government be appealing against that ruling and could you tell us to what extent we entered into the disputes committee’s procedure? On the issue of China, why has the import risk assessment, the IRA, failed to assess the impact of the Chinese fruit fly? I cannot pronounce the first word, but the second one is Suzuki. What action have we taken? There are reasons why the industry has not looked into itit has not come up until recently-but are we doing research into the ability of pears and apples to carry it as a host? Irrespective of this current analysis, will we be looking further into its ability to affect us and its ability to be carried, whether it is via America or anywhere else? It is a very pertinent question, particularly given the fact that they have an application currently before us, as you are well aware, which I understand is in the final throes of analysis by the relevant committee. Could you tell us where that is at? Would it be true to say that, as things stand, Chinese and New Zealand apples could be coming to Australia within the next six months? Fisheries and Forestry’s attention to the issue of Landcare funding and the decision to not proceed with the forecast expenditure, which involves an amount in excess of $10 million. The minister does continue to claim that because funding has gone up by $1 million Landcare funding has not actually been cut. I think we are splitting hairs in that regard, minister, because the feeling on the ground throughout regional Australia is that Landcare has suffered a blow in this budget. Your own budget papers indicate that Landcare is not getting the money that your government intended to give Landcare 12 months ago. For the sake of clarity, Minister, is it true that funding for Landcare has not been increased at the level that was originally planned by your government? What is the government’s justification for making that decision in relation to Landcare and what impact do you expect that decision will have on the reduction in practical environmental work undertaken by an estimated 100,000 volunteers across Australia and by more than 4,000 Landcare groups? Does the decision to not proceed with that forecast level of spending reflect some change in the government’s position regarding Landcare? Are you focusing on a different form of community based environmental action? I would appreciate some clarity on those points from the minister on behalf of the Landcare volunteers right throughout Australia, who I believe are the great champions of our environment through their practical work. I will just reflect for a moment, Minister. I am sure you are aware-you have been out in regional areas-that these people are bitterly disappointed. They are seeing this as some sort of diminishing of the government’s respect for the fact that they are prepared to give up their time, normally on a weekend, to get out there and get their hands dirty. These are the practical MAIN COMMITTEE",158,Austrac For Some Of Its Anti Money Laundering Activities The $500 Annual Charge And The
292,Mr Chester (Gippsland) (11.38 Am),"I want to raise the Minister for Agriculture,environmentalists of our nation. They are not the people writing reports; they are actually out there digging holes on a weekend, planting trees, undertaking pest animal and pest weed controls. They are the people who we really need engaged in the process. The reaction they have taken to this budget has been very negative. They believe there is some sort of diminished view of Landcare as a result of the government’s decision to not proceed with the original forecast level of expenditure. for Gippsland in relation to Landcare. Minister, I think there needs to be some greater clarity on where government policy is actually taking Landcare. We are all, to some degree, concerned about the environment generally and in our case as country members the environment in country areas. Obviously, under your ministry, you cover those areas. There are concerns out there that in the main can be alleviated, but there needs to be greater clarity on just where the real foot soldiers of Landcare and environmentalism at a local level are going and how they will seek direction into the future. I note that in some areas there are differences of view between the catchment management authorities and Landcare groups. Those sorts of issues will always be out there. But there is no doubt-just to reinforce what the member for Gippsland said-that these are the people who we really need on the ground to carry out a lot of these things. Advertisements on TV of what could be happening within their catchment are all very well, but these people, who are volunteers, who are ready to do a whole range of things, should probably be given a greater degree of recognition than they are currently given. Another question, Minister, is in relation to Liverpool Plains and the interface of that particular area with the prime agricultural land, the groundwater and surface water resources and the potential for massive mining development in those areas. I wonder where you stand, Minister, in relation to the potential offsite impacts on the water systems in the Murray-Darling river system. I am aware there are issues in Queensland in part of the Murray-Darling catchment. The Commonwealth is playing a greater role there and, in my view, it should. But I think there needs to be some real jurisdictional interpretations undertaken as to the state based planning processes for allowing mining activities to proceed. Now the Commonwealth is involved in water resources, it is obviously involved in the production of food in some of these very fertile areas. Just briefly, the minister may be able to report on another area. I note that there is money in the budget for the science of soil carbon. He may be able to report briefly on progress regarding those management practices that are encouraging the sequestration of carbon and on how government policy will encourage farmers to move in that direction? I will give you a little bit of background information so that you will understand why I have serious concerns about this particular issue. As the first elected conservative in the state seat of Burrinjuck in the New South Wales parliament, in the late 1980s, I raised the very serious issue of the importation of apples and pears from New Zealand and the inherent risk that that would place on Australia’s disease-free status, particularly in relation to fire blight. I raised the issue again in this place, in 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2004, and those issues are all on the record in Hansard. Given the recent press release by Biosecurity about their recommendations to introduce apples from Japan into this country and the inherent risks associated with that particular MAIN COMMITTEE",159,Austrac For Some Of Its Anti Money Laundering Activities The $500 Annual Charge And The

294,Mr Schultz (Hume) (11.43 Am),"Minister, before I ask the question I am going to askcause, can the minister give the apple and pear industry in this country some assurance that he is not going to be influenced by the recommendations of Biosecurity, who have as a matter of record in the past demonstrated their lack of scientific investigation into the actual problems associated with the introduction of apples and pears into this country, in particular from New Zealand? Can the minister also give a guarantee to this parliament, the Australian people and in particular the apple and pear industry that he will not take too lightly the serious ramifications of any recommendation by Biosecurity Australia to compromise the very safe biosecurity regimes that have operated in this country and have prevented disease from apples and pears from other countries coming into this country? I say this in the interests of the very real concerns from apple and pear growers across the country who are, once again, being placed in a situation where, with their limited resources, they have to fight a federal department whose track record has demonstrated time and time again that they are is not interested in the safety of Australia’s disease-free status but are more focused on the easy option of agreeing to pressure from organisations outside of this country in the interests of so-called free trade. well. I also rise to speak on the very important issue of apples and pears to my electorate of Mayo. The Adelaide Hills probably produce the finest apples in Australia. My apple and pear producers are extremely worried. I wrote to the minister yesterday on the Chinese import risk assessment that the shadow minister so eloquently put in his question to the minister. I am interested in that answer. In particular, is the department looking at possibly reopening that risk assessment given this new bug? I will not try and pronounce the name of the bug-you may be able to assist, Minister, in that respect. I am interested in the New Zealand aspect and the more pressing issue of the risk assessment of the Chinese situation. The second issue which was raised by the member for New England relates to prime agricultural land. In my area in the Adelaide Hills, the state government is opening up large parcels of land for housing development. Is an assessment being conducted by the federal agricultural department about the impact on our ability to produce food from inappropriate development on prime agricultural land? Certainly around Mount Barker this is a very contentious issue. This is a very important issue: where we choose to put houses and the use of areas that have fertile soil and good water-which are not always available in South Australia. Is an assessment being done on the risk here? I do not think the state Labor government in South Australia is doing enough in that respect. Population) (11.49 am)-CanI deal with the issues raised by the shadow minister first. I suspect I am going to want a few goes at my five minutes to work through the different issues that have been raised. I will deal first with the non-apple issues raised by the shadow minister, then deal with apples and then deal with the different issues that have been raised. First of all, the shadow minister raised the issue of the Productivity Commission review into the research and development corporations. I believe I can actually give him all the assurances he seeks by simply referring to the National Press Club speech I gave when the Productivity Commission inquiry was launched. There is no desire by government to use this as a mechanism to reduce funding. What we are trying to do is find ways for the money that is made available for research and development through the RDCs to be used far more effectively and efficiently than it has been. MAIN COMMITTEE",160,Austrac For Some Of Its Anti Money Laundering Activities The $500 Annual Charge And The
295,Mr Briggs (Mayo) (11.46 Am),I think you would agree with this line of questioning as,161,Austrac For Some Of Its Anti Money Laundering Activities The $500 Annual Charge And The
296,Mr Burke (Watson,"Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister forThe research and development corporations by and large do a very good job. I do not want to mince words on that; generally they do. For each of them. I do believe there are examples where they could use their money more efficiently than they do, which would result in more money being made available for research and development, not less. The key examples that I think you can focus on fairly easily are: first of all, there were a handful of them where executive salaries became completely out of control. I believe that whoever is the CEO of a research body is doing an incredibly important job. When their salaries got beyond the salary of the Prime Minister of Australia, and they were doing that off the back of farmers’ and taxpayers’ money, I think it was not a reasonable call. I spoke to them for a long time, asking them to do something about it. One of them moved a tiny bit but very few of them moved at all, and I do believe it is an appropriate issue for the Productivity Commission to have a look at. Secondly, there is the issue of co-location. We have more than half-a-dozen of the research and development corporations based here in Canberra, but they all have their own building, they all have their own conference room, they have their own payroll systems under different enterprise agreements and they have their own receptionist. I do not believe for a minute that there are not opportunities to co-locate, streamline and outsource some functions, even if the RDCs all want to keep their separate identities and not amalgamate. I really believe that at the moment there is money that could go to research and development-that farmers believe they are paying for the purpose of research and development and that taxpayers are pretty happy to contribute to in the matched funds-that, though it is not being thrown up against a wall, by any means, is not being used as efficiently as it could be. The intention of the Productivity Commission review is to find a way for the money that is provided to be used more effectively and efficiently than it has been. There are some people, including some in the electorate of New England, for example, who oppose the levies outright. It is a common view as well among beef producers in that part of the member for New England’s electorate. It is also a common view among a number of grain growers in Western Australia. It is not a view I hold. I am not opposed to the levy system. I actually think it works and works well for these reasons: firstly, if you believe that there should be an Australian government contribution to research and development-and I dothen the people who get the financial benefit from the research and development should pay a higher contribution than the general taxpayer does, and the levy system does exactly that; secondly, research and development is only of any use at all if it makes it from the lab to the farm and if farmers have been involved on the boards. If the farming organisations have had a direct stake in what is being chosen for the purposes of research, I believe that is the best way you can have of ensuring the extension part works-that the research actually makes it from the lab to the farm. My commitment to the current system is one where the more I have looked at it, the more I think it works. I think it is a smart structure. There are individual issues. Some of them have got more tied up in agri-political activity than I think is warranted for a research body. There are different areas where the money can be used more efficiently than it has been. But as a general rule the model itself is one I support and I have said so publicly previously. The next issue raised by the shadow minister concerns whether I am receiving information, advice and complaints from other departments on the work of the research and development corporations. The advice that comes to me on the RDCs comes from two sources: it comes MAIN COMMITTEE from my department and it comes from farmers. That is it; that is the only advice that comes to me. The extent to which other departments have chosen to engage in the Productivity Commission process, for example, I do not know the answer to, but I suspect the Productivity Commission would be able to provide very quickly which departments have made submissions to it. The advice that comes to me comes is from my department and from farmers, and I am not sure that advice on research and development corporations from any other department would be as useful to me as those two sources of information. We then go to the issues surrounding apples. I will deal with the issue of China and the issue of New Zealand separately because they are very different issues in terms of biosecurity. I first of all thank all members who participated in that discussion on apples for the fact that, without exception, everybody was arguing from a biosecurity perspective. No-one was arguing-in the questions that I heard and the way they were framed-from a protectionist perspective. I think that is a very important message not just for us to relay to each other but for the rest of the world to hear Australian politicians argue. Australia’s approach to biosecurity and quarantine has always been within the context of us being largely a free-trading nation. But we are also an island nation. There are pests and diseases which do not exist here, and Australia has every right to protect itself from those pests and diseases using the formula of the appropriate level of protection which has been used by both sides of politics for a very long time, which is that the level of protection should be for very low but not zero risk. If we sought zero risk, we know that that would mean that you would take no imports of anything, you would allow no tourists in or out of the nation and you would shoot all migratory birds as they approached the border. The approach of zero risk is one that no-one can deliver in any sensible public policy approach, but to minimise the risk is good and appropriate public policy, and that has had bipartisan support within Australian politics for a long time. I think the discussion we just had, the questions and the way they were framed affirmed that very strongly. I now go to the biosecurity issues which we are dealing with. With respect to New Zealand, we are talking principally but not solely about fire blight, in terms of the issues which have been raised. Drosophila suzukii-I always have to check that name-is the pest that we are talking about with China. Honourable member interjectingbiosecurity arguments there are the strongest ones in the sense that they have been around as arguments between the two nations for 70 years. When I was shadow minister for immigration, I took a quick trip to New Zealand as a guest of the then New Zealand government. I was shadow minister for immigration, and every discussion I had with every member of parliament or government agency began with a discussion about the migration of New Zealand apples to Australia. It is a massive issue for New Zealand, but fire blight is a massive issue for Australia, and we have every right to defend ourselves in every international court. There are protocols around WTO decisions, protocols which-from leaks that have appeared in the international press-it would be arguable that not everybody has followed. But there is a protocol that there is a gap between when the parties receive a ruling or a draft ruling from the WTO and when they are allowed to make it public. We observe those protocols to the letter. The final report is expected to be made public later in the year, possibly in July, MAIN COMMITTEE",161,Austrac For Some Of Its Anti Money Laundering Activities The $500 Annual Charge And The
297,Mr Burke,"I can spell it if you need that. I will deal with New Zealand first because thebut that will have to follow very strictly the WTO rules about when it is allowed to be made public, and the release of it would come not from me but from the Minister for Trade, as he has principal carriage of the issue. (Extension of time granted) The issue of an appeal obviously always depends on legal advice and is a call made by the Minister for Trade in the final instance, not by me, although it is an issue on which we do work closely together. Without in any way compromising the formalities of the process we are in, I will just say there is no difference between the vigorous way in which this government will defend Australia’s biosecurity in every international court and the way in which every previous Australian government has defended our biosecurity in every international court. I do not know that I can go any further than that without reflecting on information which at this point is still confidential. With respect to New Zealand, that applies to the fire blight issues surrounding both apples and pears. China is different. Since 1999, pears from China have been allowed into Australia. That means that a large number of biosecurity issues and the science on apples had in fact already been resolved to Australia’s satisfaction since 1999. The issue of the pest whose name I have pronounced once-and I will leave it at that; we will refer to them as the suzukii pesthas been raised by industry recently. I know the shadow minister has met with the peak industry body. The peak industry body were offered a meeting with my office, but it was not at a time they could do, in fairness to them, and we are still finalising another meeting. There is certainly no reticence from me or from them about sitting down and working through this issue. Any decision on the pest that has been referred to will be made on the basis of the science and will be made at arm’s length from the minister, as previous ministers have done. But a decision will be made on the basis of the science, and if the science says there is a biosecurity problem which has only recently come to light then I have no doubt that the Director of Biosecurity will act according to the responsibilities he holds in that job by making sure that the level of risk that is dealt with for Australia is kept at the appropriate level of very low but not zero. I cannot answer further than that, as the shadow minister would respect, without there being a ministerial direction of that nature to the Director of Biosecurity, and I think we would both agree that to go that distance would be inappropriate. In terms of particular references that have been made by others, any recommendations obviously will not be taken lightly but extremely seriously. I go to issues first raised by the member for Gippsland and echoed by the member for New England with respect to Landcare, and then there were a couple of other issues that were raised by the member for New England. On Landcare, I believe that part of the way in which the member for Gippsland described the issue is accurate. Some of it is, I think, rhetoric which does not quite match the truth, but some of it is accurate. Is there less money for Landcare? In the forward estimates of this budget, when compared to the forward estimates of the previous budget, the answer to that is yes. Is there more money for Landcare next year than there was last year? Yes. Is there more money again for Landcare the year after that? Yes. So what does that mean? First of all, in dollar terms, in 2009-10 there is $35.1 million for the National Landcare Program; in 201011, $36.2 million; and in 2011-12, $39.1 million. Would we all-everybody here-liked to have had a situation where the budgetary constraints were different and we had a whole lot more money for Landcare? Of course we would. But I do not believe it is reasonable to put it MAIN COMMITTEE in the terms that the member for Gippsland did. He said that this would result in a reduction in practical environmental work. You cannot increase the funds and reduce the practical environmental work. Mr Chester interjectingyears is in some way less than other expenditure and a reduction against CPI, there are rates of CPI being projected by the coalition which, I think, do not reflect what their shadow minister for finance or their shadow Treasurer would be saying is the case. But, Member for Gippsland, if you believe that the CPI is going to be running at those sorts of proportions over the next two years, by all means run that argument. But I do not think your economic spokespeople are matching that argument at all. In terms of Landcare, the member for New England went a little bit further and just asked: where is government policy taking Landcare? I dealt with a lot of these issues in a speech I gave to the National Landcare Conference in Adelaide. I believe Landcare in the future has to work on three pillars: food, environment and climate. I think those three pillars provide the basic framework for the work of Landcare, where work that has now been going for 20 years for the challenges of the past-whether they be soil degradation, salinity or soil moisture problems through drought-will also deal with a whole lot of climate challenges that we will be facing in the future. There have been areas where government policy in the first two years of government fell short and which we have acted to fix. Initially, when we got rid of the local facilitators, a number of members of parliament-including the member for New England and, I acknowledge, the member for Corangamite-argued vigorously with me that that was an error. We responded to that and we reinstated the facilitators on a local basis. Secondly, there are the community action grants. We had no small grants program. The only way to be able to access grants was to largely work in with a big project through the catchment management authorities or whatever the NRM bodies are called in the various states-certainly for the member for New England it is the CMAs. There were many small groups that felt they were shut out and could do good, practical work with smaller amounts of money than were being made readily available, so the community action grants were introduced. On the issues surrounding the Liverpool Plains, a large number of those in terms of final policy carriage, to the extent that there is a federal involvement, go to issues within the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts, through the water portfolio, because the issue of quality of downstream water is something that, to the extent it rests with the federal government, rests with that portfolio. But certainly, within the arms of government, my department does feed in information on those issues. In respect of this, though, there is an issue which was raised by the member for Mayowhich I have skipped; I am sorry. He refers to fertile soil, which is a similar argument to those about the changes in land use. This is something which does not rest at a federal level, and it is being dealt with very differently by different states. Tasmania, for example, has zoned agricultural land in particular ways to be able to make a zoning decision about preservation of fertile soil. One of the particular features of Australia since white settlement has been that MAIN COMMITTEE",163,Austrac For Some Of Its Anti Money Laundering Activities The $500 Annual Charge And The
298,Mr Burke,"If there is a view that an increase from $35.1 million to $39.1 million in twopeople move where the soil is at its most fertile and then put cities over the top of our best soil. It has been an ongoing practice. Some states are now starting to deal with that in new and creative ways, but I do not want to pretend that land zoning is a federal power; it is not. Finally, on the science of soil carbon, the work that we are doing on soil carbon is less than we had hoped to do. There was an extra $50 million on the table as part of the package surrounding the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme for research and development in agriculture, a good part of which was to go to soil carbon, coupled with a system of incentives whereby farmers would get cash for good work in soils. Some of that is now off the table because we were not able to secure passage of that legislation. Certainly, with the funding that we have available, there is more work being done in soil carbon than there ever has been before. It goes in two ways. One is in terms of measurement-not simply measuring the improvement in the soil but measuring how much carbon still finds its way out. The second is working out ways of integrating that with farm practices. There has been one simple rule that I have put over the programs there under Australia’s Farming Future: when research and development are being done into carbon sequestration, I want there to be an alignment between improved carbon levels in the soil and improved productivity. Regardless of where any other policy gets, if you get a productivity dividend, that is the best way of making sure you get uptake by farmers. you have made to the north-west coast, in particular, and for your representation of our primary industries. Minister, you are well aware that the forestry sector is a major industry in my electorate. I know the government established a number of funds to support businesses in the forestry sector. Would you please outline what support the government provided in the 201011 budget for our forests and wood products industry? for his ongoing interest in Corangamite. Minister, you recently announced a trial of drought reform in Western Australia. How did the government decide what measures to include in this trial, and when is it likely that that new system will be rolled out nationally? gave, and I thank you very much for your comprehensive answer particularly in relation to apples and pears. Is the agricultural land issue something that you think it is worthwhile the federal department having more of a role in, given the different policies state governments are applying to particularly housing developments and the risk as we go into the future that we are developing land that we should be retaining for food production? from the member for Mayo. It concerns a similar topic, given that in the Adelaide area much of the original agricultural land is slowly being swallowed up by urban development. When you combine that with the effects of climate change on our food production, can the minister comment on what policies and strategies are being implemented at federal level to overcome both of these serious concerns to our food security? Population) (12.11 pm)-I will first address the question of the member for Braddon on forestry, and then I will take the different issues raised in order.

303,Mr Burke (Watson,"Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister foravailable through the Forest Industries Development Fund. This allows businesses in the industry to apply-I know, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, you have an interest in this-for up to 30 per cent of funding for projects that add value to the forests and wood products industry. I think the fact that there has to be the 70 per cent contribution from the industry itself is an important way of making sure that what is funded is something that industry itself has judged to be in its best interests. It is expected, because we usually leverage more than this, that we will be able to leverage more than $20 million worth of investment from the private sector and other sources. There are places like the McKay mill and various other places I have visited on different occasions to see how this sort of government investment actually delivers for timber communities and delivers in the long term for jobs, notwithstanding the many challenges that are being faced by the forestry sector. Similarly, we also concluded the $6.3 million investment for research into the impacts of climate change on our forest systems and industries. The impacts of climate change are often thought of in terms of agriculture and are often missed in terms of forestry. There is research there which is important both in terms of the impact, for adaptation, but also in developing different accounting mechanisms. Forestry does particularly poorly out of the Kyoto protocol, under current accounting mechanisms, where there is a presumption that while a tree is vertical it is full of carbon but the moment it is horizontal all the carbon leaves. That is a method of accounting that does not match the science, and Australia has continued to pursue through international negotiations a correcting of that with a recognition of stored carbon, and research and development is able to contribute to that as well. The member for Corangamite asked about the trial of drought policy in Western Australia. Essentially what we are trialling there is something that there is never any political pressure on a government to do, which is to ask when there is not a drought, when times are good, whether you should bail out because there is no political pressure or whether that is actually the time to invest. The problem with waiting for the crisis is that you end up paying the banks rather than paying the farmer, and you do not necessarily reward those farmers who have made really tough decisions during good times and therefore have avoided crisis. They then look to their neighbour over the fence and ask, ‘How come they are getting the government money and I am not?’ The strength of this new approach is in being able to say that, with the exception of foodon-the-table money through household support, we will actually come in when times are good. We will help with proper risk management and proper planning and co-invest with the farmer on their own plan in the belief that we are then better able to manage the next crisis by farmers managing much more of it themselves rather than the government coming in at those times with the interest rate subsidy. That subsidy carries a whole lot of incentives which are terribly difficult to justify and which I believe cannot be separated from many of the mental health challenges that exist in many parts of Australia that are doing it particularly tough. The member for Corangamite also asked when that would be rolled out nationally. It will be reviewed at the end of the new financial year. We expect the nature of that review will take a few months. Following that review, depending on the findings, there would be an opportunity to start to roll it out. It is not the sort of trial where you could do a massive rollout in one hit, for the very simple reason that you do not want to undermine the value of the strategic MAIN COMMITTEE planning. If you try to do too many farms at once you end up not having enough good-quality people to help with the strategic planning and you end up creating an army of consultants with templates, on which you fill in the blanks, as a way of them getting a whole heap of government money and the farmer getting less than they should. It only works if it is done in an incremental way that then allows good-quality strategic plans to be developed. That means that, even if the trial is successful, I suspect we will be in a transition process for some time as we move from the old system to the new. I would hate to undermine good-quality planning by trying to roll out something too quickly. The members for Makin and Mayo both asked questions concerning land use, agricultural land and urban development. If the Deputy Speaker turns a blind eye for a moment, this has probably got more to do in some ways with some of the work that is happening under the population portfolio, which I hold but which is not currently before this room because we are dealing with a different set of government appropriations. The issues of food security, where people live and whether our urban planning has been as smart as a nation as it needs to be are all issues that are coming through the consultative process which I announced yesterday in population. They are issues which have always been raised with me as the minister for agriculture, where I have been able to carry the stakeholder concern without ever having any of the policy carriage. In population strategy many of these issues come directly to the forefront. It is not only an issue in South Australia but also an issue in, for example, Western Sydney, where once again the most fertile land is also the land that carries the highest financial value for the next round of urban development. These are significant concerns. This does not mean we are about to run out of food-and I do not want us to become too alarmist with the debate. We are still a massive food-exporting nation, but the question is: are we using a precious resource in the smartest possible way? It is a level of strategy that previously we have never applied. It is one of the issues that are being raised with me. I do not want to pre-empt the consultative process; I want only to say that it will be one of the issues that is fed in through that portfolio. call that you came to Bundaberg-very graciously, I might add, and very helpfully-and we talked about the problem of bats. Bats are a big problem, especially in fruit-growing areas. Long debate has ensued over how they should be controlled. I for one am not into the wholesale slaughter of wildlife at any cost, but there are other methods, which you have heard about-shooting the scouts. In view of the fact that this is having a big impact on fruit crops on the one hand and in view of the links between bats and viruses in horses on the other, what is your current thinking with regard to that and what negotiations have you had with your state colleagues? Population) (12.19 pm)-I thank the member for Hinkler for the question because it goes to one of the great tensions that arise in the policy debate-and he has hit both of them. It is an issue that can have a devastating impact on producers and a tragic impact on people. If we were talking about an exotic, invasive species then the arguments would be simple, immediate and almost entirely contained within my portfolio. But because the question largely goes to native animals the restrictions on action bring in another area of policy in terms of our native biodiversity and therefore the final approval rests not with me but in another portfolio.

What is the government’s approach to agroforestry? Population) (12.21 pm)-I prefer to refer to it as ‘agriforestry’ although I know the sector calls itself ‘agroforestry’. I do think there are benefits in having the same minister responsible for both agriculture and forestry. Very often the agriculture and forestry sectors have regarded themselves as being in opposition. They seek approval for the same parcels of land. Sometimes that sense of opposition has been pretty accurate. That has often been how things have transpired. The work that the member for Corangamite has taken me out to see in his electorate is deeply impressive. There is some success with cropping but particularly in grazing. Strategically based high-value timber actually helps with shading. In the examples I have seen in Corangamite you end up with a timber resource being planted on the land and stock numbers can be increased as a result-you are on a smaller parcel of land, your soil is healthier, the shade is more appropriate, you have windbreaks and you also have an asset for the farmer. There are some areas where it will work more effectively than others-where there are mills or ports there is always a market for the timber. This means it is not something that works on every single farm. But it is something which I think has suffered from the fact that agriculture and forestry, while within the same department, have usually been dealt with by separate ministers. To that end, we have started to align some opportunities where previously that had not happened. The new business plan for Caring for Our Country quite specifically allows the agricultureforestry mix to receive funding. Similarly, we have someone directly involved with agriforestry on the National Landcare Council to make sure they are feeding into the landcare agenda. There will be parts of Australia where this is not a deal. There will be parts of Australia where the old conflict continues. But there will be parts of Australia, such as Corangamite, where this is a very real opportunity for farmers to effectively give up part of their land for its traditional purposes to plant a new asset. They may well get a benefit of soil carbon from that. Additionally, there are benefits through the growth of the resource itself when it is time for the timber to be harvested. Finally, in the examples I have seen, it has resulted in the land remaining for agriculture having an increase in both its productivity and the total production of that area. You often get talk of win-win outcomes in government. Agriculture and forestry working together is clearly one of those. Proposed expenditure agreed to. Debate (on motion by Mr Melham) adjourned.

Hinkler Electorate: We Care2 Leader of the Opposition to the marvellous work being carried out by the We Care2 organisation in Hervey Bay. We Care2 is the not-for-profit welfare arm of the Hervey Bay Christian Church, which supplies emergency relief, counselling and food to residents in need. Its food supplies come from the Foodbank network, other Queensland suppliers and generous farmers and are distributed through a virtually non-profit supermarket which turned over $350,000 to May of this year and is currently turning over about $10,000 a week. Led by Pastor Robert Geluk and CEO Duncan Croxon, We Care2 is a unique organisation, and the value of its support services cannot be questioned in these difficult financial times. Its important work is evidenced by the fact that around 3,800 locals are registered clients, 2,000 of them as regulars, out of a district population of 65,000 people. That is the equivalent of one in every seven families in the Hervey Bay area using its services. More recently, We Care2 has been the engine room of a program providing personal toiletry kits to homeless youths in the Hervey Bay area. Its We Care Bags project has involved a wide cross-section of the community, with the Hervey Bay RSL donating $2,000 towards the cost of materials to make around 1,000 toiletry bags, many volunteers sewing the bags and still more people working hard to fill them with personal hygiene products-soap, toothpaste et cetera-donated by the general public. It is hoped that these bags will last for about 12 months and will send a clear message to those living on the streets that the wider community cares about their welfare. I must also praise the Fraser Coast Chronicle and its editor, Peter Chapman. They have tirelessly supported this project and promoted it far and wide. I have mentioned the good work being done by We Care2 and the support it receives from the local community. NowI will mention what I want to see for it in the future. I believe We Care2 requires ongoing recurrent funding to ensure that it can continue the services and welfare that it has supplied to date. In the last calendar year, We Care2 gave away, in the form of emergency aid, food valued at $55,000-that is over and above its Commonwealth emergency money and its supermarket operation. It will be almost impossible to continue this without some form of recurrent outside funding. As I mentioned, the emergency relief funds of around $28,000 are nowhere near sufficient for the level of demand that the organisation meets. This could be solved if We Care 2, and other grassroots organisations doing similar work, were eligible to receive a modest annual funding allocation from the Commonwealth. In the case of We Care 2, an additional $50,000 a year would ensure that the thousands of people who rely on its discount supermarket can continue to do so. In the words of board member and secretary David Rees: “After countless fruitless applications for funding, We Care2 simply resolved to get on with doing whatever can be done with its limited resources. It has done very well and it has certainly helped the community at no cost to Government but it can no longer continue to do so without significant help.

I am very proud of the way the local community has rallied behind this organisation and I am proud to be associated with it. Parliamentary Business today. As this term of parliament ends, I do want to express my regret that what was I think a significant reform of parliamentary business did not proceed as I had expected. I am talking about private members’ Fridays, the idea that we should devote a parliamentary sitting day to private members. You could not have parliamentary secretaries or ministers but you could have shadow ministers, shadow parliamentary secretaries and ordinary members and if the subject matter were good enough-say there was an interesting report being tabled or there was a particular private member’s notice of motion being debated-it would have clear air in terms of attracting media interest. I cannot say the proposals of the Rudd government were unique, because New South Wales has had private members’ Fridays for many years. It is a great irony that the then Leader of the Opposition and the Manager of Opposition Business both came from the sovereign state of New South Wales, where this has been the practice. In retrospect, I could say that it was a function of a government going into opposition and the one thing rallying it was to object to this particular initiative. As the former Chair of the Procedure Committee in the Main Committee chamber, I say perhaps it might have been better digested through the Procedure Committee. But I must confess I did not see the opposition to it coming, and it certainly blindsided me and others. I think the current arrangements for private members’ business are abominable and I do hope that in the new parliament we will go to something that is much better. There is a proposal from the Procedure Committee for that to happen, which will be tabled shortly. I predict that it will be a long time before we see another proposal for a day exclusively devoted to private members’ business-and more is the pity because I think this sells short the activities, interests and passions of members on both sides of parliament. The other thing that I want to comment on is the abolition of the selection committee. Previously, to select private members’ business we had a selection committee chaired by the Deputy Speaker with whips on both sides nominated to it and also some backbench members. The reality of the way it operated, and I compliment Deputy Speaker Ian Causley on this, was very business like. He would ask the Chief Government Whip, Mr Bartlett, what he wanted to select and then he would ask me, as the Chief Opposition Whip, what I wanted to select and that was it. It was all over-wham, bam and thank you, ma’am-in about one minute, but the coffee and biscuits were nice and there were a lot of minutes taken and papers produced and distributed. That has been replaced by a whips meeting, and I can say that the whips do attend that meeting and there is not the formality of paper preparation or minute taking. I am pleased to say that an Independent member-Rob Oakeshott, the honourable member for Lyneattends, which never occurred with the old selection committee, and the informality of the meeting allows us to sometimes discuss other matters.

310,Mr Price (Chifley) (12.30 Pm),"I want to talk about a couple of parliamentary thingsThey say that, because it is a whips meeting, it must be political. I can say to people that I have never prevented anyone saying anything in this parliament. It is true that I have occasionally selected a more moderate and balanced motion about a particular matter rather than an extreme motion. I am not aware of my counterparts either censuring or prohibiting any of their members from raising issues. SoI think the system has worked well. I think the Independents do have a right to have their voices heard on these matters and, under these arrangements, they currently are being heard. Sometimes they are able to raise other difficulties they may have, which are addressed by both the Chief Opposition Whip and me. I would commend the new arrangements and I suspect they will go on into the future. Ethiopia: Ogaden Community electorate and I want to raise one in particular in the House today. I was met by representatives of the Ogaden Community Association of Western Australia. My electorate of Stirling is extremely diverse. It is the most multicultural part of Western Australia. We also get the largest number of humanitarian arrivals of any seat, with the exception of another in New South Wales. The concerns expressed to me by the Ogaden community were grave concerns about the human rights situation within their homeland. The Ogaden region is actually known as the Somali state-the Somali provincial government-within Ethiopia. It is at the crossroads of what is a pretty benighted area that has been subject to very serious civil and international conflict. There is conflict with the states that border Ethiopia-Eritrea and Somalia-and there is civil conflict within Ethiopia itself. The result is that this is an incredibly poor and disadvantaged part of Ethiopia, which is of course quite a poor and disadvantaged country. But the Ogaden region has particular difficulties. The representatives of the Ogaden community said to me that what is happening there, through the Ethiopian government, is very similar to what is happening in the Darfur region of the Sudan. Of course, people here would be very familiar with that conflict, whereas the conflict in the Ogaden region is not as widely known. I listened very carefully to what my constituents had to say. They are very concerned about relatives and friends that they have back in their homeland. It is very difficult to communicate with people there. But the reports that they are getting of murder, rape, extensive sexual violence against women and burning down of their villages are greatly concerning to me. I gave them an undertaking that I would raise this matter in the Australian parliament and also raise it with the foreign minister, because Ethiopia is in receipt of a significant amount of Australian aid. Clearly, the Australian government has every right to express human rights concerns to the Ethiopian government. I will be separately contacting the foreign minister to urge him to do this, and I am sure he will. Following that meeting I went back and checked on the veracity of the claims that were put to me by representatives of the community. There is plenty of evidence from international organisations, such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, that what was put to me about what is happening in the Ogaden region is certainly true. The military forces of the Ethiopian government are engaged in a campaign against the local separatist movement. That separatist movement is quite a brutal movement. There is plenty of blame to go around. Regardless of that, the treatment that the Ogaden people have been subject to at the hands of the Ethiopian military is incredibly disturbing. The Ethiopian government does not allow much MAIN COMMITTEE",171,Adjournment
311,Mr Keenan (Stirling) (12.36 Pm),"Last week I had a lot of constituent meetings in myaccess to that region by international organisations. Indeed, the Red Cross was actually expelled from there. It is pretty serious for a government to expel the International Committee of the Red Cross. When they do things like that, they are clearly trying to avoid scrutiny by the international community. The reports are that the Ethiopian military, in their campaign in pursuit of the Ogaden National Liberation Front, will go into villages and tell the villagers that they need to abandon their village. If that is not done, they will return within a couple of days and burn that village down. They will also afflict quite horrendous treatment on the local people. The Australian government, particularly as a donor to the Ethiopian government, needs to use all its good offices to say that the international community does have an interest in what is going on in that region, that we are watching and that we do not believe that what is happening there is acceptable. We should use all our good offices both as a government and as a parliament to highlight that. I congratulate members of the Ogaden community who have come to see me to raise my awareness of what is a very little understood conflict. I give them my undertaking that I will use all of my best efforts to highlight what is going on in their homeland. Vocational Education and Training Ms HALL (Shortland) (12.41 pm)-I believe that the opportunity to access education is possibly the most important thing that any government can give to Australia as a nation. Education is about our future. The fact that not all young people in Australia access education at a level that will prepare them for life is, I think, one of the very sad features of our society. I believe that the Rudd government has really concentrated on trying to make education freely accessible for all young Australians and, at the same time, make it relevant for young Australians. Catherine is a young person who has just finished university and has been working in my office this week in Canberra. I asked her to identify a topic that she thought was of vital importance, something that she felt passionate about. The topic that she chose was education. It is coincidental that last night in the chamber I spoke about the importance of education, the importance of Building the Education Revolution, the importance of trade training schools and the importance of enabling young people to obtain the education they need. I would like to share with the House some of the words that Catherine has written for me. It is always very good to be able to look at these issues from somebody else’s perspective and not just from mine, as a member of parliament. I am somebody who has been here a while now, somebody who connects with their electorate very strongly and visits schools on a regular basis. But, still, I am somebody who looks at education from the perspective of having been in this job for quite a while. I find that Catherine’s thoughts coincide with mine very closely. She is not a person who has been involved in the Labor Party or anything like that. Here are the words she has written for me. I would like to take this opportunity to discuss the importance of vocational training experiences for young people. In my electorate, school retention rates in some areas are very low. Schools recognise this trend and have been working on the development of vocational training opportunities, which is an area of importance identified and expressed by students, as MAIN COMMITTEE was reiterated at a school leaders working luncheon that I have mentioned previously. I had a working lunch with the leaders from the schools in my electorate. In the Hunter and the Central Coast-they are the areas that the Shortland electorate covers-the retention rate, as recorded by the Department of Education and Training, for years 7 to 10 is 91 per cent. However, this drops dramatically for years 10 to 12, where the apparent retention rate in 2009 was 58.3 per cent, which is lower than other regions in New South Wales. I might add that the rate for the Central Coast is the lowest in Australia. In recognition of these trends, there is a growing focus by schools in my electorate on the provision of vocational and more hands-on, practical skills development. Recognising the different skills areas and interests of young people and encouraging development in these areas builds confidence-assuring them that they can make a positive contribution to Australia’s workforce-and encourages continuation of studies in senior high school. In my electorate on the Central Coast, Gorokan High School, Lake Munmorah High School and Northlakes High School will be receiving funding towards facilities to better enable more vocational training. The measures include upgrading hospitality, engineering and construction facilities. The importance of giving young people the opportunity to gain practical experience that they can apply in the workforce cannot be undervalued. Catherine really believes that the most important issue for government to address is education and ensuring that young people who attend our schools have the skills that they need for the future.

It is surrounded by a picturesque World Heritage listed national park and stunning river systems including the Hawkesbury-Nepean river. Protecting the way of life which we all enjoy is absolutely critical to the ongoing sustainability of our region. It is important to keep debt and inflation down in order to ease the burden of interest rates, particularly for families and small businesses. This is essential to continued growth in our local economy. Securing the future for our young people by developing and delivering programs that provide them with opportunities to build for the future is a key priority. In recent years I have been running an annual youth leadership forum and this year will see the inaugural Macquarie Youth Leadership Forum, named after and in honour of Lachlan Macquarie. This year is the 200th anniversary of his appointment as Governor of New South Wales. The forum is dedicated to developing future leaders through practical exposure to core leadership values such as service to others, integrity and courage. It is critical that the community invests in today’s youth. The forum provides an opportunity for students to begin asking themselves questions about their life, their future and the manner in which they will conduct themselves, inspiring them to reach their fullest potential. The forum has a great program, featuring speakers from all walks of life. On the final Saturday a community project that responds to the needs of the local community will be conducted. These young people often do not want to leave on the Saturday night when their parents are waiting for them. MAIN COMMITTEE",172,Adjournment

I will be fighting to increase safety on our local roads across the Hawkesbury and the Blue Mountains-roads such as Freemans Reach Road, Comleroy Road, Terrace Road at North Richmond, Jennings Road in Faulconbridge, The Avenue in Valley Heights and the Bells Line of Road, to name a few. Working towards decreasing the amount of freight on our roads is vitally important to local road safety. While we need to make roads safer, there is a need for a long-term plan. We cannot afford to make rash decisions with policy on the run, as the Labor government so often does, because we cannot afford to get safety wrong. Community safety is also a key concern. CCTV cameras would be of great assistance in the fight to improve community safety, particularly around our parks and public places.

The Nepean Hospital’s specialist took maternity leave but was not replaced. While specialists are available at Westmead Hospital, families have been told they cannot access them due to local health catchment area rules. Whilst receiving wonderful care from the staff at the Nepean, these families still have no access to a specialist-this is unacceptable in the 21st century. I call on the New South Wales government to return a juvenile endocrinologist to the Nepean Hospital. Access for women in our region to breast-screening services has also been removed in the past year. Funding for mobile screening vans was quietly axed in September 2009 and local women are only now realising they must organise to travel for a mammogram. One in nine New South Wales women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime. I have launched a petition calling on Labor governments to return mobile breast-screening units to New South Wales. In addition to these many health concerns it slipped out late yesterday that the national funding authority for Mr Rudd’s grand hospital plan is to be abolished before it has even been created. The national funding authority was to provide transparency and accountability so that federal funding and taxpayer dollars would not be diverted by the states or misused, as they have been by so many states, with federal programs such as Building the Education Revolution. The states must be held accountable for the money they spend. We cannot afford to have Labor governments keep throwing good money after bad. We need real action on these local issues. The Rudd Labor government has wasted millions of dollars on local school hall ripoffs, money which could have been better spent on tackling local crime or filling potholes in our local roads. The Rudd Labor government has promised much but delivered little, failing our community. People shake their heads at the long list of broken promises and all the waste. The Hawkesbury and the Blue Mountains are struggling to cope now. What they need is investment in health, investment in roads, investment in their community safety. (Time expired) Daw Aung San Suu Kyi Ms SAFFIN (Page) (12.51 pm)-On Saturday it will be the 65th birthday of Burma’s Aung San Suu Kyi and about the 14th birthday that she has spent incarcerated. She is currently serving a three-year jail sentence which was commuted to 18 months house arrest by Burma’s military dictator, General Than Shue. The UN Working Group On Arbitrary Detention recently issued an opinion, No. 12/2010 on the incarceration of Aung San Suu Kyi. It said ‘the continuation of the deprivation of liberty of Ms Aung San Suu Kyi is arbitrary, being in MAIN COMMITTEE contravention of articles 9, 10, 19 and 20 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights’. It further said ‘she was not informed of the reasons for her arrest, had ineffective remedy to challenge her detention, no records were given to her, she was never informed of her rights, she has been denied communication with the outside world and is being detained because of her political views’. This was the fifth opinion. All the opinions find that she is arbitrarily detained. This started in 1992. The latest fiasco arose when a man called John Yettaw, a US citizen, swam across Lake Inya and gained entry to Suu Kyi’s house. This was a misguided adventure by a person who by all accounts is an unwell person. As a result, Suu Kyi was charged with breaching the terms of her house arrest under section 22 of the State Protection Law 1975-a very draconian law. Burma Campaign Australia have invited prominent women from around Australia, including women in this place, to be ambassadors for Aung San Suu Kyi from 19 June until 24 October and use our public profile to raise awareness of Aung San Suu Kyi’s continued detention and struggle for human rights and democracy in Burma. They have said that our being ambassadors will tell her that the world has not forgotten her despite her having been under house arrest for more than 14 years. It will also tell the people of Burma that we support their struggle for democracy. It is important that they get to hear that message from we who have our freedom. In a report to the UN Human Rights Council, the UN Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in Myanmar, Tomas Quintana, called for consideration of a commission of inquiry to look into whether war crimes and human rights violations have been committed in Burma. The UK, the Czech Republic and Australia have signalled some support for that, and that support is growing. I know that all members in this place on all sides of politics join together to give support in the particular area. The National League for Democracy was the party that Aung San Suu Kyi led in the 1990 election. They were not able to take up their positions in parliament because the military dictatorship would not allow them to do so despite their having won 392 of the 485 seats contested-not a bad win. The party no longer exists as a so-called legal entity because of the five election laws that were introduced by the State Peace and Development Council in Burma. The National League for Democracy released what was called the Shwegondaing Declaration, which set out four benchmarks for the election process to be considered credible or legitimate: the immediate unconditional release of all political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi; an inclusive review of the 2008 constitution, which is a military constitution; elections to be carried out in a free, fair, open and inclusive manner under international supervision; and recognition in some way of the 1990 election result. The regime has said there will be an election sometime this year. By any account, by any benchmark, it cannot be free and fair. There is no way anybody could determine that it would be and nobody expects it to be. It will be a wasted opportunity because there are so many people who are willing to change Burma and transition it into what they want, which is a free country. But it does not happen. More people have been arrested and detained. Question agreed to. Main Committee adjourned at 12.57 pm MAIN COMMITTEE",174,Adjournment
