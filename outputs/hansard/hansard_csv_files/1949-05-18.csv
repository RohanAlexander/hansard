October, 1947,1 asked the Prime Minister whether his Government had decided that there was no need to appoint a royal commission of inquiry into Communist activities and he replied that nothing had been disclosed to that date to ""warrant a special inquiry, but that should occasion for such action arise the necessary action would be taken. In view of recent and serious disclosures that Australian Communists are acting as a fifth column for a foreign power, sabotaging our naval construction programme, rigging trade union election ballots and calling strikes without consulting the members of the unions affected thereby, is the right honourable gentleman now convinced that circumstances warrant a complete investigation of Communist activities in Australia, and will heOctober, 1947, by instituting such an investigation? ment to which the honourable member has referred. I now merely wish to repeat that I and the Government believed then and still believe that it would be completely futile to appoint a royal commission to inquire into communism. For some years past rhfl political party to which the honourable member belongs has been in office in three of the States. It, has had ample opportunity to appoint royal commissions to inquire into communism but it failnd to do so until quite recently when the Victorian Government, I understand, undertook to hold such an inquiry. Those facts are evidence, as I indicated previously, of the complete futility of instituting such inquiries.

5,Mr White,"The Minister forbill to the effect that immigrants arriving in Australia should be made to sign an undertaking that they are opposed to the over-throw of the Government by revolutionary means. Will the Minister examine the Immigration Act to see whether this provision can be made to apply to Mr Thornton and Mr the Australian Shipping Board and the Dixon, who are at present overseas, the former in Moscow and the latter in Prague? If it is found that the existing provisions cannot be made to apply, will the Minister introduce at an early date and amendment of the act so that those professional revolutionaries may be kept out of Australia ? able member for Parkes murmur something about the "" Thornton-Dixon Line "". Thornton and Dixon are Australian citizens, and do not come under the provisions of the Immigration Act. The amendment which the honourable member proposed, and which I accented, was born of our experience when we visited the United States of America, and where we were required to give an undertaking that we did not favour revolution, were not Communists, and did not seek the overthrow of constituted authority by force. The honourable member suggested that immigrants entering Australia should give a similar undertaking. T agreed, and the act was amended accordingly. That was one of the honourable member's bright ideas, and I give him full credit for it. However, I do not see how we can amend the Immigration Act so as to affect the status of Australian citizens who are overseas, and wish to return to Australia. The House would not like me to give a dissertation, even if T wanted to, on the merits of the WalshJohnson incident when the Bruce-Page Government tried to deport the two men, neither of whom had been born in Australia. The High Court ruled that there comes a time in the life of a person admitted to Australia from overseas when he ceases to be an immigrant and becomes an ordinary citizen of Australia. Thornton came to Australia at an early age, and is now accepted as an Australian citizen. Dixon was born in Australia. I cannot see how the honourable member's suggestion could be accepted by me or by any other member of the Government. COAL. representing the Minister for Shipping and Fuel what is the number of ships allocated for carrying coal on the Australian coast? What are their ages and speeds ? Has the Minister power to direct Joint Coal Board with respect to coal cargoes ? If so, will he give specific directions that the fastest of the coal ships shall be placed on the long run to South Australia ? answer the honourable member's question in detail. I shall obtain the information he seeks from the Minister for Shipping and Fuel. I assure the honourable gentleman that my colleague will do his utmost to see that fair allocations of coal shall reach South Australia. It must be recognized that the shortages which we are suffering from at present are due in part to the measure of prosperity which we are now enjoying. The consumption of electricity in Australia has increased by 75 per cent, since 1939, and it is inevitable that as the result of that increased demand for electricity which, of course, is due to the fact that our factories are working at fuller capacity than they did in 1939 and also to the fact that Australian workers are sufficiently prosperous to buy electrical appliances which in themselves consume a considerable amount of current, the demand for coal is. greatly in excess of the demand that had to be met in pre-war years. If any blame is to be attached to any one for present-day shortages it must be laid at the door of those anti-Labour governments which, before the war, failed to envisage the measure of prosperity which the country is enjoying to-day.

I discussed the matter at some length with the Minister for Works and Housing, who has interested himself in it. Interest rates as they affect war service homes and certain otber housing schemes have been fully considered by the Government. The Government has decided that, at present, it is unable to make any further concessions in interest rates. that many thousands of Australians are still without homes, can the Minister for Works and Housing say when his department expects that the lag will be overtaken?

[s it intended to make a statement to the House at an early date on these matters. -Defence will answer the question. good deal of speculation in the press regarding a Pacific pact. From the stand-point of this Government, the position is quite clear. In various statements to the House it has been indicated that our defence policy is based, first, on an international security force set up under the auspices of the United Nations organization, when that becomes possible; and, secondly, on the development of our plans for the integration of Australia's defence policies of other members of the British Commonwealth of Nations. Our proposals along those lines have been accepted by the United Kingdom and New Zealand. It is the belief of the Australian Government that since, at the moment, it seems to be impossible to get other nations on the Pacific littoral to join in a Pacific pact, the best we can do for the present is to develop our plans on the lines of integration with the plans of the United Kingdom and New Zealand. Proposals to this end are under consideration and plans on that basis are now being developed.

43,Mr Chifley,"The subject, as theall surplus meat in Australia should be accepted by the British Such a condition is necessary if the Australian Government is to embark upon substantial capital expenditure to increase the production of meat. Following discussions with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Stafford Cripps, and later with the Minister for Food, Mr Strachey, the British Government has given certain undertakings. subject to certain conditions connected with the practicability of producing additional meat .in Australia within a reasonable time. That task cannot, of course, be accomplished in five minutes, but will require a fairly long period. Negotiations will have to be conducted on an expert level in regard to such matters as price. My officers and I did not deal with that subject. It comes within the province of the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, and his officers, who are the most competent persons to discuss arrangements regarding prices. It would be most difficult to construct railways from other States into Central Australia, because such works would require a great deal of labour and materials, which could not be obtained for a fairly long period. Therefore, the general suggestion has been that, although some railway construction may be undertaken, roads should be built to various meat-producing areas in order that greater quantities of meat may be obtained. I do not think that I am able to give about the subject at the moment, but I shall have a statement prepared setting out what has happened to date. The general matter has been placed in the hands of a sub-committee of Cabinet and a departmental sub-committee, which are working closely and quickly on the subject. An essential requirement to the carrying out of capital works would be the provision of certain materials for the improvement of properties, and road-making and earthmoving equipment for the construction of roads not only in northern Australia but also from Wyndham in Western Australia and perhaps from Bourke, Thargomindah, areas in Queensland. manufacture Mr OMfley. such material and equipment in this Government. country, but unless it is made available it will not be possible to carry out any plans of that character. However, that matter is being examined for the United Kingdom Government by the British Ministry of Food, through the Overseas Food Corporation, for the purpose of ascertaining the possibilities. I shall not give a Those undertakings are detailed answer to the latter portion of the honourable member's question, because the subject is intricate, and any reply that 1 might make would necessarily occupy a considerable time. Briefly, however, the Australian Government has not asked the United Kingdom Government to engage in any capital expenditure in the matter. Commerce and Agriculture any information concerning further advances by the Australian Government on account of the apple and pear marketing scheme for the 1947-48 Tasmanian crop? to inform the honourable member that the arrangements which the Australian Government made for the marketing of the Tasmanian and Western Australian apple and pear crops for the 1947-48 season have had most satisfactory results. Prior to the opening of the season. 1 visited the Huon Valley, in Tasmania. much additional information The growers of that State requested that an additional payment of Is. a bushel be made to them on account of the marketing of that particular crop. They were informed that the Australian Government was prepared to place at their disposal the experience and marketing organization of the Australian Apple and Pear Marketing Board, and to make available to them all the profits that, might accrue from the marketing of the crop in the United Kingdom. The result has been that they have received the advance which was then fixed, plus the dividend of Is. a bushel, and I am glad to be able to announce an additional dividend of 4d. a bushel and that Cunnamulla and similar there will be what I may describe as We do not a "" fractional clean-up p a y m e n t A sufficient quantities of similarly satisfactory state of affairs exists in Western Australia, where an",17,Blackburn Recentl Y I Is To Be Provided And In What Manner

Arrangements are being made by the Department of Commerce and Agriculture to announce the appointment of the board as soon as possible in order that it may be in working >rdcr and have its organization complete in readiness for the handling of apple and pear exports on a pre-war basis when the 1949-50 crop becomes available for export. ter whether the attention of the new Director-General of Security has been called to the admission into this country of approximately 200 aliens from Shanghai and other Chinese ports with passports or vises granted to Soviet legations. Did the Government order a cessation of such entries after a large number had arrived in Australia pending the establishment of new precautionary measures? Have steps been taken to rescreen all of those who were admitted prior to such rpvision of Governmentpolicy in view of the possible entry of Soviet agents? Immigration will answer the question. Service of this country does its job effectively and efficiently at all times, and all persons of alien birth who are admitted to Australia have reports made upon them by our security officers at home and abroad. Nobody who is either an actual or a potential danger to the security of -the nation is admitted to the country. We have tightened things up a lot since the days when the honourable gentleman brought in Judge Swindells. Dame ENID LYONS I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Customs whether the Government has received representations from Tasmania to the effect that the fish-canning industry is in danger of collapse in that State owing to the importation of canned fish from foreign countries, including, I understand, a large shipment from Russia recently? Can the Minister say whether it is u fact that approximately 1,300 import licences have been -issued since the war ended and that those licences authorize importations from 26 different countries, including Yugoslavia?

Prime Minister say whether the policy regarding advances by the Commonwealth Bank which was announced in the press this morning, has been arrived at after consultation with, or with the concurrence of, the Government? Does this new restrictive policy indicate that some receswhich the honourable member has referred sion from the high level of prosperity that Australia has enjoyed because of high prices abroad for its exportable products, is imminent? Does it mean that the ""Government intends to take other restrictive steps coincidental or parallel with the new policy? Is the Prime Minister aware that the new restrictive policy will affect, in the main, small businesses as big businesses normally experience no difficulty when calling for fresh capital? the Commonwealth Bank from time to time discusses with me, as representing the Government, questions of general overall policy. The matter that the honourable member has mentioned is covered by a very long memorandum which was drawn up when Mr Armitage was Governor of the Commonwealth Bank. The memorandum dealt with a great number of matters connected with the position of small businessmen. I do not know exactly what the honourable member means by "" small businesses but the fact is that advances np to £1,000, such as a small businessman would desire, would not require the approval of the Commonwealth Bank. They can be dealt with by the trading banks without any reference to the Commonwealth Bank. In addition, there are certain provisions which give a great deal of flexibility to the making of advances by trading banks and if any person feels that he has not been fairly treated by a trading bank he may refer his case to the Commonwealth Bank to ascertain whether the trading bank's attitude on, or suggestion regarding, a particular advance, was warranted. It is impossible to cover in a short reply all the implications associated with this matter. To do so would require a statement of very great length. With reference to the main portion of the honourable member's question, it has been recognized by everybody that there will be some W ill the decline in general overall world prices for primary products and raw materials. I hope that any such decrease in prices will not be of great magnitude, but it can be said that there is bound to be some falling off in certain lines. That is already happening in overseas markets. The policy to as restrictive is calculated to ensure that investment is not used for speculative purposes or for the overproduction of some lines that are not essential to the life of the community or to the needs of other communities to whom we migh: export goods. There has been a discussion between the general managers of the trading banks and the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank. I shall prepare a written statement on the subject that T may deal with it more fully. question of the Prime Minister in his capacity as Minister acting for the Minister for External Affairs. The Potsdam Agreement, which laid down the basis for the surrender of Japan, provided for the setting up of a Far Eastern Commission which has been charged with the task, among other things, of seeing that the terms of the agreement are adhered to. One of the conditions of the agreement was that the great Japanese industrial combines, such as Mitsubishi and Mitsui, were to be purged. The purging has been done, but some of the persons affected have now appealed for re-instatement. Press reports suggest that their position may be reviewed, and that they may be allowed once again to take charge of the great armament and shipping industries.

Minister and Treasurer) move That the bill be now read a second time. When the budget was presented last September, revenue in 1948-49 would be £492,800,000 and expenditure £510,500,000. The Estimates have now been revised in the light of figures for ten months of this financial year, and whilst conclusions drawn from them must still be tentative, they suggest that revenue may exceed the budget estimate by about £35,000,000 and expendi.. 5,300,000 ture by about £14,000,000. This would mean that on the overall budget results . . 10,900,000 for the year there would be a small surplus. The House w ill recall that, in the budget, provision was made for a gap of £17,700,000 to be financed from Loan Fund. Improvements in revenue have been principally due to income tax and social services contribution and customs and excise, and also, in a minor way, to sales tax and pay-roll tax. All these items show the influence of higher employment, £ rapidly rising incomes, a greater flow of 500,000 imports and larger business turnover. 700.000 On the expenditure side, the budget this year has reflected, in many branches, the ,. 1,000,000 impact of rapid increases both in Aus1,800,000 tralian wages and other costs and in .. 5,724,000 prices of materials and equipment obtained overseas. In defence and allied services there has been some lag in expenDepartment 300,000 diture on defence development projects, 300,000 due to building difficulties and delays in getting equipment. On the other hand, .. 6,024,000 expenditure on a number of defence works has proceeded faster than was foreseen iast, September, and expenditure on the armed services has in general kept up to programme. Credits have been rather higher than expected. Amongst items of post-war charges which seem likely to be somewhat lower than estimates are international relief and rehabilitation, reconstruction training and war service land settlement. Against this, payment of certain arrears of price stabilization subsidies has brought expenditure on that item appreciably above the September estimate. The budget estimates of post office expenditure w i ll be exceeded. This is due in part to wage and salary increases and in part to faster deliveries and higher costs of equipment fro m overseas. There w ill be a substantially greater transfer to the National Welfare [4.14] I Fund than was estimated, largely because of the successful drive to accelerate the issue of tax assessments. Larger collections of pay-roll tax will add to the it was estimated that amount transferred. As already mentioned, there may be a small .surplus on the financial results of the year. If a surplus occurs, it is proposed to appropriate the amount to the war gratuity reserve, a course for which",22,Tiiax Business Undertakings Andter M Tories Of The Commonwealth

72,Mr Chifley (Macquarie,"Prim eapproval was given by the Parliament in the budget last year, under which, as honourable members know, an amount of £23,400,000 was set aside to meet the payment of war gratuities which w ill f a l l due mainly in 1950-51. I might mention here that although certain further advance payments of war gratuity have been made tliis year, the total liability outstanding is still estimated at £75,000,000. Transfers of additional amounts to the National Welfare Fund w ill, of course, be in accordance with the National Welfare Fund Act. It becomes necessary, however, to seek appropriation for certain, additional revenues which w i ll become available before the end of the year and bills to bo introduced are intended to cover a total amount of £22,900,000. Since defence and post-war charges will be lower than the budget estimate, it seems likely that all expenditure on these items can be met from revenue. Accordingly, it is proposed to seek revenue appropriation of a further £8,500,000 for this purpose. Additional appropriations are also being sought for £8,400,000 to cover other ordinary services. Capital works and services, for which appropriations amounting to £6,000,000 w ill be sought in a separate bill, include an item for purchase, in conjunction with the New lease of the Christmas Island phosphate deposits.

The several amounts provided for ordinary services represent, with minor exceptions, approximately one-third of the 1948-49 appropriations for such services. The amount of £32,000,000 for defence and post-war charges covers expenditure on the post-war defence plan and on repatriation and other charges arising out of the last war.

90,Mr Holt (Fawkner) [4.37],"I nit. not of great significance if , in point of fact, we do not get the same volume of goods or services as we could get with our money then. The remarkable truth is that despite the enormous advantages gained, by Australia during the war years in terms of technical expansion and additional capital equipment and notwithstanding the fact that the number of employed persons in Australia has increased by thousands-indeed, ment alone there has been an increase if .'in examination of the purchasing power of the £1 shows that the real income l>er capita of the population to-day is £128 a year, ouly slightly more than the real income of £117 a year in 193S-39. Associated with the deplorably slow increase of production and development of nroductivo resources, we have had to endure the discomforts and dangers of A rapidly expanding inflationary process. Some measures have been proposed by the Government for the purpose of halting i hat process. I shall discuss one of the more recent of those measures shortly. Undoubtedly the inflationary process in Australia has been accelerated by the actions and policies of governments, in particular the Chifley Government at Canberra. The process has been accelerated because this Government has embarked upon a spending spree unprecedented in the history of Australia. The Government from the people of Australia, approximately £500,000,000 a year, which is more than five times the total amount of any pre-war budget. Instead of pruning its departmental expenditure and reducing the bureaucracy that was built up for war purposes, it has, to our consternation, persisted with the process of expansion and recruitment from our diminished labour resources ever since World War II . ended. The result is that in Australia to-day one of every four employed persons is working for some government or semi-government authority. secondary industries are starved of the mau-power that they need in order to increase production and supply the materials and goods that would reduce the inflationary pressure on our economy, the Australian Government has steadily added to its forces. The number of persons employed in government departments in Australia has increased from more than 400,000 before World War II . to more than 600,000 at present. And this Government is the worse offender! Before the war. in June, 1939, 47,000 persons were employed in the Commonsome hundreds of wealth Public Service. Approximately in factory employtwo years after hostilities had ceased, in June, 1947, the number was still well almost 250,000 since 1938over 100,000. By February of this year, the total for June, 1939, had been almost quadrupled, and the figure for June, 1947, had been increased by 70 per cent., to more than 172,000. Yet we are being implored by the Prime Minister and his colleagues to avoid unnecessary expenditure and unnecessary demands upon the community! The Government is the worse offender and sets the worse example to the rest of the community. Associated with the growth of the number of persons in government employment, there has been a sensational increase of the cost of departmental administration. I shall not deal with the years prior to World War II . , when departmental expenditure was at a relatively low level, because my time is limited. Elowever, by referring to the votes for Commonwealth departments in 1946-47 and 194S-49, we find that the total expenditure in 1946-47 was £23,000,000 and that the estimate for the is deriving, in revenue current fiuancial year is £38,000,000, representing an increase of considerably more than 50 per cent -6 3 per cent, to be precise. As I have shown, one of the most dangerous threats to the health and development of our manufacturing economy is the inflationary trend to which this Government is one of the prime contributors. It has fostered the trend by activities w h i c h ' it has shown no disposition to reduce. Indeed, what was regarded as a temporary war programme of finance and departmental growth has quite clearly become the settled permanent policy of the Chifley socialist governAlthough our primary and ment. If we are to study the situation of the manufacturing economy as a whole we must necessarily direct our minds to the situation of one or two of the industries that are basic to that economy. Therefore I propose to deal with the coal and steel industries, upon which the whole of our manufacturing economy is based. The limitations, or the opportunities for expansion, of our manufacturing industries are governed by the volume of coal that can be made available to them and by the volume of iron and steel products that can be manufactured. When we examine the condition of those two basic industries, we find no cause for the Government's rosy optimism and no cause to congratulate it upon its performances in recent years. We find, indeed, that there has been a continuous record of disappointment, frustration and failure, which has obstructed the developindustries in their States, and their own ment of the entire national economy. Our need for coal last year was about 13,300,000 tons. The country actually produced 11,720,000 tons, approximately 1,500,000 tons less than we required. The effect of that inadequate production was felt throughout the country. I shall not go into the details because they have become painfully familiar to every manufacturer, every housewife, and, indeed, every other citizen, as the result of the impact of coal shortages upon their daily lives. In winter time it is now our common experience to be subjected to the rationing of fuel and power, and to suffer other inconvenience resulting from the shortage of coal. The number of trains that can be used to transport passengers and goods is reduced. The volume of power that can be generated by our electricity plants is dependent on coal. As the supply of coal falls short of needs, coal from overseas have met with a lukeso the supply of essential power also falls short of the demand. The housewife finds that she cannot conduct her ordinary domestic affairs with comfort and convenience because of those shortages, which recur every year with painful and monotonous regularity. When she goes to purchase the goods that she requires for her domestic needs, she has a continuing and exasperating experience of shortages. These conditions, I remind honourable members, are occurring nearly four years after the conclusion of the war, agement from the Chifley Government in and at a time when the Government has every possible advantage in terms of legislative power, good credit resources and ample funds for the needs of the community. Mr Bolt. What has the Government done to improve the supply of coal ? The story is one of a long record of failure. The Government has not shown even the necessary vigour and resourcefulness to import coal in order to supplement the supplies which can be obtained in Australia. Other governments have bestirred themselves to do so. For example, the Government of South Australia and the Government of Victoria-perhap s I may be pardoned for mentioning that both of them are Liberal governments-hav e sought supplies of coal from other countries, such as England, India and South Africa, because of the urgent need of the community services. South Australia imported from those countries ? South Australia has received very much coal from overseas. I am quite certain that the Premier of South Australia, Mr Playford, desires to receive a great deal more than he has obtained. I may mention, for the edification of the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Thompson), that in to-day's press, Mr Playford is reported as having made arrangements to secure additional supplies of coal from England and South Africa, and possibly India. Victoria has taken similar action. I also direct the attention of the honourable member for Hindmarsh to the fact that the efforts of the Government of Victoria to obtain warm reception and even passive resistance from the Chifley Government. One vessel, with a cargo of coal, has been tied up in Port Phillip Bay for three months, because the Seamen's Union has declared it "" black "". The Victorian Government has appealed to the Chifley Government, asking for a statement of the degree of support that it may expect if it takes steps to have the ship unloaded. To the best of my knowledge, the Victorian Government has not received any encourthe matter. Yet that shipload of coal is in Port Phillip Bay at a time when the citizens of Melbourne are under a daily threat of the rationing of electricity and transport services. I mention those facts",26,Australia S Manufacturin G Economy

92,Mr Holt,"I am not saying thatbecause we are feeling the consequences of the shortage of coal throughout the whole of our Australian economy. When we consider the steel position, the story is equally depressing. I emphasize this matter because the Minister for Post-Avar Reconstruction has taken pride in the expansion of Australia's steelmaking capacity. At page 5 of the Brief Review of Australia's Manufacturing Economy, he statedAustralia's iron and steel industry now has six blast and 21 open hearth furnaces with an even Labour governments are compelled annual capacity of about 1.75 million tons of steel from local ores. That is a subject in which we all can Government of !N""ew South Wales is imtake an interest. .This great capacity is porting Japanese steel at a cost of £42 available to us. Approximately 1,750,000 a ton in order to make dog spikes for tons of steel can be produced annually railway tracks, and the Government of from local ores, but the picture is very Victoria, is importing steel from England different when we pass from that rosy and Belgium for water supply undertakstatement of our capacity to a cold ings at a cost of £26 a ton, compared with examination of actual production. In the Australian price of £15 a ton. Many 1948, far from reaching the capacity of private manufacturers are importing steel 1,750,000 tons of steel, we made only at costs three times greater than that at 1,27S,000 tons. In other words, we used which the steel can be supplied by the only 75 per cent, of the available Broken Hill Proprietary Company capacity. More recent figures are even Limited organization and at which i l more depressing. As the result of the would be sold if we could maintain a combined effects of the shortage of coal reasonable supply of coal and obtain a and strikes in the heavy industries, the fair day's output from those engaged in quantity of steel that is produced at the these two basic industries.

94,Mr Holt,"The Leader of the Oppoin view of the banking legislation of-tateinent urges the banks to adopt a more '-autious and conservative policy. Quite frankly, the language of the statement will provoke mordant mirth in manufacturers as well as bankers. I cite, as an sample, the following passage:Banks should generally adopt a cautious attitude towards advances for enterprises of doubtful economic value or involving a high dpgrne of risk. I would like to know at what period of banking history banks have done anything but adopt a ""cautious attitude"" lowards ""enterprises of doubtful economic valive or involving a high degree of risk "". I am afraid that in that passage we detect the pen of the doctrinaire; and I am even more afraid that the hand of the theorist is going to lie very heavily on the Australian manufacturing economy for just so long as the policy of the Chifley socialists and those who support them continues. However, the general theme underlying the statement of policy is that a more cautious approach is to be adopted and the banks are to be more restrictive in granting overdrafts. The effect of that direction, in practical terms, will be that industry will be compelled to look to the public for the supply of funds to expand its undertakings and to continue production :it the current level. In that statement of policy the Government, through the Commonwealth has expressed views which ignore the problems which beset the small industries of this country. members of the Chifley Government, and the Australian Labour party which supports them, have become so indoctrinated with socialist propaganda that they instinctively think of industry and manufacturing in terms of ""big The policies which they propound are directed against ""big business"", show no appreciation the needs of small industrialists. all very well to suggest that the individual who is running a small business, whether its a partnership or as a member of a small proprietary company, should go to the public for the funds that he needs. How is he to go to the public? He has not a public share issue which he can make available for public tion. If he is operating a Mr Bolt. his is a private undertaking in which the public cannot readily share.. Opportunities for small business to secure finance in this way are very limited indeed. In practical terms, those industries whicli are most often in need of financial assistance, either to tide them over a difficult period or to enable them to carry forward a programme of expansion, find the greatest difficulty in approaching the [public, for financial assistance. Very often they have the poorest story to tell to the public, and they naturally look to the banks for assistance and for sound advice in the solution of their problems. ""IfI may highlight the matter, I draw the attention of the Government to a simple and undeniable fact. Our manufacturing economy is not based primarily on "" b i g business "" and large manufacturing concerns which employ more than 100persons, but on small businesses. Large undertakings form only a very small proportion of the total number of factories in Australia. The Commonwealth Statistician has supplied me with the official statistics for the financial year 1946-47. which are the latest available. Those statistics show that of a total of 34,700 factories, only 2,S00 employed 100 or more persons. In other words, there were approximately 32,000 factories that employed fewer than 100 persons. In shaping its economic policy an Bank, administration-and particularly one completely which publicizes so much its opposition to "" big business "" and its desire to help I believe that the "" little man ""-shoul d base that policy on the special needs of small businesses because they are numerically the most important factor in our secondary production. business"". Mr CoafELAiN* -Does the honourable member know the total number of persons and employed in the categories which he has or recognition of mentioned? what the honourable member for Griffith( Mr Conelan) has in mind, but the number of persons employed in Australian factories in 1946-47 was 813,000, of which fewer than. 400,000 were employed in factories of 100 or more employees. In other words, more than 50 per cent, of subscripthe total factory employment in Australia partnership, was provided at factories operated by",29,Australia S Manufacturin G Economy
95,It Is Mr Holt,"1 . do not know exactlyfewer than 100 employees. It is apparent, therefore, that the small factories of Australia represent a very important element in our manufacturing economy, and that the policy of the Government should obviously be designed to protect and encourage them. Any reference to our manufacturing economy during the period under review would be incomplete without special mention of the part played by unwarranted strikes and industrial disturbances in accelerating the current inflationary trend. By failing to prevent these irresponsible stoppages the Labour Government has provided what is probably its greatest disappointment to the Australian people. ""When the Curtin Government assumed office in 1941 the people of Australia thought that perhaps Labour would be able to maintain industrial peace, and put a stop to the strikes and stoppages which had marred our war effort and had done so much to poison the community atmosphere during the fateful war years. However, they have found, to their infinite disappointment, that so far from improving on the efforts of earlier non-Labour administrations, Labour has permitted a steady and serious deterioration of the industrial situation. Not only have strikes occurred with increasing frequency, but also they had affected a greater number of industries. The total number of working days lost has been considerable, and the cumulative effect upon our production has been most serious. Naturally, we ask ourselves why no reference of any consequence was made to this disturbing fact in the review of our manufacturing economy presented by the Government. ""We may also ask why it is that the Government, even at this late stage, has taken no effective steps dominating figure in the Australian to improve the position. It has not even met the requests made to it by men of authority in the tribunal which it affects to support. I refer to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court, whose Chief Judge and Chief Conciliation Commissioner, who were appointed by the present Administration, have appealed for increased authority in order to preserve our industrial law. Although those gentlemen, who are a vital part of the machinery established by the present. Government for the settlement of industrial disputes, made specific recommenda tions to the Government, their recommendations have been completely ignored. The present Government has not made the slightest attempt to strengthen the hands of the Arbitration Court, and the only reason that the court was able to assert itself recently was because an individual had, by deliberately and contemptuously defying its authority, brought himself within the disciplinary powers of the court. Turning from the court to thfCommunist conspirators who are endeavouring to disrupt our maritime industry, we find that only in the last few days hn> the Government taken action to preserve industrial peace by discharging from the Stevedoring Industry Commission the two Communists who represented the Waterside Workers Federation. Not onh has the Government rejected the appeals made to it from time to time to deal with the militant extremists, but it has as» rejected the appeals made to it from the trade union movement itself. In describing "" red"" activities in the building trades union, and the legal difficulties of resisting their disruptive tactics, only last week a trade union journal statedIsi t any wonder that decent unionists are asking what the Federal Government w ill do to give them an even break against the crookedness and corruption which alone to-day keeps the Reds juntas in power in the unions I Decent Labour-minded unionists will do the job against the Reds if the politicians give them a chance. That is what this trade union paper asks. It is what the Australian people have been asking for years. The name of Mr C. G. Fallon is very well known to members of the Parliament. He is a leading figure in the political life of Australia on the Labour side and has been a Workers Union, one of the largest and most responsible trade unions in this country. Mr Fallon has complained of this inaction and has referred to what is happening in the industrial world in the following terms:Communists are sabotaging Australia in the industrial world. TfI had the power of government I would treat many of these people who are supposed to be leaders and union officials and who are causing their members to sabotage this country, as guilty of treason to the nation, and T would deal with them by imposing the maximum penalty of the law . . . These people are pledged to a policy which has for its purpose the intimidation of decent people. Violence has been done to scores of good Australians at the behest of these people. There is a fifth column now in the industrial life of Australia. Mr Fallon and bis colleagues in the Australian Workers Union acted in the matter. They banned Communists from membership of the Australian Workers Union and from holding office in it. decent Australian trade unionists who want to get on with the job of production and of improving livin g standards in Australia are crying out to the Government to take some effective action, we have been told by the Leader of this Government ( Mr Chifley) that it is futile to ban the Communist party. This matter is right in the lap of the Government now. Recently, some sensational revelations were made by Mr Sharpley. The revelations did not convey anything very new to members of this Parliament; they are matters that we have debated freely during recent years. However, they had a sensational impact upon the Australian people as a whole, because they came from within . They could not be dismissed as propaganda from some red-baiting politician or from a team of parliamentarians opposed to the Labour movement. They came from within the Communist party itself. They have placed in the lap of this Government the responsibility for dealing with the Communists. granted.-\ courtesy. I shall not detain it much longer. There is one other matter to which I desire to refer before I conclude. made the criticisms that I have made of our manufacturing responsibility course of action. I commend to the attention of the Government and of the people as a whole the action that was taken by the Menzies Government in order to give a real drive to our munitions at the time of our greatest need. able members on this side of the House do not talk in empty terms when dealing with these matters. secondary industries, to which the Government has referred proudly in the Mr Holt. paper that is now before the House, was achieved as a direct result of the action that was taken by the present Leader of the Opposition and his Government at a time when Australia, in order to preserve itself and to assist its allies in Pacific waters, had, as a matter of urgency, to develop its secondary industries, to produce munitions on a scale that previously would have been thought to be impossible and to undertake a programme which the Nevertheless, at a time when present Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holloway) described at the time as a "" miracle of production "". A miracle of production was achieved. Every fair-minded person who looks back on that period w i ll pay tribute to the leaders of industry and to the Australian workers who worked under them for the great effort that was put forward in the munitions programme and for the remarkable results that were achieved. They were not achieved by increasing the size of government departments beyond control, by enormous departmental expenditure, by a series of white papers or by theoretical approaches to the problem. The Menzies Government realized that the only practical way to obtain munitions was to utilize the services of the men who had made a success of the business of production in their respective industries in Australia through the years. As the spearhead of the munitions drive the Menzies Government selected Mr. Essington Lewis, one of the outstanding figures in the industrial life of Australia, [Extension of time and made him Director-General of M u n i I thank the House for its tions. It gave hi m a relatively free hand to select, from his own knowledge of their capacity and worth, men who had been able to achieve production in their own fields of industry. FunctionHaving ing under the director-general were directors of various aspects of the munieconomy, I have a tions programme. The result was, to use to suggest a constructive again the words of the Minister for Labour and National Service, "" a miracle of production"". That is the kind of approach that the Liberal party, if returned to power, would make to the programme Australian housing problem. The need Honorfor more houses is very pressing. The community l if e and the lives of individual citizens are being embittered because The expansion of our of the shortage of houses, which means that thousands of people cannot live a proper domestic life. Does any one really believe that the methods that have been adopted by the present Government are securing results? Does any one believe that the creation of a mushroom-like Department of Works and Housing and the periodical churning out of reports relating to housing is getting us the houses that we need? To-day, in answer to a question, and in order to give some kind of figure that would satisfy the public the Minister for Works and Housing( Mr ment. In that country the role of the Lemmon) had to take the average over the ten years preceding the outbreak of World War II . Everybody knows that during that period the depression occurred and that housing construction reached its lowest level. It was in the last year before the war that, under the Menzies Government, we were able to achieve the greatest housing production and to put into effect the greatest building construction programme that this country had ever known. If honourable gentlemen opposite desire to challenge that statement, I invite them to examine the figures. They will find that in the last year before the war, which was the first year of office of the Menzies Government, the building construction programme in this country reached a level that it had not reached before. If we were in officeand I commend this policy to the present Government for its consideration-w e should get on with the housing programme in a practical way. We have encouragement from the experience of the manufacturing economy of the United States of America. I know that before this year has ended we shall hear a lot from honourable members opposite about the United States of America. They will ask the Australian people to look at the unemployment in that country. We might well look to it for guidance to see how we can secure the maximum output from our industrial capacity. The -Government of Great Britain, which is a little more realistic than is this Governany substantial body of unemployed. For ment, has sought expert technical advice from American industrialists in order to boost the British industrial programme. To-day we find that the United States of America, despite the fact that it has embarked upon a mighty defence programme and is trying to l if t out of its war wreckage almost the whole of the European economy, is able to give the American people a better standard of living than they have ever known before. There has been a very substantial rise in real living standards in the United States of America despite the two burdens of virtually world defence and world economic security that it has assumed. In the United States of America, more than in any other country to-day, the individual is given incentive and encourageState is limited to planning and development. It is not a hindering and crippling role, as is that played by the Chifley socialists here. It is as a result of the incentive and encouragement given, in America, to the individual and individual resourcefulness, that that country owes its remarkable achievements. unemployed. produce figures showing that there is any chronic unemployment in the United States of America. Naturally, in a country with a population of 180,000,000. where there are many seasonal industries, there must be a certain number of people unemployed at any given time. seasonal industries? vernment is not providing or enabling sufficient labour to move freely among those industries. The shortages of shearers and fruit pickers, and of labour in other industries can be attributed, partly at any rate, to the fact that thi = Government has become the great monopolizer of labour. evidently desires workers to be directed to those industries. any statement that in America there is persons who, as a result of seasonal conditions, are temporarily unemployed, the American Government, I understand, maintains the highest scale of unemployment relief in the world. So honourable members opposite will not obtain much comfort from comparing America with Australia in that connection. I have made these comments because the Government",30,Australia S Manufacturin G Economy

101,Mr Holt,"I challenge the truth ofin November last year presented to us, as a statement of fact, a roseate review of Australian manufacturing economy. Much as we take pride in the efforts of our own people-and I have no inferiority complex about the Australian workman and what he is capable of doing I do say that at the moment we are not by any means geared to our best effort, f make that statement not as criticism of Australian workmen but of those who should be an inspiration to them and should give them leadership and ensure that enabled to do their best. But as long aa we have a government which embitters rlie community with class-war propaganda and talks in terms of the exploitation of the worker by the boss, while at the same, time, refusing to point out how the welfare of one is bound up with the welfare of the. other, so long shall we find that our effort falls far short of the effort of which of rising costs leading to increased wages, wo are really capable. It is proper therefore to take a balanced view, if we would achieve the better effort of which we are capable, and thereby produce a better 'tnndard of life for the Australian people. report presented by the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) contains some interesting statistics and facts. now industries and also gives employment statistics. But it is very misleading. r.ho Government has poured out millions nf pounds in the establishment of factories, that it sold many of them for a song, and that those factories are not now in operation. If the report were presented in the form of a balance-sheet it would be very illuminating. To the unthinking members of the community it would show that the Government is responsible for the tremendous development and improvement of the soundness of our economy. But that is not so. The development of our secondary industries has been in progress for a long time under successive governments. number of employees engaged in secondary industries now surpasses the number of those engaged in primary industries. That is something which must be carefully watched because at the moment the Australian tariff is being neglected. It is overlaid with all kinds of other enactments-the licensing system, the increase in primage, sales tax and so on. The tariff was originally intended to be a protection to Australia's secondary industries, but it no longer exists as a protective tariff. It is now a revenue-producing tariff. This year the Government will collect £123,000,000 in customs and excise duties. That sum i * greater than the entire annual Commonwealth revenue prior to the war. To-day they shall be there is a great scarcity of certain goods and we have to buy in oversea* markets, paying high prices for the imported goods. That produces an inflationary effect, which increases costs throughout the whole economic structure. The housewife and working man have to pay those increased costs, which produce in turn a constant spiral and ultimately to a further rise in costs. Because of rising costs the workman seok3 increased wages through arbitration or by use of the strike weapon. The Government is aiding this inflationary process because it does not have a proper understanding of how the system 7 operates. During its term of office it has never made a statement on the subject and has given no undertaking to examine the It contains a list of tariff position to ascertain whether the 1933 tariff, which is in operation to-day, is operating as the Parliament it does not show that intended. It is laid down in the statutes that the Tariff Board shall be consulted heforc changes are made in the tariff, hut the present Government has not only made, changes without consulting the Board but it also ignored the board in relation to the Havana charter. I suggest that the Government should go to th<Tariff Board, and ask it for the information it requires, saying to the members of the board, "" You are the expert body, trusted by the people and are a cross section of the community, with all the necessary access to the economists. Advise us what is the proper and fair rate on thio or that item"". The Government could The result is that the thereby save millions of pounds. I shall enlarge on my suggestion in this way.

The future of Australia, which has been blessed by Providence with great resources and has within its borders room for millions more people, is being sabotaged by those who have stolen the control of the trade unions from the working man. Honourable members opposite may laugh, but they know very well that Mr Thornton is now in Moscow where he has been lauding Mr that they shall be forced to do so after Stalin as the greatest citizen in the world, the next general elections. Dr. Coombs, f have no doubt that in the near future we shall see honourable members opposite consorting with Mr Thornton when he comes here to tell them what he wants them to do for the iron workers. Unfortunately, many great trade unions have been captured by those saboteurs, but at last the working man is waking up. The revelations made by the former Communist Mr Sharpley in Melbourne confirmed much of what we already knew. Nevertheless, the Prime Minister will not take action against the Communists. However, the Liberal Government of Victoria, which has some backbone, has decided to appoint a royal commission to inquire into Communist activities in this country, and it will be interesting to see the undercover men aud Communist ""fellow travellers"" known to honourable members opposite who may be called upon to testify before that body. custody, but that attempt was thwarted The decision of the Victorian Government to hold such an inquiry is refreshing news to 'many trade unionists who are waking up to the Communist menace. I wish to stress another aspect of our manufacturing economy. I refer to the report published on the front page of to-day's Sydney Morning Herald under the heading "" New Policy on Bank Finance"". The honourable member for Fawkner (Air. Holt) had something to say about that announcement which no doubt has been worked out by the Prime Minister and his king of planners. Dr. Coombs, who is the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank. In the statement which he issued to the press Dr. Coombs saidI t would be reBanks should adopt a cautious attitude towards advances for enterprise of doubtful economic value or involving a high degree of risk. Xew advances should not be made to encourage day to day expenditure beyond current income. To-day, the planner is the greatest menace to our democracy. The centralized control which we are now experiencing passed into the hands of the present Government during the recent war. Now, the party despots do not want to release their hold on the people, although I have no doubt as the adviser to the Government, said that the housing problem in this country would be solved within two years of the cessation of hostilities. The planners are confused among themselves; they are out of touch with reality. The Prime Minister when he was a member of the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems condemned the rapacity and stringency of the private banks. He declared that the banks were not sufficiently generous in making advances, and told the story which we have heard hundreds of times that during the depression the private banks were too harsh. The announcement made by Dr. Coombs in to-day's press is the policy which the Prime Minister has so often condemned. The right honourable gentleman introduced legislation in order to enable his Government to take the private banks into its by the Melbourne City Council in litigation which went on appeal to the High Court. That body claimed the right to bank where it chose. Now, the Australian taxpayer is being put to the expense of the appeal that is being heard by the Privy Council. It is interesting to note that counsel for the Government in that action includes Mr Pritt, KC.. who is a reputed Communist. It is a nice state of affairs when all our import and export trade is dependent upon the whims of a few men who exercise centralized power in Canberra. Should the Government win its appeal before the Privy Council the",36,Australia S Manufacturin G Economy
108,Mr White,"The honorahle memcorner stone of commerce in Australia will be knocked out and not only the banks but also every commercial institution will be completely in the Government's hands. Yet, while we are awaiting the outcome of that appeal the Government has the impudence to tell the banks that they must limit their overdrafts. How can this country progress if the enterprise of its people is to be stifled in this way? No doubt honourable members opposite regard Lord Nuffield as a capitalist who should be nationalized, "" Prices control will be handed over to yet he has distributed in charity from £12,000,000 to £14,000,000 of the profits he has made from his enterprises. Lord Nuffield commenced in business as a bicycle repairer in Oxford and he received his start by means of an overdraft from a private bank. Sir William Rootes who is head of the British corporation which manufactures the Huniber and Rolls Royce motor cars established himself by means of an advance from an insurance company. Yet, if those men were living in Australia and sought help from a private bank to finance their enterprises they would be told, ""Dr. Coombs and Mr Chifley object"". How can we progress under a Government of the type of the present administration? If the Government were prepared to examine enterprises in order to see whether they could be better developed by the Government or by individuals, it would be the fair way; but that is not how the present Government operates. It has. signed the Marxist pledge of complete nationalization. It pursues its way under a dour and ruthless Prime Minister who has determined that Australia in his day shall be completely socialized. The paper tabled by the Minister shows that Australia is progressing in spite of the fetters placed . upon industry under the Government's centralized control. The Tariff Board is being ignored at a time when many duties need overhauling, and when it is apparent that many essential goods should be allowed entry under by-law in order to counteract inflation. The Government should restore the subsidies which it has stolen from the people. "" Stolen"" is not too strong a word to use in this connection. When the Government's proposals in the Mr White. referendum on rents and prices control were rejected by the people the Prime Minister decided to take drastic action. Indeed, since the referendum the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman), who is now sitting at the table, when questioned on almost any aspect of Government policy replies: "" What a pity the Government's referendum proposals were not carried "". As soon as the referendum result was known the Prime Minister, in a fit of pique, said, in effect. the States; we shall no longer pay subsidies amounting to £30,000,000."". Notwithstanding that decision, the Government did not give this money back but continued to levy high rates of primage duty and to charge sales tax on some 25 different articles that are essential for the building industry. Is there any necessity to continue levying saleitax, a turn-over tax which is inflationary in its incidence? This Government can take no credit for such progress as ha* been achieved in this country. It continues to monopolize the taxing field and takes out of the pockets of the people no less than £500,000,000 every year. Ai present the revenue collected through the Department of Trade and Customs if greater than that gained from all source? exploited by the Commonwealth before the outbreak of the war. The document which we are now considering contains lists of industries established in Australia -ince the end of the war. Unthinking people might believe that the establishment of those industries is in some way due to the policy of the Government. Thai is far from the truth. The Government shows that far from being the friend of the little man, whether he be a worker or a small business man, it is his enemy. It is demonstrating every day itpolicy of inability to look after the interest* of the loyal working men in the tradeunions. It is concerned more with the interests of big business which it can more easily nationalize when the time i ripe.

109,Mr Hutchinson (Deakin) [8.0],"most optimistic moments ten or twelve years ago. In Australia to-day, there is a variety of machine tools and a variety of skills far exceeding anything we have known hitherto. largely from the production demands of World War II . , particularly in the dark days when France fell and the Empire stood alone against Hitler's Europe. In those days we undertook the manufacture of articles which normally would not have been within our industrial capacity for another 50 years. The expansion of secondary production has continued in the post-war period, and the nation has continued to enjoy a high degree of prosperity due to the high prices at which our wool, wheat, meat and other primary products are being sold on the world's markets. To view our secondary industries to-day in the proper perspective, it is wise for us to trace their growth since the beginning of World War I. expansion during the two war periods and the immediate post-war years has been strikingly similar. World War I. there was a rapid development of our secondary industries. We were faced with the problem of manufacturing materials of war in this country for the first time. The war itself was followed by a boom period, and the prevailing high prices for primary products produced an era unparalleled in the history of Australia's economy. sequently, however, the revival of industries in other countries had an impact upon production in this country. Some Australian industries were forced to the wall and, to save others, tariff protection to a degree never before experienced was necessary. Had that action not been taken, undoubtedly many industries that came into existence during World War I. would not exist to-day. Tariffs were increased to such a degree that during the depression years, economists estimated that the excess cost passed on to the primary industries as the result of our fiscal policy was approximately 8 per cent. We should always remember that our primary industries are the foundation of secondary production. later 1930's, tariffs were revised. The Ottawa Agreement had the effect of lowering many high imposts. Exchange adjuster. Hutchinson. ments followed. Ultimately, in the years preceding World War II . , we had reached a stage in which there was a reasonably healthy growth of secondary industries. This has resulted As I have said, World War II . produced the greatest impetus of all time to our secondary production, and we were compelled to produce, commodities which normally we would not have considered producing for several decades. Unfortunately, the expansion of secondary industries was carried out to the detriment of primary industries. We should be very foolish, indeed, to concentrate on industrial development without realizing that the basis of our prosperity is still our primary industries. In 1921, 491,000 people, or 23.S per cent, of the total number of employed persons in the Commonwealth, were engaged in primary production. The 1947 census disclosed that of a total of 3,167,000 people employed, 498,000. or only 15.7 per cent., were engaged in rural industries. Clearly, therefore, Industrial there has been a substantial drift of labour from the basic primary industries to the secondary industries of this counThroughout try. Our industrial expansion has been greatest in the engineering, vehicle manufacturing, and ship-building industries. In 1933,101,000 people were engaged in those industries, whereas in 1947 the number was 277,000. Capital employed increased in the same period from £50,300,000 to £111,900,000. To-day, Australia is undertaking the production Subof articles never before made in this country. We have embarked for instance upon shipbuilding. The Government's intention, of course, is that this industry shall be socialized. The Government is to be the sole shipbuilding authority. Australian workmen are now making a complete motor car which is remarkably good. Other items of production include tractors and engineering equipment of all descriptions. That is the reason for the enormous increase of capital and labour employed in those industries. The manufacture of textiles and clothing has also grown remarkably. In those industries, capital invested rose from £21,900,000 in 1932 to £38,000,000 in 1946-47 and this growth is continuing. We are still During the short of woollen yarns. Rayon, too, is being manufactured. The capital employed in the production of food, drink and £54,900,000 in 1931-32 to more than £77,000,000 and it is still being poured into those undertakings. Gas and electrir city undertakings, both vitally important to home comfort and industrial expansion, have remained f a i r l y stable, the increase of capital being only from The figures I have given I received from the Commonwealth Statistician. They are the latest available from that source, but, from banking sources and other reliable sources, I have learnt that since 1947, the census year, between £60,000,000 and £100,000.000 per annum has been poured into Australian secondary industries in the same ratio as in the years preceding 1947. That is to say, the greatest part has flowed into the engineering, shipbuilding and vehicles group. The next greatest has gone into the clothing and textiles group and the next into the food, drink and tobacco group. This remarkable development of secondary industries has been detrimental to the primary industries to a degree. A pertinent question is whether there has not been too great, and therefore dangerous, a development of secondary industries and a dangerous neglect of primary industries. The secondary industries are exporting their products but not nearly to an extent sufficient to warrant an ever increasing expansion of secondary products without a corresponding expansion of primary production. As things stand to-day, secondary industries are somewhat top-heavy, and that is always a dangerous condition, because, should the secondary edifice tumble, great unemployment would be possible. I want to see the continued development of secondary industry in Australia. I believe that it can go on. I believe that it can absorb even more men and money and that it can produce more goods and services. I believe, however, that that is only possible with an ever-expanding population. We must bring migrants by the thousands to this country. Without an ever-expanding population, secondary industries can easily run into difficulties and dangers. I deplore the statement of the Minister for Transport ( Mr Ward) that; new arrivals are a danger to our jobs. I tell him that our security, indusf=] tobacco has increased from trial as well as national, depends on an ever-increasing population. An ever-increasing population is vital to the maintenance and development of our secondary industries. Therein lies our salvation. In reply to a question that I asked earlier to-day about banking, the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley), had to £41,700,000 to £53,300,000. admit a recession on the primary side. Such a recession must necessarily have an impact on the secondary structure. There are other factors in the world to-day that must be considered. A great deal of the boom of the secondary industries in Australia is due to the fact that we cannot buy goods overseas. The war left one-half of the industrial world out of action. Before the war, Germany was the third greatest manufacturing nation in the world and Japan was making great strides all the time in manufactures, particularly textiles. Today, as after World WarI . , the competitive element in trade is returning. From what the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) saw in Germany, he could tell honourable members that western Germany has reached about 73 per cent, of its production in 1936. That shows that Gormany is rapidly returning as a competitor in secondary industries. Then we have the great export drive that Great Britain is making. I ts economic position has completely altered. Whatever we may like to say about Japan, it must have some place in world trade. We cannot allow millions of people to be born and to die of starvation. The industrial resurgence in other parts of the world, therefore, must have an effect on our industrial development. We are exporting manufactures sand I believe that that export trade can be expanded. I believe, for instance, that soon we shall be able to export the Holden motor car and that there is room for the expansion of our exports of textiles. Nevertheless, there is not nearly sufficient export trade in sight to warrant the continued expansion of our secondary industries, unless we have a constant stream of migrants pouring into the country. Without them we can easily run into difficulties, if we continue to expand our secondary industries at the present rate. Another aspect of our economy that is causing concern to every one engaged iv secondary industry and every one who providing a surplus for export. We cantakes a wide view of the Australian econot close our eyes to those facts. nomic field is that man-hour production is less in Australia than it is in most of the tion?

The answer is that with it the things that make for human the Communists employed in the industry comfort.

What is the reason for low produc; ; Once upon a time it was possible for a ship to berth at Newcastle with a load of iron ore, have its cargo unloaded, and be re-filled with finished steel products within a period of seven days. To-day, the same series of operations occupies from sixteen to twenty days. That is simply due to the reduced capacity of workers in this country to do a job within a reasonable space of time. I do not say that men should be driven to work hard, and I do not believe that anybody urges such a policy. But so great is the need to improve our standard of living so that a man may buy something worthwhile with every £1 of his income that any worker who fails to do a reasonable amount of work within a reasonable space of time imnoses a hardship upon his colleagues and also upon his wife and children. Everybody who goes slow on the job is lowering the true value of the £1 note. The Government should take all possible steps to reduce the effect of disruptive Communist tactics in industry, yet it has been almost entirely inactive. Only recently did it suddenly become aware of the fact that, after all, production is related to the standard of living. I come now to my last point. member not tell us his solution of the problem that he has been discussing? so. If we are to maintain a decent standard of living we must have a larger population in Australia and get back to a competitive basis, and there must be more production for each man-hour worked than there is at present. That is the solution of the problem, but it reside of the House have been suspicious of quires for its application a government that will whole-heartedly support the men who are willing to work, and not the disruptionists who prevent the workers from giving of their best. In other words, the Australian Government should back the genuine worker instead of the Com "". My final point refers to the methods by which industry should be developed. Unfortunately there has been a great deal of indiscriminate industrial expansion in Australia recently. Many of the new industries may be of great value to the nation, but great dangers are involved in the indiscriminate establishment of industry. Should we be faced again with the economic difficulties that assailed us during the 'thirties, it might be difficult, or even impossible, under the terms of the Geneva international trade agreement, to protect many of our industries. Our tariff policy cannot safely proceed along the lines that were followed during the 'thirties. When the Bruce-Page Government adopted a policy of developing industries by means of tariff protection accorded along the lines recommended by the Tariff Board, it undertook one of the most sensible plans ever put into effect in the economic history of Australia. This Parliament has not the ability to investigate in detail every one of the 3,000 items affected by our tariffs. Therefore, it must have some independent body to make investigations and present comprehensive reports for its guidance. Unfortunately the Tariff Board seems to have fallen into the discard under the administration of this Government. That is not unusual under a Labour regime. The Tariff Board was discarded in the period from 1929 to 1930, and an extraordinary tariff policy was pursued by the Scullin Labour Governthe honourable ment with the result that colossal costs were unloaded on to the primary industries during the depression years. This Government is following the same dangerous path. For instance, it proposes to develop the aluminium industry. Nobody knows much about that industry. There has not been any proper inquiry into it, and no adequate reports have been prepared for the guidance of the Parliament. Honourable members on this the Government's proposals and have asked for information and explanations, but their requests have received a meagre response. Is the aluminium industry a sound industry? A strong manufacturing economy cannot be established by foolishly developing unsound industries or by unloading on to other natural industries costs that might interfere with their progressive growth. If we are to develop our manufacturing economy on sound lines we must change to a more methodical and sensible policy than that which is being pursued by this Government.

Honourable members opposite have asserted that the figures in the review do not mean very much, but I believe that they mean a great deal to the workers.

They had an excellent opportunity to use the labour resources available to manufacture greater quantities of galvanized iron, and build houses. H a d those governments shown foresight, many Australians would not now be without homes. Of course, honourable members opposite want the public to forget that, in those years, anti-Labour governments failed to grasp their opportunities to increase production. In 1939, the number of persons in employment, excluding those employed in rural industries, household domestic duties and the defence forces was 1,730,200.

129,Mr Thompson,"I said just nowfellow-workers and of the entire community. Having said that, I repeat that the cause of the distorted outlook of some workers is the selfish and unfair attitude which has characterized members of the Opposition parties. A lot of criticism has been levelled at the Government for its alleged failure to increase production. The honourable member for Deakin criticized the establishment of uneconomic industries and contended that the Government should always be guided by the recommendations of the Tariff Board. However, the real reason for the establishment of many of the so-called uneconomic industries is the acute shortage of goods which we used formerly to import from overseas. It must be clear to any impartial observer that the main reason for the establishment and continued operation of many of the so-called uneconomic industries lies in the destruction during the war of the productive capacity of many European countries from which we formerly drew our requirements. It is characteristic of the inconsistency of members of the Opposition, who complain that the Government has sponsored the establishment of a number of uneconomic industries, that to-day one of their number asked a question that was designed to obtain tariff protection for the fish canning industry. That industry, which was established in this country in recent years, is now being adversely affected by imports from overseas. I know something of the problem presented by these industries, because a number of new industries which were established in my electorate during the war and immediately afterwards are now beginning to feel the impact of the competition presented by lower priced goods shipped from abroad. Those industries must be given sympathetic consideration. The national economy demands that, irrespective of the political complexion of the government of the day, or of the capacity or personality of the Minister for Trade and Customs, or of the members of the Tariff Board, many of those industries must continue to function. In the State of South Australia, in which my electorate is situated, many small industries sprang up, not because of government sponsorship, but because Mr Thompson. of individual enterprise in the endeavour to fill pressing needs. I was somewhat intrigued by the criticism of man-hour production voiced by certain members of the Opposition. In contradiction of their assertions I propose to refer to the experience of an English industrialist who came to this country. He was the general manager of a cotton textile manufacturing firm which in recent years established works in South Australia. In the course of a discussion with him I said, "" Are you receiving a satisfactory return from your employees? "" He replied, "" I am perfectly satisfied that we are getting a fair deal from our employees "". I emphasize thai that particular industry is one of the new industries established in Australia. Incidentally, I claim that South Australia stands very high in any interstate comparison of new industries. The construction during war-time of munition factories and the importation of plant and machine tools enabled private enterprise at the end of hostilities to establish a number of new industries. As an example of the successful establishment of new industries in South Australia, 1 mention that a director of the concern which took over a munitions factory at Finsbury told me that his firm intended to install plant to the value of £1,250,000. Moreover, that particular factory will be engaged in the production of heavy steel products, unlike other factories which are cneaged in the production of light article? and luxuries which command a quick turnover. I propose to quote some statistics which I obtained to-day and which I understand were released by the Premier of South Australia. Although the information has not hitherto been made public I do not consider that I shall be doing any harm by releasing it. I preface my citation with the admission that the value of money has deteriorated, and the price of fame commodities might even have doubled in the last ten years. The statistics to which I refer show that the value of the production of South Australia increased from £33,000,000 before the war to £104,000,000 last year. I think that the degree of that increase gives sufficient indication of the increased production of South Australia. WhilstI do not usually interject when honourable members are speaking, I was moved to do so during the speech of the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt), who made a serious misstatement of fact. He referred to the importation of coal by the Liberal Governments of Victoria and South Australia, and I interjected to inquire whether any coal had actually been imported. In reply, the honourable member referred to a statement made by the Premier of South Australia. I took the trouble to examine the report of that -statement which is contained in to-day's Issue of the Adelaide Advertiser. That report stated, in part, that 10,000 tons of coal will be imported from England for the haulage of ore from BrokenH ill to Port Pirie. The report went on to state that the steel companies concerned will pay the difference between the price of local coal and that which is to be imported. However, the significant fact is that no one yet knows how great that difference may be. It is also intended to obtain supplies of coal from South Africa, but supplies are conditional upon that country granting export licences. The South African coal is intended to be used by a government trust in Adelaide. Whilst[ readily admit that the decision to import coal to fulfil requirements represents, a forward step on the part of the State governments concerned, I point out that so far no coal has materialized. 1 pay a tribute to the Liberal Government of South Australia for its action in taking over the Adelaide Electric Supply Company and continuing with the work of erecting the new power plant at Osborne that was opened a few weeks ago. That was a step in the right direction. In a press statement, the manager of the South Australian Electricity Trust has said that, provided the trust can get adequate supplies of coal, there will be no need to increase the price of electricity. ment felt that by taking that action it He has said, further, that if sufficient quantities of coal are made available the trust can provide from its plants all the electric power that is needed. The difficulties with regard to electricity in cities in other States, particularly in Sydney and Perth, have been caused largely by failure to make provision for an extension of generating plants to meet the increased demand for electric power. This Government has done all that it possibly can do to keep the wheels of industry turning. Honourable gentlemen opposite do not agree with that statement. They contend that the Government has not "" stepped in "" fast enough. The honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) is an old hand at this game. The right honourable gentleman knows as well as I do that when there is, as there is to-day, a tremendous need for production and a shortage of the man-power that is necessary to achieve that production, it is impossible to force men to work by taking action under the Crimes Act or other legislation. I remember that on one occasion the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) addressed the coal-miners and did all that he could to get them, to return to work, but he was unsuccessful. later. back a week later, in any case. they may remain out for a month, or whatever the period may be, and at the end of that time they usually go back. The point that I am trying to make is that at the present time men form their own views and will not do just what any leader would like them to do. Irrespective of whether it is the Prime Minister or anybody else who appeals to them, in the end it rests with the men themselves to decide what they are going to do. In an attempt to achieve industrial peace, this Government took action with which honourable gentlemen opposite did not altogether agree. It appointed ten Conciliation Commissioners, most of whom had been closely associated with industry and trade unions. The Governwas doing something thnt would avoid many unnecessary stoppages and achieve greater production. However, even though governments may do all that they can do to make provision for the avoidance of stoppages, if men decide to stop work they cannot be prevented from doing EO. I do not agree with the statements that have been made to the effect that the",45,Australia S Manufacturin G Economy

133,Mr Thompson,"They come out,Prime Minister has played up to the -extremists in industry and let them get away with it to their hearts' content. In my view, unnecessary stoppages of work will not cease until trade unionists as a whole realize that unnecessary stoppages are not in their interests or in the interests of workers generally. I hope that the tide is beginning to turn and that the men are beginning to realize that they as well as the Government have a responsibility to Australia and to the community generally. I want the individual man, whether he be a coal-miner, a seaman, or a waterside worker, to realize that if for some inadequate reason he holds up the production of coal or delays the loading or the sailing of a ship he is other condition was that there should causing trouble to other men in other branches of industry. I want him to appreciate that this Government has done all that is possible to prevent unnecessary stoppages. The individual unionist will never agree to surrender his right to strike. If any employee is convinced that he cannot carry on in a fair and reasonable way, it is for him to decide whether or not he will continue. If an employer does not wish to continue in an industry, he is at liberty to close his factory. I do not think that that fact is always sufficiently recognized in some statements that are made in connection with these matters. It is a very good thing for the House and the country that we should have an opportunity of expressing a few thoughts on this topic. This afternoon one honourable member opposite said that in the last year before World War II., during the regime of the Menzies Government, approximately 39,000 houses were erected. I ask the honourable gentleman, with due deference, what the government of the day had to do with that? Approximately five years ago I was appointed by the Treasurer as a member of the Commonwealth Housing Commission. The present Premier of South Australia, Mr Playford, having congratulated me upon my appointment, said, "" I want you to understand that when we were discussing the transfer of powers not one Australian Premier was agreeable to transfer to the Commonwealth Government powers regarding housing"". report of the Commonwealth Housing Mr Thompson. Commission was one of the best that has been prepared. That fact is, I think, generally recognized. In their report, all that the members of the commission could do was to recommend to the Australian Government that the only powers it had over housing, apart from war service homes, and homes for Government employees, was in regard to finance, and that it could make finance available to State governments under certain conditions. It made certain recommendations. Two main conditions were specified. One concerned a rental rebate on houses built for rental if the rent amounted to more than one-fifth of the income of the tenant. The be a limit placed upon the expenditure on any one house. That entailed that only reasonable types of houses should be constructed. All the States except South Australia are working under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. They are building houses with money supplied by the Commonwealth. Let me say now that it is the State itself which is responsible for the building of the houses. It may be alleged that indirectly the Commonwealth is to blame for the lag in home-building, but the Commonwealth could be blamed only if it had power over production. I remember debates in this House on the subjects of banking, free medicine and national health. The Leader of the Opposition caused an amendment to be made to the question that was put to the people at a referendum regarding the control of health services. The amendment had the effect of including in the question asked of the people a proviso that the Government's powers to legislate for a national health service should not be such as to include conscription of the labour of doctors or chemists. It was only with that proviso that the Opposition supported that portion of the referendum proposals. Now honourable members opposite want us to say to workmen that they must work in steelworks. By doing so those honourable members are forsaking their old argument regarding conscription of labour. The States, whether governed by Labour or Liberal governments, bear a great deal of the responsibility for production lags. TheyI claim that the have powers that this Parliament does not possess. State governments can introduce legislation of a nature that the Australian Government could not introduce, and do things thereby that the Australian Government could not do, yet the shortage of houses is attributed to the Australian Government. The Australian Government has no control over the number of houses built in any one State. All the control it has is whatever it may assume through some arrangement that it may make with the State concerned or with a board set up by that State to regulate the production and allocation of materials. ment is taking most of the available buildbers opposite were in office, ing materials for public buildings. member who has just interjected would be one of the first to complain that the Government was not building sufficient repatriation hospitals or something of that nature. Very likely he is like myself, and has been w-riting to the Postmaster General and asking for a new post office to be erected in a town in his electorate. I do not doubt that when, some municipality or individual in the honourable member's electorate writes to him and complains about inadequate postal facilities caused by inadequate premises, he does not write back and say that the Commonwealth is using too much material and that the work on that post office must wait until something else has been built first. It is all very well to criticize the reasonably. Indeed, I and my colleagues Government. The honourable member will complain next that the Government is taking a bank and not building one in its place. The honourable member is going around the mulberry bush, as it were, and if he cannot pick a mulberry on one side he will pick one on the other, providing it is a green one, and he will say that the Government is providing a sour mulberry. That is typical of the Opposition's methods. Honourable members opposite do not look at the good fruit which the ceeding with my own remarks. He Government is growing. They only wish to seize on something that has not been matured, such, for instance, as the arbitration system. They pick on that and blame the Government for not doing things that it should have done. We on this side of the House realize, with honourable members opposite, that the first prerequisite of an increase in production and manufacturing is the obtaining of electric and hydro-electric power, and coal. We must get that power first and supply it to industry at a price that will enable it to be economically used. I quite appreciate the views of honourable members opposite about coal, but I desire to say also that whilst I ask the coal miner to do his best in production, I think that honourable members opposite should accept some of the responsibility for the coal situation as it is now because of the heritage that we now have which resulted from the treatment of the coal miners in the past when honourable memThe honourable member's time has expired the Opposition) [9.5] I consider that this debate has been a useful and an> interesting one. It was opened this afternoon with a speech by the honourable member for Eawkner( Mr Holt). His speech, I consider, was an uncommonly informative and thoughtful one, and I am only sorry that it was not made at a time when it might have enjoyed a greater audience over the radio. The honourable member who has just resumed his seat, indicated particularly in his closing passages, some faint hostility to the Opposition, but apart from that I should like to say to him that I think he put his case most here who were members of the Menzies Government are indebted to him for the testimonial that he gave us regarding the industrial development of South Australia, which, as he knows, is the direct result of a deliberate act of policy by us when we established large munitions works there during the first two years of the last war, when we had the responsibility of office. He said something else upon which I shall comment before propointed outI consider quite rightlythat none of those problems is easy of solution. The greatest mistake that any of us can make in discussing these matters is to assume that those problems are simple. They are not a bit simple. I think it is also dangerous to generalize about industry as a whole. All industry",47,Australia S Manufacturin G Economy

137,Mr Menzies (Kooyong,"Leade r ofis not equally efficient, all production effort per man-hour is not uniform in Australia. There are some industries in which I believe the performance per manhour is excellent, and nobody could criticize it. The honourable member mentioned one such industry, and I could mention others. That, of course, is very true of the machine industries. From inspections that I have made recently of the steel industries I consider that the work done by steelworkers is beyond praise. But there are other industries in which the productive effort is grossly inadequate, and that is why I do not desire to generalize, but to particularize. right through the wall of such a house. The productive effort in the coal industry at present is much below what this country needs, and the productive effort in the to build for £500 or £600. I was told building industry is, unfortunately, so much lower than it ought to be that it is a very large factor in the cost of building from the cost of the land, fencing and homes in Australia. As all honourable members know, since the House last met I have travelled extensively in three States, very largely for the purpose of going into industrial centres and visiting factories and workshops. From time to time. I made speeches, including dozens to trade union audiences. it was quite a useful experience and I returned from it reinforced in a view that I entertained in a general way before that there are three things of paramount importance which are relevant to the matter before the chair. The first, is that we in Australia must aim at reducing, or at lea6t holding, prices. The rising price level is a constant source of anxiety me that, in the long run, a guarantee of to people all over Australia. It is very true that the factors that contribute to rising price levels are not always properly avoid unemployment, but also in developrealized. Sometimes, it must be said, the very people who, by their own failure to realize the needs of production, get away from the practice of having all have contributed to higher prices, complain about the high prices when they occur. As a national problem the reducing, or at the least, the holding of prices is of paramount importance. There is another matter of great imwhich I have set forth unless we observe portance. We must endeavour by every certain conditions. When the honourable conceivable means to house our people at member for Deakin( Mr Hutchinson) a reasonable cost. We tend to talk rather was sneaking, some one asked him what too much in terms of the number of was his solution of our problems. I think houses completed. WheneverI look at we have all been here long enough to new groups of houses being built in housrealize that there is no easy solution. No Mr Menzies. ing settlements, and inquire about the cost, and look at the quality of the buildings, I am horrified to think that people should have to pay such fantastic prices in order to get into such common-place dwellings. Recently, I looked over some houses being built in a New South Wales town by the Housing Commission. No one could be proud of them. They were wooden houses and were, I thought, crudely finished, the interior partitions being merely fibro plaster. The honourable member for Hindmarsh, who has just concluded his speech, could, with one dramatic gesture, put his fist They were the sort of cottages which, before the war, one would have expected with some pride that the cost was working out at about £1,600 a piece, apart furniture. What ordinary wage-earner could expect to build or acquire a home a» that price? I come now to the third matter, which, while it may not be the concern of those who are not used to examining national I think problems, should, nevertheless, be very much the concern of honourable members of this Parliament. It is this: We must aim at producing, not only in order to meet our own local requirements, but also to capture and hold new and permanent markets overseas. Time and time again I have emphasized to such members of the public as were willing to hear full employment must lie not alone in the provision of public works designed to ing markets in other countries for things which we make in Australia. We must our eggs in one basket. We must cease to be exporters of primary products only, and must in addition develop an export trade in secondary manufactures. I do not believe that we can successfully achieve any of the three objectives one can write out a neat formula on a piece of paper and say, "" Do this and all will be well"". We are dealing with intangible human factors. We must seek by persuasion to make the people understand more and more the nature of the problems that confront us. That is why a debate of this kind is so valuable. As a preliminary to solving our problems certain conditions must obtain. In the first place, it will have to be learned-not , [ hope, in the hard way-that failure in one section of productive industry may do irreparable injury in other sections. The honourable member referred to this in the course of his speech. TfI may put the matter in biblical terms, we must learn that we are all members one of another, as far as the industrial situation is concerned. Some time ago, I was at Muswellbrook, which is on the fringe of the electorate of the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott). It is an important dairying district, and on the outskirts of the town a factory is being erected for the production of powdered milk, for which there is a big market outside Australia. The establishment of such a factory is of great importance to the dairy-farmers of the district, because it would give them a market right at their door. The factory has been under construction for two years. It will not be a huge building, although it will be adequate for its purpose. I was told that it would be another twelve months before the building was completed. I said that I could not begin to understand why there was so much delay in the completion of a building which was obviously of such importance to an important group of primary producers. I was told that it was impossible to obtain reinforcing rods for the concrete work. Honourable members will understand that, in the construction of such a factory, there must be a great deal of concrete work for the bedding down of heavy machinery, for the flooring, and for the side members. Why is there a shortage of reinforcing rods? Because there is a general shortage of steel. The reason for that has been stated, and I shall return to it presently. In other country areas, people are unsteel ingots were produced each year, able to produce as much as they otherwise whilst, as I have said, during each could because there is a grave shortage of the last three years only 75 per of machinery. Where such machinery is locally made, the shortage is due to the fact that it is impossible to obtain some particular kind of iron or steel. In another place one finds that there is a shortage of fencing wire and wire netting, without which farmers cannot subdivide their properties, or protect them from rabbits. Here, again, th% difficulty is due to a shortage of iron and steel. All over the country one sees wooden houses complete as to foundations and walls, but without roofs, because corrugated iron is not available. In other places one hears for Hindmarsh of a shortage of builders' hardware, plumbers' material, and piping. Such shortages are commonplace, and every time they occasion delay in the completion of buildings the cost of the buildings increases. A house built in fits and starts over a long period must necessarily be much dearer than one the construction of which proceeds steadily from beginning to end. Always, when one seeks the root of the trouble, one is referred to the steel industry at Newcastle and Port Kembla. I confess that working in iron and steel is a man's job. Those who are engaged in the industry are working efficiently, a fact which the management is quite ready to admit. The managers say that they have a good team to worK with, and they have no complaints about efficiency. Why, then, is it that at the greatest of our steelworks production during the last three years has been only 75 per cent, of capacity, and that for this year it is expected to be only 58 per cent, or at most, 60 per cent. ? The reason is the shortage of coal. management do not say so, and they should know. The population of Australia was smaller in 1941 and 1942 than it is now, and from that population 1,000,000 persons were subtracted and transferred from civilian occupations to service in the armed forces, to say nothing of the hundreds of thousands who were employed in specialized occupations in the production of munitions; yet in 1941 and 1942 over 1,000,000 tons of",49,Australia S Manufacturin G Economy

139,Mr Menzies,"Thos e engaged incent, of that quantity has been produced, and for the present year the quantity is so far not expected to exceed 60 per cent. The answer is not a shortage of man-power in the steelworks. The answer is a shortage of production on the coal-fields. Nobody who looks at the problem, and goes up there and discusses it on the spot, will fail to find that the shortage of coal production is due to a variety of circumstances. There is a good deal of Communist interference; there is a tremendous snarl of unnecessary stoppages, and there is a violent and unreasonable opposition to the mechanical extraction of pillars. With mechanization, we would be getting from those fields alone another 3,000,000 tons of coal a year. basically, the answer goes back to the very matter referred to by the honourable member, and subsequently, by myself. the real failure is the failure in the minds of the people concerned in that while they may earn adequate wages by working four shifts a week, as they do, by denying the community the result of the fifth shift they are denying the community iron and steel and continuity of productive employment in a series of subsequent activities and that they are pushing up the cost and limiting the quantity of production on the land, and increasing the cost of housing. They do an act of deep injury to the rest of the community. must be emphasized so far as we can emphasize it from this place. It needs plain speaking not only by politicians and above all not only by members of the Opposition. This is common ground, or it ought to be common ground, for all of us. By every conceivable word and effort union leaders themselves ought to get their people to understand that no section of the community can live to itself. We are all in this problem of production, and until all do their job it is forcing up of prices. It is a destructive, useless to talk about rising prices because all these things mean under-production; and under-production in the face of the present purchasing power in the country must mean rising prices. Let me remind everybody that with under-production and vast purchasing power prices must, llr. Menzies. rise, and we must inevitably reach a poinr of time when that crazy structure crashes. These policies of under-production and indifference to the welfare of the rest of the community are the inevitable precursor and cause of depressions. Depressions are not made by deliberate scheming on the part of somebody, by wicked planning of some political kind. Depressions are produced because you get a boil-up in the price level. The whole structure becomes unsound, and then it begins to collapse. Therefore, it is of the first importance that it should come to be realized in all sections of industry that we are all in this matter together. The second condition is closely allied But, to the first; it is that full employment depends upon full production. The public attitude to this matter is all wrong. There is an attempt to say that full production is the inevitable result of full employment. It is nothing of the industry to realize that kind. Full employment depends in the long run upon full production. An evil doctrine is being disseminated in Australia to-day. I have encountered it in many places. It is an attractive doctrine, but very evil; and it sums itself up in one slogan, "" Look old man, don't work yourself out of a job. Don't go too hard because if you do, the job will finish more quickly and you will be out of a job "". That slogan is attractive on the face of it. This is the justification for all the go-slow That is the first thing which advocacy carried on in Australia and with some success in many sections of industry "" Don't work yourself out of a job "". The truth is that under-production will ultimately weaken our true capacity to produce, because we can get into an entirely wrong frame of mind on this matter. But under-production at a time when the purchasing power of the country is so high for a variety of reasons, including the extraordinary prices we are receiving for our exports, must mean a indeed, a self-destructive, attitude. If we were producing fully, with vigour and efficiency, we would not only be supplying the demands of our own people at prices which would cease to rise but we would also be putting ourselves in a position to supply the wants of people all around the world and thus provide ourselves with markets which would maintain in continuous employment the population o j Australia. The next 'thing I say with reference honourable gentleman mean by best conto this great problem of production is ditions? that we shall not solve it unless we meet and overthrow the real menace of comber knows that if at one end we take a munism. I am not going to talk about first-class colliery on the Maitland field communism in rhetorical terms. All I like the John Darling colliery and at say is that it is a real menace and that the other end look at a mine like the until we over-throw and defeat it , we Wonthaggi' mine in Victoria, in which «hall not defeat the problem of production there is a miserable seam of coal and conbecause where Communists are most ditions of mining are most difficult, we active and successful, production is at its find at the John Darling colliery, under lowest because these are the people who first-class conditions and with a wonderful have preached this doctrine more successseam of coal, hours which cannot be refully and continuously than anybody else. garded as excessive and wages which, as Nobody can go round, as I have myself, the honourable member knows, are far and have discussions with scores, or beyond the wages earned by the ordinary hundreds, of wage-earners in factories and skilled worker in many other industries. workshops and have their views without knowing that there is a rising impatience be paid good wages? among the decent wage-earners in Australia with communism and with the tolerance of communism. We must get it about, their wages; I merely recite the clearly into our minds that ""these people fact. The fact is that in that mine the are our enemies. Does anybody in this wages of miners employed at the coal face HouseI am sure that no honourable range up to £4 12s. a shift, the lowest member does-suppos e for one moment that the Communist is seeking for better production in Australia? The question answers itself. His actions have been destructive from first to last, and the being the product of bad conditions, aims people are becoming increasingly imto bo their cause-whic h is a very differpatient about it . How are we to deal with ent matter-com e to this very place and communism? Again, I am not producing say, "" Here is where we start our actisome medicine, free or otherwise, out of vities "". They are immeasurably more a bottle. On this subject the Prime active in the good coal mines than in the Minister published an advertisement quite bad ones. When they read in the newsrecently headed "" Common sense about papers that communism is the product of communism"". It is a very attractively evil conditions, they must smile, because printed advertisement, and the Prime they are devoting the whole of their Minister, I see at a glance, is imenergies to getting rid of good conditions measurably more photogenic than I am. wherever they find them because their It is a very nice picture. What does he objective is misery and despair, a state say in the advertisement? He saysCommunism can be beaten by improving the absorb revolutionary ideas. "" Common conditions of the people. Bad conditions are sense about communism "" this advertisethe soil in which communism thrives. In other words, the proposition is that positive approach to this problem, not communism in Australia is the product that which is merely a process of putting of bad conditions. If that is so, I put one's head in the sand. I divide the two questions to honourable members approach into two parts. First, inside the opposite. One is this: How is it that trade unions, I believe that this Parcommunism is most active and vitriolic liament has a duty, which I hope it w ill and so successful in the coal mines in perform, to restore complete industrial which the best conditions and highest wages obtain? being £3. It cannot be said that such a wage level, and conditions of the kind that exist there, represent the bad conditions which produce communism. Yet, the agents of communism, which, so far from of mind in which people will be ready to ment is called! I believe that there is a",51,Australia S Manufacturin G Economy

141,Mr Menzies,The honourable mem,53,Australia S Manufacturin G Economy
142,Mr Cokklan,Why should they not,53,Australia S Manufacturin G Economy
143,Mr Menzies,"I am not arguingdemocracy by placing control of the unions in the hands of their rank-and-file members, and not in those of a few people who, having gained power by one means or other, presume to exercise it at their own sweet will. ""What sort of democracy would there be politically in this country if every individual adult did not have the right to record his or her vote at a secret ballot? 1 hope that nobody will suggest that we should go back to the bad old days when there was no secret ballot and people were stood over when recording their votes. not come from the party on this side of the House. able members opposite are now hearing from this side of the House a proposal that they should apply the same idea of democracy to the trade unions. My friend, the honourable member for Boothhy( Mr Sheehy), knows that that is a great and powerful answer to irresponsible Communist activity. Under such a system no longer would it be possible for n handful of Communists-and they are necessarily a handful because there is no union in Australia that does not contain a clear majority of those opposed to communism-to call meetings at odd times when it is thought that loyal trade unionists can not be present. The answer to this problem is to restore something which is vital to this country. Just as the trade unions are vital to Australia so democratic control of the trade unions by their members is vital. There is only one method of democratic control worth talking about and that is control by vote in a secret ballot. I believe that if paryear the British Labour party re-publiaments, wherever they exist, were to adopt that method, so that it became universal, and if we were not limited to our constitutional function of dealing only with interstate disputes, the Communist who to-day is the king pin in some of the key unions in Australia would more and more be put back in his place. We should then have moderately led unions and sober decisions by them. We should then get rid of a whole lot of the stupid and criminal stoppages and the country would have immeasurably better production. Outside the unions we should recognize treason for what it is. Does any one doubt that the true Australian Communist is treasonable? Can any one doubt that the true Australian CommunistI do not mean that poor fish, the "" fellow traveller "", the fellow properly described as a "" rat-bag "" who bounces up and down around the fringes of meetings, but the true Communist-owe s allegiance to the Soviet Union? I gather that the Sydney Trades Hall Council has no doubt on that matter, because it recently so declared in a very notable resolution. Although responsible people are coming more and more to realize that communism is treason, the Government invariably says "" No. Do not worry about that. All you have to do is to raise wage levels, shorten hours or perform some other industrial movement, and all of a sudden these wretched traitors will become loyal citizens and your troubles will be at an end."" BeforeI conclude I want to bring that argument a little nearer home. Wherever one goes in Australia up to that point one meets with a great deal of agreement, but at that point some one is hound to say, "" The true protection against communism is a strong socialist party "". I want, with my usual restraint, to speak in mild terms on this matter, but I say that that araument is utter trash. As a matter of fact the socialist movement in Australia has for too long got away with the piece of humbug that it is really opposed to communism. A little careful analysis will show clearly how untrue that suggestion is. Only last lished a centenary volume of the Communist manifesto of Marx and Engels. It has the honour of containing a foreword by Professor H . J. Laski, who recently resented being told that he was of Communist tendencies, and brought a libel action with deplorable lack of success. In the foreword by the Labour party the opening sentence roadsI n presenting this centenary volume of the Communist manifesto, with the valuable historical introduction by Professor Laski, the Labour party acknowledges its indebtedness to Marx and Engels as two of the men who have been the inspiration of the whole working class movement.",53,Australia S Manufacturin G Economy
144,Mr Sheeity,Such a suggestion would,54,Australia S Manufacturin G Economy
145,Mr Menzies,"I hope not. HonorOf course, they have no connection with the fellow next door in Australia! Across the seas the Labour party changes into something altogether different. In Australia the Labour Government says, "" Leave it to the socialists to clean up the Communists "". Let me ask the socialists in this House and wherever socialists may be found, ""What are the Communists aiming at?"". That, surely, must be worth a little thought. What are they after? Do not assume that the Communist leaders in Australia are fools. Do not assume that the Communist leaders in the world are fools. It is a great mistake to think that the man you are fighting is a fool. Let us assume, as we should, that the?* men have some intelligent conception in their minds of what Communists are aiming at. [Extension of time grantcd.-\ What are they aiming at? Let me, in a few minutes, endeavour to answer that question. Are they aiming at mere disorder? If they are aiming at mere disorder, then their movement is admittedly a criminal movement. Any movement that sets out to create disorder in an orderly community accustomed to the rule of law is a criminal movement. I do not eare whether there is anything about it in the Crimes Act; it is criminal if that is its objective. If the Government believes that that is the objective of the Communist party, it has no shadow of an excuse for not dealing with communism as a criminal movement. Somebody may say "" No, they are aiming at something more than that "", so let us have a second shot at answering the question. Are the Communists aiming at some state such as Russia in which a ruthless minority holds absolute power? Are they aiming at a minority government established and maintained by force? If they are, again they are a criminal movement, because that result cannot be achieved without overthrowing the entire parliamentary system in this country, and abolishing universal franchise. Those things cannot be overthrown without revolution, and I mean revolution with bloodshed. Ls that what the Communists are aiming at, because that is a definition of civil war; and a movement that aims at civil war is a criminal movement. What possible third answer is there to the question? AlthoughI have thought about the matter considerably, I cannot find any further answer other than that in the long run the Communists are aiming to establish a socialist state. Honourable members opposite may retort, "" But our methods are different "". Parliamentary socialists in Australia say, "" Yes, our method is the method of orderly progression through acts of Parliament, supported by a majority of the people. We aim by constitutional means to produce the socialist state"". It will be the same socialist state as that which the Communists aim to produce, although admittedly it will be produced less violently. But what is the difference in the ultimate objective? Honourable members opposite may have their choice on this matter. Once it is established that the socialist state, with the Government as the universal master, is the objective of both parties, and it is retorted that the methods of the parties are fundamentally different I say, "" All right, what is the difference ? Your methods are peaceful and theirs are violent. What government, so believing, can stand quietly by and permit as a lawful movement in this country, a party which it admits is designed to use violence to achieve its ends ? "" A simple examination of this problem, I venture to say, makes these things abundantly clear, and makes it equally abundantly clear that just as we should establish industrial democracy in the unions, so we should treat a treasonable and criminal movement outside the unions as a treasonable and criminal movement and an enemy of this country, because, in the long run, we must put the Communists down or they shall destroy us. House is discussing a paper on Australia's manufacturing economy presented by the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman). The debate gives honourable members an opportunity to discuss broadly the expansion of our manufacturing industries, our methods of production, the causes of the alleged under-production, and, in the still wider sphere entered by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) the causes of and remedies for communism. I propose to say a few words about some matters mentioned by",54,Australia S Manufacturin G Economy
146,Mr Daly (Martin) [9.44],"Thethe Leader of the Opposition and certain other speakers.. I amon common ground with the right honourable'gentleman on the necessity for adequate production! of coal if the industries of' this country are to be maintained. Coal is basic to our economy, and upon the quantity of coal produced aind its transport to many parts of the Commonwealth,, depend various other industries which are vital to' our economic existence. I believe;,, therefore-, that coal productionmust be keptat the maximum. A coupleof years ago, I attended a coal conference convened, by the International Labour Organization at Geneva. At that meeting I sat with representativesof other coal-producing nations-, and heard them discuss their problems. I might have been talking to a group of fellow Australians. I soon learned that coal mining problems were not confined to this country, but were common toall coal-producing countries. Reference was made, for instance, toa shortage of man-power, mistrust between employers and employees-, and lack of mechanized equipment. Clearly, throughout the world under-production in the coal mines was causing industrial dislocation. problem has not yet been solved. Industrial output in most parts of the. world is hampered by a lack of coal, and the problems which beset coal production in this country are to be found in all other coal-producing lands. Particularly in Europe, heavy demands are being mad© upon industries to overtake existing shortages of various commodities. Production figures of pre-war years have to be considerably exceeded to meet changed world conditions. I emphasize therefore that coal-mining problems are not confined to this country, but are shared by all nations in which this vital commodity is produced. The Leader of the Opposition has referred to the part played by Communists in hindering production by causing strikes in the coal mines at crucial periods. I agree with the right honourable gentleman that the Communists are responsible for many unnecessary stoppages in the coal mining industry which bring misery and privation to the working people of Australia. I hold no brief for any person who supports communism. All members of the Australian Labour party recognize the growth of communismas the real 3fr. Daly. menace to the working people; Atthe same time, the. Government and. the members, of our party have: at least a common policy on how communism is to be stopped. I reiterate the view already expressed that commiunism,'. has grown out of the conditions that existed in Australia in those tragic years prior to She prosperity that weenjoy to-day. vernment ! anti-Labour governments^ whose, policj resulted in queues of people looking for work. Blame for the growth of communism must be laid at their door. This Government believes that by improving the conditions r of the workers, b.v creating better conditions generally, and by bringing prosperity to people in all walks of life, it will be able to destroy for ever the. evils of coniimunism and the hopesof those people who. would, foist it upon us. We on this sidehave; a common policy. We believe that we have gone a long way along the road towards the achievement That of our objectives. The Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) has given to the people a. clear and definite indication of the fact that we are innoway sunrtoirtexs. of communism, that we are viciously opposed to it and that we represent, as a party, the only opposition worth mentioning to the growth of communism. But what do we find on the other side? We find that the Opposition parties, have a dozen different methods of stamping out communism. The Leader ef the Opposition said that the Communist party was a criminal organization, that his party recognized communism as a treasonable movement and that Communists would be treated as traitors. He implied that the Communist party would be banned by his party if it were returned to power. He has stated seA'eral times publicly recently that if he were returned as Prime Minister, the Communist party would be banned. But what does the Liberal Premier of Victoria, Mr Hollway, say? He is a member of the same party and has signed the same pledge of loyalty to Liberal principles. Has he banned the Communist party? No! He has appointed a royal commission. The Leader",55,Australia S Manufacturin G Economy
147,Mr Fuleek,Under the Menzies Go,56,Australia S Manufacturin G Economy
148,Mr Daly,"They existed under allof the Opposition savsthat, the Communist party is a treasonableorganization. Mr Hollway is of the same political ilk as the leader of the Opposition'. He leads a government with all the sovereign power necessary to ban the Communist party Yet he has not banned it. All he has done Es' to appoint a royal commission. The results are-known to-day. He agrees with a Communist renegade in fne person of a man named Sbarpley. The Sunday Telegraph of the 24th April reported Mr Holhvay as having saidI am inclined to agree with Mr Sharpley in his published article in the Melbourne Herald that immediate and outright banning of the Communist party would not have all the desirable consequences most people would expect of it . Fancy that!' One would never think that he was in the same party as the Leader of the Opposition. He addedThe banning of the Communist party was only a short-term answer to communism. What a pity that the Leader of the Opposition does not read Mr Hollway's statement! Mr Hollway added-and this is interestingAs a long-term plan you must eliminate the social conditions which provide a breeding ground for communism. The Victorian Government has been carrying out its policy of fighting communism by improving living conditions during the past two years of its period in office. On the Victorian side of the border, we find Liberal recognition of the fact that this Government is facing the problem by removing the conditions that have brought communism about and for which honourable members who support the parties opposite are in the main responsible. We are criticized for our lack of action in endeavouring to stop the growth of communism in Australia. I speak from memory when I quote Mr selves, what action they can expect from McDonald, leader of the Victorian Country party, as having saidAt least the Chifley Government is prosecuting for seditious utterances members of the Communist party, which is more than the Hollway Government is doing in Victoria. It is more than Liberal leaders in the States where Liberal governments rule are doing. The Playford Government in South Australia and the Liberal Government in Western Australia have not taken any action to carry out the ! Economy. 49 announced policy of the Liberal party to ban the Communist organization. As a government, we say that the utterances of &-& Leader of the Ormosition are mere electioneeringcatchcries, are not honest and lack sincerity, and that the people cannot expect him to carry out the policy, because the Liberal Premiers have not supported him in any shape or form and are applying an entirely different policy. The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Bowden) said that the State could do anything, in the matter of prices control. We were told that the States were better organized than was the Commonwealth and were closer to the problem and that only they could do the job efficiently and well. The honourable member for Gippsland ran all round Victoria saying that. Yet, to-night, he says that communism is not a State problem. He is trying to dodge the issue. The Australian Country party has enough issues, to dodge already without trying to dodge that one. We realize the part that the Communists play in Australia in stopping necessary production and in denying to the people the necessaries and amenities of life. This Government is facing the problem. We are fighting communism in the places where it really matters-the trade unions, the workshops, and in this Parliamenton the issues that really matter by improving the living conditions of the people. Australians need to bear well in mind the half-hearted attempts of the Liberal State Premiers in dealing with the Communist party. Let the people compare the statements of Mr Hollway and other Liberal. Premiers with those made by the Leader of the Opposition, and they will be able to judge for themthe Liberal party with its dozen different policies on this issue. The honourable member for Deaklin( Mr Hutchinson) said that we had built up in this country manufacturing industries to the detriment of our primary industries. He would have us believe that we should have only primary production in Australia. He is one of those honourable members of the Opposition who in days gone by were prepared",56,Australia S Manufacturin G Economy
149,Mr Bowrarn,The State cannot do it.,57,Australia S Manufacturin G Economy
150,Mr Daly,"The State cannot do it?to send all our raw materials out of Australia for manufacture in other countries and then buy back the manufactured products. We believe that we should manufacture in Australia, Australian workmen, everything that it is possible to manufacture here. That policy was commenced by the Scullin Government to which the people of Australia owe an undying debt of gratitude. foundations on which Australian secondary industries have been developed. Before the war, the establishment of secondary industries was seriously neglected, but, with the outbreak of war, Great Britain was unable, because of its vast commitments, to provide us with a great many of the necessities with which to prosecute the war, and we were thrown on our own resources and had to manufacture for ourselves our own war needs. So, with the outbreak of war, we had to establish munitions factories and the like, and we saw a remarkable growth of secondary industry in Australia, which has carried on into the post-war years, as is shown in the statement of the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction. [ agree with most people that it is impossible to expect the primary industries of Australia to maintain the employable population for an unlimited Before the war, the people were mainly dependent on tbe primary industries for employment. Many thousands of people in all walks of life, anxious, and willing to learn a trade, were unable to find the necessary employment to do so. That position has changed and, with the growth of those industries, employment in that field has increased by about 500,000 persons during the past ten years. The honourable member for Hindmarsh Thompson) spoke of the expansion that has occurred in South Australia, and honourable members from other States know that similar remarkable development has occurred elsewhere throughout Australia. pressed with the great industrial potentialities of Australia and with the opportunities that have been created for the exploitation of those potentialities by the progressive efforts of this Government. We have been told by honourable members opposite that man-hour production is Mr Daly. inadequate, that our methods are bad and that the Government has done nothing to improve industries. It is a remarkable fact that, despite their bitter criticism, employing industrialists have come to Australia in hundreds with the object of establishing industries here. The Daily Mirror of the 6th February, 1948, reported the activities of overseas industrialists in Australia under these headings-""Rush for That Government laid the Factories: Thirty British Agents Here: New Plants Established.*' The article statedMore than thirty representatives of British manufacturing firms were in Australia at present surveying opportunities for the establishment of factories, the Premier( Mr McOirr) said to-day. High praise for Australia was expressed by Mr L. Hartnett, a leading Australian industrialist, whose remarks should interest the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett). Mr Hartnett must be well known to the honourable member, at least by reputation, and I am sure that he will agree that Mr Hartnett's political views are not predominantly socialist. The Daily Mirror reported an interview with Mr Hartnett upon his return from abroad recently in these termsWith its abundance of food and raw materials, vast untapped resources, and healthy period. climate. Aivtralia is the best country in the world, according to MrL . Hartnett, a leading Australian industrialist. "" In the last seven months"", he said, "" 1 have visited twenty countries, and 1 say without any qualification that none is better off than Australia."" Mr Robert Butler, a former Ambassador to Australia from the United States of America, has also spoken in glowing terms of this country. I shall not quote his remarks to the honourable member for ( Mr Henty, because I fear that these facts do not please him. However, after his return from Australia, Mr Butler told the people of America of the great conditions in Australia and the wonderful opportunities that exist here for indusWe cannot but be imtrialists and others seeking to establish new businesses. The matters that I have discussed this evening are of extreme importance to Australians who depend upon manufacturing industries for their employment, their welfare and their living conditions. Although primary industries are of vital importance to us, we cannot neglect the wide field provided by the manufacturing industries for the employment of our people and the betterment of their standard of living. I commend the Minister for his speech. The paper has been well presented, it contains a wealth of information, and it is a tribute to the progressiveness of the Government in this very important national sphere. adjourned.

In pursuance of an agreement made in 1.0-115 between representatives of the Commonwealth Government, the Government of New South Wales and Mr M. M. Wire, experimental plantings of 150 acres to ramie were made in a number of areas as an initial step towards meeting the shortage of fibres in Australia. For varior-s reasons, most of the experimental areas proved unsatisfactory. The agreement was terminated and at present .

The Commonwealth EmployPrime ment Service is an essential part of the Government's plans for maintaining f u l l employment providing, e.g. the means for obtaining and furnishing vital data about the labour market of relevance to the proposed establishment of new enterprises and use of the national works reserve and other economic stabilising instruments and for handling the labour transfers involved. That there is full employment in Australia, is, in one sense, a tribute to the effectiveness of the service. Under the conditions of f u l l employment, the most effective ultilization of the aptitude, skills and abilities of all workers is of paramount importance and a skilled employment service can contribute to this by guiding workers using it to the jobs .where their",60,Ramie

159,"1,486 Mr Davidson Asked The Minister For",,62,Bureau Broadcasting Of Warnings
160,Mr Johnson,"The answers to thethe Gladstone and adjacent districts in 'Queensland recently and of the methods of broadcasting warnings. The cyclone reached its greatest intensity at Gladstone about midday on Wednesday, the 2nd March. The first preliminary warning was issued by the Brisbane Meteorological Branch on Saturday, the 26th February. The first cyclone warning was issued at 10.30 a.m. on Sunday, the 27th Februury, and was furnished to all broadeasting stations, postal radio stations, port authorities and storm warning stations. Subsequent advices were issued at 4 p.m., 0.30 p.m., 7 a.m. and 10 a.m. daily until the storm passed. Ample warning was given, accordingly, of the approach of the cyclone. The warnings referred particularly to the coastal areas south of Ttockhanipton as being the part likely to be most severely affected. 2. It is not possible in storms of this nature upon noticeto state which particular locality within the broader area being affected will experience the most severe conditions. All localities and interests should take whatever steps are practicable for safety. 3. The use of some technical terms is usually desirable for the benefit of those w-ho understand them, but all warnings are normally phrased to give a clear statement. Instructions will be issued to ensure that the wording of the warnings will always be in the simplest possible terms to be readily understood by all hearers and users. 4. An examination of the comments contained in the leading article in the Rockhan\pton newspaper on the 8th March, 1949, has shown that the criticism of the services supplied was not well founded on major points of service. The warnings issued from the Brisbane Meteorological Bureau commenced three days before the cyclone reached the coast and were issued approximately every six hours until the storm passed. Each warning gave the latest position of the cyclone, also Its dircct'on a<< accurately as it is possible to so do. The warnings were thus made well in advance and were comprehensive, frequent and thorough. They were announced by all broadcasting stations us soon as possible after receipt. They were also transmitted to coastal radio stations, shipping interests, and to all major coastal points likely to be affected. The broadcasting stations gave very good coverage of the cyclone, especially on the day prior to that on which the storm centre reached the coast. The examination indicates, however, that improvement? in certain details could be effected. One such direction is to arrange for separate advices to shipping and land stations. Arrangements are being made for the advices to land stations to omit references to latitude, longitude and millibars and to omit also technical terms as far a«. practicab'e. With reference to the departure of an aircraft for Brisbane at 0 a.m. on the 2nd March, the consideration by the responsible forecasting officer that the"" cyclone had not approached nearer the coast since the previous evening led him to anticipate considerably less severe winds than were actually experienced immediately to the south of Rockhampton: conditions at the destination were not extremely difficult. The necessary action is being taken to obviate a repetition of the weakness in this particular aviation forecast. The red pennant, although not complete in itself, is regarded as a useful additional m.caii!' of warning, and its continuance is considered advisable. In regard to the availability of a baragraph at Rockhampton, such an instrument is on view at the harbourmaster's office. It is considered, in regard to the major points raised, that the warnings to the areas concerned were timely and accurate, and that the methods of distribution were very comprehensive. W ill he consider the appointment by thi Parliament of a special standing committee to consider the recommendations contained in the annual report of the Auditor-General with particular reference to (a) the re-establishment of the Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts; (6) the review of the Audit Act to provide access to all revenue accounts, including income tax papers; (c) aircraft manufacturing contracts; (d) disposal of property purchased from United States forces in Australia, and such other matters designated by the Auditor-General as warranting further investigation by a committee of this Parliament. tioned by the honourable member and other matters on w h i c h the A u d it o r General has commented in his r e p o rt have received or are r e c e i v in g in d i v i d u a l a t t e n t i o n by the Government.

On what specific information did he base noticehis statement that the majority of foreign syndicate strips appearing in the Australian press are re-drawn here? 2. In view of the statement of the authors and artists' section of the Australian Journalists Association, that original imported foreign strips are sold and used in Australia, what action does he intend to take to ensure that employment of Australian artists and ex-servicemen who are being trained as black and white artists under the post-war reconstruction training scheme, is not jeopardized t and Customs has supplied the f o l l o w in g information:l . Evidence obtained during an inquiry conducted by the Department of Trade and Customs in 1943 to ascertain how newspapers were able to continue to publish overseas comic strips in view of the embargo on importation, disclosed that in many cases Australian artists re-draw these strips for publication in local newspapers. More recent inquiries have disclosed that the practice is still in operation. Similar evidence was also given at the Tariff Board inquiry into the publishing, industry in 1940. 2. This is now a matter for the Publishing Industry Committee which has been established by the Government with the view of ascertaining hnw best Australian authors and Artists can be assisted. o Minister, upon notice1.

W ill it make any amount received available for the benefit of Australian soldiers who helped to build it , and to the dependants of those who lost their lives in building the railway? honourable follows:No assessment has yet been made of Japan's total reparations liability nor of. the proportions of the Japanese reparations pool to be allocated to recipient countries. However, the claims of Australian soldiers who helped to build the Burma-Siam railway and of the dependants of those who lost their lives in building it , w ill be borne in mind when the question of reparations from Japan is discussed at the Japanese Peace Conference. senting the Minister for Health, upon 1. In view of the recent deaths of several Australian citizens from smallpox contracted during a voyage from Australia to England, what action is being taken to prevent the introduction of smallpox into Australia by passengers on shipboard and passengers arriving by aircraft? 2. What immediate measures could be taken to vaccinate the population of Australia in the event of an outbreak of the disease in this country ? 3. Is production of a certificate of vaccination required before a passport is issued in Australia to an Australian going abroad; if not, why not? He a l t h has supplied the f o l l o w in g in for m a t i o n :LA l l passengers are examined by doctors of the Quarantine Service on arrival and are required to give the address to which they are proceeding. All passengers by air are required to have been vaccinated within three years and more than twelve days. 2. There is sufficient lymph available to cope with the greatest possible emergency. The recent amendments to the Quarantine Act give the Government power to proclaim any area in which an outbreak occurs and to take such action as is necessary to control and eradicate the epidemic and this would include compulsory vaccination and isolation. 3. No certificate of vaccination is required by an Australian going abroad before a passport is issued. The accepted international arrangement is that each nation makes laws for people entering itsterritory. The only remaining reason therefore why Australians going abroad should be compulsorily vaccinated would be to protect the travellers themselves. Many Australians, however, go to places where there is no smallpox and therefore compulsory vaccination would not bo justified. In addition, a number has conscientious objections to vaccination under any circumstances. member's questions is as the honourable member for Bourke( Mrs. Blackburn) asked how much petrol rationing has cost the Commonwealth.",63,Tractors

Australian representative. honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr they are unable to compete with tools being Bernard Corser) asked a question regarding the issue of a passport in favour of MrH . C. Williams, a member of the World Federation of Democratic Youth. Further to my interim reply on that date, I now wish to state that I have had Technical Staff Officer) ; inquiries made in this matter. Mr Williams applied for passport facilities in June, 1945, to enable him to attend a World Youth Conference in London. As he complied with all requirements the facilities were granted and his passport facilities were extended in August, 1946, when he again proceeded abroad. Other persons connected with the organization have been granted passport facilities at different times, but in each case the person concerned has complied with all the requirements prerequisite to the issue of a passport. The reference that the organization is "" known widely as a Liaison Office 'Communist F r o n t ' "" would not affect the issue of passports in favour of its members, as the political views of an applicant for a passport are not regarded as a disqualifying factor in the issue of such a document. the honourable member for Martin( Mr Daly) asked the following questions:1. Isi t a fact that licences have recently been granted for the importation of certain types of spanners and other tools from GermanyV 2. Isi t also a fact that those goods are being marketed in Australia at prices considerably lower than the prices of similar goods manufactured in Australia? 3. If so, will the Minister consider giving further tariff protection to Australian manufacturers in order to protect our home products? The Minister for Trade and Customs has now supplied the following information :1. Yes. 2. The prices at which spanners, wrenchec J. M. . Senior and other tools are being offered from Germany will, it would appear, enable importers to have a competitive advantage over local products. 3. In this connection it is the policy of the Government to rely on the advice of the Tariff Board in the imposition of rates of duty considered nccessaiw to protect Australian industries. If Australian tool manufacturer 1 provide Senator Courtice with evidence that imported from overseas he will, he said, have the matter inquired into by the Tariff Board. It is not the policy of the Government to invoke the Customs (Import Licensing) Regulations for the protection of Australianindustry.",65,Australia House

In the case of country addressees, written authorization, usually to the postal supervisor, is accepted and the letter is opened by the authorized agent. No separate record of the number or contents of envelopes so opened is kept and in no case is correspondence examined. 2. See answer to No. 1. 3.
