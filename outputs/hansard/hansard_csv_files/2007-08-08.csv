Because of the division of responsibilities, they say that in some cases Disability SA, a staterun organisation, have responsibility for things, and their website says, ‘We deliver (a), (b) and (c),’ but when the families come to seek that support they find that that support is not actually available because the agency has not been funded adequately by the South Australian government. So, in some of these interventions by the federal government, we are saying that we are taking a whole slab of responsibility away from the state government-in this case, for senior carers. We are going to be providing that care plan and the funding for that, which means that the state governments can spend a higher proportion of the funding they do have on each of the people who still remain under the area that they have agreed is going to be their responsibility. Certainly, as I sit and listen to the families who talk to me about the caring responsibilities they have and the impact those have on the other children in their family, I welcome the measures by the federal minister, but I also call on states and territories to step up to the mark, take this opportunity, cease the blame game, come on board, talk with us, get this agreement in place and provide the services that these families so desperately need. Question agreed to. House adjourned at 7.59 pm The following notice was given: Mr Lindsay to move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Hardened and Networked Wednesday, 8 August 2007 ----Iran: Human Rights rights abuse in Iran. The abduction and brutal beating, again, of Tehran’s Sherkate Vahed bus drivers union leader, Mansour Osanloo, on the evening of 10 July this year is yet another chapter in the growing catalogue of human rights abuses in that country. While there is some disagreement over the extent to which workers’ rights should drive the policy of the government of the day in our country, it goes without saying that all of us in this place support freedom of association-I am sure even members of the government support the right to join trade unions-and, above all, freedom from all forms of persecution. Article 23, section 4, of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides: Everyone has the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests. Article2 provides that these rights are universal and exist regardless of nationality or jurisdiction. Iran’s membership of the International Labour Organisation also binds it to respect the rights of workers to organise, free from fear of prosecution. That the most recent attack on the most basic rights of Mansour Osanloo was carried out following surveillance of him by individuals understood to be members of Iran’s security forces is particularly concerning, of similar concern is that there appears to be no certainty as to whether his abduction was the work of security forces. There was a complete lack of transparency and even procedural fairness in failing to inform him, his family, his friends or colleagues of his fate. In November last year it is believed that the state-sponsored militia, the Basij-the SR of the Tehran regime-stifled political dissent again in that country and were responsible for Osanloo’s earlier abduction and imprisonment. The most recent incident bears the hallmarks of the same kind of underhanded attack-a completely illegal attack, against the declaration of human rights, the rights of freedom of association and Iran’s membership of the ILO. This case of human rights abuse is par for the course with the Iranian regime under its President Ahmadinejad. Thursday, 9 August marks the anniversary of Mansour Osanloo’s release from prison following several months behind bars after his members refused to collect passengers’ fares as a result of price rises in Iran. ACTU officials and members of affiliated unions will undertake a national day of action tomorrow, with protests outside the Embassy of Iran. Union officials will also seek an audience with the Iranian ambassador to lodge a written protest against Mr Osanloo’s unjust and baseless imprisonment, and I wish them every success in working towards securing his release and freedom from further prosecution. This is not just a case of one trade union leader; this man is the leader of the democratic opposition to a very fearful regime in Iran.

188,Mr Baldwin (Paterson,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourismnity. Crime, whether it is a break and enter, motor vehicle theft, vandalism, violence or hoodlums creating a disturbance, affects everyone, not just the victims. People demand and deserve the right to feel safe in our streets and in their homes. There can be no doubt that nothing reduces the incidence of crime, particularly petty crime, more than an increased police presence and a rapid response to an incident. In my communities, the lack of support and assistance from the New South Wales Labor government in providing adequate police resources is a cause of concern. Last week, hundreds of concerned and angry residents turned out to public crime forums organised by the community in the Forster-Tuncurry and Tilligerry Peninsula areas. I attended, along with the federal Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator David Johnston. Every one of those residents was concerned and stressed about the need for greater police presence in the area to help reduce crime. In the Tilligerry, a person complained of having reported his motorbike stolen and claimed that police had not turned up to investigate for some three days. In the Tilligerry Peninsula and Forster-Tuncurry areas, locals have been desperately calling for an increase in police numbers and 24-hour-manned stations for almost a decade. Criminals have learnt of the times when police stations are not manned and they are using that to their advantage. Police resources are stretched to breaking point. In response, the New South Wales Labor government has promised 700 more police over the next four years, yet there are more than 500 police leaving the police force each year. In four years time there will be around 1,300 fewer police than there are today. Identifying the problem is easy; finding solutions is a little harder. Whilst it is the New South Wales Labor government’s responsibility to fund and provide the police force, the federal government has stepped in to offer support to the maximum of their constitutional powers. Through the federally funded National Crime Prevention Program, we are offering to pay for crime prevention programs, but they can only do so much. I am pleased to announce that, through the Port Stephens Council, a crime prevention task force will be established in the Tilligerry Peninsula to help address escalating crime in that area. The federal government will commit up to $150,000, which will help fund a full-time crime strategist for two years. In discussions with the Mayor of Great Lakes, John Chadban, a $150,000 funding package has been offered to help their crime prevention task force develop and implement strategies that will help. On top of this, the councils were advised they could also apply for up to $500,000 for crime prevention solutions. For example, this year I fought for and secured $95,000 for funding for closed circuit television cameras for Nelson Bay CBD to help reduce crime in that area. I make the point: there is no point in having these cameras if we do not have the police numbers to monitor and use them. Nothing will reduce crime more than an increased police presence.

It was great to see him there in good health and I am very sad that he lost his battle and his life on the weekend. He saw four years overseas military service in the First Australian Landing Craft Squadron in Rabaul in New Guinea, in Jacono in New Britain and he also served in Borneo. His father was one of the early presidents of the Fairfield RSL Club and the Fred Galton Hall is named after his father. In fact, the street I live in, Galton Street, is named after his family. Bill will be deeply missed in Fairfield. It is the end of an era to see Bill pass away. Until very recently, Bill could be seen walking around the streets of Fairfield and he would always stop and have a word to anybody he knew, which was a lot of people. I recall seeing him several times in the last few months doing his shopping in Fairfield and stopping to talk to him. IfI had realised that last time. I got to talk to him would be in fact the last time, I would have taken the opportunity to tell him just how much I valued his friendship and just how much the community valued not only his military service but his service to the community through the RSL club. His funeral will be on Friday. I take this opportunity in the parliament to extend my personal condolences to his daughters, Kate and Diane, and his son, Bill Jr. They will miss him, but the entire Fairfield community will miss him. He was an institution in the Fairfield RSL club. He was the patron of the club and was deeply respected by every member of the club because of his humanity, because of his decency and because of the time that he would take to talk to anybody who came his way. He will be sadly missed and I extend my condolences to his family. Bonner Electorate House of Representatives and what an incredible journey it has been. Representing the people of Bonner is a great honour and I am pleased to report that over this time. I have been able to work with the community to deliver results and real outcomes for the electorate. The bayside of Brisbane is a key community in Bonner and I am committed to the revitalisation of Wynnum. In 2005 I fought hard to deliver a local Medicare office to the area; a service that was desperately needed not only by the people but by the local economy. Since opening its doors in September 2005, the Medicare office has been a welcome achievement and has played an integral role in helping to stimulate what was a struggling local economy. In cooperation with the community I have also been able to open an Australian Hearing office in Wynnum, which has proved to be a great asset to the local senior and veteran community. Late last year I also announced over $400,000 in black spot road funding for the bayside and $1.2 million towards the costs of a planning study for the future extension of the Port of Brisbane Motorway. In the southside community of BonnerI have worked closely with local schools and their P&C associations to deliver practical outcomes through the Investing in Our Schools Program. Eighteen southside state schools have now received funding for projects specifically designed by the schools to address the needs of students and staff. Throughout the whole of Bonner over $3 million has been provided to 33 schools in the past year alone, and I plan on working to increase this number over the coming months.

This is an invaluable new service to the southside community. This centre will play a key role in supporting local families and single parents. These are but a few examples of what has been achieved over the past 2½ years. While the Bonner community can be proud of the progress that has been made, there is never time to rest and always more to be done. I am committed to improving our local roads and infrastructure, to addressing the needs of our environment and to combating local crime. With the support of the community I plan to deliver funding for the upgrade of the Port of Brisbane Motorway, just as I plan to ensure that all clubhouses and scout halls in Bonner are given the means to install CCTV and combat crime in their local area. I am committed to Bonner. As the 2007 federal election draws closer, I am determined to work even harder to ensure that on a national level this country retains the best government it has ever had so that at a local level even more positive outcomes can be delivered to the community. Dental Health sue to all of us in Australia-that is, dental care, the arrangements that are currently in place and the changes that should take place. Given the air within the federal government at the moment of moving into areas that they traditionally blamed others for, I urge the Commonwealth to look very closely at this issue. It is an issue that they need to have a much closer look at not only in terms of the Medicare arrangements for dental care but also in terms of some of the training arrangements. I know there is some movement in terms of training, but there is a bottleneck with the delivery of dental care-there are some 600,000 Australians on the waiting list now. There is a need for a degree of federal intervention in relation to this. There was a program some years ago with which the Commonwealth government did assist. For the life of me I cannot understand why dental health is considered to be different to the rest of our bodily health when it comes to Medicare arrangements. A constituent of mine from the little town of Bendemeer, Mrs Ruth Mathews, has been working on a petition to the parliament. I think some 3,000 petitions have been presented, urging the federal government to make some moves in the dental care area. The 3,000 people who have signed the petitionand I am sure many other Australians would too if we asked them-are prepared to pay more in their Medicare levy for dental care to be included. This issue has been raised on a number of occasions by a number of members, and it is an issue that we should be addressing when we have surplus budgets. I congratulate the government on its economic activity in terms of surplus budgets. But, rather than giving $2, a milkshake or half a sandwich back to people in terms of tax cuts, we should address this issue. If there is surplus money, we should transfer some of that money into Medicare so that people with dental problems can avail themselves of the same provisions that they can if they have a problem with their foot, their hand or their heart. There is a very real need for this issue to be part of the election platform of all the major parties. Hopefully, it will be one that the Prime Minister, given his recent attitude, will mention.

192,Mr Keenan (Stirling) (9.45 Am),"I rise to talk about an issue that I have discussed ining the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads, the Hon. Jim Lloyd, in my office to meet with members of the Balga Action Group. The Balga Action Group have been campaigning for nine years for an overpass to be built at the very dangerous intersection of Reid Highway in Mirrabooka Avenue. The minister told the action group that in his 2½ years as minister he has never, ever come across a situation where a state government has torn up a cheque for $10 million. The Commonwealth had offered $10 million for this overpass to be built, and astonishingly the state Labor government minister tore up that cheque. Just to remind the House, this road is 100 per cent the responsibility of the state government. Yet extraordinarily, when the Commonwealth comes and offers them $10 million to build infrastructure on one of their roads, they fail to match the funding and accept this offer. That money has now been reallocated in other parts of Australia, and 13 other local councils will be spending that money. I think my community is pretty outraged by that. The local community, through a recent red spot survey which was run by a local community newspaper group, the RAC and Channel7 put the Reid Highway and Mirrabooka Avenue intersection as the 16th worse in Western Australia. The intersection that the state government continues to say is the worse, based on figures that they refuse to make public, the Reid Highway/Alexandra Drive intersection, was not one that was rated by the community at all. The intersection at Reid Highway and Mirrabooka Avenue is only going to get busier as that area develops further. I do not want to have another family suffer a devastating tragedy in order to get the state government to listen. It is time now for action and I will not stop lobbying my colleagues to put that money back on the table. Extraordinarily, in the Stirling Times, one of my local community newspapers, the WA transport and infrastructure minister, Alannah MacTiernan, said something along the lines of, ‘Well, we don’t do anything until there is a federal Labor government.’ She is essentially threatening my constituents-unless they vote Labor, the state government is not going to put any infrastructure into my electorate. That is what this state government has come to. They are extraordinarily precious, they are extraordinarily arrogant and they are extraordinarily out of touch. It is disgraceful that they hold my electorate to ransom, but I give a commitment to my electorate that I will continue to be lobbying for this overpass to be built, and I call on the state government to put politics aside and join me in building this much needed local infrastructure. Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme Ms GEORGE (Throsby) (9.48 am)-In January this year I received correspondence from my constituent Michael Boscoscuro seeking my assistance in having the drug Tysabri listed on the PBS. Michael’s letter set out the circumstances of his eventual diagnosis with multiple sclerosis at 18 years of age. Michael was a talented student and a competent sportsman who was expected to achieve dux of his school before he was struck down with MS. Despite ongoing and severe treatment, he battled on courageously and commenced his Bachelor of Commerce degree at the University of Wollongong in 2006. Due to the aggressive nature of his condition and the limited ability of interferons to stabilise the MS, it was decided that he should start a course of mitoxantrone. His is rapidly approaching the maximum permissible dose of this drug. MAIN COMMITTEE In his letter to me, Michael pointed out that Tysabri had been shown in trials to markedly slow the progress of the relapsing remitting form of MS which he suffers. In his words, Michael said this: ‘Tysabri may not be a cure, but it appears to be by far the best treatment available at this time. But unless it is placed on the PBS, its prohibitive cost-that is, around $36,000-would financially cripple most MS sufferers and their families.’ In response to my representations, the government advised that the PBAC had rejected an initial application for listing at its meeting in November 2006. From my discussions with the manufacturer, I understand that a new application was in fact submitted to the PBAC on 4 July. I appeal to the minister to ensure that the consideration of the new application from the manufacturer, Biogen Idec, is expedited. MS, as we know, is a devastating disease, often hitting people-as it did Michael-in the most productive period of their lives. I understand that there are currently around 18,000 MS sufferers in Australia. Many of these sufferers see the listing of Tysabri on the PBS as light at the end of the tunnel. Clinical trials have shown a remarkable 68 per cent reduction in clinical relapses, and yet its prohibitive cost puts Tysabri beyond the reach of most MS sufferers. I urge the government to act expeditiously and with compassion. Herbert Electorate: Crime Herbert Electorate: Roads am)-I am right behind my local community in their concerns about local crime. I saw something in the media earlier this week which I think my community would think a great idea. They are always writing to me and always talking to me about hooning in Townsville. It is a problem all over the Commonwealth, and certainly in my city it is a problem: what to do about these irresponsible drivers. The suggestion was that the police be given the power to impound their car, take it to Sims Metal and turn it into a cube. The New South Wales Police Commissioner went one step further and said that the cube should then be taken and put on the front lawn of the house of that particular hoon. I think it is a very popular suggestion. It is a pretty tough penalty, but the community have to make up their minds. Do they want to do something that is effective about hooning, or do they not? I reckon they want it to be addressed. I am certainly going to look at that in the coming weeks, and I am going to ask my community how they feel about that, but I think we are going to get a bit of support for that. I am also behind my community in relation to their concerns about roads. I want to report to the parliament a number of things that have happened. The Townsville ring road is now well under construction. It will connect the Douglas arterial through to the Bruce Highway and have a motorway standard as a bypass for the city of Townsville. It will take a whole lot of heavy trucks out of the suburbs. That is going to be a great boon when it is open. I am also about to officially attend the start of the Woodlands Shopping Centre to Veales Road fourlaning of the Bruce Highway. The people along Mount Low Parkway will be very happy to see that happen. In the future, I want something done about the non-walkway between Nelly Bay and Geoffrey Bay on Magnetic Island. It is the most dangerous piece of road, with no footpath, no satisfactory way that our pedestrians can get across between the bays, and it is the most popular MAIN COMMITTEE",165,Statements By Members
193,Mr Lindsay (Herbert,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence) (9.50walk on the bay. We must do something about it, and I am going to do something about it. On the port access road which now needs to be built, I have given a commitment to my community that I will build that road and I will build it sooner rather than later. I am hoping that in the life of the next government we will see a start on the port access road. I would also like to report to the parliament that I have had meetings with both of Australia’s roads ministers, Jim Lloyd and Mark Vaile, with a North Queensland focus. I thank them for their attention, and I thank them for the support that they are giving me. I hope to make some great announcements in the not too distant future. Dental Health Ms GRIERSON (Newcastle) (9.53 am)-I rise today to share with the House the problems that people in Newcastle and all around Australia are facing in accessing vital dental healthcare services. Research released just last week by the Australia Fair group found that 46 per cent of people reported that it would be difficult for them to pay the $300 needed for basic preventative dental treatment. The same number of people said that the cost of dental care influences their decision to see a dentist regularly. Twenty-three per cent of people said they have not seen a dentist for over two years. We know that there are about 50,000 hospital admissions for preventable dental conditions each year and that there are 650,000 people on public dental waiting lists. To take just one example from my electorate last year, one of my constituents contacted our office seeking assistance. He had been having significant problems with his teeth and needed dentures. After failing to be able to access any public services, being told that it would take 18 months, he finally went to a private dentist and paid the $4,300 fee with his credit card. He is on a pension and is, as you can imagine, barely keeping on top of the interest charge, which may even increase after today. How did it come to this? We have pensioners putting dental treatment on their credit cards. One of the most infamous decisions of the Howard government when it came to power 11 years ago was to abolish the $100 million a year Commonwealth dental program. That is just over $1 billion the Howard government has not spent on dental health care in the last 11 years. That is a lot of money, so what would it have bought? What does it actually buy? Well, if you are the Howard government hell-bent on spending its way back into power, it has bought a lot of advertising. In fact, it is uncanny when you look at the numbers-this government has actually spent $2 billion on advertising in that 11 years. That is two Commonwealth dental programs worth of advertising that we have seen the money spent on, while 650,000 people wait for treatment. People all over this nation are asking the government to do something about dental health. People have been asking why the Howard government has abandoned working families and the Howard government’s response, currently, is to blame the states. It is the same old tired buck-passing and the same old blame game. The Minister for Health and Ageing says, ‘People should direct their concerns to the state governments. They need to take responsibility and I think that public dental care is appropriately in that domain.’ People do not care about that response. The survey found that 75 per cent of Australians think the Commonwealth should at least share the funding for dental care. As the Prime Minister himself said recently: ... Australians are interested in good outcomes, they’re not interested in theories of governance. MAIN COMMITTEE Here is a good outcome: Kevin Rudd and federal Labor will establish a Commonwealth dental program to make dental care accessible to working families again. Kevin Rudd and federal Labor will end the Howard government’s blame game and actually do what the Commonwealth can and should be doing to address this important issue. Cook Electorate: Cronulla Surf Life Saving Club the Cronulla Surf Life Saving Club on achieving 100 years since its establishment. Last Friday there was a special ball held at the Westin Hotel to celebrate the event and then we had the annual general meeting last Sunday on Cronulla Beach, which was attended by some 400 people. This, in the Year of the Surf Lifesaver, is a very significant event and of course it was part of the group of foundation clubs involved in establishing the surf-lifesaving movement. How do you judge a surf club as to how it sits in the Australian scene, as Australian surf clubs are iconic in themselves? Cronulla surf club is probably the most outstanding club in Australia’s history. How do we judge it? Firstly, in terms of the number of lives lost. During the past 100 years, members of the club have performed over 9,000 rescues with no lives lost-a remarkable achievement. Secondly, Cronulla Surf Life Saving Club has been one of the most successful clubs in the history of surf life saving championships, including being the only club to win three consecutive world, Australian, state and branch championships point scores. Finally, you judge a club according to the quality of its members. It is a club that has a strong bond between the members. They are some of the most outstanding men and women, certainly in my electorate and, I think, within the country. I congratulate Kevin Neilsen, the president, who is an outstanding surf champion himself, the deputy president, Greg Holland, John Holt, an Australian who is part of the Australian Surf Life Saving Hall of Fame, and further winners of Australian surf life saving championships, Ian Goode, Daniel McLellan and his sister Kate, Peter Tibbitts, Nick Dixon and Warren Buchan. Peter Tibbitts was involved in the boat crews. Of course, there is also the new generation. Nathan, Tiane and Krystal Smith come from the one family. Nathan and Krystal won successive titles for five years in the New South Wales ironman and ironwoman of the year competition. They are an incredible family. Chris Allum, this year’s winner, who is also a fine young man, took part in the youth leadership forum here in the parliament this year and gave a speech of which we would all be proud. It is a wonderful club, superb people are involved in the club, their achievements are magnificent and I congratulate them, in this the Year of the Lifesaver, on reaching their 100-year anniversary. 193, the time for members’ statements has concluded. Second Reading Debate resumed from 20 June, on motion by Mr Billson for Mr Abbott: That this bill be now read a second time. Ms ROXON (Gellibrand) (10.00 am)-The purpose of the National Health Amendment (National HPV Vaccination Program Register) Bill 2007 is to amend the National Health Act MAIN COMMITTEE",167,Statements By Members
194,Mr Baird (Cook) (9.56 Am),I wish to join Senator Michael Forshaw in congratulating,169,National Health Amendment National Hpv Vaccination Program Register Bill 2007
195,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Ir Causley),"Order! In accordance with standing orderto ensure and to establish that the National Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination Program Register can operate. As many in this House would know, Labor was instrumental in pushing the government to include Gardasil, the first vaccine available to treat some strains of HPV, on the National Immunisation Program. Of course we will support these measures to establish the register as they will enhance the efficiency of the National HPV Vaccination Program. By way of background, HPV is a sexually transmitted infection mostly affecting women between 20 and 24 years of age. Almost all abnormal pap smear results are caused by HPV. In 98 per cent of cases HPV clears by itself; in rare cases, if the virus persists and is left undetected, it can lead to cervical cancer. We know that, sadly, cervical cancer does kill around 200 women in Australia each year. Gardasil was developed by former Australian of the Year Professor Ian Frazer, and is the first vaccine available that protects against some of the cancer causing strains of HPV, notably HPV strains 16 and 18, which cause around 70 per cent of all cervical cancers. Members would recall that late last year CSL Ltd, the Australian manufacturer and distributor of Gardasil, applied to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee for Gardasil to be listed on the National Immunisation Program. As the vaccine was originally on the market at a cost of $460 for a course of three shots, CSL was seeking to have this cost met by the government, rather than borne by Australian families. PBAC knocked back the application of CSL in November 2006 citing a number of reasons including that it was not cost effective for taxpayers to fund Gardasil at the price originally proposed by the manufacturer, but PBAC also at that time raised some other concerns about a lack of information on how long the vaccine remained effective. It was also reported that PBAC was not convinced by CSL’s claims about the protection that the vaccine would provide over a lifetime. I am proud to say that Labor, including my colleague the former shadow minister for health Julia Gillard, led the outcry from health stakeholders, patient groups and pharmaceutical companies that PBAC’s decision required urgent review. Comments by the Prime Minister about driving a hard bargain with manufacturing companies gave credence to the then shadow minister’s concern that PBAC, in making its original decision, had been overly influenced by the government’s focus on cutting the cost of its subsidised medicines program. It is all well and good for the minister to say that he respected PBAC’s integrity and process and therefore would not overrule the decision, but this response ignored the absolute need for the Australian government to do everything that it could, within our health system, to reduce the incidence of cervical cancer. Eventually, but only after prime ministerial intervention, the minister saw the sense and requested that PBAC reconsider or consider a new application from CSL in which the main initial concerns raised by PBAC were addressed. As we now know, Gardasil was subsequently approved for inclusion in the NIP at the extraordinary PBAC meeting in late November. On 29 November 2006, the government announced that it would fund free the HPV vaccine for females between 12 and 26. The establishment of the HPV register was also announced at that time. Obviously, despite the ups and downs of that process, we do welcome this result, and the availability of this vaccine is going to provide very welcome protection for many Australian women. MAIN COMMITTEE Let me turn now to the legislation before us, which inserts a new section 9BA into the National Health Act providing for the establishment of a National HPV Vaccination Program Register. Broadly speaking, the establishment of the register will assist in the administration of the vaccination program itself, provide a means to monitor participants in the program and assist in monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of the HPV vaccine in preventing certain cervical cancers. According to the new subsection 9BA(3), the purposes of the register are to ensure the successful implementation of the program and, in doing so, facilitate the establishment and maintenance of an electronic database of records for monitoring vaccination of participants in the program. It is intended that the register will collect information about the vaccination program, including personal identifying details, details about the doses given and the immunisation provider. Labor acknowledges that there will be some people in the community who will have privacy concerns around the collection of such data. On this issue I note that the bill provides for women or the parents of girls to have information removed from the register following a request in writing-an ‘opt off’ register reflecting the arrangements that have been in place in Australian state and territory based Pap test registers for between eight and 18 years, depending on which state or territory you live in. No information about sexual history will be sought or recorded, and the bill precludes the release of personal information except to a vaccination provider or prescribed bodies, either through regulation or as prescribed in the Health Insurance Act. Labor is satisfied on this basis that the bill adequately addresses privacy concerns. Of course, the public interest in the maintenance of this register certainly is a significant factor in the balancing that is always required in these matters. The register will help to monitor the effectiveness of the program in preventing certain cervical cancers by allowing for future cross-referencing of data against Pap smear and other cervical cancer registers maintained by states and territories. The register will also allow for the maintenance of records tracking the HPV vaccination status of eligible persons for the purposes of certifying the completion of the course of vaccination and establishing mechanisms to advise eligible persons, or the parents or guardians of children, if doses of HPV vaccine have been missed or if booster doses are required in the future. The register will allow for the provision of information on new developments associated with the program to vaccination providers, eligible persons, and parents or guardians of children, promoting general health and well-being. Finally, the legislation provides for payments to general practitioners who enter information on the register. According to the explanatory memorandum, there is no financial impact arising from this bill. Funding for the register was approved by the Prime Minister on 20 February 2007 as part of an additional $103.5 million over five years allocated for the implementation of this program. A total cost of $8 million to $11 million has been allocated to build and operate the register over three years. As I said earlier, Labor supports this bill and the program that is now in place. Of course, we support measures that are aimed at the promotion of the health and well-being of Australians. As I said earlier, Labor is proud of the strong support it gave early to Gardasil in its ability to treat HPV and argued for it to be put on the National Immunisation Program, so we are keen for its implementation to be as efficient as possible and for its evaluation to be as thorough as possible. MAIN COMMITTEE We would encourage the government to move this legislation through parliament quickly, as I believe is intended. While we understand that the short time frame from the November 2006 announcement to the commencement of the vaccination program in April this year meant that it was difficult to establish the register before immunisations commenced, we believe the register needs to be operational as soon as possible. We understand that state based immunisation programs and individual GPs are currently capturing vaccination data at a jurisdictional or surgery level while they wait for the register to be implemented. Obviously there are some risks around data being mislaid or not making its way onto the register. A uniform national approach to capturing this data is preferable and obviously much needed, particularly given the privacy issues that have been flagged. Even more significantly, until this register is operational, the impact of the program on cervical cancer prevention cannot be effectively assessed. With the funding already allocated, the government should move swiftly to set up this register. Labor would also appreciate some clarification from the government on some eligibility rules around the National HPV Vaccination Program. As members would be well aware, this program has been very widely advertised in media across the country. Those advertisements have heavily promoted the government’s intention to fund free HPV vaccine to all 12to 26year-olds. Public information has stated that the HPV National Immunisation Program would be targeted on an ongoing basis for 12and 13-year-old girls, to be delivered through schools, in addition to a two-year catch-up program for 13to 18-year-old girls, also delivered in schools, with vaccines to the 18to 26-year-old age group to be delivered through general practice and community based programs. While it has been widely noted that not all schools will be vaccinated in this first yearrather, there will be a systematic rollout-no similar qualification has been placed on the community based vaccination of women between 18 and 26. As local members, we are concerned that we are increasingly receiving reports from constituents who have examples of women attending community clinics and their GPs being told that only women in certain age brackets are being immunised in this particular year. We are still trying to get to the bottom of these reports. Obviously there may be people who are not within the specifications, but it seems that at this stage a number are. We are not sure whether this is an issue of the shortage of the requisite volume of vaccine or a practical problem of GPs finding the time and resources in their busy schedules to have these consultations within the correct time frames for young women seeking immunisations. Because there are a range of different ways these vaccines can be provided, we do not know whether it is a problem with the rules the government has set or whether it is a distributional or access problem, particularly with regard to the differences that may exist within some of the community health sectors in different states and territories. When you consider that some medical services, such as university medical clinics, may have a large number of women on their books who fall within the 18to 26-year-old age group and that each of these women will need three shots prior to June 2009, when the cut-off for free vaccinations comes into effect, you would understand why some services might seek to streamline their immunisation programs. I know that some people from the department are here, and I would be appreciative of an answer and some clarification on that. Obviously some constituents are very concerned that, if they cannot access it now, by the time they are MAIN COMMITTEE able to access it they will fall outside the right age categories or the cut-off times. It would be helpful if the government could look into these issues with some urgency and provide us with that information so we can assure or explain to constituents the process to make sure that they get the coverage they are entitled to. As I have said, given that the vaccination process involves three injections over seven months at a total cost of over $400, if it is not accessed through the HPV Vaccination Program it is a serious cost issue for many families. It is an affordability issue where some families will be forced to make a decision between concern for the health of their daughters and other financial pressures that they have. Obviously the government’s decision has been made. This is a program that is available, and we need to make sure that the rollout is accessible to as many people as possible. After such an extensive advertising campaign has been run we do not want to unnecessarily worry young women, particularly, who want some assurance of knowing that they have been immunised against HPV and who do not want to feel that they have missed out because their local service might not have been able to access the program at the right time. For the benefit of the staff who are here, I can tell you that these reports have come from many different states. They have come from Queensland, Victoria, South Australia-they are the ones that I can remember off the top of my head-but we have had queries from many constituents. My colleague who is speaking next will know whether this has been an issue in Western Australia. It would be helpful if some proper information could be provided so that we can assist our constituents in making sure that they get the coverage they deserve. As I have said, Labor supports this bill. Dr WASHER (Moore) (10.13 am)-The purpose of the National Health Amendment (National HPV Vaccination Program Register) Bill 2007 is to amend the National Health Act 1953 in order to establish and maintain a National Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination Program Register. It also allows for payments to be made to general practitioners for the provision of vaccination information on the register. Vaccines have had a dramatic effect on the incidence of disease in our populations. According to the World Health Organisation, vaccines are thought to prevent around two million deaths every year. The discovery of vaccines is quite an interesting story, although not always an ethical one. Long before the causes of disease were known and long before the processes of recovery were understood, an interesting thing was observed. If people recovered from a disease, rather than succumbed to it, they appeared to be immune from a second bout of the same illness. It was these types of observations that led the Chinese to try to prevent deadly smallpox by exposing uninfected individuals to material from smallpox lesions. This process, known as variolation, took a variety of forms, from injecting the pus and fluid of lesions under the skin to grinding up dried scabs and inhaling or injecting the ground-up powder. Lady Montagu, wife of the British ambassador, observed this method in the early 1700s and brought it back to England. Although the effects of variolation varied, ranging from causing a mild illness in most individuals to causing death in a few, the mortality and morbidity rates due to smallpox were certainly lower in the populations that used variolation compared with those that did not. One person who experienced variolation as a child in the late 1700s was Edward Jenner, a young boy who survived the process and grew up to become a country doctor in England. As MAIN COMMITTEE a country doctor, Jenner noticed that many people who milked cows did not get smallpox, even though they were exposed repeatedly. With this in mind, in 1796 Jenner undertook a daring experiment and infected a young boy with the bovine disease, cowpox, in the hope of preventing subsequent smallpox infection. After allowing the boy to recover fully from cowpox, Jenner unethically infected the boy with smallpox by injecting pus from a smallpox lesion directly into his skin. As Jenner had predicted, the boy did not contract smallpox. Jenner’s experiment was initially rejected by those in the medical establishment. However, over the ensuing months, he went on to collect case studies and publish a book detailing his observations. As a result, within a few years thousands of people protected themselves from the deadly smallpox disease by intentionally infecting themselves with cowpox. Jenner’s process came to be called ‘vaccination’ after vacca, the Latin word for cow, and the substance used to vaccinate was called a ‘vaccine’. So how do vaccines work? Disease-causing organisms, such as viruses and bacteria, have at least two distinct effects on the body. The first effect is very obvious-we feel sick and exhibit a range of symptoms. The second effect is less obvious, although it generally leads to eventual recovery from infection-the disease-causing organism induces an immune response in our body. As the response increases in strength over time, the infectious agents are slowly reduced in number until symptoms disappear and recovery is complete. How does this immune response occur? The disease-causing organisms, such as viruses and bacteria, have proteins called ‘antigens’ which stimulate the immune response. The resulting immune response is multifold and includes a synthesis of proteins called ‘antibodies’. These proteins bind to the disease-causing organisms and lead to their eventual destruction. In addition, memory cells are produced in an immune response. These are cells that remain in the bloodstream, sometimes for life, ready to mount a quick, protected immune response against subsequent infections. If such an infection were to occur, the memory cells would respond so quickly that the resulting immune response can activate the organism, and symptoms would be prevented. This response is often so rapid that infection does not develop. Obviously a live or virulent organism cannot be used as a vaccine because it would induce the very disease it should prevent. Therefore, the first step in making a vaccine is to separate the two effects of disease-causing organisms. In practice, this means isolating or creating an organism, or part of one, that is unable to cause full-blown disease but that will still retain the antigens responsible for inducing the host’s immune response. This can be done in many ways. One way is to kill the organism using formalin. Vaccines produced this way are called ‘inactivated’ or ‘killed’ vaccines. Examples of killed vaccines in common use today are the typhoid vaccine and the Salk poliomyelitis vaccine. Another way to produce a vaccine is to use only the antigenic part of the disease-causing organism: for example, the capsule, the flagella or part of the protein cell wall. These types of vaccines are called ‘acellular’ vaccines. An example of an acellular vaccine is the Haemophilus influenza B or Hib vaccine. Acellular vaccines exhibit some similarities to killed vaccines. Neither killed nor acellular vaccines generally induce strong immune responses and may therefore require a booster every few years to ensure their continued effectiveness. A third way of making a vaccine is to attenuate or weaken a live micro-organism by ageing it or altering its growth conditions. Vaccines made in this way are often the most successful vaccines, probably because they multiply in the body, thereby causing a large immune reMAIN COMMITTEE sponse. Examples of attenuated vaccines are those that protect us against measles, mumps and rubella. Immunity is often lifelong and booster shots are not required. Some vaccines are made from toxins. In these cases, the toxin is often treated with aluminium or adsorbed onto aluminium salts to decrease its harmful effects. After such treatment the toxin is called a toxoid. Examples of toxoids are the diphtheria and tetanus vaccines. Vaccines made from toxoids often induce low-level immune responses and are, therefore, sometimes administered with an adjuvant-an agent which increases the immune response. For example, the diphtheria and tetanus vaccines are often combined with the pertussis vaccine and administered together. Toxoid vaccines often require a booster every 10 years. Another way of making a vaccine is to use an organism that is similar to the virulent organism but that does not cause serious disease, such as Jenner did. A more recent example of this type of vaccine is the BCG vaccine used to protect against mycobacterium tuberculosis. The BCG vaccine currently in use is an attenuated strain of mycobacterium bovis and requires boosters every three to four years. In addition, biotechnology and genetic engineering techniques have been used to produce subunit vaccines-vaccines which use only the parts of an organism which stimulate a strong immune response. To create a subunit vaccine, scientists isolate the gene or genes which code for appropriate subunits from the genome of the infectious agent. This genetic material is placed into bacteria or yeast host cells, which then produce large quantities of subunit molecules by transcribing and translating the inserted foreign DNA. These ‘foreign’ molecules can be isolated, purified and used as a vaccine. The hepatitis B vaccine and the human papilloma virus vaccine Gardasil are examples of this type of vaccine. Gardasil contains the major capsid protein of human papilloma virus types 6, 11, 16 and 18. The proteins are produced separately by the transgenic yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These proteins self-assemble into a virus like particle that is purified and placed into a sterile liquid for injection. Australia was an early supporter of vaccines. Smallpox vaccination began here in 1804, just five years after Jenner described the protective effect of cowpox, and the vaccine was produced locally from 1847. A vaccine against the plague, Yersinia pestis, developed in 1895, was imported into Australia soon after to control an outbreak in Sydney. The effectiveness of the year-old typhoid vaccine during the Boer War in 1899 led to its production in Australia shortly afterwards. Since World War II vaccination has had an enormous impact on the lives of Australians. At that time, poliomyelitis and diphtheria struck fear in the heart of every parent, and most families had experienced or knew of a tragedy related to one of these diseases. Also, many children died, were significantly incapacitated by whooping cough or measles, or were born with disabilities as a result of intrauterine infection with rubella. In contrast, in 1998 there were no cases of polio, diphtheria or congenital rubella syndrome reported in Australia and no deaths from measles or whooping cough. The Commonwealth first provided free vaccines in 1953 with the diphtheria-tetanuspertussis vaccine. This was followed by the oral polio vaccine in 1966, the rubella vaccine in 1971 and the combined measles-mumps-rubella vaccine in 1989. These have been followed by a range of other vaccines as they have become available. Another major initiative enacted by the Australian government in the area of vaccination was the establishment of the National Immunisation Program in 1997. Under this program the Australian government provides MAIN COMMITTEE funding to state and territory governments for the purchase of the 25 vaccines listed on the National Vaccine Schedule and funding to Medicare Australia for the Australian Childhood Immunisation Register, the General Practice Immunisation Incentives Scheme and subsidising individual private consultations involving immunisation through the Medicare Benefits Schedule. In 1996 Australian government expenditure on vaccines was $13 million; this grew to $283 million in 2006-07. In late November 2006 the Australian government added Gardasil to the National Immunisation Program. The reasons for adding this new vaccine to the program were clear. Cervical cancer is the world’s second most common gender-specific cancer amongst women and is currently responsible for the deaths of around 200 women in Australia each year. Before the introduction of the National Cervical Cancer Screening Program in 1991, the mortality rate was around four in 100,000. It is estimated that the screening program prevents around 70 per cent of squamous cervical cancers and the rate of mortality in 2004 dropped to 1.8 per 100,000 women. The introduction of Gardasil, used in conjunction with the screening program, should reduce this mortality incidence further. It is essential however that vaccinated girls and women continue to participate in the national screening program. The prophylactic Gardasil vaccine resulted from research by distinguished medical scientist and 2006 Australian of Year, Professor Ian Frazer, and fellow Australian citizen Dr Jian Zhou. Sadly, Dr Zhou’s life was tragically cut short at the age of 42 in 1999, before he could share in the joy of seeing the vaccine brought to market. Not one to rest on his laurels, Professor Frazer is currently working on a therapeutic vaccine for HPV-in other words, to cure the disease. The vaccine could be one of the first products to come out of the new biopharmaceutical production centre. This centre, incidentally, received $100 million in this year’s federal budget. Gardasil, as mentioned earlier, vaccinates against the human papilloma virus types 16, 18, 6 and 11. Types 16 and 18 are responsible for 70 to 80 per cent of the cervical cancers in Australia and types 6 and 11 cause 90 per cent of genital warts. The human papilloma virus is a common and usually asymptomatic infection. It is highly contagious and many people will acquire an HPV infection within a few weeks of becoming sexually active. In most people the infection clears within 12 to 24 months. However, in three to 10 per cent of women infected with types 16 and 18 the infection does not clear up and can result in cervical abnormalities which in some cases progress to cervical cancer. Through the National Immunisation Program, the vaccine is being administered to girls aged between 12 and 13 years in three injections over a period of six months through schools which wish to participate. It is the most successful school based program yet, with an uptake of greater than 80 per cent as at the end of June. From this month the vaccine is also available free to girls and women aged up to 26 years through GPs and community providers. The establishment of a register for the HPV vaccination program is integral to the success of the program. The register will enable: the recording of the details of individuals who participate in the HPV program, allowing statistics on participation rates to be compiled; the recording of vaccination information which can be compared with information recorded in Pap smear, cervical cytology and cervical cancer registers so as to assess the effectiveness of the HPV program over time; the notification of participants of the HPV program, if booster doses are required, to determine vaccination status or to certify completion of the vaccination MAIN COMMITTEE course; the collection of statistics to inform health authorities, healthcare providers and the public about the HPV program; participants to be informed, or parents of participants, of developments with the HPV program; and the details of vaccination providers to be recorded. Participants or their parents in the HPV program can opt to have personal details removed from this register at any time. This bill, by enabling such a register, will support the Australian government’s commitment to our progressive, world class immunisation system. I commend the bill to the House. Ms PLIBERSEK (Sydney) (10.29 am)-The National Health Amendment (National HPV Vaccination Program Register) Bill 2007 inserts a new section 9BA into the National Health Act 1953 providing for the establishment of the National Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination Program Register. The need for this bill arose from the government’s 2006 announcement to fund free HPV vaccine for females in the 12to 26-year-old age group through the National Immunisation Program with the aim of reducing the incidence of cervical cancer. The government made this announcement after the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Council decided that it was not cost effective for taxpayers to fund Gardasil-a decision which, at the time, was not without controversy. The establishment of the HPV register was also announced at that time. Labor is supporting this bill so that the register can be implemented as soon as possible, because the National Immunisation Program has already begun. We are also supporting this bill with the aim that the register will enhance the efficiency of the program. This is especially important after some schoolgirls were hospitalised following injections. It is important to know if there are any side effects from the injection. While the Department of Health and Ageing officials have labelled the effects as psychological, it is still important to have a mechanism to monitor participants in the program. Of course, it is also important that we monitor the effectiveness of the HPV vaccine in preventing certain cervical cancers. This vaccine is a huge breakthrough and will save many thousands of lives. It is an Australian innovation that makes me extraordinarily proud when I think of the health effects and protection that women around the world will eventually receive from this vaccine. I congratulate all of the scientists involved in the extraordinary discovery of this vaccine. Turning again to the register, I want to clarify that the register will, firstly, facilitate the establishment and maintenance of an electronic database of records for monitoring vaccination of participants in the program. Secondly, it will facilitate the monitoring of the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing certain cervical cancers by allowing for future cross-referencing of data against Pap smear and other information contained in registers maintained by states and territories. Thirdly, it will facilitate the establishment of mechanisms to advise eligible persons or their parents or guardians if vaccination has been missed or if booster doses are required in the future. It also allows for the maintenance of a record of people who are eligible to complete the course of the vaccination. It also facilitates the promotion of health and well-being by providing information on new developments associated with the program to vaccination providers, to women who are eligible and to their parents or guardians. The register also facilitates a payment to GPs for entering information into the register. It is important to know that there was initial controversy about including Gardasil in the National Immunisation Program. Labor is very pleased that it has been included. The vaccine protects against two strains of sexually transmitted human papilloma virus and those two MAIN COMMITTEE strains are responsible for about 70 per cent of cervical cancers. Free vaccines have been available from April 2007 in schools and from most doctors from July 2007. The Immunisation Program is targeted on an ongoing basis at 12and 13-year-old girls and is to be delivered through schools, and there will be a two-year catch-up program for 13to 18-year-old girls in schools. For 18to 26-year-old women, the program will be delivered through their GPs and community based programs. The government has committed a total of $579.3 million between 2006-07 and 2010-11 for the vaccination program. The program involves three injections over seven months. If the vaccination program had not been included in the National Immunisation Program, it would have cost about $430 for three shots. Of course, while it is a very high cost-more than half a billion dollars-the savings from the treatment of women with cervical cancer and the terrible loss of life associated with this disease certainly makes this half a billion dollars well spent. I am very pleased that the government has decided to provide the vaccine free to all Australian young women. I think we need to acknowledge the work of the then shadow health minister, Julia Gillard, and the current shadow minister, Nicola Roxon, in supporting the government’s introduction of this free vaccine. I know that it has not been without controversy. As I said, there are some people who have expressed concern that vaccinating young women will encourage increased sexual activity. Indeed, Australian Family Association spokeswoman Gabrielle Walsh was reported in the Daily Telegraph in May this year saying: Some parents feel it gives the children a sense they are going to be sexually active ... She further went on to say that, where young girls were going to abstain from sexual activity, it was not necessary to be vaccinated. I understand why parents would certainly be wishing to discourage early sexual activity in their teenage children, and I support a parent’s right to do that. The key is that this course of vaccination will eventually result in lifelong protection. When young girls are at school, it is the easiest way of making sure that we have access to 100 per cent of the relevant population. I do not believe that it will encourage earlier sexual activity. I think probably the last thing that young people who are engaged in sexual activity that is too early are thinking of is whether they are protected from human papilloma virus. The difference it is going to make there I think is negligible. As I say, the benefit of giving it to young girls in schools is that they will achieve lifelong protection from human papilloma virus. Incidentally, it is interesting to note that the federal Department of Health and Ageing says that recent overseas research has shown that 14.3 per cent of women who have had only one partner still carry the human papilloma virus. So, for parents who hope that their daughters will not engage in sexual activity before marriage and will have only one sexual partner throughout their lives, even for those women this vaccination is important. According to a South Australian study of 2,000 people that was published in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health, only five per cent of parents were concerned that the vaccine would make their daughters likely to engage in earlier or promiscuous sexual behaviour, and 75 per cent of parents said that they wanted their daughters to be vaccinated. The key scientist involved in the discovery of the vaccine and 2006 Australian of the Year, Professor Ian Frazer, recently said: MAIN COMMITTEE The opportunity to protect against cervical cancer is as compelling as the opportunity to protect against polio ... It is entirely the parents’ right to decide if they would like their child to be vaccinated. Hopefully they will be able to consider eventually that the vaccine is designed to protect against disease and the reality is that it has to be given early in life. If they wait too long, they could lose the benefit. We know that when women contract cervical cancer they are faced with the potential of a much shorter life expectancy than they otherwise would have had or, secondly, if cervical cancer is not caught and treated early enough, a hysterectomy is the other potential. It is a very serious potential. In 2004-which is the most recent data that we have-212 women died from cervical cancer and many others were forced to undertake either the option of hysterectomy or other very invasive surgical and medical procedures. The idea that we can save hundreds of lives and tens of thousands of treatments I think shows what an important breakthrough this is and what an important thing it is for us as a society to support maximum vaccination. The uncomfortable truth for many people is that a high proportion of teenagers are actually sexually active, the majority of young people in years 10 and 12 are sexually active in some way and a quarter of students in year 10 and half of students in year 12 have engaged in sexual intercourse. My personal view is that those figures are too high, but the reality for many Australian teenagers is that they have become sexually active, and that is another good reason to say it is very important to vaccinate against human papilloma virus from a very early age. I think these figures, which show a large proportion of teenagers become sexually active quite early, suggest that we need to do a lot better with our sex education in schools. We do not have a very good national approach to educating teenagers about not just the physical consequences of sexual activity but also the emotional and psychological aspects of engaging in early sexual activity. I was interested to see that in the recent federal budget the government announced that it had spent half a million dollars on educational research for high school students to talk about the financial aspects of teenage pregnancy and the responsibilities that arise from becoming a teenage parent. Again, if people know teenagers, they know that thinking about the financial aspects of potentially raising a child is probably not going to be the thing that stops them from engaging in sexual activity if that is at the top of their minds at an early age. I think that, as I say, we can do much better in our sexual and reproductive health education. I want to conclude by making a few more general comments about women’s health. Women use Medicare services about twice as much as men. An enormous range of medical problems are faced by women, of which cervical cancer is one of the more serious. We know that one in 11 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer before the age of 75. The most common age for that diagnosis is between 50 and 69. Rates of lung cancer, melanoma and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma are all increasing. The really interesting thing about lung cancer is that Australia has done fantastically well in reducing smoking rates. We have done brilliantly. We now have the lowest smoking rates in the world because of decades of concerted education campaigns, advertising campaigns and because we tax cigarettes quite highly, as we rightly should; but young women are increasingly smoking. Young women are the only group who are taking up smoking in larger numbers. I think that begs the question about why young MAIN COMMITTEE women are engaging in more risk-taking activities than in previous generations. We are also seeing more young women booked for violent crime, speeding offences and dangerous driving offences. I think there is a very interesting underlying question there about the changes in society that are prompting young women to engage in activities that older men and women see as very dangerous. We know that we have very good screening technologies available for many of these diseases, including cervical cancer and breast cancer, but many groups in the community do not avail themselves of that testing regime as much as they should or in a way that would significantly reduce their development of these diseases. Breast screening participation rates for Indigenous women and women from non-English speaking backgrounds in the target population of 50 to 69 are just 34.8 per cent and 47.4 per cent respectively and are significantly lower than the general rate of 57.1 per cent of the target community. We have increasing problems not just in the population of young women but also in an emerging population of young men when it comes to eating disorders and body image disorders. At the same time, we have increasing levels of obesity in the young Australian population and in the general Australian population. We need to do better in some of these areas when it comes to preventative measures in health care. As I said, we have done very well with smoking, but we have new and emerging challenges all the time which are increasingly related to diet and lifestyle challenges like obesity, leading to diabetes, for example. At the same time as we are seeing these emerging trends in poor health, most Australians are paying more to see a doctor, more for many medicines and more for private health insurance. There was very little in the most recent budget to genuinely tackle some of these health problems that are linked to the increasing expense of accessing normal medical services. In the last few days we have had an incredible intervention from the federal government, saying that they are happy to take over the running of the Mersey hospital in Tasmania. It is no coincidence that the Mersey hospital is in an extremely marginal seat. Setting aside all the cynicism of taking over one hospital in one marginal seat, it really does beg the question of the federal government’s broader vision for health care in this country. The one-off taking over of one hospital, leaving many services in many rural and regional areas facing exactly the same problems of shortages of specialists and shortages of equipment and so on, suggests that the government is prepared to pick and choose the health issues it is involved in in a way that is, I think, detrimental to the running of the broader health system. I will not conclude on a negative note. I want to conclude on a positive note of welcoming the initiative to provide Gardasil to women in the target age group and to other young women to provide them with a lifetime of protection from at least 70 per cent of the cervical cancers that are related to the two particular strains of human papilloma virus associated with this immunisation. It is a terrific step forward. Ian Frazer and his team must be congratulated for what is really a world-class breakthrough in women’s health. It makes me enormously grateful to think that my own daughter and grandchildren, if ever I have them, will be protected against the bulk of human papilloma viruses that may lead to cervical cancer. I want to express my gratitude to the scientific team who have come up with this breakthrough and offer my support not just for the national register but also for the free and ready availability of this vaccination program to young women who will benefit from it. MAIN COMMITTEE lian parliament as the federal member for Ryan in the western suburbs of Brisbane, an electorate that I grew up in and that I represent very proudly here in the national parliament. I am delighted to speak on the National Health Amendment (National HPV Vaccination Program Register) Bill 2007 because it is something that is of great interest to all my constituents, particularly to the parents of young women in my electorate. They will be very pleased and very proud, I think, that their government has acted very strongly to protect their daughters. I am very proud to be an advocate of this bill and to continue, as a local member, in working to promote this very significant piece of legislation and policy content therein. Australia has a long history of using immunisation in targeted and mass vaccination programs in order to control communicable diseases, although it should be said that in 1996 our immunisation rates were at a disturbingly low level with some 53 per cent of children aged zero to six years fully immunised for their age-so much so that Professor John Horvath, the current Chief Medical Officer in the Department of Health and Ageing, described those levels as ‘on a lower rate than in some developing countries’. I am pleased to say that today those rates are very different. In 1996, interestingly, only $13 million was spent on vaccines by the then Labor government. Again, I am pleased that this is a very different figure today. In the past 10 years the Howard government has been able to turn around this sort of figure. We have been able to increase our immunisation programs to the point where we are the envy of many developed countries around the world. I think that the turning point might be the Howard government’s introduction in February 1997 of the Immunise Australia strategy, which consisted of a seven-point plan and a comprehensive range of initiatives to increase Australia’s immunisation rate as quickly as possible to international levels. Overall, the government increased expenditure on immunisation some 22-fold to a figure of $283 million in 2006. We have been able to do that in the last few years only because of our very prosperous economy. A very strong economic performance allows the government to be able to inject this kind of money into very worthwhile and significant programs. The flip side of that is that, if an economy is going backwards or stuttering along, there is no way in the world that a government will be able to invest heavily in social services and in the communities around the country. It is a very indicative and a very salient point to make that it is only when an economy is performing robustly that governments can invest in their people, and in their young people in particular. The Gardasil vaccination program alone represents an expenditure of $107.4 million a year-eight times the yearly expenditure on all vaccines by the previous Labor governmentwhich brings the predicted expenditure on vaccinations in 2007-08 to $443 million, or a 34fold increase on 1996 levels. These are not insignificant figures. I am sure that the constituents of Ryan will appreciate this massive 34-fold increase on 1996 levels. Again, it points to the capacity of the government to be able to do this because we are generating revenues from the business community as a result of business doing well in Australia thanks to the policies of the Howard government in the economic area. Immunisation coverage rates have also increased dramatically, despite being at levels as low as 52 per cent in 1995 for children aged zero to six years of age. Since the introduction of the Immunise Australia program, childhood immunisation coverage rates have increased to all-time highs, with over 90 per cent of children aged 12 to 15 months now fully immunised. MAIN COMMITTEE",169,National Health Amendment National Hpv Vaccination Program Register Bill 2007
196,Mr Johnson (Ryan) (10.49 Am),"As always, it is my pleasure to speak in the AustraThe Howard government has of course conducted a number of very successful vaccination campaigns during its time in office: firstly, the measles control campaign in 1998, where 1.9 million primary school children were vaccinated with MMR, and, secondly, the current immunisation program against meningococcal disease, which commenced in 2003 and targeted all oneto 19-year-olds over a four-year period. At the time of its commencement the meningococcal vaccination program was the largest of its kind ever undertaken in Australia, at a cost of $298 million over four years. Just think about it: almost $300 million over four years of taxpayers’ money invested in the people of Australia by the government, which is a very significant investment in the people of Australia. Again, I just make the point that the government had the capacity to be able to do this because it has been able to manage the economy very well over the last decade. The benefits of such a large-scale vaccination program are already evident with the reported cases of meningococcal disease dropping from 213 cases in 2002 to just 40 cases in 2005-a decrease of 81 per cent. In 2006, the numbers were better still, with just 24 cases of meningococcal disease reported and one death. The success of this vaccination program is indicative of the benefits of these large-scale immunisation programs and reflects very well on the Howard government’s ability to effectively manage them. The Gardasil vaccination program, of which I will speak in a moment, will be the biggest of these programs yet. Approximately half a million women worldwide develop cervical cancer every year, and 230,000 of these women will die of the disease-many of them from the developing world. In Australia, about 800 women get cervical cancer each year, and about 270 women die from it. Thanks to the success of the Pap smear program in Australia, cervical cancer has dropped from the eighth to the 18th most common cause of cancer death amongst Australian women. Indeed, Australia has the second-lowest incidence of cervical cancer and the lowest mortality rate in the world. However, we all know that one death is still one too many, so whatever our government and our brilliant medical scientists, researchers and doctors can do to minimise cancer-or should the good Lord allow them to rid our society of cancer-would, of course, be a wonderful blessing upon us all. The Cancer Council of Victoria estimates that the Gardasil vaccine has the potential to prevent up to 500 cases of cervical cancer each year in Australia and to save in the order of 200,000 lives every year worldwide. Looking at this figure, one finds it enormously disturbing. However, when one goes beyond it, one must stop and think that this is not just a number on a piece of paper; it is someone’s loved one, someone’s relative, someone’s daughter, someone’s mother or someone’s sister. Whatever we can do, we must do. We must do all we can within the powers of humanity to rid our earth of such cancers and all the other ills and evils of our world. The Gardasil vaccine is a breakthrough in the treatment of cervical cancer, and the Howard government is very proud to be able to make it widely available to young Australian women. It is a good example of politics and government at their very best. Previous speakers and colleagues have mentioned Professor Ian Frazer. He can claim much of the credit for discovering the vaccine, in cooperation with his good friend and colleague-a man who has now sadly passed on-Dr Jian Zhou. I never had the opportunity of meeting Dr Jian Zhou, but he did live in my electorate of Ryan. I do know his wife very well, Ms Sun Xiao-Yi, who still lives in the suburb of Mt Ommaney in the Ryan electorate. She is a wonderful lady. She has become a MAIN COMMITTEE family friend to me and my wife in the last 10 years, through mutual friends of ours. I regret very much that I did not have the opportunity of meeting her husband, who, from all accounts, was an incredibly gifted man and a wonderful human being. He spent some time at my old alma mater at Cambridge University, in the United Kingdom. I wish very much that I had had the pleasure and honour of meeting him. Ian Frazer, also a Ryan constituent, lives in the suburb of St Lucia and works at the University of Queensland. He is a very distinguished professional, a very smart man and a very kind man. His compassion, humanity and decency and just sheer determination to make an impact on the world through his medical and research skills is an inspiration to all of us and certainly to those in the medical profession. Someone like my brother, who is a young neurosurgeon in this country, looks up to Ian Frazer. My sister is about to graduate from Sydney University as a doctor and aspires, as I think all doctors and medical researchers do, to make a difference in their professional endeavours. I have had the pleasure of meeting Ian Frazer-or as the press like to call him and as media magazines and feature stories like to label him, ‘God’s gift to women’-on many occasions. I am very fortunate that he is a Ryan constituent. His wife has just retired as a teacher at a local primary school in the Ryan electorate, and I want to pay tribute in passing to her for her dedication at that local primary school. She and Ian are wonderful people. Everyone knows Professor Ian Frazer for his Australian of the Year honour in 2006. He relished, of course, this opportunity to promote Australia’s medical research capabilities and to inspire others to pursue a career in this very important field. The vaccine that he came up with protects girls and young women against four strains of the human papilloma virus, which is sexually transmitted. Two of the four strains are responsible for 70 per cent of all cervical cancer, and the remaining two strains cause over 90 per cent of genital warts. Before the vaccine was cleared for use in Australia, more than 8,000 women across 16 countries received the vaccine as part of the clinical trials designed to test the efficacy and safety of the vaccine. The results, as published in the very prestigious New England Journal of Medicine, are remarkable and demonstrate that Gardasil protects against a range of cancerous and precancerous conditions. The worldwide take-up of Gardasil has been incredible, with over six million people now being vaccinated in the United States alone. Germany, Italy and France have now also instituted an Australian style widespread immunisation scheme. In November 2006, the Howard government announced a funding outlay of $537 million for the national HPV vaccination program using the Gardasil vaccine. I am pleased that I can stand here and say that I was a very strong advocate of that in the corridors of government here. The $437 million over five years is for the vaccine itself, which retails at approximately $460 over the counter. An additional $100 million over four years is provided to support the implementation of the program with an education campaign and the establishment of a national register, which this bill specifically establishes. The free vaccine is being provided through school based programs to girls aged between 12 and 13 years on an ongoing basis. As part of the program, the Howard government will also fund a two-year catch-up program at schools for girls aged between 13 and 18 years. As well, there is an additional two-year catch-up program to enable young women, aged up to and including 26 years, who have left school to be vaccinated through their local GPs. MAIN COMMITTEE We might recollect the scenes on national television when, in April this year, Professor Ian Frazer himself vaccinated the first Australian schoolgirl. Speaking of Professor Frazer and Australian schoolgirls being vaccinated, I had the pleasure, during the recess, to be part of Professor Ian Frazer’s visit to a very significant college in my electorate-Brigidine College at Indooroopilly. On behalf of the college principal, Ms Madeleine Sayer, I invited Ian Frazer to speak to the young women at the college about medical research in general, about his life and times, about what inspires him and, in particular, about the Gardasil program and vaccination. On the record in the parliament, I want to thank Brigidine College for having me visit the college with Professor Frazer. I want to thank the college captain, Stephanie Byrnes, for her assistance and hospitality in looking after us and showing Professor Frazer around the college and, of course, to thank the college principal, Madeleine Sayer, for her foresight and very strong reception of the visit by Ian Frazer. For Ms Sayer this was an investment in the young women of her college in a broader sense as well as in the very direct sense, with Professor Frazer speaking of his experience and his skills. The day was a resounding success. This college is at Indooroopilly and has some 500 students. The Brigidine College newsletter published on 27 July and distributed to the parents of the girls states: Mr Michael Johnson, the Federal Member for Ryan organized this visit to the College last Monday. It was a great privilege for the girls to meet and hear an address by Professor Ian Frazer. He spoke of his work in the development of the vaccine that protects women against cancer. All the Yr 12, 11 & 10 students have already been immunised this year (one more injection to complete the series). It is a great initiative of the Federal government and we were able to express our appreciation through Mr Johnson. I thank Madeleine Sayer and Brigidine College for their hospitality. I know that the students of the college would have very much appreciated listening to a very distinguished Australian and someone who is in enormous demand by a lot of schools, organisations and companies for his time and his wisdom. Madeleine Sayer’s letter to me, commenting on this Howard government initiative, says: It is a marvellous program and I would commend all associated with this decision for the investment in the future of our nation. Yours sincerely Madeleine Sayer Principal This bill will amend the National Health Act 1953 to enable the establishment and operation of this national program register. It will ensure the successful implementation of the national HPV program. The national register will enable the government to collect information on girls and women immunised by the cervical cancer vaccine, Gardasil, to gauge the success of the national immunisation program. Through the compilation of data and statistics, the register will enable the government to determine how many people participated in the HPV vaccination program in relation to the eligible population, and also of course enable outcome based analysis as recorded by cervical cytology registers. The register will also provide a way for participants to be contacted if need be and will help women to find out whether they have been vaccinated and whether they require booster doses. The register will contain personal and vaccination information about women who participate in the program. However, only registered vaccination providers will be given access to MAIN COMMITTEE the HPV register to allow information to be entered on the register and to check the vaccination status of those to whom they are administering the vaccine. The bill also makes provision for vaccinated persons to make the request in writing at any time to have their details removed from the register. In conclusion, I want to again thank Professor Frazer and pay tribute to him in the parliament. He is of course a very strong advocate of good health policy and of medical research expansion in this country. I know that when he was named Australian of the Year he was very proud of that-and, like me, he is not an Australian by birth. He is an Australian by migration, coming from Scotland-I do not come from Scotland-and is someone that many in this country admire because he has every decency about him to make a difference in our country. Of course, we are a country of only 20 million people. I think the amount of money that the federal government invests in health alone is something we can be very proud of. There is always a case for more money to be spent in every aspect of government and public policy, but as a prosperous nation we can be very proud of what we have spent. That is not to say we cannot do more. We can always do more. Every government can always look to revisit its programs to try and invest in areas where it will really make a difference to people on the ground. This is something that, as a local member, I want to continue to advocate. At the pointy end of life-at the grassroots of our community, in the day-to-day living that takes place across our country-we should always remember what makes a difference, at the end of the day, to people’s lives. It is this sort of thing that people look at very seriously. We can get caught up in theory and academic nonsense about a whole bunch of things but, at the end of the day, we should just remember what actually strikes at people’s hearts and souls. It is this sort of thing that makes a difference in the lives of children and in the lives of their family security. I commend this bill very strongly to the House. Health Amendment (National HPV Vaccination Program Register) Bill 2007, which will record on a register personal and vaccination information for individuals receiving the HPV vaccine under the National HPV Vaccination Program. This register is needed because the existing Australian Childhood Immunisation Register only collects information up to age seven. The aim of this bill is to overcome some technical difficulties with the Department of Health and Ageing being able to collect and use a person’s Medicare card number for purposes other than the purpose for which the Medicare number was generated. The HPV register will assist in monitoring the number of doses of vaccine received, notifying individuals if doses of vaccine have been missed, recalling individuals in the event that booster doses might be required in the future and providing educational materials. It will also allow vaccination information to be compared in the future to patient outcomes, as recorded in Pap smears, cervical cytology or cervical cancer registers. It is so important to have accurate registers of information so that medical professionals have access to a person’s medical history. This information can be vital in diagnosing future illnesses and determining which medications to prescribe to patients. It can be difficult for a teenager or a young adult, and difficult for the families of these people, to remember and have knowledge of all the vaccinations that they have received, so this register will also mean that medical professionals can use this information rather than relying on information from the actual patient or their family. MAIN COMMITTEE",181,National Health Amendment National Hpv Vaccination Program Register Bill 2007
197,Mrs Hull (Riverina) (11.08 Am),"It gives me great pleasure to support the NationalMany times you may have a separation in a family, whereby parents go separate ways, and then records of children’s vaccination programs are not kept intact. Years down the track, it becomes a vital and difficult issue for some of those young people to reconcile exactly which vaccination programs they have undertaken. A mum or a family member could have a tragic death, and with that death goes all of the information on the way in which the children were vaccinated in their early years. That leads to confusion about many illnesses. Particularly when young couples decide to marry, this becomes a problem. Having a register such as this will mean that professionals and those people will be comforted that they can access this kind of information and that it is not lost to them forever. The cross-referencing of information will provide information about the effectiveness of the HPV vaccine in reducing cervical cancers and inform the future directions of the HPV program. Australia is one of the first countries in the world to fund a HPV program. It really is a great credit to the Australian government, particularly to the minister, for having acted on this fantastic initiative. This bill will remove the obstacles associated currently with the collection of personal and HPV vaccination details and the disclosure of Commonwealth assigned identifiers, such as the Medicare number, for the purposes of the register. It also establishes the register and provides for the recording of certain personal information about individuals participating in the HPV program. It also details the purposes of the register and provides individuals with an opportunity, on written request, to be able to access these kinds of details in individual circumstances. It also allows for the cross-referencing of information about the vaccination status of females on the register, with Pap smear, cervical cytology or cervical cancer registers maintained by states and territories. It also recognises that some personal information-such as name, address, date of birth and Medicare card number, which are already in the possession of, or under the control of, the Commonwealth-may need to be disclosed to and used by the Department of Health and Ageing in order to facilitate the operation of the register. It facilitates the payment of a small administrative fee to GPs who provide details on the register relating to individuals in the 12to 18-year-old group who are vaccinated with HPV vaccine. Our immunisation system is now world class, with immunisation coverage rates above 90 per cent for 12-month-old children for the last six years. The proof of the success of the program can be measured by the large decline in the rate of preventable diseases. In the case of polio and smallpox, it has led to the eradication of diseases in Australia. Our childhood immunisation rates have increased. When I was on the Wagga Wagga City Council, I was running a program, through ABC radio, trying to encourage young mums and families to vaccinate their children, because at that time only 53 per cent of children were fully immunised by the age of 12 months. We saw the re-emergence of whooping cough and the threat of other diseases being reintroduced simply because our young mums and dads had never seen the devastating consequences of those diseases. Many people were frightened off by claimswhether or not they were valid-of damage caused to children through having vaccinations. I felt it was almost a national crisis, with almost half the children in Australia not vaccinated against killer diseases and typically terrible diseases. So prior to my coming into this HouseI encouraged families to vaccinate their children. I am really proud to see that we have now lifted those rates substantially, with over 90 per cent of children now fully immunised. I congratulate the government on this massive effort because it has been committed to ensuring MAIN COMMITTEE that Australians can access free vaccines to protect the population against vaccine preventable diseases through our National Immunisation Program. As the previous speaker indicated, the Australian government announced in 2006 that a free human PV vaccination program for all Australian girls and women from 12 to 26 years of age would be implemented. In 1996 the Australian government expenditure on vaccines was $13 million a year; when the Howard and Vaile coalition government came into this place, vaccination expenditure was a mere $13 million a year. In 2006-07, our vaccine expenditure was $283 million a year. I am very proud of the government for this extensive program to ensure the protection of Australian children. The HPV program has commenced with $475.9 million of funding over five years from 2006-07 until 2010-11. The commitment to the vaccine funding of that is estimated to be over $443 million. We have a very good program for schools and young girls in particular. This program will provide vaccinations for three groups of females: girls aged 12 and 13 years, which will be delivered through schools on an ongoing basis; girls aged 13 to 18 years, which will be delivered primarily through school for a two-year catch-up period; and young women aged 18 to 26 years, which will be delivered through our community programs, including GPs, for a two-year catch-up period. This will be staged in various ways and by various means, but it has commenced in 2007 and will continue through 2008. I am extremely pleased to see that the government has acted forcefully and decisively, as it does, to ensure that our Australian children, and their families, are supported and protected and to encourage families to move on this issue. I congratulate the minister and the government. I commend this bill to the House. proud of its achievements in the area of health. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for some of our state Labor governments, especially the Queensland state government, which has a dismal record of failure and mismanagement in this area. The Howard government constantly seeks to be proactive in tackling health problems and costs. We know that we face escalating health costs-firstly, because of the scientific and technological advances in medicine; secondly, because our expectations for treatment have risen with those advances; and, thirdly, because we are an ageing population with all the health problems that that entails. It therefore makes sense to concentrate resources on building good health and immunity from infancy, and on the prevention of disease or injury, to minimise future health costs. In my role as Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing, I am involved in an inquiry at the moment into the breastfeeding of babies in Australia and have heard much evidence regarding the long-term health benefits that this gives our children. We are listening to people and gathering data so that we can say to parents, ‘Here is the latest information; here is the data so that you can make informed choices about ensuring the best lifetime health outcomes for your child.’ A healthy nation is also a more productive nation. Building immunity is an important step in keeping our people healthy, which of course is good for our people, for our economy and for our future health costs. We start building that immunity with care, nutrition and immunisation of babies and young children. Under the Immunise Australia Program, we fund vaccinations in babies and children for a wide range of diseases including hepatitis B, diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, polio, pneumococcal, measles, mumps, rubella and meningococcal C. MAIN COMMITTEE",185,National Health Amendment National Hpv Vaccination Program Register Bill 2007
198,Mr Somlyay (Fairfax) (11.19 Am),"The Australian government has every reason to beOver the last 20 years, child mortality rates in Australia have been reduced by half; however, some years ago many parents stopped vaccinating their children because diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus, polio and whooping cough appeared to have been eliminated. In 1989-90, only 53 per cent of one-year-olds were immunised; since 2000-that is, on this government’s watch-that figure has been over 90 per cent. When we came to government in 1996, Australian government expenditure on vaccines was $13 million a year-I repeat: $13 million a year. In 2006-07, our vaccine expenditure was $283 million, and that was before the introduction this year of the National Human Papillomavirus-HPV-Vaccination Program, and also the rotavirus vaccinations. The addition of rotavirus vaccine to the National Immunisation Program will cost $124.4 million over five years, while the HPV vaccine program commenced with vaccine funding of $475.9 million over five years. The Australian government’s commitment to vaccine funding in this financial year is estimated to be over $443 million. That contrasts again with the $13 million that it was in 1996. In 2007-08, our expenditure is to be, as I said before, $443 million. That is a very large commitment to proactive health care from the federal government. We would not be responsible managers if we did not try to ensure that that investment is both effective and costeffective. The National HPV Vaccination Program, announced by the government in November 2006 and introduced in April this year, funds free HPV vaccine for females in the 12to 26-year-old age group, with the aim of reducing the incidence of cervical cancer. The vaccine is most effective if given before any exposure to HPV infection and is administered as a series of three injections over a period of seven months. As part of that program, the National Health Amendment (National HPV Vaccination Program Register) Bill 2007 establishes a register of those vaccinated. There are a number of very good reasons for this register. The first is to ensure that each young woman completes the full course of three injections. The second is that research on this vaccine is ongoing and it is possible that a booster may be necessary in future years. The register enables women to be notified if this is necessary. The third is that it provides data on the efficacy of the vaccine, as well as ascertaining whether the vaccine program causes any drop in the number of women having their regular pap smear test under the National Cervical Cancer Screening Program. Routine pap smear tests have proved highly effective in detecting cervical cancer in early treatable stages, significantly reducing the mortality rate, but there is concern that the vaccination may give some women a false sense of security leading them to neglect having these routine tests in the future. Another concern is that, although the vaccine protects against two strains of HPV responsible for 70 to 80 per cent of cervical cancers, other strains may also adapt or develop over time. Cross-referencing the vaccines with NCSP data will help monitor such changes and allow us to be proactive in combating them. I know most of us get a little bit nervous about personal information being gathered on a computer that may be shared with unknown people or organisations. In this instance, we are talking about a record of vaccination, not of an illness. There are in-built safeguards. The first safeguard is that the HPV register will also hold information about general practitioners and registered nurses who are recognised for the purpose of the HPV register as vaccination providers. Only those registered providers would be given access to the register for the purpose of making an entry or checking the vaccination status of their patient. The second safeguard is MAIN COMMITTEE of course choice. All vaccinations are voluntary. Good sense, yes; highly desirable, yes-but still voluntary. On top of that, this bill makes the provision for a female or her parent or guardian to make a request in writing at any time to have her details removed from the HPV register. That request must be complied with as soon as practicable. We all need to make choices, preferably informed choices, in our own health care. The government can only do so much to help protect us. We, as individuals, have to make health choices for ourselves and our children regarding diet, lifestyle, exercise, smoking, medical practitioner treatments, vaccinations and the use of this register. I believe it is an important tool in the fight against cervical cancer. Obviously the government also believes that the bottom line is that each individual has a choice. Australia has a world-class immunisation system and we should be proud of it. It is part of this government’s forward-thinking and proactive approach to health. We also have world-class health professionals and clinicians. The problems lie in the administration by state government. I do not mean to play the blame game, which was the name of the report that I tabled last year on behalf of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing, but unless you look at where the problem is coming from, look at the cause, not the excuse, you cannot fix the problem. While the federal government, through the GST, funds most state hospitals and health costs, they are administered by the states and the Commonwealth has no say in how those dollars are spent. I find it particularly difficult to see the level to which funding health care in my own state, Queensland, has sunk. This is affecting the morale and retention of health professionals working in the public system, which of course exacerbates the problem. In the Courier-Mail on 6 August there is an article about a report released this week on Queensland Health by the former head of the University of Queensland School of Medicine, Mr Ken Donald. The article says: The latest inquiry into the department, once envied by other states as delivering a model of public health care, reveals a system in meltdown … In five years’ time the breakdown in services will be ‘out of control’. Queenslanders already know about the long waiting lists for public hospitals and the secret waiting lists-the lists that you have to get on to get on the list. That arrangement is used deliberately to mislead people over the length of a waiting list. Last week’s report reveals that in spite of all the press conferences, assurances and hand on heart declarations, the situation is becoming so desperate that some in Queensland Health are marking patients’ files never to be seen by a doctor. Minister Robertson insisted that these people only had minor ailments, but how do you know that they are minor until the person has been examined? Also, the ailments include cancer and stroke-and they are hardly minor conditions. I mention the sad state of Queensland Health as a contrast. This bill is indicative of the federal government’s attitude that it is far more effective to be proactive and spend money ensuring better health early than to wait and treat the problem when it is serious. Queensland Health’s approach to its own health has been to try to hide and deny the symptoms until it is at a point of collapse even in coping with emergency calls. I commend this bill to the House. ence and Training) (11.30 am)-In summing up the National Health Amendment (National HPV Vaccination Program Register) Bill 2007, I firstly thank the members who have spoken MAIN COMMITTEE",187,National Health Amendment National Hpv Vaccination Program Register Bill 2007
199,Mr Farmer (Macarthur,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, Scion this bill. I would like to thank the member for Gellibrand, the member for Sydney, the member for Moore, the member for Fairfax, who has just finished his speech, the member for Ryan and, most importantly, the member for Riverina-and I say that because the member for Riverina brought up a valid point that I can relate to as a single parent. When my wife passed away, when my children were very young, I found it difficult to locate all the records that my wife had for my son and my daughter for their vaccinations over the years. Like a lot of men, I had left that up to my wife to do, and so of course I had a witch-hunt to try and find the necessary papers. I had to contact my doctors et cetera. One of the things that this bill does is to make sure that it takes that onus away from those situations and assists the family unit, in moments of crisis like that, in having a record of vaccinations that have taken place. This bill is about vaccination and information. The bill amends the National Health Act 1953 to insert provisions for the establishment and maintenance of the human papilloma virus, or HPV, register to complement the implementation of the National HPV Vaccination Program. The register will collect personal and vaccination information about people who receive HPV vaccine under the HPV program with a view to evaluating in the long term the effectiveness of the vaccine in reducing the incidence of cervical cancer. The HPV register will also facilitate a number of other functions relating to the HPV program and the payment of an administration fee to general practitioners who provide information to the register. In summary, the legislation will ensure the collection of information which, in addition to evaluating the success of the HPV program in reducing cervical cancer, will also inform the policy direction of the HPV program and government expenditure in the future. It will also benefit individuals participating in the HPV program by providing them with information about their vaccination status, sending notifications when doses of vaccine have been missed and facilitating a recall system for participants in the event that booster doses may be required in the future. As the father of a 12-year-old girl, I see this bill as being absolutely vital-vitally important not only for my daughter but, indeed, for me and for the rest of my family, my son included, because none of us wants to lose a wife, a daughter or an aunty and none of us wants to lose a close relative when it can be prevented. So this bill shows a vision on behalf of the coalition government-a vision for the future, a vision to monitor the health of young Australians well into the future, well into the years ahead. It is for that reason that I would like to commend this bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment.

There are two amendments contained in the bill and both deal directly with the act. The two MAIN COMMITTEE",189,National Health Amendment National Hpv Vaccination Program Register Bill 2007
200,Mr Bevis (Brisbane) (11.35 Am),"The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2007amendments are as follows. The first repeals the current subheading for the chemical pesticide binapacryl and creates a new subheading for this chemical. The second moves prepared culture medium for the development and maintenance of viruses from its current subheading where it has a customs duty rate of five per cent to a new subheading where it will receive a customs duty rate of three per cent. The main purpose of the first amendment to the bill is to bring Australia into line with its international obligations under the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade, mercifully known simply as the Rotterdam convention, to which Australia is a signatory. The convention operates under the auspices of the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations. The Rotterdam convention list includes chemicals that have been banned or severely restricted in five or more countries. Acutely hazardous pesticides that may not have been banned or severely restricted in any country but that are known to cause health or environmental problems are also able to be included on the list. The Rotterdam convention was adopted at a conference on 10 September 1998 and was signed by Australia in New York on 6 July 1999. The national interest analysis was tabled in both houses of parliament on 9 September 2003. The Joint Committee on Treaties tabled its report, No. 55, covering the convention on 16 October 2003. The committee concluded by quoting and supporting the evidence received from the Department of Environment and Heritage that said: ... ratification would strengthen our existing systems which protect the environment and human health of Australia and Australians and enhance our capacity to influence international efforts to address chemical issues. The Australian government deposited instruments of ratification for the Rotterdam convention on 20 May 2004. Obligations relating to the convention came into force for Australia on 18 August 2004, three years ago. The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry describes the convention as a procedure that helps participating countries learn more about the characteristics of potentially hazardous chemicals that may be shipped to them. It also initiates a decision-making process on the future importation of these chemicals by the countries themselves and it helps convey this decision to other countries. It does not involve international bans. The procedure promotes a shared responsibility between exporting and importing countries in protecting human health and the environment from the harmful effects of hazardous chemicals that are being traded internationally. It allows countries to make informed decisions about what chemicals they allow to enter and contributes to the processes of managing chemical risk. The convention covers pesticides and industrial chemicals that have been banned or severely restricted for health or environmental reasons by the parties which have been notified by parties for inclusion in the procedure. One notification from each of two specified regions triggers consideration of the addition of a chemical to annex III of the Rotterdam convention. Severely hazardous pesticides that present a hazard under conditions of use in developing countries or countries with economies in transition may also be nominated for inclusion in annex III. There are 39 chemicals listed in annex III of the Rotterdam convention which subject to these procedures, including 24 pesticides, four severely hazardous pesticide formulations and MAIN COMMITTEE 11 industrial chemicals. Many more chemicals are expected to be added in the future. The conference of the parties decides on the inclusion of new chemicals. Once a chemical is included in annex III, a decision guidance document containing information concerning the chemical and the regulatory decisions to ban or severely restrict the chemical for health or environmental reasons is circulated to all parties. Parties have nine months to prepare a response concerning the future importation of the chemical. The response can consist of either a final decision to allow importation, not to allow importation or to allow importation subject to specific conditions, or an interim response. Decisions by an importing country must be trade neutral-that is, they have to apply equally to domestic production for domestic use as well as to imports from any source. The import decisions are circulated and exporting country parties are obliged under the Rotterdam convention to take appropriate measures to ensure that exporters within their jurisdiction comply with the decisions. The Rotterdam convention promotes the exchange of information on a very broad range of chemicals. It does so through the requirement for a party to inform other parties of each national ban or severe restriction of the chemical; the possibility for a party which is a developing country or a country in transition to inform other parties that it is experiencing problems caused by a severely hazardous pesticide formulation under conditions of use in its territory; the requirement for a party that plans to export a chemical that is banned or severely restricted for use within a territory to inform the importing party that such exports will take place before the first shipment and annually thereafter; the requirement for an exporting party, when exporting chemicals that are to be used for occupational purposes, to ensure that an up-to-date safety data sheet is sent to the importer; and, finally, labelling requirements for exports of chemicals included in the procedure as well as for chemicals that are banned or severely restricted in the exporting countries. Despite the Rotterdam convention clearly stipulating that binapacryl would be subject to prior informed consent conditions for all signatories from 1 February 2005, it has taken the government over 2½ years to take the appropriate action. This represents yet another example of the Howard government’s lethargy and complacency in office. As in so many areas, it has fallen asleep at the wheel. Today, about 2½ years after the parliament should have been considering this matter, it has finally been brought before us. Although there have been no imports of binapacryl since 1 January 2007, it was not previously classified separately in the tariff and its importation was not readily identifiable. The United Nations Committee of Experts on the Transportation of Dangerous Goods also classifies binapacryl as a poisonous substance requiring further regulation under the Rotterdam convention. The second amendment in this bill was contained in Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 1) 2007, which was tabled in the House of Representatives on 15 February 2007. The date of effect of the change was 1 January 2007, as the change was originally included in Customs Tariff Notice No. 1 (2006), which was published in special Commonwealth Gazette S222 on 15 December 2006, in accordance with the requirements of section 273EA of the Customs Act 1901. This amendment will allow for the duty rate of ‘free’ rather than five per cent for the prepared culture media for the development or maintenance of viruses, as intended by the Customs Tariff Amendment (2007 Harmonized System Changes) Act 2006. This is a positive amendment. MAIN COMMITTEE The Labor Party supports both of the measures contained in this bill. They are both valuable additions to the legislative framework of the country in two respects. I think it is worthy of mention again that our obligations under the Rotterdam convention, to which we all subscribe and which are supported in this bill, seem to have been lost in the paperwork of the Howard government over the course of the last two years. Here we are, in the dying weeks of this parliament and in the lead-up to an election, with the government now tidying up some of these matters. These measures should have been dealt with much earlier. We are pleased that they have finally come before the parliament, and they have bipartisan support. Dr STONE (Murray-Minister for Workforce Participation) (11.45 am)-I thank the member for Brisbane for his contribution to the debate on the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2007. The legislation is receiving bipartisan support. Government does a very significant amount of work in this area to make sure that the country is protected in all ways. The Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade, which the member for Brisbane referred to, is a multilateral environmental agreement designed to promote shared responsibility and cooperation among parties in international trade of certain hazardous industrial chemicals and pesticides. This government takes the whole business of trading hazardous industrial chemicals and pesticides very seriously indeed. Our agribusiness industry is dependent, as is our manufacturing industry, on the very careful management of these substances and, indeed, the Rotterdam convention is very seriously considered and complied with by this government. The aim of this convention is to protect human health and the environment from potential harm and to contribute to the environmentally sound use of these hazardous products. The amendment to the classification of the pesticide binapacryl allows for its separate identification. This will allow the Australian Customs Service and other regulatory agencies in Australia and throughout the world to identify and monitor this trade and this pesticide, thereby having greater control over the movement of this good. The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2007 contains minor amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995. In this final summary of this debate, let me just repeat that the bill contains amendments to repeal the current subheading for binapacryl and create a new subheading for this chemical. This amendment comes as a result of information received from the World Customs Organisation acknowledging that binapacryl was classified incorrectly in the third review of the harmonised commodity description and coding system which forms the basis of Australia’s custom tariff. These measures will take effect on the day the act receives the royal ascent. The bill will also amend the text of the subheading for microbiological culture media to remove the reference to culture media for viruses. This amendment will ensure that the rate of customs duty of ‘free’ will continue to apply to prepared culture media for the development or maintenance of viruses. This measure was implemented via customs tariff notice in December 2006 and then included in Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 1) 2007, which was tabled in the House of Representatives on 15 February 2007. The measure contained in this bill will take effect from 1 January 2007. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. MAIN COMMITTEE Bill read a second time. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. Second Reading Debate resumed from 31 May, on motion by Mr Pearce: That this bill be now read a second time. 2007 is a belated response by the government to the 1997 Review of the Regulation of Corporate Insolvency Practitioners; the 1998 Legal Committee of the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee report Corporate voluntary administration; the 2000 Companies and Securities Advisory Committee report Corporate groups; the 2004 Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee report Rehabilitating large and complex enterprises in financial difficulties; and the 2004 Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services report Corporate insolvency laws: a stocktake. Updated insolvency laws that adequately respond to business practices, provide more clarity for creditors and in turn reduce the cost of obtaining finance are vital for the Australian economy. There is of course a social impact that should be considered, and this is something particularly important to the agenda of those on this side of the House. In 2003, the ACTU estimated that around 19,000 employees may lose up to $500 million-that is, half a billion dollars-in unpaid entitlements each year. Although other creditors have other sources of income sometimes, employees are likely to be dependent on the wages they receive from a company and, as such, the impact on them is likely to be substantial. Labor does welcome the bill, overdue though it is. In particular, changes relating to finetuning of administration processes implement the CAMAC recommendations that date from 1998, and it is good to see, in 2007, that they are finally being implemented in this legislation. The changes that arise from this bill fall into four categories: improving the outcomes for creditors, including employees; deterring misconduct by company officers; improving regulation of insolvency practitioners; and finetuning voluntary administration procedures. Outcomes for creditors are improved by the bill in a number of ways. In the current system, employees are afforded priority amongst unsecured creditors. However, this priority can be displaced by a deed of company arrangement. Employees have only a limited opportunity to challenge any change to this prioritisation in a deed in the event that their priority is displaced by a meeting of creditors. Changes in this bill mean that it will now be mandatory for a deed of company arrangement to preserve the priority of employee entitlements when a company is in voluntary administration unless employee creditors agree to waive their priority. The court may approve the employee creditors’ waiver and alter their priority in the deed of company arrangement where it is satisfied that it would be more beneficial for employee creditors than the immediate winding-up of the company. This is a sensible measure which the opposition supports. Issues relating to the superannuation guarantee will also be clarified. Although the Corporations Act gives priority to the superannuation contributions of employees, it has been held by the courts that the guarantee, which is a statutory tax liability owed by the Commonwealth, cannot be characterised in the same way and therefore does not have the same priority. As the MAIN COMMITTEE",190,Customs Tariff Amendment Bill No 1 2007
201,Mr Bowen (Prospect) (11.49 Am),"The Corporations Amendment (Insolvency) BillSGC is related to superannuation payments and exists to ensure that the benefits for employees are received, there is a need to clarify and address the priority of the SGC in a receivership, voluntary administration or deed of company arrangement, not just company liquidation. Changes to the superannuation guarantee act and the Corporations Act mean that the SGC will receive the same priority as wages and superannuation contributions. Rights of subrogated creditors-those creditors who are entitled to be substituted for another creditor in a liquidation because they have advanced funds to meet a particular creditor’s debt-are clarified so that they have the same rights as the original creditors, even if an advance has not been made before the relevant date. New disclosure requirements for administrators are introduced to address the concerns about the independence of directors and to make sure that creditors can make well-informed decisions when engaging administrators. Administrators will be required to provide a declaration of any ‘relevant relationships’ and indemnities that apply to them in a document which is a maximum of two pages in length. Greater guidance will be given to courts to set and review remuneration of administrators and deed administrators. A number of amendments are also made to streamline administration processes. The requirement that a company in a creditors’ voluntary liquidation hold an annual members meeting will be removed, as the economic interests of those members is not substantial enough when balanced against the cost of those meetings. However, if the liquidator chooses not to call an annual meeting of creditors, then they must lodge a report with ASIC on the progress of the administration and notify creditors that the report will be available to creditors free of charge. In the case of a members’ voluntary liquidation, where the economic interest is generally greater, the requirement for an annual meeting is retained. Various requirements to publish notices and documents will also be made redundant unless there is a strong policy rationale for the publication of relevant documents. The bill will also allow various notices to be published together to reduce costs. Electronic communication will now be made available to administrators for the distribution of notices to creditors, provided that certain conditions are met. Currently, electronic distribution is only available to notify members of meetings. In order to increase the opportunity to recoup funds for creditors, two types of pooling orders in liquidation, voluntary and court ordered, will be made available. Voluntary pooling will be available to occur when a liquidator of a group of companies that are in the process of winding up makes a determination that the group of companies can be pooled for the purposes of liquidation. Courts will be empowered to order that a group of companies is pooled for the purposes of winding up. An application for court ordered pooling may only be made by the liquidator or liquidators of the companies in the group as each company in the group will be taken to jointly and severally be liable for each debt payable in each claim against the company in that group. The bill also puts forward a number of proposals to deter corporate misconduct. ASIC will now be able to use its compulsory powers to investigate a liquidator’s conduct if it has reason to suspect, for example, that they have failed to carry out their duties. Penalty privilege in relation to proceedings for disqualification, banning suspension or cancellation of orders or declarations to that effect will be removed. This was one of the amendments sought after privilege was claimed in the High Court’s Richv ASIC case, where ASIC was unable to obtain certain documents in relation to the relevant orders. MAIN COMMITTEE Banning and disqualification orders and orders to cancel or suspend licences will help deter misconduct of company officers, including in relation to phoenix company activity. Insolvency practitioners will be better regulated under new provisions. Prohibitions on inducements to members or creditors of a company to secure an appointment will now be extended to include directors and providers of professional services, such as legal and accounting firms. Registered liquidators will have to obtain and maintain professional indemnity and fidelity insurance to cover their work as insolvency practitioners. The requirement that registered liquidators provide triennial statements to ASIC will be replaced with a requirement that a detailed statement be provided annually. This means that a liquidator’s suitability for registration will be reviewed more regularly. ASIC will be able to cancel the registration of a liquidator automatically where the liquidator becomes disqualified from managing a corporation or by reason of bankruptcy and where the liquidator does not maintain their insurance. An application will no longer need to be made to the company’s auditors and liquidators’ disciplinary board first. The board will be given more flexibility to deal with disciplinary matters. For example, it will be able to hold a prehearing conference to determine procedural matters. Small changes will be made to increase the efficiency of voluntary administration procedures. New provisions will allow administrators to sell properties subject to a lien, pledge or retention of title clause if they have written consent of the property owner or the security holder, or with leave of the court. Administrators will also be able to consent to the transfer of shares if they are satisfied that it is in the best interests of the company as a whole. The bill will allow slightly longer periods to pass before the first and second meetings of the creditors are required to be held. There will also be some slight amendments to change ‘days’ to ‘business days’, which will consequently affect the timing for things such as when notices for meetings must be given. Labor notes the consultation with stakeholders in insolvency areas, such as the Insolvency Law Advisory Group and the Insolvency Practitioners Association of Australia. As required by the Corporations Act, the amendments under this bill have also been approved by the states and territories through the Ministerial Council for Corporations. Labor supports this bill in the interests of modernising Australia’s corporate insolvency regime. We reiterate our concern that some of these changes were recommended almost 10 years ago and yet the government is acting only today to legislate. We do, however, support this as being ‘better late than never’ and support in particular the measures which protect employee entitlements upon insolvency. to thank the honourable member, Mr Bowen, for his contribution to this particular debate around the Corporations Amendment (Insolvency) Bill 2007. Well-designed insolvency laws are critical to any good-functioning economy. They are among the most basic laws that govern commercial life and are, I think, integral in ensuring that Australians can have some certainty when a company experiences some form of financial distress. In this regard, I note that Australia’s corporate insolvency laws are well regarded and essentially sound; they do not require fundamental revision. The government is therefore not proposing radical changes to the law in this bill; rather, this bill provides an integrated package of measured reforms which, together, are expected to have a significant impact on the efficiency and integrity of our corporate insolvency regime. MAIN COMMITTEE",194,Corporations Amendment Insolvency Bill 2007
202,Mr Pearce (Aston,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (11.58 am)-I would likeThis bill responds to the recommendations of a number of committees, notably the Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee and, of course, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services. Both of these committees examined areas of corporate insolvency law. The bill also, of course, responds to many suggestions for improving the law that have been made by others, including creditors, practitioners and, indeed, members of the judiciary. I would like to take this opportunity if I could to thank all of those who commented on this important bill and to note the role in particular of the Insolvency Law Advisory Group, otherwise known as ILAG, which did provide valuable and technical advice in the course of drafting this legislation. I also want to take the opportunity to note key industry stakeholders, such as the Insolvency Practitioners Association of Australia, the IPAA, who have welcomed the introduction of the bill and applauded the consultation process. They said: The IPAA believes the legislation contains major improvements in the insolvency regime. It improves the efficiency, efficacy and fairness of the process. We commend the government’s consultative process, which has produced the balanced bill. We look forward to working with the government on the next round of reforms to other areas of insolvency. The bill focuses on improving outcomes for creditors, deterring corporate misconduct, improving the regulatory framework for insolvency practitioners and finetuning the voluntary administration procedure. It also addresses public concerns about the independence of insolvency practitioners and practitioner remuneration. Key initiatives include mandating the priority of employee entitlements in deeds of company arrangement, clarifying the status and priority of the superannuation guarantee charge in insolvency and the introduction of a new statutory process for facilitating the winding-up of companies in corporate groups. The bill will also require practitioners to provide creditors with sufficient information for them to assess whether a remuneration proposal is reasonable. The report will include a summary of the main tasks to be performed by the practitioner and, of course, the costs associated with them. Pooling will permit creditors to agree or a court to make an order that the assets of two or more companies in liquidation be combined so that the liquidation of the companies can proceed together as if they were indeed one company. This important facility will allow for more streamlined administration, consolidated accounts and consolidated meetings and minutes of meetings, thereby providing scope for cost reductions and better returns to creditors. As part of the announced package of insolvency reforms, the government implemented two very important reforms in 2005-06. First, we allocated an additional $62 million over four years to improve the range of entitlements available to employees under the General Employee Entitlement and Redundancy Scheme, otherwise known as GEERS. Secondly, we also established an assetless administration fund involving expenditure of some $23 million over four years to target improper behaviour by directors in the lead-up to a company’s insolvency. The program is already delivering results. Through this bill, the government is demonstrating that it is actively working to minimise the economic and social costs that can regrettably accompany a corporation’s insolvency. Those costs may include the disruption of trade and commerce, the loss of employment, the loss of savings, damage to suppliers and customers and the expenses of the insolvency process itself. This bill demonstrates that the government remains committed as always to improvMAIN COMMITTEE ing the insolvency processes in the interests of all Australians and that we want to see the best possible results for all who may be affected by an individual company’s insolvency. I want to take this opportunity to again thank all of the stakeholders who have participated in what has been a very good example of consultation. I also want to take the opportunity to thank the officials from the Department of the Treasury for all of the very hard work and the dedicated approach that they have taken to ensure that there has been effective consultation with our stakeholders. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Second Reading Debate resumed from 28 February, on motion by Mr Nairn: That this bill be now read a second time. Amendment (Trustee Board and Other Measures) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2007 is to make consequential amendments to 30 current acts arising from the establishment of the Public Sector Superannuation Accumulation Plan on 1 July 2005, the establishment of a single entity to administer the Commonwealth superannuation schemes for Commonwealth government civilian employees, the introduction of a new regime for managing legislative instruments under the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 and changes to the earning bases for the superannuation guarantee regime from 2008. As background, the Public Sector Superannuation Accumulation Plan was established on 1 July 2005. The establishment of this plan was a direct result of the closure to new members of the defined benefits Public Sector Superannuation Scheme. As the honourable member for Cunningham and I know, defined benefits schemes have been closed to several categories of Commonwealth employees. This plan is the main Commonwealth superannuation scheme for those entering the Commonwealth Public Service from 1 July 2005. The establishment of the PSS and the PSSAP. The management of these three schemes is now undertaken by the newly formed Australian Reward Investment Alliance. This body replaced the former CSS and PSS boards. In relation to the LIA, from 1 January 2005 a regime was established to reform and manage procedures for the making, scrutiny and publication of Commonwealth legislative instruments by establishing a federal register of legislative instruments; encouraging rule-makers to undertake appropriate consultation; encouraging high standards in drafting legislative instruments to promote their legal effectiveness, clarity and intelligibility to users; providing public access to legislative instruments; establishing improved mechanisms for parliamentary scrutiny of legislative instruments; and establishing a sunset mechanism to ensure periodic review of legislative instruments and, if they no longer have a continuing purpose, to repeal them.

203,Mr Bowen (Prospect) (12.05 Pm),"The main purpose of the Superannuation LegislationThis bill changes the earnings base for the superannuation guarantee from 1 July 2008. It removes a pre-21 August 1991 lower base for SG calculations, principally in the mining industry. From1 July 2008, superannuation guarantee requirements are to be changed to simplify the earnings base of an employee for superannuation guarantee purposes. The Superannuation Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 2) Act 2004 simplifies the earnings base of an employee for SG purposes. The SG amendments already enacted but to be applied from 1 July 2008 will have the effect that all employers will calculate their SG liability against an employee’s ordinary times earnings. Various provisions will be removed from 1 July 2008 so that simpler ordinary times earnings will be the basis of calculation in all cases. Among the provisions that will be repealed are those which allow the use of a pre-21 August 1991 earnings base and earnings bases specified in industrial awards, superannuation schemes, occupational superannuation arrangements or law of the Commonwealth, state or territory. From1 July 2008, employers will still be able to use notional earnings bases specified in legislation or industrial agreements on the basis of their superannuation guarantee contributions where these are above an employee’s ordinary times earnings, but the superannuation guarantee will be assessed only against ordinary times earnings. This is largely a technical bill, which the opposition supports. Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Board and Other Measures) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2007. I am absolutely delighted to be speaking on the issue of superannuation. I say that because Australia recently celebrated the 15th anniversary of the superannuation guarantee introduced under the Hawke-Keating government in July 1992. That legislation effectively meant that all Australians are entitled to a minimum superannuation payment of nine per cent and that has effectively meant that we have changed the debate in Australia in terms of savings and the capacity of the private sector to invest, for example, in the provision of vital infrastructure. As a former President of the ACTU, I regard that as one of the greatest achievements of the Australian trade union movement, which worked in a constructive partnership with the Australian Labor Party in government from 1983 to 1996. That is not just my view and the view of the opposition; the truth is that Australia’s approach to retirement income is world leading. That is acknowledged by many other countries throughout the world. That view has also been appropriately endorsed by the World Bank since 1993, when it undertook a global study of retirement income systems and demographic factors. It concluded: Systems providing financial security for the old are under increasing strain throughout the world. Rapid demographic transitions caused by rising life expectancy and declining fertility mean that the proportion of old to young is growing rapidly. Traditional safety nets, such as community and extended family care are weakening under the weight of this growing burden. Also in peril are the formal systems, such as government backed pensions, which have proven to be both unstable and difficult to reform. The result is an impending old age crisis that threatens not only the old but also their children and grandchildren who will inevitably shoulder this burden ... Financial security for the old would be better served if governments developed three systems, or ‘pillars’ of old age security: 1) a publicly managed system with mandatory participation and the limited goal of reducing poverty among the old; 2) a privately managed, mandatory savings system; and 3) voluntary savings. That was the intent of the system developed by the federal Labor Party in government. Its groundbreaking legislation came into effect in July 1992. It is clearly about making sure that MAIN COMMITTEE",198,Pssap Meant There Were Three Commonwealth Civilian Superannuation Schemes The Css The
204,Mr Martin Ferguson (Batman) (12.09 Pm),"I rise today to speak in support of thewe look after our senior citizens in retirement and that we have a capacity for a privately managed superannuation scheme that gives them a guaranteed minimum and that requires voluntary savings over and above the guarantee of nine per cent in 1992. I compare that to the system that we inherited from the current Prime Minister when he was the Treasurer in March 1983. We discovered on coming to government in 1983 that for most people the age pension was their main source of retirement income; superannuation was largely the preserve of the wealthy or people employed in local government and state and federal public services. We also had in place a number of private superannuation schemes operated by key companies that suggested to many workers that, if they stayed with their employer for a lengthy period of time, they would get some superannuation on leaving the company or on retirement. What we discovered more and more was that in the fine print there were outs for the companies to escape their superannuation obligations. In March 1983 the Australian Labor Party in government-with Bob Hawke as the Prime Minister and Paul Keating as the Treasurer-realised that as a nation with a major demographic challenge confronting Australia’s future in the 21st century something had to be done about the fundamental issue of retirement, side-by-side with the huge challenge to Australia in building our savings base and creating a universal safety net to guarantee dignity in retirement for all Australians. In addition to that problem we had a taxation problem. That went to the fact that a substantial proportion of concessionally taxed superannuation savings was dissipated well before retirement. It was not just a question of increasing access to superannuation savings; it was also a serious question of having an overhaul of the taxation system in place that was part and parcel of the superannuation system in 1983. The facts showed that, in 1983, 40 per cent of the workforce had some superannuation cover; but, by 1991, through the partnership between the ACTU and the Australian Labor Party in government, that had grown to 72 per cent. People should not forget that the campaign to spread superannuation was resisted by many major companies in Australia, with the support of the then opposition through its various leaders. This was a campaign that they suggested was wrong for Australia. History has now shown that it was absolutely of fundamental importance to the future of retirement income in Australia, our capacity to save and also our capacity to bring forward public investment in infrastructure by a partnership with the private sector. The whole nation has benefited as a result of the initiatives commenced by the Hawke and Keating governments in March 1983. I say that because the record will show that the superannuation guarantee levy built on the achievement and laid the foundation for the income security and higher standards of living in retirement for all future generations that we rightfully expect as a nation. The fruits of the levy are being felt further today, and people my age and younger will see the benefits for decades to come. In some ways this bill continues the tradition of reform started by the Hawke and Keating governments and further enhances the administrative arrangements pertaining to superannuation. It is an ongoing, evolving system. Virtually all employees are now accumulating substantial superannuation savings to help fund their retirement income. It is also interesting to note that the industry wide superannuation funds are performing exceptionally well in terms of earnings and are also exceptionally competitive in terms of the management fees charged, including the death and disability insurance coverage provided by those schemes. Contrary to what was suggested by the current government and many employers at the time, these funds MAIN COMMITTEE are well managed. They are professionally managed. They are not union dominated. They are joint trustees of employers’ and workers’ representatives, working to achieve the best possible return for ordinary workers who have chosen to join those schemes and, in doing so, to reduce what the nation would have to invest in the old age pension to look after people in retirement in the future. It has been a win-win situation for all, despite the vigorous opposition pursued by the Howard government representatives who, prior to March 1996, were in opposition. I think it is important, because virtually all Australian workers are now accumulating substantial superannuation savings to help fund their retirement income. It is about them paying their way. The increased self-funding of retirement has enabled the Howard government, and will enable successive governments, to improve the retirement conditions for Australians who, for one reason or another, are unable to adequately fund their own retirement incomes. Having said that, let me also say that older Australians trying to make ends meet on the age pension are among the most disadvantaged in our community, and that is a fact of life today. We should also be paying close attention to the struggle that many of those people who did not have access to superannuation now confront on a day-to-day basis. For them, the welfare of the aged still remains conditional on our capacity to maintain a decent old age pension funded through our tax system at this particular point in time. Finally, can I say that self-funding of retirement has and will increase the flexibility in the Commonwealth budget, especially as our population ages, and will increase our national savings overall. We should also not forget that during the 1980s economic debate was dominated by the need to increase private savings and to close the current account deficit. Superannuation, I contend, was not only a measure to increase the benefits to people in retirement; it was also essentially about increasing national savings and thereby reducing the need to borrow from foreign sources by creating a large pool of domestic savings. As we all appreciate, today global capital is footloose. There is enormous foreign investment in Australia, but Australia’s superannuation savings are also going into projects all over the world so as to ensure that we diversify the investment basis of the various superannuation schemes operating in Australia. On that note, another milestone reached this year was the accumulation of over $1 trillion in Australia’s superannuation funds. Who would have thought we would have achieved that when, on winning government, we started this program in March 1983 when we found that retirement income in Australia was in an absolute mess. It is a major achievement and it opens up a wealth of opportunities for Australia in the 21st century. I say that because these funds will continue to be cash flow positive through to 2020, and they provide a significant opportunity for Australians to invest in their future. Governments, and the people whose taxes they collect, simply cannot afford to fund the level of infrastructure investment needed for Australia’s future economic prosperity without the private sector. For example, in November 2005, according to Ernst and Young, the eastern states of Australia needed more than $100 billion of investment in infrastructure on transport, energy and water over the next 10 years. The truth of the matter is that it is no longer a question of planning projects. The key challenge confronting governments at a state and federal level is how we bring forward the delivery and implementation of project plans. That is what is required of an alternative government, through Infrastructure Australia, working in partnership with all the different portfolios from transport and roads to communications-just to name a couple of areas that need investment at this particular point in time. MAIN COMMITTEE The superannuation funds I referred to are looking for investment opportunities overseas. They cannot find them in Australia at the moment because of tardiness at a federal level and, in some instances, at a state level in their incapacity to put these projects in place and bring forward private sector investment. The truth is that Australia’s retirement incomes are therefore being used, in some instances, to fund other countries’ economic growth. While this is a good thing, here at home we are facing a future funding shortfall of $100 billion in infrastructure investment that could increase economic growth opportunities, create training, apprenticeship and tertiary education opportunities, create jobs for our children and grandchildren, eliminate congestion in our cities and, at the same time, provide good earnings on our superannuation savings, thereby improving the capacity of people to retire with some dignity. I am assured by many that, for example, road tolls will never be accepted. The truth is that tolls developed by government in partnership with the private sector by and large deliver value for money, through more time for work, family or play, lower fuel costs, lower greenhouse emissions, less noise and air pollution, and less wear and tear on vehicles. What is required is delivery and leadership at a government level to bring forward some of this infrastructure investment in partnership with the private sector. In doing so, you deliver to the shareholders who are, effectively, ordinary workers who have chosen to select various superannuation funds in which to invest their retirement incomes. I am not just talking about the big operators, such as the Macquarie Banks and the Leightons, who are at the centre of these projects; I am also talking about the mum and dad investors saving, through superannuation or direct investment in the share market, for the future of their children and grandchildren, and for their own retirement. In the 21st century, public ownership of infrastructure assets does not have to mean public funding. Public ownership today can just as legitimately come from direct investment through the share market, through listed infrastructure funds or through superannuation as through public sector investment derived from taxes and other government fees and charges. It comes back to a capacity at a government level to lead and break through the barriers. It is something that is lacking at the Howard government level through lack of direction and strength at this particular time. It is about time we as a community realised that there is more than one form of community ownership when it comes to roads and infrastructure, including water and communications infrastructure. Community ownership of infrastructure in the modern sense is about the economic empowerment of individuals to make their own investment choices-investment decisions that, I suggest, can build the infrastructure for their children’s and grandchildren’s future and grow their retirement incomes at the same time. Just think, for example, about if we had been able to bring forward some of this infrastructure over the last five to six years in terms of our coal export opportunities. We would have earned hundreds of millions of dollars worth of additional export earnings, if we had not had the blockages in places such as Newcastle, Dalrymple Bay and Hay Point. A lack of leadership at a government level and a failure to actually bring forward the investment has deprived Australia of an even bigger economic cake and, in doing so, ripped away apprenticeship opportunities and employment opportunities in those very key regional centres of Australia. Also, that effectively means that capital is footloose. If we do not bring on these projects in Australia sooner rather than later then they are looking for investment in other countries. That MAIN COMMITTEE is why, for example, Indonesia has now overtaken Australia as the major coal-exporting nation in the world. That is why Brazil was looked to by some of these major mining companies in the past as an alternative source of supply for iron ore. I stress today that we have a responsibility at state and federal government levels, in partnership with the private sector, to bring forward some of these investment opportunities via the superannuation funds. We can no longer be tardy on this particular front. It is no longer about the extraction of taxes and spending by governments on behalf of the Australian community. This represents a real challenge. The lack of leadership on infrastructure at a Commonwealth level in recent years has meant that Australia has denied itself a wealth of economic and employment opportunities. I say in conclusion in support of the member for Prospect that, as he has already said, the main purpose of the bill before us today is to make consequential amendments to 30 current acts, arising from the establishment of the Public Sector Superannuation Accumulation Plan on 1 July 2005, the establishment of a single entity to administer the Commonwealth superannuation schemes for Commonwealth government civilian employees, the introduction of a new regime for managing legislative instruments, and, finally, changes to the earnings base of the superannuation guarantee regime from July 2008. Federal Labor support this bill, but let me say that superannuation reform must continue in Australia, regardless of which party is in government, to ensure that it seeks to achieve what we set out to achieve in March 1983-that is, secure incomes for future generations of Australian retirees and a better standard of living for the aged in our society. The superannuation guarantee legislation today is a proud achievement of Labor in government seeking to do the best thing by all Australians, rather than superannuation, as it was previously, being the preserve of the better-off in the Australian community. The 15th anniversary should not be forgotten. It is a great achievement, and Australia is better off. Today’s superannuation legislation builds on the achievements of Labor in government. I commend the bill to the House. Ms PLIBERSEK (Sydney) (12.28 pm)-As someone under the age of 40, I am amongst the first generation of people who have had access to compulsory superannuation. That contrasts markedly with the experience of my parents’ generation. My father was lucky enough to work for a company-Qantas-that was one of the first companies to give superannuation to all of its employees rather than just to upper management. But, for the majority of people in my father’s generation, superannuation is not adequate retirement income. Looking at this generation of under-40s, we ask: although we have access to compulsory superannuation, will our contributions and our employer contributions over the years actually provide an adequate retirement income? Of course, we have to acknowledge that it was the last Labor government in 1992 that designed and established the framework for the superannuation guarantee contribution. At the time there were many people on the other side of politics saying that it was a bad idea. I think time has proven that it was probably one of the greatest financial and social decisions made by the Labor government, for two reasons: because it has improved the quality of life for many people after retirement, giving them a little bit more spending power than if they had to rely on the old-age pension, and because funds under management-which the member for Batman was referring to-have given us a multi-trillion dollar pool of investment to invest in MAIN COMMITTEE both Australia and overseas. It has meant that we now have one of the largest pools of funds under management of any country in the world. That gives us enormous opportunities for investing in productive infrastructure in Australia-of course, always keeping in mind that the primary responsibility of superannuation trustees is to their members, to ensure a good return on investment. Whilever we have an ageing population, as we do now, the issue of compulsory superannuation will become more important and our assessment of the adequacy of retirement income will become a greater issue. A report was released on 2 August by the Allen Consulting Group for the Investment and Financial Services Association. The report was entitled Australian national saving revisited. That report shows that we have an ageing population and, although we have compulsory superannuation, the pool of funds that will be available in the future does not meet the needs of that population. A report by AMP at the end of July showed that 3½ million Australians will fall short in their retirement incomes. That is about a third of the workforce. The Allen report for IFSA says that there will be a savings gap of about $452 billion. That shows the magnitude of the gap that we are talking about. Financial planners estimate that retirees need about 60 per cent of their pre-retirement income to live comfortably in retirement. The current level of nine per cent compulsory employer superannuation contribution will give you that 60 per cent of earnings in retirement if you are in employment for 40 years straight. The reality, of course, is that many Australians do not have that unbroken working pattern for a variety of reasons, including unemployment and disability, but most, particularly many women, experience a broken pattern of employment because of their family responsibilities. The median amount of a baby boomer’s superannuation is $30,700 for men but only $8,000 for women, due to a number of factors, including a broken working pattern. While we have these reports showing that retirement income generally, despite compulsory superannuation, will be inadequate, the situation for women is considerably bleaker. less than $300 a week. Three-quarters of women in retirement live on less than $300 a week. That trend of the feminisation of poverty in old age will increase as our population ages. Fifty per cent of women who have either retired or will retire in the next 10 years have less than $20,000 in superannuation; 20 per cent of women who are retired or are on the verge of retiring have less than $5,000 in superannuation. These figures are alarming. By 2019, men on average will have accumulated double the superannuation that women on average will have accumulated. So we are looking at a generation where poverty will be starkly gendered. Older women will be much more likely to be living in poverty than older men. In July 2005, Dr Ross Clare of the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, in his evidence to a parliamentary inquiry into the superannuation of under 40-year-olds, said: You can do a lot of research and determine quite conclusively that on average women tend to have less entitlement to superannuation than men-or you can ask your mum. Each will give you the same answer. What alarms me even more than this trend is our lack of engagement with the trend, the unlikelihood that things will change very much in the future. So women, even young women under the age of 40 who have been contributing to superannuation for as long as they have been in paid work, face additional barriers that keep their retirement incomes lower than men. MAIN COMMITTEE They are barriers that are generally unique to women and they are the result of the superannuation guarantee contribution being predicated on a stable paid linear model of employment that does not take account of the breaks that women’s employment generally shows because of time out, particularly around childbirth but also for caring later for parents and others. I want to look a little bit more closely at some of the barriers to women’s superannuation savings. The first is obviously the pay gap. The reality is that women’s earnings over a lifetime are often substantially lower than those of men, even for women with similar qualifications and work histories. The sad truth is that we expect in a modern developed country like Australia that the pay gap between men and women’s wages will improve over time. It has been either steady or worse in recent years, and I think that is something that we need to examine very closely. On average, full-time working men are earning nearly $200 a week more than full-time working women. For the last decade, women have earned about 85 per cent of men’s wages. We forget-we think that these battles have been won and yet the figures for the difference between men and women’s wages, even in full-time employment, are substantial. If you add on to that the fact that women are much more likely to take breaks from paid work to care for children or for other family members, you see the additional problem. Child care is a particular issue. I no longer have shadow ministerial responsibility for child care, but I am still passionately interested in it. One of the main reasons that many women do not return to work within a period after having children is, if you are paying for child care for one child, two children or three children, it is just not worth your while. For some people this is a personal preference, and I applaud that personal preference. It is a wonderful thing if you are able and want to do it. Many women would like to return to work. They see that the longer they stay out of the workforce the more their lifetime earning capacity diminishes, but once they factor in the childcare costs, transport costs and so on, it is just not worth their while. We can improve that situation by improving child care. Countries that have good quality, affordable child care have much higher women’s participation rates. So it is not just about personal preference here. When women return to work after having children, they often sacrifice increased pay for greater flexibility. Again, if that is a personal choice that people make to work part time or more flexible hours that is terrific. WhatI fear is that a lot of women would love to have more responsible work, would like to have promotions and so on, but that our workplaces are not responsive enough, they are not willing enough to accommodate more flexible working patterns because they do not understand the value and the skills that parents-women-can add to the workplace. So that pay gap is a significant problem when it comes to the accumulation of superannuation savings. Another barrier is the big increase we have seen in the casualisation of work, and especially women’s work. Industries where women are concentrated have seen some of the greatest growth in casualisation. What we often see now are workers generally, but women more likely, to be cobbling together income from more than one job. There might be two, even three, part-time or casual jobs and, because the superannuation guarantee only kicks in when you are earning more than $450 a month, women who are working irregularly or casually may well be missing out because they are not eligible for employer contributions. If you are earning $400 each from three different employees, you can see how this can have an impact on women’s long-term ability to save for their superannuation. That increase MAIN COMMITTEE in casualisation has seen about a quarter of Australian workers now in casual jobs. About a third of women are employed casually. Work Choices is increasing this trend and we also see Work Choices, by driving down penalty rates and overtime as people are forced on to AWAs, has an effect on women’s ability, and in fact on everyone’s ability, to save for their superannuation. ABS data shows that women who are on AWAs and who work a standard 38-hour week on average are earning $87.40 less per week than those on collective agreements, and women on AWAs who work part-time are earning $85.10 less per week than those collective agreements. If you lose $80 a week or the equivalent moving on to an AWA, obviously your ability to put money away for superannuation is affected-not just the compulsory contribution but any capacity you have to make additional voluntary contributions. For women who choose to spend time out or are forced to spend some time out of the workforce because of their caring responsibilities, they do-or the family does-get additional support through the family tax benefit part B. That is a good thing. We want to enable people to have the broadest range of possibilities, the broadest range of options when it comes to raising their families. But that money is generally never put away for savings; it is spent on the day-to-day expenses of families, which are so high these days. Women may be able to make voluntary contributions during a period out of the workplace or their partner or husband is able to make contributions for them, but for most women the reality is that they assume that they will be able to rely on their partner’s or husband’s retirement savings. In most instances this is terrific, it is fine, but sadly in a growing number of cases where you see divorce, women who have assumed that their retirement income would be comfortable because of their husband’s superannuation find that it is not. Changes in the Family Law Act in 2002 went some of the way to addressing this by allowing superannuation to be divided like other property. But, of course, anyone who has taken action through the Family Court knows that you have to have some money up-front to perhaps get the result that you are after through litigation in this area. The other thing to consider, of course, is that women are more likely to live longer than men. That is not great news for men, I suppose-the longer they live the better. I have some of my parliamentary colleagues very worried here, haven’t I? I would not take any personal action to make that happen. It means that any retirement savings have to last much longer and they are also more likely, with older age, to experience greater health expenses and also greater retirement home or nursing home expenses. So the smaller final superannuation savings of women often have to go a lot further. There have been some measures in this area, such as superannuation contribution splitting and the tax offset, that have helped women who are in unpaid work caring for their families. The measures in the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Board and Other Measures) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2007 allow some growth in superannuation. They allow women to continue to make contributions to grow their superannuation, including by having some of their husband’s contribution transferred to their fund at the year’s end. The take-up of the superannuation co-contribution scheme introduced by the government has also been high amongst women. Indeed, Labor welcomed the announcement in this year’s budget of the doubling of the government’s co-contribution on contributions made in superannuation accounts in the last financial year. MAIN COMMITTEE All of these things are positives, but there are a number of additional things that we should investigate to truly address this problem. I think the adequacy of women’s retirement savings is one of the greatest financial and social issues that will face us over coming decades. We should look at some of the strategies that have been recommended, including through having a parliamentary inquiry by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration but also by a number of other people. We need to look at specific strategies for helping women boost their retirement incomes. We need to start with a recognition by the government that the financial information that women are receiving about superannuation needs to be specifically targeted and that their information needs are different from those of men because they need to include this information about broken working patterns and so on. I noticed that the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Women’s Issues, Julie Bishop, asked the Treasurer what proportion of the $25 million budget set aside for the Financial Literacy Foundation will be spent on women’s superannuation literacy. I was waiting for an answer; I was very interested in the answer. I think unfortunately the answer is no money. I am advised that the Treasurer’s Financial Literacy Foundation spent no specific money on programs which target women’s financial literacy in respect of their superannuation. The members of the Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration, in their inquiry into superannuation for people under 40, agreed that a lack of superannuation is one of the most pressing financial areas where women are especially prone to a lack of financial literacy. The committee recommended that the Financial Literacy Foundation with the Office for Women target specific programs to improve the financial literacy of women under the age of 40 with respect to superannuation. I do not think that has happened. We could have another look at some of the other recommendations of that committee, including helping women who are on paid maternity leave to continue to contribute to superannuation with superannuation guarantee contributions from their employer. That is one of the recommendations we should explore. The standing committee recommended that the government should have a look at the particular issue of the lack of super guarantee contributions during periods of maternity leave. (Time expired). those honourable members who contributed to the debate on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Trustee Board and Other Measures) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2007. In summing up, I will bring the debate back to what the legislation is all about rather than talk about what we have just been listening to. The main purpose of this bill is to update a range of legislation as a consequence of other legislative changes. The bill amends a number of Commonwealth acts as a consequence of the establishment of the Public Sector Superannuation Accumulation Plan, otherwise known as the PSSAP, by trust deed under the Superannuation Act 2005. The PSSAP was established on 1 July 2005 and replaced the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme, otherwise known as the PSS, as the main superannuation scheme for new Australian government employees and other office holders. The bill proposes amendments to a number of Commonwealth acts that deal with terms and conditions of employment and it includes references to the PSSAP where appropriate. The bill also amends a number of acts to reflect the consolidation of the governance arrangements for the three major superannuation schemes for Australian government employMAIN COMMITTEE",199,Pssap Meant There Were Three Commonwealth Civilian Superannuation Schemes The Css The
205,Mr Pearce (Aston,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (12.48 pm)-I thank allees. They are the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme, known as the CSS, the PSS and the PSSAP. Since1 July 2006, the Australian Reward Investment Alliance, known as ARIA, has been the trustee for the three schemes. From1 July 2008, all employers will be required to calculate their superannuation guarantee liability for an employee using the employee’s ordinary time earnings. The bill will amend the Superannuation Act 1976, which provides for the CSS, and the Superannuation (Productivity Benefit) Act 1988 as a consequence of this change. The amendments will enable minimum benefits paid under those acts to comply with the superannuation guarantee requirements following the change to the earnings base from 1 July 2008. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. Main Committee adjourned at 12.51 pm MAIN COMMITTEE Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry: Logos (Question No. 4540) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, in writing, on 14 September 2006: In respect of any change to the logo of the department and agencies that report to the Minister, (a) when was the most recent change, (b) how many such changes have taken place in the past five years, (c) what was the reason for the change, and (d) what was the total cost of the change, including (i) signage, (ii) stationery, (iii) associated advertising and (iv) website design. (a) Common branding for Australian Government departments and agencies was introduced in June 2003 and coordinated by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. (b) One. (c) The common brand was introduced to improve recognition of the many policy initiatives, programmes and financial services delivered across the Australian Government. (d) The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry does not have a consolidated detailed record of the costs involved in the change. Finance and Administration: Electricity and Water (Question No. 5212) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Finance and Administration, in writing, on 7 December 2006: (1) For each financial year since 1 July 2004, what sum has the Minister’s department spent on (a) electricity and (b) water. (2) Since1 July 2000, what measures has the department instigated to reduce electricity and water usage. swer to the honourable member’s question: (1) The Department of Finance and Administration (Finance) pays electricity and water costs for a diverse range of owned and leased properties around Australia. Payment arrangements vary depending on the circumstances, including whether Finance is the landlord and/or the tenant. (a) The total costs of electricity for Finance as a landlord were: 2004-05 $1,445,693.96 2005-06 $1,484,582.37 The total costs of electricity for Finance as a tenant were: 2004-05 $1,323,271.36 2005-06 $1,522,966.06 Finance as a tenant used more electricity in 2005-06 than in 2004-05 because machinery of government changes increased the number and size of Finance tenancies.",207,Natsem Data Shows That 73 4 Per Cent Of Women Aged 65 And Over Now Live On An Income Of

(2) Finance is both a landlord and a tenant. In both roles, Finance is seeking to monitor energy and water use more accurately, and reduce consumption as far as possible. Measures instigated since 1 July 2000 to reduce water usage include: waterless urinals systems are currently on trial; progressive installation of water flow control fittings in taps and showers; installation of dripper systems with timers for the four small irrigated courtyards; use of dual flush toilets; installation of water meters on cooling towers and data logger water meters on mains supply lines; and regular checks of storm water drains, toilets, taps and pressure relief valves on hot water systems for leaks and the routine periodic changing of seals. Measures instigated since 1 July 2000 to reduce electricity usage include: timed after hours air-conditioning activation switches; movement activated sensor lighting and computer controlled lighting; staff are encouraged to turn off monitors and log off computers daily, and shut down computers over weekends; consideration of energy efficiency when purchasing items such as whitegoods and office machines for use in Finance tenancies; and a Christmas shutdown with a flow on effect of reduction in energy consumption over that period.

Investing in Our Schools Program (Question No. 5577) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Education, Science and Training, in writing, on 21 March 2007: (1) Is she aware of a letter written to all school principals by the former Minister for Education, Science and Training stating that ‘it is anticipated that the maximum amount an individual school community will receive [under the Investing in Our Schools program] is $150,000 over the next four years’; if not, why not.",211,Questions In Writing
211,Mr Vaile,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,212,Questions In Writing
212,Mr Vaile,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(2) Has her department previously advised school principals, teachers, parents and any other members of a school community that they may (a) apply for several projects under the Investing in Our Schools program up to the $150,000 limit and (b) make such applications until the end of 2008. (3) Is she aware of schools that had budgeted on receiving a total of $150,000 under separate applications over three or four years. (4) Will she ensure that those schools identified in Part (3) that had a legitimate expectation that they would be able to apply for up to $150,000 under the Investing in Our Schools program will still be given the opportunity to do so; if so, how; if not, why not. Ms Julie Bishop-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Previous years’ Programme Guidelines have stated that the limit for funding in respect of any one school is $150,000. It has further been stated that this may comprise of a number of smaller applications. It has never been stated in any Programme Guidelines that schools may apply for projects up until the end of 2008. The broad intention of the Investing in Our Schools Programme in respect of distributing funding was to provide $700 million to assist state government school communities deliver small infrastructure projects. To this end, some 15,100 projects have already been approved to 6,166 (or over 90 percent) of state government school communities. This high demand from school communities led to the 2008 Programme year funding being brought forward into the 2006 Programme year. The Schools Assistance (Learning Together– Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Act 2004 was amended by Parliament in April 2006 to facilitate this reposition. In February 2007, the Australian Government announced a further $127 million would be made available to allow state government schools that have received grants below $100,000 or none at all to apply for funding grants. The funding limit of $100,000 as stated in the 2007 Programme Guidelines will ensure a wider distribution of this new funding. (3) Under the IOSP, school communities apply directly to the Australian Government for funding discrete, small infrastructure projects. Applications are submitted within the Programme Guidelines of each funding round and each application is assessed on its own merits in a competitive process that takes into account the relative needs and risks of each project applied for. It has always been made clear to schools that approval or non-approval for one project does not guarantee that any subsequent project in a later application round will be approved. It is a competitive grant programme. (4) See answer for Question 3, above. Education, Science and Training: Funding (Question No. 5585) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Education, Science and Training, in writing, on 22 March 2007: (1) Has she read an article titled ‘Please, sir, they want more’, which appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald on 5 September 2005; if not, why not. (2) Can she confirm that the former Minister for Education, Science and Training is quoted as telling the Channel Nine Today program that ‘We’re giving each public school $150,000 directly to the P&C to do whatever they think is appropriate with it’; if not, why not. (3) Is she aware of schools that had acted in good faith on this and other statements about the Investing in Our Schools program and planned to lodge separate applications over several years, up to a total of $150,000, to repair, replace or install school infrastructure; if so, which of these schools is in the federal electoral division of Lowe; if not, why not. (4) Can she ensure that schools which have spread out the completion of broader projects by applying for separate, smaller grants under the Investing in Our Schools program, and which have not applied for a single grant of the maximum amount of $150,000 for one individual project, will not be disadvantaged by the recent reduction in the maximum sum available to schools under the Investing in Our Schools program; if so, how; if not, why not. (5) Will she ensure that schools which had a legitimate expectation that they would be able to apply for separate grants between 2005 and 2008 to a total of $150,000 will be given the opportunity to do so; if so, how; if not, why not. Ms Julie Bishop-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) While the funding limit for any one school was nominally $150,000 over the life of the Programme, there was never enough funding available for every state government school to receive the maximum amount. Given that this is a competitive grants programme and that there are around 7,000 state government schools and the initial IOSP funding pool for these schools was $700 million, the average total grant was inherently going to be $100,000. For the 2007 Round, the funding limit was $100,000 to ensure the widest distribution of the remaining funding. (3) Under the IOSP, school communities apply directly to the Australian Government for funding discrete, small infrastructure projects. Applications are submitted within the Programme Guidelines of each funding round and each application is assessed on its own merits in a competitive process that takes into account the relative needs and risks of each project applied for. It has always been made clear to schools that approval or non-approval for one project does not guarantee that any subsequent project in a later application round will be approved. It is a competitive grants programme. (4) See answer to Question 3, above. (5) Already 90% of state government schools have been successful under the Programme. The Australian Government has decided to introduce the limit of $100,000 for state government schools to ensure the widest distribution of remaining funding can be targeted at those schools which have either not applied for funding or which have received less than $100,000 in funding. Due to the success of the IOSP, an additional $127 million has been committed to state government schools, bringing the total to $827 million for state government schools. Tourism Australia (Question No. 5592) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Small Business and Tourism, in writing, on 26 March 2007: In respect of her involvement in the “G’Day USA: America Week 2007” promotion: (a) What was the total expenditure for her participation in the trip on: (i) airfares; (ii) travel advances; (iii) accommodation; (iv) ground transport; (v) entertainment, and (vi) incidentals.

(c) What was Tourism Australia’s budget resources allocation for the program for the calendar year in: (i) 2004; (ii) 2005; (iii) 2006, and (iv) 2007. (d) What proportion of the program’s costs was recouped through cost-recovery measures, including sponsorship deals for the G’Day USA: America Week 2007 promotion? Fran Bailey-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (a) (i) Airfares$ 22,818.86 (ii) Travel Allowances $ 567.00 (iii) Accommodation $ 2,595.13 (iv) Ground Transport $ 2,128.17 (v) Entertainment Nil (vi) Incidentals Allowance $ 124.95 (b) Yes.

(d) Any cost recovery activities are conducted by the G’Day USA: Australia Week Organising Committee, and not by the individual organisations associated with the event, such as Tourism Australia. G’Day USA 2007 was a great success. Tourism Australia advises there were more than 300 million consumer contacts generated from G’Day USA, triple the previous year. Qantas achieved its second highest ever sales week during G’Day USA. In addition, I appointed Terri Irwin as Tourism Ambassador. Terri Irwin promoted Australia heavily throughout the USA, generating priceless promotion of Australia. Special Broadcasting Service (Question No. 5599) Ms Macklin asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, in writing, on 26 March 2007: (1) Does the SBS have any guidelines for encouraging Indigenous content; if so, (a) what are those details and (b) do the guidelines include targets for the amount of Indigenous content and what are those targets; if not, did the SBS formerly have any guidelines for encouraging Indigenous content. (2) How many people does the SBS employ and what number of those people are Indigenous. (3) Does the SBS have an Indigenous employment strategy; if so, what are those details. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Yes. (a) SBS has the following guidelines for encouraging Indigenous content: The SBS Charter as outlined in Section6 of the Special Broadcasting Service Act 1991 states that SBS, in performing its principal function must contribute to meeting the needs of Australia’s multicultural society, including ethnic, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. SBS Independent (SBSi) administers the Special Production Fund, funded by the Federal Government, for the development and commissioning of quality Australian projects from independent filmmakers. The SBSi principles guiding the selection of projects notes that the Special Production Fund be applied to, amongst other things, Indigenous programming. SBSi acknowledges, through its choice of projects, the on-going need to support new Australian talent (both on and off screen) from non-English speaking backgrounds, and to support program production from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island filmmakers, in alignment with the SBS Charter. SBSi expects filmmakers to be guided by the protocols described in the SBS guides “The Greater Perspective, Protocol and Guidelines for the production of Film and Television on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Communities” and “Indigenous Protocol”. (b) No. However, since the establishment of the Fund, SBSi has consistently allocated over 30% of funding to projects featuring either Indigenous themes or Indigenous creative principles. SBS provides three hours per week of Indigenous programming through its Aboriginal radio program. (2) SBS employs approximately 874 (full-time, part-time or casual) persons, of which 13 identified as being Indigenous. (3) SBS is currently in the process of developing a new Indigenous employment strategy. SBS has also recently approved the establishment of an SBS Indigenous cadetship within its News and Current Affairs Division, to begin in 2008, and is currently in discussions with universities and tertiary institutions on ways of attracting Indigenous journalism students to the SBS Cadetship.",212,Questions In Writing

(2) Can she confirm that the maximum amount available to a school under the IIOS program has changed since the conception of the program in 2005. (3) What notification of the change in the maximum funding amount was given to schools that had planned to receive the maximum funding of $150,000 over the life of the program. (4) Is she aware that schools that were approved for IIOS funding for the planning stages of future projects may not now be able to complete those projects using IIOS funds. (5) How many schools in the electoral division of Charlton are in the situation outlined in Part (4) and what is the total allocation of IIOS funding for these schools. (6) Does the allocation of public funds to projects that may not be completed or produce any tangible benefits for schools and students represent effective expenditure of taxpayers’ money. (7) Will she reinstate the original provisions of the IIOS program so that schools can complete their planned projects; if not, why not. Ms Julie Bishop-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) Under the 2007 Programme Guidelines, state government schools may apply for project grants that take their school’s total IOSP funding up to a maximum of $100,000. (2) Yes. (3) All state government school communities, regardless of their IOSP funding profile, were sent a letter from the Parliamentary Secretary shortly after the IOSP funding extension was announced, advising of the upcoming 2007 Programme. (4) It has always been made clear to schools that approval or non-approval for one project does not guarantee that any subsequent project in a later application round will be approved. The Programme Guidelines did not guarantee that all schools would receive the maximum amount. It is a competitive grant programme. (5) See answer for Question 4, above. (6) The Investing in Our Schools Programme allows school communities to decide which projects are important to their educational needs. These project applications are then assessed by an independent State-based Assessment and Advisory Panel (SAAP) comprising parents and schools principals, who rank the projects on a numerical scale and make recommendations to the Minister. The SAAP assesses each application on its own merits against key criteria such as the demonstrated education benefits of the project, as well as the capacity for the project to be completed within the budget defined in each application.

217,Mr Vaile,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Austrade (Question No. 5627) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Trade, in writing, on 29 March 2007: (1) Has Austrade contributed to the activities of Longway Industrial Development Pty Ltd and Coverdale Trading Limited; if so, (a) in which years did this occur and (b) what was the purpose of any contribution.

Child Care (Question No. 5634) Ms Macklin asked the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, in writing, on 29 March 2007: In respect of Figure 2.11, page 192 of the Department of Families, Communities Services and Indigenous Affairs Annual Report 2005-06, which shows full-time childcare gap fees as a proportion of weekly disposable income before and after the childcare benefit and the childcare tax rebate; under the modelling used to create the graph, and for each of the income ranges represented, what, in dollar terms, is: (a) the estimated average fees paid; (b) the assumed value of the childcare benefit received; and (c) the assumed value of the childcare tax rebate received. Noting that those paying full-time fees are a minority, the FaCSIA Annual Report for 2005-06 estimated the average weekly fee for each income as $236. Following the release of the 2006 Australian Government Census of Child Care Services the average weekly fee in LDC was revised to $233. The calculated Child Care Benefit and Child Care Tax Rebate are not assumptions but are the actual benefits that would be paid for each income level.",315,Questions In Writing
