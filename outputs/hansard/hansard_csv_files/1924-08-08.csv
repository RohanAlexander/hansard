In Senate's amendments). surer) [11.6] I move That the amendments be agreed to. The schedule of the amendments, which is in the hands of honourable members, seems rather formidable, but the majority of the alterations are consequential upon two or the© important ones. not been really altered since the measure was considered by this chamber. Most of the amendments were moved by the Government ^ for the express purpose of making the bill clearer, or of assisting the bank to exercise its functions as a central bank during the early stages of the re-organization. Another place decided by fourteen votes to eight to leave out the provision for the appointment of local boards, whioh was in the b ill when it left this chamber. As the alteration is not in any way vital, the Government has accepted it . The only local board which the Government contemplated -appointing immediately waa to be located in Melbourne. directors of the bank would meet? directors will meet in Sydney, where the bank has its headquarters. torate w ill now have f u l l power to exercise such functions as were proposed to be assigned to the local boards. hoped that the board of directors may see its way clear to meet in Melbourne occasionally for the purpose of coming into contact with the controlling authorities of the private banking institutions here. Although the head offices of the various private banks are distributed among the state capitals, most of them are in Sydney and Melbourne. The Senate left out the word "" l e n t "" inclause 5 and inserted "" granted,"" in order to make it quite clear that the £6,000,000, which is to be given to the bank by the Treasurer as capital, is not to be repaid. D u r in g the debate on the measure in this chamber I stated in reply to remarks by the Leader of the Opposition that the intention of the Government was that this £6,000,000 should be contributed to the bank by the Treasuryi n practically the same way as private BILL. shareholders contribute the capital of committee: (Consideration of private banking companies, the only difference being that shareholders of private institutions receive dividends on their permanent investment, and the Government will receive on this £6,000,000, only "" a rate of interest equivalent to the effective rate of interest payable by the Commonwealth on the loan raised for the purpose."" The profits of the bank are, of course, to be apportioned equally between its reserve f u n d and the The principles of the bill have National Debt Sinking Fund. The National Debt Sinking Fund w ill gradually extinguish the loan raised for the purpose of providing this £6,000,0000, and then the Commonwealth Government will be in the position of ordinary shareholders. This amendment w ill, to a large extent, meet the objections raised by honourable members of the Opposition on the manner in which the Government proposed to create the capital of the bank. It will also give a greater sense of security to depositors; though, of course, the bank would be absolutely secure in any case, for the whole Credit of the Commonwealth is behind it . Buthad this amendment not been made there might have been a fear in some quarters the board of that the bank would be obliged to repay this amount, and that that obligation would take precedence over the other liabilities of the institution, which was never The direcintended. Another important amendment relates to the appointment of the board of directors. When the bill left It is this chamber it provided that the board of directors should include(b) two persons who are or have been associated with manufacturing industries or commerce; (c) two persons who are to have been associated with agricultural, pastoral, or other primary industries; and (<i) two persons who bave a knowledge of currency and are declared by the Governor General to have 'been chosen because of that knowledge.",13,Excise On Spirit Feom Doeadilla Grapes

20,Dr. Earle Page,"The board ofThe other place deleted those sub-clauses, nnd inserted the following: (6) six other persons who are or who have been actively engaged in agriculture, commerce, finance, or industry. It w ill be noted therefore, that all reference to persons with a knowledge of currency is removed. The amendment w ill tend to reduce the danger of making in vidious distinctions in appointing the directors, and it w ill somewhat widen the scope of the Government's choice, for it gives a much more general power than did the former provision. I do not think honourable members w ill offer any objection to it . Another important amendment has relation to the control of the note issue. When the bill lef t this chamber, it contained a provision that any decision of the board which affected the Note Issue' Department of the bank should not be effective unless the directors who voted for it included two. of the following directors, namely, the Governor, the director who is the Secretary to the Treasury, and the directors appointed on account of their knowledge of currency. The amendment provides that any decision of the board respecting the note issue shall be effective if Six directors vote for it at a meeting at which all the directors are present, or five directors vote for it at a meeting from which any of the directors are absent. The Government considers that this provision contains adequate safeguards, and also removes a possible source of discord and trouble in connection with the in ternal working of the board. It w ill be realized that some such safeguard is necessary. In the Bank of France, three censors,, who have no vote in ordinary matters, must agree unanimously to any proposed alteration in the note issue before it can be effective. Another alteration made in another place will meet with the approval of the honourable memparticular. pointing the board of directors the Government should, as far as possible, give due consideration to the fair representation of the geographical divisions of the Commonwealth, has been deleted. It was thought that the provision in the bill might l i m it the clioice of directors. The deletion of the words w ill relieve the Government of the necessity of keeping geographical divisions in mind when making appointments to the directorate, and w ill enable it to appoint the best men obtainable; but uo government, in making such appointments, would disregard the claims of the various states for f a i r representation, if that could possibly be arranged. Indeed, a direction from Parliament to consider state representation may be regarded as unnecessary. There are some consequential amendments to this clause, and the following new section is proposed to be inserted after section 1 2 A : 12AA -(1. ) There shall be a.Board of Advice in London hereinafter called thc London Board. (2./ The London Board shall consist of three members to be appointed by the Governor General upon the recommendation of the Board of Directors. (3.) The members of the London Board shall, subject to this Act, hold office for four years and be eligible for re-appointment. (4.) The duties and powers of the London Board shall be such as may be delegated to it from time to time by the Board of the Bank. The amendment aims at giving the bank the benefit of the advice of financial experts in Londoni n the flotation of loans, and the transaction of other business there. The Government recommends the acceptance of the amendment as it w ill assist the bank to function efficiently. Section1 2 B is lef t out because it refers to the appointment of local boards of advice. In section 13, the words "" t h e ' LondonB o a r d "" have -been substituted for "" a local board.''"" That alteration is consequential. There is another amendment that prepares the way for words indicating how members of the board in London shall be remunerated. It"" leaves out the words, "" By way of salary at the rate of Two hundred pounds per annum,"" and substitutes "" as is fixed by the Governor General on the recommendation of the Board of Directors."" The next eight amendments The provision that, in apare entirelyconsequential ancl verbal alterations. The next I have already explained. The following amendment deals Avith the appeal board. The Senate seeks to leave out sub-section 3 of the proposed new sub-section 1 6 B , and to insert the following new sub-sections :(3.) The Board shall refer the appeal to an Appeal Board consisting of three members,",14,Commonwealth Bank
21,Ber Fo R Boothby ( Mr Duncan,"Hughes) i none of whom shall be appointed by the Board and one of whom shall be elected by the officers of the Bank in the manner prescribed, with an independent Chairman appointed by the Board. (4.) The Appeal Board shall consider any appeal referred to it under this section and shall submit its Teport thereon to the Board, which shall determine the appeal and notify the appellant of its determination, which shall be final and conclusive. That amendment amplifies and defines the rights of appeal of servants of the bank. A new elause proposed to be in serted after clause 11 makes a verbal amendment that was overlooked in the drafting of the b ill ; the word "" G o vernor"" is struck out and the word "" Board"" substituted for it . The next amendment prepares the way (for the addition of new sub-clauses to clause 16. At the end of clause 16, a proviso that was urged in this Committee by fhe honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann) and the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Manning) has been inserted. It provides that Australian notes shall not be issued to the bank without the approval of the Treasurer. That w ill give the community an assurance that the bank w ill not, without the approval of the Government, issue notes to itself to meet its necessities and the circumstances of the moment. The Government is quite certain that such an amendment w ill not in any way affect the efficiency of the bank, and therefore recommends its acceptance. has been inserted after clause 16:16A. After section 60o of the principal Act, the following section is inserted:60OA. The Board may issue Australian notes to the Bank or to other banks in Australia in exchange for money or securities lodged with the London branch of the bank. It will be noticed that the board "" may "" issue notes. The provision is not mandatory in any way. I expressly dealt with this point in my second-reading and I thought I had made it clear to every one that the bank has the power referred to. hold securities in Australian stock, British bills of exchange not exceeding 120 days against its gold. Senate is designed to make it clear to those who read as they run that the Bank Dr. Earle Page. has this power. In my speech on the second reading of the bill, I said:Consideration of these possibilities will show that the Central Bank must not be directed to provide exchange at any particular rate or to issue notes for English money, and vice versa, up to any amount which the banks or the public may apply for. Unfettered discretion must be given to the Central Bank, in order that disturbances shall beavoided as far as possible. The amendment does h o t alter the powers of the Bank, but merely defines them. There is another amendment made by the Senate that was suggested by the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory). The present act provides that the control of the note ' issue may, by proclamation, be transferred from the bank to the Treasurer. What the Government suggests is that that power should reside in Parliament, and not in the hands of the Government of the day. Shouldi t be necessary 'to restore the power of control over the note issue to the Government, the conditions would be sufficiently urgent to necessitate the calling together of Parliament to discuss, the facts. The next amendment leaves out the date "" the 31st January, 1925,"" in clause 17, and in serts "" a date to be fixed by proclamation."" The banks are willing to adjust their balances by cheques drawn on the Commonwealth Bank, but they point out that their present clearing house arrangements are such that it may not be possible for them to make the necessary alterations The following new clause by the 31at January, 1925. If the date is fixed by proclamation, they w ill be able to effect the reform before the date is proclaimed.. alteration w ill be postponed indefinitely? vernment w ill get busy as soon as the bank commences to function as a central bank. In sub-section 7 of the proposed new section 60AD, it is desired to insert after the word "" public "" the words "" and speech, allows interest thereon."" The sub-section -reads(7.) In this section the word -""-Bank"" means a person or corporation carrying on the The Notes Board has the right to business of banking, and includes any person Government or corporation which receives deposits from the Government stock, and public, and which is proclaimed by the Go-vernor-General to be a bank for the purposes of this section.

The amendment will avoid any possibility of vexation to such companies, which are further safeguarded by the power given to the Governor General to proclaim what are banks for tbe purpose of the section. A co-operative society that pays interest would not be proclaimed, but some means must be provided to make certain of getting statistics from those institutions that should supply them. The last amendment of the Senate deletes from clause 18 the proposed new section inserted by the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney), and accepted by the Government. The proposed new section refers to the relations between the bank and its architects. The Senate felt that it was too small a provision 'to make in the bill, and would give an instruction to the directors in a . matter that should be lef t to"" their own judgment. amendment is not of importance that we should risk on it a conflict between the two Houses. I have taken this course of placing the whole of the amendments before the committee in globo because few of them are important, and many are merely consequential. Honourable members w ill have an opportunity of saying whether they prefer to discuss the whole of the amendments at once, or to deal seriatim w i th the more important. The bill contains eighteen clauses, and the Senate has made no fewer than 33 amendments which have absolutely recast it . Yet we are coolly asked to deal w i th the whole of those amendments on one motion. ford) -As some of the amendments are likely to be discussed, I shall put them seriatim. "" Treasurer should postpone the consideration of all the amendments u n t i l the next meeting of the House. Senate's amendment to clause 4 agreed to. Clause 5Section9 of the principal act is repealed, and the following section inserted in its stead:""9 -(1. ) The capital of the bank shall be Ten million pounds, consisting of the following:(6) Such sum not exceeding Six million pounds as is lent to the bank by the Commonwealth from moneys borrowed by the Commonwealth in pursuance of this act; and Senate's Amendment -Leave out "" lent"" in paragraph (6), and insert "" granted '>. posedThat the amendment be agreed to. -The Treasurer has stated that the money to be furnished to the Commonwealth Bank by the Treasury w ill be similar to.a subscription of capital to a limited liability company, and the Commonwealth as a shareholder in the bank w ill Teceive interest at the bank's current rate. The proposed amendment is a The mere side-stepping of the issue.. The such vital money advanced by the Treasury is to be merely a 'loan on which the bank w ill have to pay interest, and there is no analogy between such a loan, or grant, or whatever it may be called, and the contribution of the capital to a limited liability company, the shareholders of which may, or may not, receive profits. The profits of the bank should first be utilized to liquidate its indebtedness to the Treasury. The Senate has practically recast the b ill , and one feels entitled to ask for an opportunity to make another second-reading speech upon it . The majority of the amendments have been made in the interests of the associated banks, at the instance of their champion, Senator Greene. He admitted that he was in constant touch w it h representatives of the associated banks. While the bill, as it lef t this chamber, was well designed to serve the interests of the money trusts, it is calculated to do so infinitely more effectively since SenatorI suggest that the Greene has made his mark upon it . I protest against 'the Government placing an almost new bill before the committee, and suggesting that it should be accepted in globo. Such procedure is not -in the best interests of the country. This is the first occasion in my experience of parliamentary Ufe on which a government has tamely accepted radical alterations made in a b ill by the Senate. The explanation is that this measure is drafted in the interests of the money trust.",16,Commonwealth Bank

The measure was rushed through this chamber with the aid of the guillotine, and for several days afterwards lay dormant. Wheni t reached the Senate some persons, armed with a certain amount of information, and with perhaps more knowledge than the Government possessed, set about altering the b ill to meet the wishes of the financial interests which support the Government. The Treasurer would be wise to agree to postpone this discussion in order to give honourable members an opportunity to study the effect of the amendments. It is indecent to ask the committee on Friday morning to hurriedly agree to 33 amendments of vital importance to Australia. The Treasurer has not attempted to explain the effects of the amendment to clause 5. What difference is made by the substitution of ' ' granted "" for "" lent ""? I understand a grant to be in the nature of a g if t , and a loan to imply an obligation to repay. Is money to be granted by the Treasury to the bank to be used as the directors think fit, and without any obligation to repay ? A loan is usually conditioned in regard to the application of the money and the period of repayment. Instead of granting money to the bank, would it not be better to merely lend capital to it , so that as it prospered it may be able to repay the Treasury, and rely upon.its own resources? The clause, &s amended by the Senate, means that £6,000,000 is to be granted by the Treasury to the Commonwealth Bank. I doubt if even a legal member of the committee can explain what is meant by the word ""-granted "" as it is employed in this clause. An y amendment proposed in this Parliament by a member of the legal profession is usually to benefit in terests other than those of the general public. There is no doubt that the effect of this amendment w ill be to benefit those who, under the bill, w ill come into close association with the Commonwealth Bank.

If the period were fixed at, say, twenty years, the bank would be responsible for the return' of the money borrowed at the end of that period.

Paragraph b of proposed new section 9, clause 5, as amended, readsSuch sura not exceeding £6,000,000 as is granted to the bank by the Commonwealth from moneys Iborrowed by the Commonwealth in pursuance of this act. Sub-clause 4 of proposed new section 10 has been amended to provide that the bank -shall pay interest on the grants made to it by the Commonwealth. The original word was "" loans "" and not "" grants."" Webster's definition of "" lend "" isTo allow tlie custody and use of, on conditain Customs duties . . . to a single year. tion of the return of the same; to grant the temporary use of; to allow the possession and use of, on condition of the return of an equivalent in kind; as, to lend money or some article of food. From that definition it is evident that this money has to be returned at some future period. The clause as originally drafted would have given the Commonwealth Bank an opportunity to return the money whenever possible. The following is the definition of the word ""grant,"" using the substantive and not the verb:The act of granting; a bestowing or conferpresentative assembly, &c. Also in Law to ring; concession; allowance; the yielding or admission of something in dispute; the thing or property granted; a gift; a boon. There is certainly a distinct difference between the two words. Under the amendment the Government w ill make to the bank a g if t of £6,000,000 for which it must pay interest at the rate equivalent to the effective rate of interest -payable by the Commonwealth on the loan raised for the purpose. This is not the right procedure to follow. The clause should stand as originally drafted. A loan to the bank implies that the money, or an equivalent, has to be returned at some future period. money as a loan, but a grant is not a loan. As I think that the word "" g r a n t "" would be incorrectly used in this clause, I cannot support the amendment. [12.1] -Sinc e honourable members have raised this discussion on the meaning of the words "" lend "" and "" grant,"" I should like to give some details from Murray as to the meaning of the word ""grant."" I am not confident that the use of the word "" granted "" in this connection is correct, though it is probable that in the circumstances its use is preferable to the use of the word ""lent."" I doubt whether it is possibleto make a grant which is subject to the payment of interest. Murray gives as his third definition of the word "" grant. "" An authoritative bestowal or conferment of a privilege, right, or possession; a gift or assignment of money, &c, by the act of an administrative body or of a person in control of a fund or the like. He gives an example of the use of the word in Green's Short History -of the English People as follows:The Commons restricted their grant of cerAccording to Murray, in law, the word "" grant "" meansA conveyance by deed or other written instrument(b) Formerly in more restricted application.

40,Mr West (East Sydney) [ 1 2 . 4 ],"Imay have an opportunity to say what he knows about the matter, and to explain why the substitution of ""granted"" for "" l e n t "" is proposed. I do not see any reason why we should not agree to the substitution of the word ""granted"" for the word ""lent."" It seems to me that in the main what the honourable Hughes) has said is correct. If we accept the suggestion of another place, and substitute "" granted "" for "" lent,"" we shall conditions, for instance, that the State be giving a meaning to the word "" grant"" which has not yet been accepted by the best, authorities. But that the Government is proposing to give to the word "" grant"" a new meaning, which up to the present has not been acknowledged, is no reason why we should' not accept the amendment, because Ministers have done many things unique in the history of government, and we expect them to do more. There is no reason why they should not coin a new meaning for an old word. I know that the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) whilst going through his academic 'course in the Sydney University gave some very excellent; if unique, translations of phrases in other languages, and there is no reason why, having added to the accepted meaning of words in foreign tongues,' he should not give to words of the English language meanings which ! have not up to the present been identified with them. For this reason I accept the amendment. word ""granted"" or the word ""lent,"" as originally proposed, provided we do not make any alteration in the conditions of the ""grant "" or "" loan,"" we shall make no alteration in the bill. We therefore need not quibble over the substitution of one word for another. The interpretation of the bill will depend upon the conditions, and not upon the use of a particular word in this case. Possibly the time may come when My/tray, or some such authority; having seen the word ""grant"" used in this connection will accept the use of the hew meaning now proposed to be given to it, and will quote the Treasurer as his authority. surer) [12.8] -The amendment of the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr produced the word ""lent."" After the West),, being a direct negative of the motion, is out of order; the proper course for him to take is to vote against the motion. The use of the word "" granted "" in this connection has been adopted for a special reason. Despite the remarks of my old schoolmaster, the honourable memwhether the use of the word in this connection is correct or not, the word has been so used before by this House. It was so used in connection with the grant of £500,000 for main-road development. That was a grant made on certain Governments should contribute £1 for £1 to the purpose for which it was made. We have made certain grants of money for the relief of unemployment, and granted loans on which interest has to be paid. The money which, under this Bill, it is proposed to allot to the Commonwealth Bank will be a grant under certain conditions. As I explained when introducing the Bill, it will be a grant to the bank as perpetual capital, but interest will have to be paid on it at the-rate at which the Commonwealth borrows the money for the purpose of making the grant. Every one wishes to see the Commonwealth Bank increase in credit, reputation, and prestige, and the main reason for the substitution of "" granted "" for' "" lent"" is to remove beyond possibility any doubt which might arise in the public mind that the Commonwealth Government would have priority in a claim for this money Whether we use the over bank depositors. The public must feel that they will be in a preferential position if they deposit their money with the bank. For this reason, in the interests of the bank itself, the quibble regarding the use of the word ""granted"" should not be pressed. Even though the use of the word ""granted"" in this connection may not be entirely in accord with the opinion of authorities upon English, I think the amendment should be accepted. should not have risen if the word "" quibble "" had not been used.

EARLE PAGE -He w ill not do that. grave doubts about that, and I am sure the doubts of the honourable member for Richmond( Mr R. Green) are graver still By his meek acceptance of these amendments the Treasurer practically admits that a member of another place knows more about banking than do Ministers and the Treasury oflicials. The gentleman responsible for these amendments desired to embarrass the Treasurer rather than to assist the Commonwealth Bank, for it cannot be contended that they are calculated to promote the welfare of the institution. No honourable member will deny that the amendment now before the committee is infinitely worse than the original clause, bad though it was. be represented on the board. will bo no representation of the masses, who are the mainstay of a people's bank. The Government's acceptance of this amendment lends colour to the statement that the real desire of -Ministers is to hamstring the bank. The Government desires the Commonwealth Bank to be a bankers' bank only, and, therefore, it offers no protest against an amendment which makes possible the appointment of a board wholly representative of private banking institutions. Tho amendment is most dangerous. It is said that the directors are to receive about £ 5 0 per sitting on one day in the month, and they may do something which will bolster up their private interests to the infinite detriment of the Commonwealth Bank. I have a shrewd suspicion that the Government has already decided' who the directors shall be. John Higgins and Mr Edmund Jowett have been mentioned, and it is to be expected of the present Government that it will appoint only representatives of the wealthy classes. We may be certain that no working farmer will get a seat on the board; yet, a practical farmer making a living -from a small area would have a better idea of finance than would some wealthy squatter who was rich merely by inheritance. It is quite possible that the majorit y of 'these directors w ill know very little about finance. The Treasurer would not call in a barrister to set a broken l i m b; yet he is prepared to entrust the control of the bank's finances to men who are not qualified financiers. I have The desire of the Labour party was to have a board of three permanent directors who were f u l l y qualified by m a n j years' experience of banking. The only men who will be able to administer the affairs of the bank successfully w ill be those who have given many years of study to the involved problems of finance. The amendment makes it possible for the directorate to consist of men having interests in private banking institutions and engaged in ordinary commerce, which does not necessarily give a knowledge of finance. MrM . CAMERON -It is not likely that unqualified men w i ll be appointed. it is possible, and if the honourable member does not wish that to be done he The workers are not to should assist to have his ideas expressed in the bill.

An y young person desiring to become a doctor or a lawyer must spend years of study to fit himself for such an occupation. The intricacies of banking are just as great as those of the medical or legal profession. Yet under the amendment it is possible that men not qualified for the position may be appointed to the board of directors. An y road now open to such appointments should be effectively closed. wanted to put a farmer on the board. say that.

It is only fair to the bank and to the people of this country that all possibility of unjustified appointments should be removed. assurance should be given by the Government that the appointees shall be persons with banking and financial experience, wholly employed in the service of the bank, and free from outside influence. If a representative of any great section of the community is appointed, he will act more in the interests of those whom he serves than in the interests of the Commonwealth Bank and of the people of this country. It would be intolerable to have such men controlling the bank. If the bill, as amended by the Senate, is passed by this committee, the door will be open for the operation of outside influences.

The Senate's amendment has broadened considerably the scope of the bill, because the Government will now have the power to reject any person ""whom it thinks is unfitted for the position. Government will use that power sanely and reasonably. The honourable .member for Hume has said that a director -of the bank should have had special training in hanking. He has reminded us that members of the legal and medical professions require special training. If we were dealing with the appointment of the manager of the Commonwealth Bank, there would be a good deal of force in the honourable member's contention. To propose that the iGovernor of this .bank should be a man without years of banking training would be absurd.

In that respect, I think the Senate's amendment is wrong.

The original provision for the directorate was in my -opinion better than that now proposed, because it afforded less scope for a. departure from sound principles. The Senate's amendment camouflages the position because, while apparently the clause as amended by the Senate is intended to -convey the same idea as the clause as -originally introduced, it really does not -do so, in that it leaves so much latitude to those who w ill have in their hands the appointment of the directorate.

I said that the demands with regard to currency, whichhave been the crux of the whole difficulty, have come not from the Commonwealth Bank, but from private banks;, and have been prompted as much by the immediate business requirementsof the banks as by sound currency considerations. That is why I am opposed to the elimination from the directorate of the Commonwealth Bank of the mem who have, inmy opinion up to the present, beenstanding firmly and wisely against the pressure brought to. bear upon them. I believe those men, against great opposition and great pres1 sure, have been acting in the interests of the country. It w ill bevery much to be regretted if they are eliminated from the directorate. There is, in my opinion, nothing to be gained by accepting the Senate's amendment in this case.

The value of a man's opinion on any subject depends largely upon what he knows of it . An ignorant man is not qualified to decide who is an expert. Although a treasurer may not be an expert in currency affairs he has sources of in interests that will be represented on the formation available which should make him capable of reaching an honest and honourable decision on them. Certainly he would be far less liable to error than the man in th© street who had no such advice available. There are men in the community who have made currency matters thestudy of their lives, and I can see no reason why they should not be represented on the Commonwealth Bank directorate. Honourable members of another place agree with us that the board of directors of the Bank should be representative of various interests in the community, but whereas we determined the proportion in which such interests should be represented they are willing to leave' that matter to the discretion of the Government. I consider that it would be in the interests of the. bank for honorridiculed the statement of the honourable able members to determine that at least the great producing interests of the community should be somewhat evenly represented. For the reasons given I shall oppose both the motion and the amendment. As the honourable member for Perth( Mr. Mann) has said, it is not difficult to infer that the associated Senator Greene, took a hand in the framing of the amendments inserted in this bill in another place. opinion, to"" make the alteration that the Minister now proposes to accept will be to remove still another provision which in some measure safeguards the public in terests. I am glad that the honourable member for Perth intends to oppose the motion,, but I am sorry that he cannot accept the amendment moved by the honourable member for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney). If the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Manning), and the honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann) vote in accord with their speeches we shall at least be sure of two more votes to prevent the directorate of the bank being excluI t should be just as sively representative of 'the associated banks and th© financial institutions of the country. I regret that the honourable member for Macquarie suggested that the amendment was moved to waste the time of the committee. This measure would have justified consideration for three months, and Parliament should have had the opportunity to give adequate consideration to it . I am suspicious that if the motion is agreed to the only board of directors of the bank will be those of the big insurance companies and the associated banks. If that should be so, the bank would not be operated in the interests of the people. H o w can we reasonably expect men who are deeply concerned in the prosperity of the private banks to promote the interests of an institution which is diametrically opposed to them? Common sense forbids such a conclusion. The honourable gentleman who moved, in another place, for the insertion of the provision which the Treasurer now asks us to accept, prejudiced his own case by stating-and I speak on the author it y of press reports-that he was in daily contact with private financial institutions. The .honourable member for Macquarie member for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney) that workers could have a sound knowledge of financial affairs. It is quite evident that he has never heard of, or else has given no consideration to, the reasons for the huge success of the workmen's banks in America. Those institutions were established on small capital, and are flourishing under the control of banks, through working men.

Not only have they used the hours of daylight, but they have frequently burned the midnight oil to devise ways and means of squeezing a little more profit out of their business, or of extorting a little higher rate of interest from the people to whom they lend money. institution is not profit, but service. That of our wasting time considering this bill is the line of demarcation between a private and a government concern. One is operated for profit, and the other for service. The great captains of industry and the prominent financiers of the country are totally unfitted to evolve a progressive policy of national service, for they have been all their lives concerned with earning profits for private persons. Some honourable members opposite were amused at the statement of the honourable member for Hume that a working farmer might have an even better knowledge of finance than a big squatter. the financial and currency problems about which honourable members opposite talk so glibly are only difficult to understand because of the stupid language which people use in talking about them The principles of finance are not so intricate as the general public is led to believe. Farmers who have to work hard to pay the heavy in terest which the banking institutions demand from them are generally possessed of a sounder knowledge of finance than big squatter? who have inherited all their wealth and have never done a day's work in their lives. I suppose the Government would consider a wealthy man to be a currency expert. Perhaps it would even go so far as to say that the mad American millionaire, of whom we read in the press a few days ago, was a currency expert. gives no consideration to how a man obtains his wealth. inherited from the buccaneers of the years gone by, or obtained by the sweating of the employees in an industrial undertaking, or at any rate by many of the questionable practices which big business adopts. The fact that certain individuals arc wealthy is no guarantee whatever that they are currency experts. I have said on every occasion when a bill has been brought before us for the appointment of men to such positions as these, that the Government should announce their names. The Treasurer may [H9 ] tell me that it is not the practice, but I do not care whether there is a precedent for it or not. It is time we broke away from x some of the precedents that have enslaved us in the past. The honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) rightly interjected that the success or failure of the bank would depend entirely upon the men The chief aim of a national appointed to the board. What is the use when we cannot say a word on the appointment of the members of the board, upon the choice of whom success or failure depends ? before the bill is passed who will be appointed. member any doubt that the bill will be passed? His interjection is only a legal quibble. In any case, the Government could give the committee a guarantee that the names of the persons intended to be apMany of pointed would be submitted to Parliament for ratification. It is said that we should not mention names, but a lot of speculating has been going on outside Parliament. The name of Sir John Higgins has been repeatedly mentioned in certain circles, and, if we searched the Commonwealth, I do not suppose we could find a man less fitted for the job. I wonder whether he will lose his memory when he gets on the board ? Men with such commercial records as his ought not to be appointed to the board; they are eminently unfitted for such work. I question whether we could find one representative of big financial and commercial interests that is fitted for this job. Such men cannot view the business from the right angle, because their environment and the associations of their lifetime have unfitted them for the Apparently, it work. It may have been successful ? that these men can only regard institutions like banks as means for squeezing out profits. The first function of a national institution like the Commonwealth Bank is to render service to the nation. The difference between profit and service is very great.

108,Motion By Mr Bbuce ) Read A First T I M E .,"The following paper was presented : Lands Acquisition Act-Land acquired at South Launceston, Tasmania-Fo r Postal purposes. ter) [4.7] I desire to inform the House that His Excellency the Governor General has approved of the appointment of the honourable member for Echuca( MrH ill ) as Minister for Works and Railways. As honourable members are aware, MrH ill is now on his way to South Africa with the Commonwealth parliamentary delegation, and a few weeks must necessarily elapse before he returns to Melbourne. In the meantime, the Department of Works and Railways will be administered by the Minister for Home and Territories (Senator Pearce). I was desirous of obtaining the services of Senator Wilson, but he is so closely engaged with the problems of immigration and the overseas marketing of Australia's surplus products, that it was impossible for h i m to undertake the work. He will, however, render such assistance as he can give to Senator Pearce. ter) [4.8] I move That the House do now adjourn. Parliament has now been sitting tor a considerable time, and, although I think it will meet the convenience of honourable members if no action is taken to add to the number of sitting days next week, the Government intend, as tbere is a great deal of business to be done, to ask the House to sit on Tuesday in the following weeks of the session. under the impression that the quantity of work that the Government expects Parliament to transact was so small that we might easily have adjourned earlier, to escape the influenza epidemic. the work remaining is voluminous, no days will be too many, and no time too long to devote to the legislative duties required of us by the country. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 4.10 p.m. Buti f",33,Paibs
