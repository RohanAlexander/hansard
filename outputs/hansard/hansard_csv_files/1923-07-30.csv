11,Mr Atkinson,"The reason is that, consulted with the lessees of the greatthebackward condition of the Territory, which includes large areas of high-class pastoral land held under leases which still have from eighteen to twenty-one years to run, and will look impartially f at all the circumstances, they will admit that the proposed Ordinance represents a common-sense attempt to encourage settlement. The Goverument intends, after the Ordinance has been approved, to provide better transport facilities. Every one seems to be satisfied that the Territory is worth developing, and that there are large tracts of land there which, with proper treatment, will yield a rich harvest. accepted responsibility for developing the Territory, and must do its best to discharge that obligation by attracting a white population to this now empty portion of Australia. By doing that, we 1 shall materially assist in the prosperity and the defence of the whole continent. Some military experts say that if an army were landed in the Northern Territory, it would not be able to inflict any damage upon the rest of the country. I do Dot pose as a military expert, but there are other military experts, 'and they are men of good standing, who oppose that view, and hold that if a strong mobile force were landed in the Territory, it would be very difficult for Australia to expel it. It would apparently not be difficult for an army, once landed at Port Darwin, to travel to Newcastle Waters. That seems to be an easy ^country for motor traffic. For six or seven months in the year the weather is dry, and during that period the more the roads are used the better they become. that it would be impossible for an army to land in the Northern Territory and travel overland to the south of the continent. one thing, and some another. to me that a mobile force could make its way to Newcastle Waters without much difficulty. food available on the route. The residents would probably not be able to muster their cattle in time to get out of the way of the advancing army, which, if it was in the country for long, could plant much of the coastal area with rice. [68] to give a hostile army an opportunity to attempt to cross the continent. better than cure. The Territory is admittedly in a backward condition. The principal reason for this appears to be want of transport facilities, and not climatic conditions or poverty of soil. After having observed what previous Governments have attempted to do in the Territory, the present Government has come to the conclusion that the first essential is to develop it along the lines followed in the rest of Australia. That The Commonwealth has is to say, pastoral development must come first. Most of the land of Australia was settled first by pastoralists, and was divided later into smaller holdings, and later still into closer settlement blocks. think that more could be done by assisting mining prospectors than by providing for land settlement? to say. It is no good talking of mining or any other industry in the Territory, while transport facilities are lacking. If we provide for the development of the land, mines may be opened and give an extra fillip to progress, as they have done in other parts of Australia. Experiments have been tried from time to time in the Territory, but the results of them have not come up to expectations. The parts of the Territory of which we know most-the Barkly Tablelands and the Victoria River country-ar e used only for cattle. The Government want to alter that state of affairs and make the Territory, if possible, a sheep country. That is the first and most natural step to take, and it is the one that is most likely to succeed. When the Ordinance has been passed, the Government intend to provide telegraphic, railway, and shipping facilities. In this great Territory there apI t seems pear to be two distinct classes.of land. If a line be drawn from the Queensland border to Western Australia, the land to There would be plenty of the north of it is coastal, and more or less low-lying.

The rainfall in those areas is regular and reliable, even in seasons when other portions of Australia to the east and west are not getting their usual rainfall. That factor alone supports the argument that this country is capable of development, if provided with proper means of communication. As one proceeds southward th© rainfall diminishes, but I understand that in the Alice Springs district, and even in the Macdonnell Ranges, there is a good rainfall, although not so reliable as in the belt further north to which I have just referred.

No sensible man will attempt to raise sheep in an area where that pest is prevalent. wealth offered to hand the Territory back to South Australia ? any such offer having been made to South Australia. Sheep could be run in the Territory only with the protection of dog-proof fencing, and the costs of the material, transport, and labour are prohibitive. The Northern Territory is poorly limbered; consequently, all timber required for fencing or building has to be transported considerable distances. These difficulties of transport explain why the various holdings have not been developed to any great extent. The distance from Darwin to Emungalan is 200 miles, and to Newcastle Waters, 400 miles. Prom the railhead goods have to be carted by donkeys, camels, or horses. If goods are shipped to Burketown the difficulties of handling are equally great. The port is a poor one, and ships have to lie 8 or 9 miles out from the shore. If rough weather blows up they have to weigh anchor and go further out to sea u n t i l the weather moderates. Prom the roadstead the goods have to be lightered-ashore, and then must be transported great distances by donkeys and camels. The people living in the southern part of the Territory get their goods from Oodnadatta over very poor roads, whilst residents in the Victoria River district obtain their supplies from either Katherine or Wynd-would be the ham, in Western Australia. B y either route the cost of transport is Ifeavy. I am told that the transport is frequently It would include 2s. 9d. per ton per mile, and that by the time the goods Eire delivered at the homestead from £ 2 5 to £ 4 0 per ton has been added to their original cost. The Government propose to overcome some of these difficulties by building railways. bad start last week. member for the Northern Territory ( Mr. Nelson) informed us that an extension of 100 miles from Daly Waters toNewcastle Waters will tap the Barkly Tablelands, and give considerable relief to the people living in one of the best portions of the Territory. Not only are goods costly to transport, but they must be ordered in large quantities, and from the time the order is placed the settler may have to wait five or six months for delivery. The Government are anxious to the .Commonremove that disability, and this Ordinance is a step in the righ t direction. Eveni f it were possible to raise sheep in I am not aware of the Territory there would be almost in superable difficulties in carting the wool 4 to the coast. Therefore, cattle-raising seems the only form of pastoralism that is practicable at the present time. Cattle will forage further from the waterholes than will sheep, and, moreover, they have not to be shifted from area to area so often. But even for cattle-raising the settler must provide water supplies, and boring is very expensive. N ot only is the transport of material costly, but the prices of labour and material are very high. I am told that the fuel required to operate an engine for boring and pumping costs from £ 8 to £12. per week. The conversion of the country from cattleraising to sheep-growing will not be easy, but the Government hope to be able to do it , and I am satisfied that they are taking the right steps to that end. A large expenditure w ill be necessary to -fit the Territory for the carrying of stock, especially sheep. The facilities for shipping at Darwin and at Burketown are totally inadequate.

The manager of Avon Downs Station, who has had wide experience, is satisfied that it would he a great sheep country if proper means of protection for the sheep were provided, and a sufficient number of bores were put down. Apparently, water is very easily obtained, and it is invariably of good quality. The cattle men are experiencing anything but a good time, the small men particularly being in a precarious position. If the present conditions continue much longer, many of the smaller men will probably have to leave their selections. Both the Barkly Tablelands and the ""Victoria River country, we are assured, are excellent for sheep. If we can convert the Territory from a cattle to a sheep-raising country, beneficent results will follow. In Western Queensland there are thriving country towns, such as Winton and Longreach, which are dependent solely on the sheep and cattle industry. If the Territory can be developed in the same manner, and the pastoralists become satisfied with their lot, there is no reason why similar towns should not spring up there. Population undoubtedly would be attracted, and the prospector would have a better chance than he has to-day of unearthing the mineral wealth of the country. To enable the Territory to advance, it must be treated as other parts of Australia have been treated. The Government intend providing proper means of telegraph and other communication in addition to harbour and shipping facilities. what the result will be of the proposed extension of the railway from Newcastle Waters to the Pellew Islands? Even though the line cannot be taken as far as the McArthur River, if it is constructed as far as Borroloola, leaving (he produce to be lightered to Pellew islands, or wherever the harbour is situated, it will be an excellent thing, besquare mile; for the second period cause it will mean the tapping of thc Barkly Tablelands country, and it will provide an outlet superior to anything that exists to-day. That is one of the proposals that the Government are now considering. If it is found to be practicable, it will not be long before a Bill will be brought before the House giving effect to it. If the Commonwealth is to stand up to its responsibilities steps will have to be taken as soon as possible to provide better means of communication. I am satisfied that if that is done, this country will have such a chance as it has never had before. The Government intend to promulgate a special Ordinance dealing with agricultural and town lands as soon as possible. Before that can be done, however, the Northern Territory Administration Act will have to be amended; otherwise the Government would not be able to grant any tenure except leasehold, and it is the intention of the Government to place itself in the position to grant freehold tenure. An important matter, which' was touched on during a previous debate, is the accommodation provided for employees. While many land-holders appear to have made the necessary provision, some are deficient in their provision. That is to be remedied under the operation of a special Ordinance. To understand the position of the Territory, we must study the land laws relating to it. Before dealing with the South Australian Acts, I desire to remind honourable members that ""the Northern Territory Acceptance Act compels the Government to recognise the conditions that existed at the time the Territory was taken over. To make himself acquainted with those provisions, one has to look at the Acts of the South Australian Parliament. South Australia acquired the Northern Territory as far back as 1863. The first Act which has a direct bearing on the Ordinance, and which affects the position as it exists to-day, was passed by the South Australian Parliament in 1890, in an endeavour to revive the pastoral industry of the Northern Territory by liberalizing its land laws. Under the Act of 1890, it was provided that leases could be granted for periods not exceeding forty-two years, and that the rentals should be: For. the first period of seven years, not less than 6d. per of seven years, not less than Is. per square mile; for the third period of seven years, 2s. per square mile; and for the remainder of the term, on a valuation approved by the Minister, irrespective of the improvements effected by the lessee. At that period conditions",16,Northern Territory Crown Northern Territory When The Honourable Lands Bill Second Reading
24,Mr Yates,Oan the Minister tell us,17,Northern Territory Crown Northern Territory When The Honourable Lands Bill Second Reading
25,"Mr Atkinson""","I am unable to say.concerning improvements were not imposed; but stocking conditions were iusisted upon. A person taking up a pastoral lease under the Act of 1890 was expected to carry one head of cattle or five head of sheep per square mile during the first three years of his lease, and before the end of the seventh year and up to the expiry of his lease two head of cattle or ten head of sheep per square mile. the power to resume for public or mineral purposes, and the land resumed for public purposes was to be used only for railways, post-offices, and such other public services. under that Act for public purposes the lessee was compensated for his improvements, and for any loss he had incurred. A lessee could also surrender his lease for a new lease, in which case he could obtain an additional fourteen years' tenancy. which has a bearing on the Ordinance was passed in 1896, wherein it was provided thatThe rent to be fixed by valuation for the remainder of the term of the lease shall not be more than 50 per cent, above or below the rent payable during the last year of the third period of seven years. Under the Act of 1899, which has a direct bearing on the conditions as they exist to-day, a section in the Act of 1890 concerning the granting of pastoral leases and fixing the term was repealed and this provision term of any pastoral .lease shall not exceed forty-two years."" the first period of twenty-one years were fixed as they had been in the 1890 Act, but for the balance of the term the rent was not fixed by the Minister, but by two arbitrators, one of whom was appointed by the Government and one bj the lessee. Under the 1896 Act the rent fixed was not to be 50 per cent, above or below that payable during the twentyfirst year, and powers of resumption for special purposes were allowed. lessee, if he desired, could within three years of the passing of the Act surrender his lease and obtain a new lease for a period of forty-two years at a rental to be agreed upon by the Minister and the lessee. . In 1901 an Act curtailing the powers of resumption which existed under the Acts of 1890 and 1899 was passed; Mr Atkinson. and in that Act it was provided that the Government could resume land for public purposes on giving three months' notice, or for agricultural or other purposes on giving two years'notice. If honourable members will refer to the South Australian legislation they will see that the whole of the Northern Territory was treated by the South Australian Parliament as if it were of the same producing The Act of 1890 also contained capacity in different districts. No allowance was made for the difference in the quality of the' soil or the carrying capacity of the land, and consequently the same rents and stocking conditions When land was resumed applied all over the Territory. In. these circumstances, many anomalies have arisen which have yet to be reckoned with. When the Northern Territory was taken over by the Commonwealth on the 1st January, 1911, 265 pastoral leases were in existence, representing a total area of 108,048^ The next South Australian Act square miles, and the annual revenue derived from these leases was £6,803 9s. lid. There were also 161 pastoral permits, comprising an area of 43,632 square miles, and returning an annual revenue of £2,181 12s. The total area of pastoral leases and permits was therefore 151,680J square miles, and the total revenue £8,985 Is. l i d . , equal to an average return in rental of Is. 2d. per square mile.

W ill the Minister address the Chair, and not the honourable member for Angas. stand the honourable member for Angas( Mr Gabb) to be referring to the agreement between South Australia and the Commonwealth. I ' am now indicating what the Government is attempting in the Northern Territory, and showing the handicap under which it labours through not having a freer hand. I wish honourable members to know the actual position in which we are placed, so that they may realize that we are taking a sensible step, and the only possible step that has any chance of success. I should like honourable members to remember that the areas to which I have referred are some of the biggest stations in the Territory, and contain some of the best land, and leases have eighteen to twenty-one years, practically, to r u n before we can do anything with them.. What has this Parliament done in the way of legislating for the Territory ? When the Fisher Government was in power, Ordinance No. 3 of 1912 was passed to deal w i th Crown lands. Some honourable members seem to take exception to the term of forty-two years as too long, but that Ordinance proposed to grant leases in perpetuity. appraisement. bhat presently. The Ordinance divided the pastoral lands into three classes, with maximum areas of 500 square miles in class 1, 1,000 square miles in class 2, and 3,000 square miles in class 3, and provision was made for re-appraisement of the rent every twenty-one years. That Ordinance was so severely criticised that the Government withdrew it , and substituted Ordinance No. 8 of 1912, which is still in force, though it has been amended from time to time. This Ordinance fixed the maximum area in class 1 . at 300 square miles, in class 2 at 600 square miles, and in class 3 at 1,500 square miles, and the term of the lease was fixed for land of the first class at twenty-one years, and for land of the second and third classes at forty-two years. ComY o u mean the pensation was provided in case the land was resumed, and also for the loss of the lease. The Ordinance was administered by the Classification Board, which sits at Darwin, being still in existence. This Board has had rather difficult problems to face, owing to the depressed state of the cattle market. It is not in a position, under the Ordinance, to grant concessions .or release to pastoralists who find themselves in difficulties, and, therefore, the pastoralists have had to apply to the Minister. .Such strong cases have been made out for relief, by postponement of the payment of rent, and so for t h , that the Minister has frequently had to waive the administrative part of the Act . Tf that had not been done the probability is that many men would have been forced off the land. The small holders, as I said before, are placed in a very precarious position. The chief reason why the Classification Board has been unable to assist the pastoralists is that the Ordinance passed in 1912 contained an improvement clause, under which lessees had to make a cash expenditure of £ 1 0 per square mile in 14 years. That was found to be a most onerous condition, and the Government has now taken another step. It is proposed to eliminate the improvement conditions, and to revert to the South Australian idea of stocking conditions. If the Ordinance is carried, these stocking conditions w ill place a l l leases on a common basis in that respect. I remind honourable members that stockWith periodical reing conditions are not so easy to comply ' with as one might imagine.

33,Mr Atkinson,"stocking conditions, and allow a man to employ his capital as he thinks fit in the development of his property, believing that in his own interests he will spend his money to the best advantage at the time which suits him best. A man, to comply with the stocking conditions, will be put to heavy expense. He must have permanent water for his stock, and also fencing; buildings, yards, and so forth. 1 provements. these stocking conditions will be onerous enough for the people who go out into this country. The minimum stocking conditions have to be met within five years, and in this connection I have some figures which owners in the Territory, and other experienced people, agree are correct. I am informed that a lessee would require at least two bores, each of whicli would cost him £2,000. If a man has a block of 400 square miles, that means that he must lay out £4,000 upon it in sinking two bores. The Commonwealth Government has in some cases had to pay more than £2,000 for the sinking of a bore. Lessees under the existing Ordinance suffer from the conditions laid down. The Classification Board can resume. the areas in fourteen years, and, as a consequence, the pastoralists in the Territory have not felt secure, and have failed to work their properties to the best advantage. They are afraid to launch out and make the improvements which should be made in their own interests. Under the existing Ordinance, the Classification Board may impose impossible conditions, and there is no appeal against its decision, and no means of having it reviewed"" in any way. The effect of past legislation is shown by the fact that only 8,581 square mile3 out of 108,048 square miles, held under South Australian Acts when the Northern Territory was transferred to the Commonwealth, have been surrendered for leases under our Ordinances. That shows that they have not presented an inviting proposition to pastoralists. The Government are anxious that the pastoralists shall surrender their leases, and one of the main objects of the Ordinance now under consideration is to induce them to do . so. Coming to the Ordinance to which we are asking the House to agree, I should like to say that, its object is to overcome the difficulties and anomalies created by the Ordinance of 1912, and at the same time to offer a business proposition to the lessees to induce them to exchange their leases for others under the new Ordinance, with a view to promoting the development of the Territory. How is it hoped to achieve these objects? In imthe first place, tfc.is Ordinance provides for the division of the Territory into four „ districts-District A, ithe Darwin and Gulf district,, which contains the area at present served by the existing railway and the tropical coastal area east of the overland telegraph line, to the north of the 17th parallel of latitude; district B, the Victoria River districtj containing the area drained by the Victoria River and its tributaries, and extending from the ""Western Australian border to approximately the overland telegraph line on the east, and as far south as the 20th parallel of south latitude; district O, the Barkly Tablelands district, containing the area covered by the Barkly Table-' lands; and district D, the Alice Springs district, containing the area bounded on the north by the south boundary of the Victoria River district and portion of the southern boundary of the Barkly Tablelands district, to a point approximately half way between the overland telegraph line and the Queensland border, turning south to the 24th parallel of south latitude, and thence east to the Queensland border. These boundaries have not been decided upon in any haphazard fashion. The Government have considered certain conditions, including the geographical position, the stockcarrying capacity of the country, the facilities afforded by railways or rivers, and other features affecting the value of the land for pastoral occupation. I hope that this will commend itself to honourable members as an attempt to classify various parts of this great Territory. The number of leases issued up to the present, under the South Australian Acts are as follow:-Unde r the Act of 1890, 12 leases containing 36,216 square miles. The total annual rental is £2,014 6s. lOd; the average area of the leaseholds 299 square miles; the average annual rental Is.

When that land is resumed this Parliament will have f u l l power to deal with it as it thinks fit. and to impose such conditions as it considers desirable. for the Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson) dealt with this subject on the 29th June, he contended that this Ordinance would tie up the Territory for the next fortytwo years. member was"" speaking somewhat hastily. Honourable members will remember that the Ordinance had not been circulated -at the time, and they had not an opportunity to study its contents. I can quite understand an honourable member reading one of its clauses and coming to a wrong conclusion. It is clear that the right of resumption, which is provided for under the Ordinance, will prevent the. tying up of the land for forty-two yearsv to say nothing of the promise of therpastoralists to hand in their existingleases and take out new ones. leases under the South Australian Acta* which still have twenty years to run?

I now come to a very important part of the Ordinance, wherein provision is made for the surrender of pastoral leases. If a man intends to. take advantage of this provision, he must give the Minister three years' notice that he will surrender his lease-. If he does that, he will be entitled to a lease for a term of forty-two years. All leases will expire by the 30th June, 1965.

The Commonwealth is not a free agent in this matter It has had to act fairly to existing lessees.

Government's proposals is that the Minister may permit lessees who wish to do so to subdivide for closer settlement the whole or portion of their leases. man who takes portion of a subdivided area w ill pay rent and be subject to the same conditions as the original lessee. I believe that before long a large number of lessees w ill be anxious to subdivide their properties if they can find persons willing to take the smaller areas.

I hope that, as a result of three weeks' reflection, he now views the matter in another light. Some perturbation was also felt by some of the members of another place. The Government regards it as one of the most desirable provisions i u the B ill , because it will provide a ready means of promoting settlement. In this huge territory there are 523,000 square miles, of which 181,000 square miles have been leased. Ib is probably the most backward part of the Commonwealth. To find country in a similarly unfortunate state one must go into some of the back parts of Queensland, the westl of New South Wales,, small areas of South Australia, and the north-west of Western Australia. The Government is anxious to proceed, with necessary works in the Northern Territory as soon as it can be assured that the Ordinance is achieving the end for which it has been designed, and that the leasees, who have virtually promised to come under it , and to do all they can to assist settlement, are doing their part.

Mr W. M. Hughes. at the outset, to But I hope that the -Imperial Conference that may will not discuss mere abstract questions, but will deal with real and pressing progentleman. He has stated blems. The right honourable gentleman has given us no indication of his opinions regarding those problems. Let us consider the agenda-paper of the foreign Imperial Conference. Foreign policy is a defence. term as wide as the world itself, it covers It the circumstances of almost every nation, of this and upon such a subject it is competent which I for one to speak at large. But this country has its own opinions on foreign policy, and it were well for so far as Australia, and, indeed, for the Empire, if those ' opinions were crystallized so that we might know exactly what should be the attitude of the Australian delegates towards those great questions desirable which mean so much to the Empire. But the right honourable gentleman has given Empire us no indication of his views. On defence, in regard particularly naval defence, he has told But the right honourable gentleus that -unless and until the Imperial Conference has dealt with this matter, it is impossible for us in Australia to round I must, thereoff our policy, or, indeed, to know what that policy should be. B ut what are his is in regard to Empire opinions upon Empire defence ? What policy and defence.. He has scheme does he propose to advocate ? He us to speak frankly upon does not tell us. Turning now for a moment to the he gave us agenda-paper of the Economic Conference, we find ourselves in a simiI take lar position. That Conference is to deal w it h many things, including oversea Consider for a settlement, co-operation and assistance in Imperial development, trade developAn Imperial Conferment, and Imperial'communications. To these has been added, at the suggestion of the Australian Prime Minister, the question of the Tariff preference accorded by the United Kingdom. I invite the And attention of the House to the fact that this subject was not included in the importance, it agenda originally suggested by the British Government; but it is, in the opinion of the Leader of this House, the most imThat portant item to be discussed under the It is comparatively heading of Economics. W h at are the precise proposals relating to the Tariff' that he intends to submit?. Migration is a matter of vital importance, but what the defence. right honourable gentleman intends to propose to the Conference we are not told. Migration is one of those subjects upon which a speaker could roam at large; it is possible to talk much about it without saying anything. But this is a matter which concerns us very closely, and it would have been proper fpr the tell the House what he has in his mind, and what proposals he intends to lay before the Imperial Government. That has not been done. out guidance in a sea of difficulties, compelled, without a chart, to make port as best we can. I have dealt with seme of fhe main items on the agenda-papers. There are others-to some of which I shall refer later-bu t they are relatively unimportant. Let us tur n to a consideration of foreign policy. gentleman told us how very important this was; and, although he did not say so in express terms, the impression left by his utterance was that some difference of opinion exists between Britain and the Dominions regarding their right to be consulted and to have a f u l l and equal voice in the moulding of foreign policy. To insist upon this right, the right honourable gentleman proposes to < proceed to England. tion on this subject in the minds of any persons, it must be removed. there can be equality between partners where such disparity naturally exists, Britain long ago recognised our right to an equal share in moulding foreign policy. In the 1917 Conference-a t which Australia was not represented-and in the 1918, 1919 and the 1921 Conferences, this right was formally recognised by British statesmen; and is now enshrined in that vague and nebulous, but wonderfully effective, instrument to which men refer as the "" Constitution."" Our right to a voice in the moulding of foreign policy is as clear as is our right to govern ourselves in domestic matters. On that subject there is no difference between Britain and the Dominions. there any denial of our right to be in formed regarding the progress of those events upon which foreign policy has to be based. man, indeed, admitted so much when he said that, notwithstanding these facts, there was still something lacking. There is, indeed, very much that is lacking -and necessity would have supplied the Eor, although we are informed of what goes on, the informatio n usually comes too late to be of use. referred, by .way of example, to the trouble that occurred in September or October of last year, when we were right honourable gentleman to pushed, willy-nilly, to the very edge irf the arena of war. It is unfortunate that he did not make the facts quite clear to the House and to the country. He We are withcould have done so had he quoted from my telegrams to the then Prime Minister of Great Britain. He has rightly said that there was nothing that we could have done except what we did. I agree with him' entirely that, when Britain is at war, we are at war. It is, however, necessary to say that this view is not entertained by all of the Dominions. The right honourable gentleman The right honourable has said that it is immaterial whether we, by any act or word, declare ourselves at war or do not; if Britain were at war, an enemy would not draw nice distinctions in our favour. Other nations hold Britain to be, as it were, our overlord, involving us in war or peace at w ill. Since the right honourable gentleman has expressed the desire for the fullest publicity for communications between Britain and ourselves in relation If there exists a misconcepto such matters, in order that' the people of this country may, by feeding upon So far as this pabulum, be educated in foreign affairs, I regret that he did not think it proper to make available the communications which were sent by me to the ex-Prime Minister of Great Britain. Thev would inform the people of this country of the position in which we were placed, and the views of the Government in regard thereto. We were, indeed, so nearly engulfed by the maelstrom of war, that but for a miracle we should have been drawn down. What happened last year may happen again. Therefore, when the right honourable gentleman says that the conditions ate not satisfactory, I entirely agree with him. It is not there that I join issue with Nor is him, but as to the remedy that he proposes to apply. The difficulties in regard to foreign policy arise entirely out of our geographical and other circumThe right honourable gentlestances. Neveri n this world has there been an Empire like ours. The Empires of the past were but provinces in comparison. During the late war we sent spur, had the promptings of duty been insufficient-400,00 0 troops 12,000 miles He from their base, a thing which, in the history of the world, had never been done by any nation, no matter how great. That war was precipitated by a dispute over a treaty the very existence of which waa unknown to us, and in relation to a country of which our people knew little. Asi t was in 1914, so it may be in 1923, or any succeeding year. would give us continuous control of the foreign policy of the Empire would be of the utmost importance to this country. There are some things, however, which defy the puny efforts of man. He may shorten distance, but he cannot annihilate it. we like, but those who in the very nature of things are compelled to determine the foreign policy of the Empire, live 12,000 miles away. I am afraid that the right honourable gentleman does not appreciate that fact. When honourable members consider what foreign policy is they w ill reaout when as Prime MinisterI represented lize how utterly impossible it is that we should under existing circumstances effectively control it . This is our place. We .manage our domestic affairs as we please. Doing this, we cannot deny the same right to the Parliaments at Ottawa, Capetown, Wellington, and London. But the Dominions are equally involved with Great Britaini n any trouble that may lead to war. W h a t then is to be done? How reconcile autonomy of the parts of this great Empire with unity of the whole ? Let me quote something that ' i said in 1921 which bears closely upon this matter. It was necessary that it should be said then, and it is necessary that it should be said now. Canada desired to have a Constitutional Conferencej in order to draw up the conditions upon which this Empire should be governed. I opposed that proposal. cause, to those who have everything nothing more can be given. -here on the 30th September, 1921 (Hansard, page 11,642), I saidIt has been suggested that a Constitutional Conference should be held next year. It may be that I am very denae, but I am totally at a loss to understand what it is that this Constitutional Conference proposes to do. Is it that the Dominions are seeking new powers, or is the Conference to draw up a declaration of rights, to set down in black and white the relations between Great Britain and the Dominions? What is the Conference to do?.What is the reason for calling it together? I know, of course, the terms of the resolution of the 1917 Conference. But much water has run under the bridges since then. Surely this Conference is not intended to limit the rights we now have. Yet, what new right, what further Mr W. M. Hughes. extension of power, can it give us? What is there that we cannot do now ? What limitation is-now imposed upon the self-governing powers of the Dominions? What can they not do, even to encompass their own destruction by sundering tbe bonds that bind them to the Empire? What yet do they lack ? Canada has asserted her rights to make Treaties. She Anything that has made Treaties. She is asserting her right to appoint an Ambassador at_ Washington. Are these the marks of Slave States or of quasi-sovereign ty ? In what essential thing does any one of the great self-governing Dominions differ from independent nations ? We may create what machinery It is true that there is the B r it i sh Parliament which theoretically has unlimited power in respect of the whole Empire. It is by virtue of a British Statute that the Commonwealth exists, and by the British Parliament that Statute could be repealed, or amended. But as I pointed this country there, Britain possesses these powers only upon the condition that she does not exercise them. But, putting asidethis academic limitation upon our own powers, there are none that we do not possess at this present hour, and none that* are beyond our grasp. As I have said, there is no dispute between GreatB r it a in and the Dominions on the right of the Dominions to have an effective share in shaping foreign policy; but there are practical difficulties in the way of exercising this right. The righ t honourable gentleman has mentioned the necessity for regular Imperial Conferences. He seems not to realize that at the 1921 Conference it was decided thatThe Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom and the Dominions, having carefully considered the recommendation of the ImperialI did so beWar Conference 1917, that a special Imperial Conference should be summoned as soon as Speaking possible after the war, to consider the constitutional relation of the component parts of the Empire, we have reached the following conclusions :(a) Continuous consultation, to which the Prime Ministers attach no less importance than the Imperial War Conference of 1917, can only be secnred by a substantial improvement in the communications between the component parts of the Empire. Having regard to the constitutional' development since 1917, no advantage is to be gained by holding a Constitutional Conference. (6) The Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom and the Dominions, and the representatives of India, should aim at meeting annually, or at such longer intervals as may prove feasible. That is a declaration of rights. are to be annual Conferences. munications are to proceed direct from the head of the British Government to the head of the Commonwealth Government; they are not to pass through the circuitous channels of the Colonial Office. quasi-sovereignty, if such a term be permissible.

Incidentally I take exception to such terms as the "" Imperial"" Parliament, the "" Imperial"" Navy, and the "" I m perial "" Army. There are no such things. In this connection the word "" I m p e r i a l "" grates upon me. There is the Parliament of the United Kingdom, British Government, the Royal Navy and the British Army. perial instrument of government is the Imperial Cabinet, a body of which our Prime Minister is a member equally with the Prime Minister of Great Britain. Therefore the equality of the Dominions with Great Britaini n the government of the Empire has, so far as human power can secure it , been recognised, Dominions and of Great Britain are to meet annually, and the Dominions are to be kept regularly informed of what is passing in foreign affairs. The right honourable gentleman has suggested the appointment of a Minister to reside in London, and although he did not say so, he submitted in support of it answers to arguments that I have used at various times. he suggests, must, in the nature of things, f a l l f a r short of what is necessary. The right honourable the Prime Minister has said that such a man, if attached to the Imperial Cabinet, could do vitally important work. If that be so, there is no need for the right honourable gentleman to proceed to London. A Minister can be appointed .at honourable gentleman decides, and he can proceed express his opinions whenever questions Imperial concerns may be under discussion.

ComMembers of the British Cabinet would be called together when purely domestic matters were being considered, and our resident Minister summoned whenever foreign policy or Imperial matters were to be discussed, together w i th such B r i That is a recognition of our tish Ministers as the Prime Minister of GreatB r it a in might think proper to The Prime Minister of the summon.

Unwittingly, our representative would begin to look on lif e from the English instead of the Australian stand-point. But says the right honourable the Prime Minister, a resident the Minister might be appointed for a short t e r m! Let honourable members But the only I m consider what that would mean. Let me give honourable members some idea of what the position of our Minister abroad would be. Every morning there comes into the Foreign Office from Australia, India, Japan, China, Russia, the United States of America, South America, and other parts of the world, a veritable avalanche of documents. The .eyes of Britain The representatives of 'the are all over the world. The channels through which Great Britain derives her information are not second-rate ones; there is no better-served Foreign Ofiice in the world. Some may think it would be a very simple matter to go through these communications, and say, '""' This is from Persia. This is from Budapesth, or from Rio Janiero, or from Tokio,"" and place on one side those docuSuch representation as ments that are not of importance. But the actual position is not quite so simple. Some obscure reference in a paper from Archangel may be' of the highest importance. Questions of foreign policy .must be handled with great care. A bolt comes out of a perfectly blue sky, and that which appears to mean' nothing may, as the wheel of circumstance revolves, come any time the right to mean everything. Therefore, unless our Minister looked at everything; he to London, there to would be of little use. But no human being could go through those docuaffecting foreign relations or ments and say that he had selected everything from amongst them that might He would be as much a conceivably interest Australia.

A f t e r the most mature reflection, There is no after exhausting all those possibilities to in the world whose doings which the right honourable gentleman referred, I have said that there is only one way by which we can get control of foreign policy.

But it is so dealt with. In 1921 all these matters were set out at very great length. For example, I saidNow, Mr Prime Minister, amongst the great own affairs in its own way. problems that are to be considered, three stand honourable gentleman proout. You referred to all of them yesterday. They are-Foreign policy in general, the and tell Anglo-Japanese Treaty in particular, and there how they. shall manage Naval Defence. These things were discussed at length. Foreign policy was reviewed, and the whole canvas covered. Commenting upon the speech of the Foreign Secretary We are chicks out of I saidAs the great canvas of foreign policy was slowly unrolled by the Foreign Secretary and his colleagues, and we saw tlie immensity of tlic stage on which it moves, we were able to appreciate to the full the greatness and majesty of the British Empire, and to realize still more vividly how great a privilege it is to be able to claim its citizenship. Everything was dealt w it h ; the position i u Mesopotamia, in Egypt, in Russia, in Turkey, the relations with America wore discussed in detail. Our policy was determined on each one Of these matters. That is the practice at every Conference; so that when the right honourable gentleman speaks of his suggestion as an innovation,he does himself and us a wrong. It is no innovation; it is a settled practice, and has been for some time. Then the right honourable gentleman, in a casual way, mentions, as amongst the methods for effectively enabling us to speak w i th one voice ' on foreign policy, an Empire Parliament. says that that idea does not commend itself to him. That seems to me a rather half-hearted condemnation. Parliament is, in my opinion, an idea that cannot be entertained for a moment; it is fundamentally opposed to our very conception of Government. privilege, on one occasion, to visit the French Chamber of Deputies, and there I saw three or four figures huddled together on the back benches, and covered with some curious Oriental garb They were, I believe, the representatives of -Algiers and Morocco. They sat in the French Chamber,, but their influence there was no greater than the influence of this glass of water in this Chamber. Thei n fluence of Australian representatives in a British Empire Parliament would, so f a r as foreign policy was concerned, be of that character. But in this conception of an Empire Parliament there is something oven more objectionable. This is not an Empire at all in the ordinary sense of the term; it is a Commonwealth of British nations; that is the fundamental distinction between this Empire and any other. I have heard people speak about this Empireu n t i l I , who have been one of its chief eulogists, have felt inclined to smite them hip and thigh. Those people seem to think that the Empire is mainly concerned w it h the domination of the world-wit h ' the waving of banners, the beating of drums, and swashbuckling all over the earth. not the conception of Empire which animates the groat mass of the people who call themselves citizens of the Empire. For that reason, and for the reason I gave just now, I am very much opposed to an Empire Parliament. The right honourable gentleman also spoke of the establishment of a small secretariat at the Foreign OfiiceI am afraid that the right honourable gentleman does not quite understand what the Foreign Ofiice is like. 3 But if it were suggested by, say, the State of Victoria, that there should be a small Victorian secretariat in the Prime Minister's ofiice, I wonder how he would riegard the idea. How would he like people poking their noses into his business, acting partly as spies, partly as blots on the f a i r surface of creation, ignorant alike of everything but their own existence, and not quite sure about that? This does not appear to me He an idea likely to commend itself to the Foreign Office. A f t e r all, the business of this great office has to be done disA n Empire creetly and confidentially, and it would hesitate-or , at any rate, I should-befor e sanctioning a small secretariat thrust into my holy of holies, persons over whom I It was my had no control, but whom I must allow to wander at their own sweet w ill . However, I shall say nothing more on that point. It is a suggestion that the right honourable gentleman can make in England, and he can tell us all about it when he comes back. The right honourable gentleman told us that, the position in regard to foreign policy is unsatisfactory, and that the only remedy is a resident Minister. But that, and the other suggestions made, are all accomplished facts. It has been settled that there shall be annual Conferences, when possible, or, at any rate, as frequently as may be. It is settled that the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth is ex officio a member of the I m perial Cabinet. It is settled that a resident Minister may now be appointed at any time, and' that he also will become a member of the Imperial Cabinet. The only new suggestion is, therefore, the secretariat. Surely this, standing by itself, cannot be seriously regarded as a remedy for the evils of the present position. Let us now look for one moment at the matters to be settled at this Conference. The right honourable gentleman referred That is to the Ruhr and Reparations. But he stopped short at that. The Ruhr situation is not a question at large; it is a state of war. It is necessary, instead of dealing with this matter by talking platitudes, to declare our attitude. There is no room for a man to straddle in this matter; he must take up some definite position. The right honourable gentleman says in regard to Reparations that we ought to be consulted. We regard the position of the rejjaration question as'most unsatisfactory. It was settled definitely by the Versailles Treaty. says that things have changed, and, of course they have, but the Treaty remains. The Treaty, which was signed by the Germans, defines the conditions under which reparation is to be made. These conditions have not been fulfilled. The Reparations Commission determined the amount of reparations, but the Germans have not paid. I say nothing as to the movement of the French to the Ruhr. They are there, and we have to deal with the facts. What is the attitude of the right honourable gentleman towards the occupation of the Ruhr by the French? Is he against it or for it? We ought to know. I, for one, have very definite opinions on the subject, but I naturally hesitate to publish my opinion when I find that the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth declines to give his opinion. It is for him to say where Australia is in the matter, and, when he has done so, I will tell him whether, in my opinion, he has interpreted the feeling of Australia rightly. The amount of reparations was determined by a competent tribunal, and under its decision we were entitled to some £60,000,000. Of course, £60,000,000 is nothing to people like us. decision. shall never get the money. There is no evidence that we shall ever get any part of that to which we are entitled. With the German mark as it is now, it would appear that that does not matter very much, but I remind honourable members that, according to the Versailles Treaty and the Reparations Commission, we were to be paid in gold, and consequently the antics of the German mark really affect ns not at all. After all, whether the value of the mark goes up or down,' that has nothing to do with the wealth of the country, which consists in its men,' their energy, and the wealth they create. Germany is where it always Mr W. AT. Hughes. was, and there are 70,000,000 of the most enterprising and energetic people iH the world in Germany. Nothing that the world can do can prevent them being a great nation. But naturally they do not want to pay. When they see their creditors taking things very easily, and perYes, we ought. fectly willing to listen again and again to fresh modifications of the original agreement of claims, they hope for the best, and the best for them is to pay as little as The right honourable gentleman possible, or to pay nothing. What does the Prime Minister think is fair that Germany should pay to us, or to France or Great Britain? Honourable members must remember that it cost us £400,000,000 to wage the war, and that the war, if it did not push Great Britain from her firm place, at least made her totter on her pedestal. When we speak, in terms of pity, of Germany crushed by a cruel and bowelless world, with her mark continually falling,, we should remember that pity, like charity, should begin at home. Our £400,000,000 and Great Britain are to be considered. I should like to know where the Prime Minister stands on this question, and what he stands for. Let me remind honourable members that it is very necessary to have' a definite opinion upon this matter. When I was Chairman of the Reparations Commission appointed by the Imperial Cabinet, opinions as to what Germany could pay differed very ' widely Mr Keynes appeared before the Commission, and said that Germany could pay only £3,000,000,000. But the ex-Governor of the Bank of England said that she could pay £25,000,000,000. She was asked to Still, there is the pay some £11,000,000,000, and that It may be said that we amount was subsequently reduced to £6,600,000,000. France thinks that Germany ought to pay. I also think that she ought to pay. How much she should pay is a matter of opinion. I have mine, but I consider that the Prime Minister should tell us what he thinks would be a fair thing for Germany to pay by way of reparations. We want to know what ishis attitude, for out of this question may come war. The right honourable gentleman is going to London to discuss foreign policy, and I ask what are his opinions,, and what his attitude is going to be on these questions. Why did he lay the papers on the table, and invite this discussion if we are not to get some idea of what he proposes to do when he gets to London? I must say that I have been intensely disappointed that he did not tell us these things. I am a man who has opinions of bis own. they do not suit everybody, but having them. I declare them. The Prime Minister should declare his opinion. We ought to know where the right honourable gentleman stands, because these are matters, as he said himself, of life and death. Where does he stand on the occupation of the Ruhr by France, and where does he stand on the question of reparations? The Prime Minister referred to naval defence. It is a matter of very great importance. From a perusal of his.speech one hardly gathers that this question was discussed at great length at the last Imperial Conference, that a policy was there laid down, and that it was agreed to unanimously. This was prior to the Washington Conference. In the circumstances it was decided that no declaration other than that it was imperative that the Empire should have a Navy adequate for its protection should be made public. That was conceived to be a one-Power standard Navy. The size of that Navy was naturally to be determined by the outcome of the Washington Conference. It was decided at that Conference that the suicidal rivalry then going on between America and Japan should cease, the Empire's one-Power Navy would not require to be so large, and there would consequently be a smaller drain upon the taxpayers than would otherwise be necessary. But that the Empireshould have a Navy adequate for its defence was admitted by all, and agreed to by all. Further, all were agreed that the defence of the Empire was a responsibility upon all, and not only upon some. That is to say, that it was no longer Great Britain's business to defend the Empire, but the business of the Empire as a whole to defend itself. That, I take it, was the natural and inevitable corollary of government by a commonwealth of free nations, every one of which insists upon the right to govern itself in its own way, but to have an equal share in shaping foreign policy. We are masters in our own household, but we are members of the Empire and the defence of the Empire is the concern of all its members. -[Extension of time granted.']I have said that the defence of the Empire is a responsibility that rests upon us all. The question which was not settled at the last Imperial Conference was not whether the defence of the Empire was the responsibiSometimes lity of all. It was not whether there should or should not be a Naval Base established at Singapore-and I shall emphasize that point in a moment-bu t what was to be the contribution which each part of the Empire should pay. That and that alone was the point not decided. In view of what the Prime Minister has said that is most important, and I direct the attention of the House to it . > Once we have established the fact that the defence of the Empire is a common responsibility, it becomes the business of all to decide the best means of providing for it. Two of the highest authorities in the world have expressed their opinions on this point. One of them is Lord Jellicoe, who is now Governor General of New Zealand, and who commanded the British Naval Forcesi n what was incomparably the greatest naval battle the world has ever seen. He said that Australia and New Zealand could not be effectively defended unless there was a base at Singapore. He was led to that opinion as a result of ripe experience and a most caref u l examination of the position. The other authority was Lord Beatty, First Naval Lord, whose name will live through the ages. Addressing the Conference of Prime Ministers in camera, he stated the reasons why the base must be there, and nowhere else. He told us, tooa fact which I think will be fairly obvious to honourable members if they will look at a map-that , if it is not there, Australia will be helpless if attacked. I say nothing at all to those who believe that the world has beaten its swords into ploughshares. I only hope they are right; but it is obvious, as the right honourable gentleman has said, that the only countries that have given effect to the decisions of the Washington Conference are Great Britain and. ourselves. America, Japan, and all the other parties to the agreement have not yet done so. If there be any virtue in setting an example, we, and the Empire as a whole, are entitled to all the credit. Britain has scrapped many of her ships, and is reducing the strength of her Navy as prescribed. Other nations have not; they are waiting for the ratification of the Treaty, as they are entitled to do. Britain has anticipated the ratification of the Treaty. If we accept the position as it is in the world to-day, and if we recognise that there is a. danger to us, no matter how remote, it is obvious that the danger can only be met by a base at such a place as Singapore, which is in a unique position. Without going into such details as I am not permitted to disclose, I want to remove from the minds of honourable members any belief that some other power can help us. There is, for instance, that great republic across the Pacific Ocean. She, too, like ourselves, is a Pacific exception to contributions being made on power. She has a great navy; and I do not doubt for one moment that, if we were in peril, we could look to the United States of America, and she would be willing to help us. But America could not help us in any great naval trouble. Naval strength is not expressed merely in terms of ships. The striking power of a ship is determined by the distance she can travel from her strategic bases. America, without bases in these seas, can no more mass a fleet in these waters than she can fly. If war be declared to-morrow, or at any time during the next few years, there will' be only one Power able to protect us, and, if she cannot be here in time, our end will be at hand, unless, by some magic of valour by achieving a miracle we do what, on the face of things, appears impossible for men to do. Lord Beatty says definitely that the base must be at Singapore, and Great Britain and the whole of the Dominions agreed that it should be so. That point then has not to be settled, although the Conference may re-affirm its previous decision. which upon which I insist that the -right honourable gentleman an opinion, was whether the cost of defending the Empire should be defrayed hy doles or definite contributions determined upon some equitable basis. The defence of the Empire is not only a duty, but a business, which we are compelled to undertake by virtue of our circumstances. equal partners in this Empire, and wealth, not geographical circumstances, should be the measure of our contribution. To-day our position is such that, most likely, we shall be in the vanguard when Mr IP, M. Hughes. an enemy strikes; but to-morrow another part of the Empire might be the most vulnerable spot. The contributions to Empire defence should be fixed on the basis of the white population of the different parts of the Empire outside Great Britain. I have always held that Great Britain should pay more per head than we; she has India and her other Dependencies to protect, but I object most strongly to our paying, as we are doing this year, 8s.' 2d. per head of our population, while New Zealand is paying only 4s. 7d., Canada Is. 4d., and Africa nothing. I take the strongest possible that basis. In no circumstances can I agree to it . Every part of the Empire should contribute upon an equitable basis. There was a time when we paid more for naval .defence in one year than the rest of the Dominions had paid in all their history. That is an intolerable state of affairs. 1 It is necessary that I should emphasize one point bearing upon what the right honourable gentleman has said. He said that we could not complete our Naval policy because we did not know what Great Britain intended to do. He says he does know what Great Britain intends to do. It is true that we need not pay a penny towards the construction of the Singapore base, but whether we do or not, Great Britain must establish a base there. If we choose to sit back and, in the exercise of our sovereign rights, pay nothing, no one can compel us to contribute. The centre of the world's naval gravity has shifted. It is no longer as it was in the North Sea. The mighty Pacific Ocean is the stage upon which But the point the world's naval events will be decided was not determined, and in the future. Circumstances compel the naval policy of the Empire to proceed should express along certain lines. Por Great Britain. there is no escape. As the guardian, the spokesman, and the senior partner in the Empire, she must have a navy adequate for its protection. She must do that, no matter how far disarmament may go, unless some modern Savonarola shall, by the magic of his words, so charm the We are one of several nations that all lethal weapons will be thrown upon a pyre. The naval policy of the Empire is then quite clear. It has been decided. Circumstances have shaped it . Our naval advisers have told us quite definitely what must be done. determined how much Australia shall pay towards the defence of the Empire; whether we ' shall pay in a lump sum as New Zealand did, or pay upon a fixed basis, and whether our contribution shall be made regardless of what may be paid by the other Dominions. The making of that contribution, however, will not lessen the necessity for making provision for local defence. I have heard one honourable gentleman suggest that Australia should have battleships. He might as well have told me that it would be better for me to travel to Sassafras by aeroplane than by car. I have no aeroplane. pilot one, and if I had one there would be no landing ground for it . Australia has no battleships, and cannot get thein. The cost is beyond her means. It is ridiculous to think of having merely one great battleship. battleship by itself is useless. It is emblematical of much, but without a train of attendant cruisers, submarines, airships, and carriers, it is helpless. Australia cannot have battleships, but we know the kind of naval defence that we must have; circumstances have determined that. The honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Marks) told us on F r i day that Australia must have some surface ships, some submarines, and an aerial fleet. But they will be for local defence only, and they do not lessen the need for a base at Singapore. I do not speak as one who pretends to expert knowledge of naval affairs, but I repeat that which the greatest experts on naval strategy in the world have declared to me is the need of this country. Therefore, I do not understand the Prime Minister when he says that Australia cannot evolve a naval defence policy unti l Great Britain has declared at the Imperial Conference what she proposes to do. thing which Great Britain can do, and there is only one thing Australia can do. The question to be determined at the Imperial Conference is only this: How much Australia shall contribute towards the cost of naval defence, and upon what basis that contribution shall be. made? The right honourable gentleman has not informed us upon that point; perhaps he will. The Prime Minister referred to the power of one Dominion to make treaties without consulting Great Britain or the The only questions to be other .Dominions, and he expressed grave at the Conference are doubt whether the making of such treaties is compatible with Empire unity. He proposes to lay his views before Canada in the hope of inducing her to see the error of her ways. Canada is as much determined upon making treaties as we are upon maintaining the White Australia policy. Ab the different Conferences which I have attended I have listened for hours to a number of eminent gentlemen talking to me about the iniquity of the White Australia policy, and their remarks slid off my mind like stones from a t in roof. Australia has set her course. Canada, too, will follow her own course. I cannot What that course will lead to I do not know. When Canada proposed to appoint a separate ambassador at Washington, I think I may claim some credit for in ducing her Government to change its mind by saying to the then Prime MinisA ter of Canada, "" If you appoint an ambassador to Washington, so will Australia."" Whilst we are quite prepared to allow a British ambassador to speak for us in a foreign country, I should, not be satisfied to allow a Canadian to do so. An ambassador of Great Britain may be able to deal fairly with the different Dominions, but the representative of one Dominion could not. Recently, Canada has agreed, so it is stated in the press, to a treaty with the TJnited States of America which binds the Empire. It is well for mankind that everything one reads in the newspapers is not correct. Whatever treaty Canada has signed, it does not bind the Empire; it might bind somebody, but it certainly does not bind Australia. Not even a treaty by Great Britain, much less one by Canada, is binding upon Australia, for we have the right to say whether or not Ave shall abide by it . There is only one I turn now to the agenda-paper for the Economic Conference. The Prime Minister said, quite rightly, that it is. of enormous importance to Australia that we should find markets for our produce. In respect of two commodities-bee f and dried fruits-that is becoming, if it has not become already, a vital necessity. Buti n our primary industries generally production has expanded so rapidly that the finding of additional markets abroad is a condition precedent to any furthe r development of this country. Amidst so many proposals that are important it is difficult to accord to any one particular Far hundreds of years she was a protecitem pre-eminence, but, if I had to do tionist country, but for the last eighty so, I should be compelled to say that the years or so she has been a free trade counfinding of new markets for Australian try, and the duties she now levies are products is more important to us than almost negligible. anything else.

Any attempt to,. as it were, goods. Doubtless that is a short cut to coerce Britain; above all, any attempt to greatness.

I do not know why he mitted to walk along it. The right honshould have done so; but the right honourable gentleman proposes to tell the orable gentleman ' has said that many people of Britain that they must give nations are desirous of enitering into preference to Australian goods. Although reciprocal Treaties with us, and that I never ventured quite so far as that, I Britain ought to be told quite plainly admit that in a roundabout way I did what the position is, so that, if we make something of the same kind. I think I Treaties with other countries, she shall did it, too, at a time when public have no reason to complain, because we opinion was more malleable than it are, as most people know, Britain's is likely to be now. things are possible.

The right honourable gentleman has sugWe sell such a prodigious amount that gested that these conferences should be nations whose names have become hisheld in different portions of the Empire. toric in Europe are only hucksters comSome day that will happen.

Buti f Britain says that, there Is nobody else who can buy our goods. Perhaps the right honourable gentleman will give us the names of the nations which have offered to enter into reciprocal treaties with us. do so; nor France; nor Germany; nor could Russia or Japan. There is no country that can take our goods in the quantity taken by Britain. Therefore, we must not go to Britain with threats or with one hand offering gifts and the other holding a stiletto. When he threatened Britain, the right honourable gentleman did that which, was very unwise. What is more, he knows that he could not give effect to his threat, as this country would .not stand it. If the right honourable gentleman came down to-morrow with a proposal to give preference to some other country and not to Britain, he would cease to be Prime Minister. Britain has to be approached very cannily. If we are able to congratulate the right honourable gentleman on having secured extended preference in regard to sugar goods, dried fruits, and one or two other lines, we shall indeed have much for which to be thankful. In her own interests, Britain ought to give us preference on our wheat and meat; it would be a sensible thing for her to do. But we are the sellers of these things, and we must try to convert her, not threaten that if she does not buy from us we shall take our custom elsewhere. No one else can buy our goods, or they would have been taken long ago. I agree entirely with what the right honourable gentleman said in regard to migration. He did not, however, tell us what he proposes. Does he propose to say to Britain, "" What is the use of dealing with this great matter in this tin-pot way; what is the use of giving £3,000,00:') when we want £100,000,000?"" Britain could not £200,000,000 in any better way than on great public works here, on which her streams of immigrants and our own citizens would be employed. It would solidify the Empire, strengthen her credit, and make it certain that Australia would be her best customer; because every man she sends here is a potential buyer of British goods. £100,000,000 or even £200,000,000 are small sums to spend on the development of such a vast continent as this. Let the right honourable gentleman speak boldly. This is the psychological moment for pressing for Australia's development. There is room here for ' America could not many millions if an active public works policy can be entered upon. Every one who comes to Australia from Great Britain becomes at once. a defender and a customer of that country. The Prime Minister has said, that the forthcoming Conference is to be the most important 'ever held. That has been said of other similar gatherings. Many of the matters to which he has referred have been settled long ago. It is the duty of the right honourable gentleman to attend the Imperial Conference because these gatherings strengthen the ties of Empire, and enable the representatives of the different Dominions to become well informed on questions of Empire concern. This Conference, like former assemblies of the kind, has been summoned to consider questions of great importance. It is proposed that this Parliament should go into recess while the Prime Minister is absent in England. But why should it not be allowed to continue at work? If it was my duty to remain here to carry on when Mr Fisher was Prime Minister, during what was probably the most strenuous session Parliament has ever experienced, it is the duty of the present Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) to lead this Parliament while the right honourable member for Flinders is away. In 1916, after the outbreak of war, I visited Great Britain, and Parliamentremained in session during my absence; in 1919, Parliament sat while I was away. I was absent for fourteen months. In 1921 I again visited England, and this Parliament continued at work. It is true that my presence here was urgently spend £100,000,000 or needed, and some of the supporters of the present Government, the gentlemen' who are now on the Corner benches, sent me a telegram to return home. They felt that without me this Parliament was a bleak and desolate place. But the Parliament was open, and the work of the country was being carried on. I have given briefly the history of previous Conferences, which shows that it has been the hitherto unbroken practice for ment to remain in session while the Prime Minister is absent. closed. We are naturally a little -at least I am-to know why this should be. This is a new era, and, it coincides with the "" restoration of responsible government!"" formed not long ago that the odious condition of affairs which had so long existed in the country was to cease, and that the days of government by one man had passed. aspirations! have passed away, and Parliament sat for only two months, and is now on the verge of recess.

Here is his golden opportunity. was to lead the way in the New State movement, -and set in order the House which for years has been inhabited by bandits and men of no reputation at all.

So far from censuring the right honourable gentleman for having the Conference fixed at a time to suit himself, I say that that was quite a proper thing for h i m to do. It is proper that a great Dominion like this should have its convenience consulted, just as the convenience of Great Britain herself is considered. If the time suggested was inconvenient for the right honourable gentleman, it was quite righ t to have it fixed for a suitable time. But having done that, as he did, I do not think he should then put the fact forward as a reason why the House is not to meet on account of the time fixed for the Conference. The right honourable gentleman was perfectly within his rights in having his convenience consulted, and declaring that he was going to visit England at a certain time-that if they at Home did not iike it they could "" l u m p . it .

I apologize to the House for the length of time. I have occupied its attention. The debate is one of the utmost possible i m portance. I have endeavoured in the time at my disposal to cover the ground, and some repetition has been inevitable. It has been quite impossible to deal in due proportion with all the subjects set out in the agenda-paper, but I have done what I could... I hope that the Prime Minister, when he goes to England, will sec to it that everything is done in such a way as to make impossible a recurrence of those unfortunate troubles that have in the past nearly led us to war. I can only repeat unless and u n t i l there is such improved communication as will enable Australia and England to be in touch with one another, so that events may be immediately known throughout the Empire, no effective remedy can be found. Sitting suspended from 6.28 to 8 p.m. state of the House. This afternoon honourable members were obliged to listen to the declaration of a policy of gloom, in connection w i th international matters, from the right honourable member for No r t h Sydney( Mr W. M . Hughes). The speech delivered by the Prime Minister' ( Mr Bruce) last week was equally uninspiring and depressing. The statement of their views concerning the subjects to be discussed at the Imperial and Economic Conferences may be regarded as convincing evidence that they can offer the world nothing better than war, and more war, involving greater sacrifices of life, heavier burdens of debt, tears, and anguish for mankind, and, afterwards, difficulties and chaos in our social life. The policy propounded by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton), on the other hand, is one of hope and an inspiration to a greater nationhood. It is a declaration to the world that, whilst we are prepared to provide adequately for tlie defence of this country against aggression, we do not desire to adopt the Old World's conception of National advanceI ment by the power of military might, but prefer rather to advance by the noble example of an industrious and peaceloving people;. It is my intention to place on record some of the glaringly inconsistent statements made by both the Prime Minister and the right honourable member for North Sydney, and at the same time to emphasize the attitude taken up by the Australian Labour party concerning the futur e of the Commonwealth in its relation to Empire problems. The right honourable member for No r t h 'Sydney said that it had long been recognised by the British Government that the Commonwealth had a right to an equal voice in Empire affairs. He declared, in fact, that we have in the Councils of Empire an influence equal to that which we have in our own domestic concerns. It is a fact, however, that in many respects Australia is not master of its own destiny. There isa limitation of the powers of self-government which, unfortunately, certain of our leading public men of to-day have permitted, and for which they are solely responsible. On occasions this Parliament has been required to accept, without quali[Quorum formed.""] fication and without the opportunity of introducing amendments, legislation dictated by the British Government.

The Prime Minister last we cannot place very much reliance upon the Prime Minister's declaration that if He seemed to be in we have an equal voice in the direction of Imperial foreign policy we shall enjoy a feeling of greater security. A statement by the late John Bright, BeforeI resume m y seat I although made many years ago, is specially applicable to the position of the Commonwealth to-day. It probably wasf u l l y justified at that time, but it is a thousand times more justified to-day. It more firmly confirms me in my opinion As an Australian, I do of the position in which we find ourselves. It also gives the Australian people an idea of the conception that even leading British statesmen in those times had of The what would be a sane, logical, and justifiable policy for the Dominions to pursue. Mr John Bright was one of the greatest and most revered of British statesmenI quote from a speech he delivered on 28th March, '1888. He saidNowI should like to ask the Federation people whether the Colonies of this countryCanada and the many Colonies, ithe great Colonies tliat cluster in the South Pacific, the Australian Colonies-whethe r they think, that these Colonies will, be willing to bind themselves to the stupid foreign policy of the willing to undertake the responsibility of entering into war, the seat of which is 10,000 miles away, and dn which they cannot have the slightest influence or interest, and when they may hot -have been in thc least consulted as to the cause of quarrel for which this country was rushing into war? In my opinion, tbe Colonies will never stand a policy of that kind I IfI was a Canadian, or ""Victorian, or New South Wales man, or Queenslander, or New Zealander, I would take good care, as -far as I was concerned, that my voice sliould never go in favour of any connection whatever with those complications in the foreign policy of the Government of the Mother Country.

IfI know the feelThose words should be taken to heart by the public men of this country. The opinion therein expressed would be in dorsed, I believe, by the people of Australia. The right honourable member for No r t h Sydney( MrW . M . Hughes) this This policy is quite afternoon asked what were the privileges with thab of a progresto be desired that we did not now enjoy,, Many of the events and what were the powers required that we did not now possess. My answer of the is that we have no power and no effective In view of these facts, voice in the formulation of the I m p e r i al policy on foreign affairs, nor can we anticipate it , because those who are in the secret conclave which determines B ritish foreign policy are not prepared to allow even the most trusted members of their own Government to know what their intentions are. That being so, is it likely that they w ill permit the Dominions of the Empire to leax'n their views. policy is at present effectively directed by the agents of big commercial and financial concerns of GreatB r it a in , in which they are interested, and they are determined that they shall retain f u l l power to enable these concerns to exploit, not only the English-speaking race, but also the people of foreign countries when the opportunity offers. These British financiers and controllers of commercial interests have proved time after time that they are prepared to invest' their capital and place their trade in foreign countries, without giving thought to the desirableness of supporting Australia or the other Dominions, if by so doing they can obtain extra profits and dividends, or a higher rate of interest than they can obtain in the British Dominions. stanced in the case in which Austria was afforded by British financiers prior consideration to the claims of Queensland. It is for these reasons that the makers and breakers of foreign, policies are not prepared to give to a young Democracy such as Australia any opportunity of effective consultations. this position. have the opportunity, as a free people, to determine our own. course without entering into the entanglements of the foreign policy fixed by the British Government. When the right honourable member for No r t h Sydney was Prime Minister, he went to GreatB r it a in to attend an Imperial Conference to t r y to bring about a more satisfactory state of affairs, so that Australia might have, an effective voice in the settlement of the .Imperial foreign policy. A t the last Conference attended by him, it was agreed that Australia and the other Dominions should be consulted as to, and in formed of, the lines GreatB r it a in proposed to follow in fixing her foreign treaties and agreements. Prime Minister( Mr Bruce), in discussing this aspect of the situation last week, saidThe importance of this was realized at the Conference of 1921. Mr Hughes, then Prime Minister of Australia, stressed that view more than anybody else, and it was owing to his representations, to a great extent, that action was taken to endeavour to evolve a method of keeping the Dominions informed of the proposals of the Imperial Government. The decision was reached that the Dominions The formulation of foreign should be regularly advised by the British Government on all matters of foreign policy, particularly those which might involve the Empire in war. The principle was laid down at that Conference that the Dominions must be kept fully informed, especially when the peace of the Empire was involved. Tbe British Government undertook to supply information regularly to the Prime Minister of each Dommion, and it has done so. Unfortunately, the system has not proved quite satisfactory. My reply to that statement is that the system was most unsatisfactory. Our experience last year with respect to the Near East proved the absurdity of the agreement reached at the 1921 Imperial Conference. We became involved in a serious international indiscretion committed by the ex-PrimeM i nister of Great Britain. The indiscretion was countenanced and endorsed by This was especially in the right honourable member for North Sydney, who was then PrimeM in ister of the Commonwealth. This afternoon the right honourable gentleman expressed a .sham indignation that certain papers relating to the Near Eastern situation had not been tabled by the Prime Minister, in order that the We must face whole facts could be placed before honorI feel that we should able members. I concur in the view that the cablegrams should be tabled and made available to honourable members; but the attitude adopted by the right honourable member for North Sydney this afternoon is most inconsistent with his attitude of 22nd September of last year. The right honourable member attempted to-day to obtain a point of vantage against the present Prime Minister, because honourable members were denied the opportunity to peruse the file of papers dealing with the Near Eastern complications of last year. I refer honourable members to Hansard of 1922, page 2,612, to show what the right honourable member for North Sydney did when he was Prime Minister. The honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey) asked him on The present that date for information about the cablegrams, respecting the Near East, received by him. The reply recorded in Hansard wasI tell the honourable member and tbe House once more that I have no objection whatever to the Leader of the Opposition seeing these cablegrams, but I am not going to take the responsibility of running counter to the direct instructionthe Foreign Office that these cables are not to be read by anybody. They are not read by my own staff, and I am not going to nialse them public. public i u SouthA f r i c a. orable gentlemen occupying positions of public trusts in the Parliaments of South Africa and Canada were afforded an opportunity to peruse the files dealing with the Near Eastern situation. It ill became the right honourable member for North Sydney this afternoon to pose as one who desired to give honourable members of this Parliament an opj>ortunity to see such documents, because when he was Prime Minister he did not. Why did he not allow us to do so? He gave us the reason. He told us he had received a direct instruction from the British Poreign Ofiice that the information was not to be made available, even to a trusted Parliament such as this is, but was to between Office. When honourable members realise that have occurred, they will know that we are not the masters of our own business, and that we do not determine, to the extent that is generally understood, the conditions of international policy foreign relationship. The right honourable the Prime Minister, and also the right honourable member for No r t h Sydney, who are declared Imperialists, endeavoured to make xis believe that we were our own masters. not. perial Conferences should be held annually, or as frequently as would suit the convenience of the Prime Ministers of the various Dominions. I am afraid that they may ultimately merge into a form of Imperial Parliament that will possess all the features of Imperial Federation. We should realize that Imperial Federation is conceived out of a passion for ostentation and aggrandizement. Prime Minister and the right honourable member for North Sydney would both be prepared to lend a willing ear to special pleadings for an Imperial Federation, even if it meant sacrificing or subordinating many of the glorious principles of the Australian Democracy. It is regrettable that the right honourable the Prime Minister was not courageous enough to give us some definite statement last week. I agree w it h the right honourable member for North Sydneyi n this respect, that we had a right to expect a lead from the Government as to what should be their attitude towards many of the great questions that will engage the attention I understand that honof the Imperial Conference. A t least, we might have expected some declaration as to the policy of the Government in this respect, but apparently the right honourable gentleman is fearful of the conse1 quences of openly declaring his adherence to the principles of Imperial Federation, with all its entanglements, for which Australia would have to pay dearly. He has avoided the issue. He w ill proceed to London to do his own sweet w ill , or rather that of a Government which, as we know, is required to obey the dictates of the commercial and financial interests of Australia, just as the British Government is required to do the bidding of Imperia l financiers and men of commerce. Our first duty is to be be treated as confidential as loyal to our own country, which gives us himself and the Foreign breath, sustenance, and sheltering homes. Instead of concerning ourselves w it h prosuch . circumstances as these blems affecting Australia, Parliament is expected to go into recess and wait until the Prime Minister, after settling all the questions of Empire, returns to devote the fag end of his time and to the difficulties with which the Government and Parliament of Australia have to contend. When we realize the heavy burdens placed on us by the war, the difficulties under which we are labouring to-day, and the great injustices which The facts prove that we are exist even in this enlightened Democracy, It was proposed that these I m it should be our concern, first of a l l , to set our own house in order, for only then can we give a lead or set an example to other nations. The Imperialism expressed by the Prime Minister and the right honourable member for No r t h Sydney is the very antithesis of Democracy. That is a cardinal truth we should never forget.

62,Mr Makin,"Australia than are our public men of today. They'faced the question of the defence of Australia with a better. spirit. They declared its right to proceed with its development, free from the entanglement of foreign policies, and free to determine its own future according to the desires of its own people. Among the trusted men who gave expression to pronounced views in this regard were the late Chief Justice Higinbotham and the late Mr J. L. Purves, QC. With many others, they were outspoken in their declaration that the interests of Australia were paramount, and must not be subordinated to those of Imperialism. Even Sir Henry Parkes, whom I shall quote a little later, declared that Australia was well fitted to work out its own destiny, and that it would be to its advantage to keep away from the of Imperial foreign relations. A t this stage I shall quote the views of a journal that formerly had great influence in the political concerns of the Commonwealth. I do not know that it has the same influence to-day, although at times it makes desperate efforts to reassert its importance. I speak of the Melbourne Age. In its columns on the 15th June, 1888, appeared the following: So far, indeed, from receiving any commercial advantages from the (English) connection, it would not be difficult to show that commercially speaking, the colonies would be better off without it , for as long as we are involved in the wars of the Empire we shall be exposed to the risks and interruptions of trade which they inevitably bring in their train. The Agei n those days even went further than many of us are prepared to go today. The article proceededPecuniarily speaking, it may be doubted whether separation would not be ultimately the most profitable policy for all parties; for the Mother Country would then be spared the expense of defending the colonies, and tbe colonies would not be put to the trouble ..of defending themselves. In other words, the Age declared that as the result of separation we should not be-required to defend any indiscretions that might be committed by Imperial statesmen. painter "" article. compare the attitude adopted by the Age at that time with its present attitude we can see that not only many public men of this continent, but also certain sections .of the press, are drifting to-day towards Imperial Federation. I do not profess to subscribe to the whole' of the declaration of the Age in 1888, but I say that there is some wholesome truth in the paragraph I have read. Victoria, was alive at that time. article the Age is getting back again to its former attitude. agreeably surprised when I read in its leading article this morning its declaration of hostility to any policy that would involve Australia in any form of Im perial defence, and its assertion that any defence system of Australia should be Australian armed and Australian conentanglements trolled. However, it is well to place on record the view it expressed in earlier years. The Prime Minister is going to England to an Imperial Conference allegedly to determine matters of foreign policy. In a moment of crisis we shall be expected to swallow without protest what has been done, and if a blundering Imperial statesman involves us in war we shall be expected to make contributions in men and money. The Prime Minister is to discuss with Imperial statesmen and the statesmen of other Dominions the question of Imperial defence.. Last week he told us that at one time there was a suggestion that a Dominion unit should operate in the'Pacific, and that all the Dominions should contribute towards its cost and maintenance. It was at least one direction, in which the House had a slight indication of the policy of the Government, because the right honourable gentleman said, "" I think Australia would welcome that to-day."" That is to say, he thinks we should participate in a Dominion scheme of defence for the Pacific. In this connection I believe the Melbourne Age this morning closely voiced the opinion of the people of Australia. It would be well for the right honourable gentleman to realize that while the people of Australia are willing to accept the responsibility for defending It was, and when we their country, the provision in that regard must be entirely Australian owned and controlled. The people themselves have definitely expressed their opinion in favour of this policy. The right",40,Imperialand Economic Conferences Subjects Listed For Discussion

67,Mr Makin,"I confess that I washonorable gentleman must realize the heavy burden that the people of the Commonwealth carry because of their unmistakable loyalty and manifest devotion to the Empire. to liquidate the war debt must be paid by many generations to come. But the sacrifice the people made in their loyalty to the Empire was not only a nnancial one; thousands of our bravest and best citizens It would be wrong to place Australia under an obligation to take part in any upheavals likely to arise from the chaotic and volcanic conditions of Europe to-day. I should like to place on record Australia's financial obligations as the result of the Great War; but before any financial circumstance is considered there should always be held in mind that sacrifice of Australia's youth, for which no form of monetary compensation can ever be regarded as adequate. . Those who left, these shores at that time were very desirable and acceptable citizens of Australia. Comparing the position of the Commonwealth to-day with that of 1914, the figures are startling, and surely should compel us to decline to become involved in wars in other parts of the world except wi,th the approval of the people of the Commonwealth. debt of the Commonwealth and States was £336,781,121; and in 1922 it ' was £922,951;136. taxation per head of population in 1914 was £4 13s. 9d., and in 1922, £12 5s. Id. We have come to the limit of those financial obligations that can be accepted if the Australian people are to continue to enjoy any measure of comfort and obtain the advantages of the _ existing economic conditions. tralia, as far as her obligation to participate in any scheme of Empire defence is concerned, is undertaking her full share, to the extent that she is prepared to defend Australia, which comprises, I understand, one-third of the Empire. prepared to fully protect their country agaiust the aggression of foreign nations they will more than comply with their rightful obligations. Prime Minister will not be prepared to involve Australiain any further expenditure of money, such as would be occa-' sioned if we accepted the proposal to make Mr Makin. Australia a unit in a scheme of Empire defence in the Pacific, to the cost of which she should subscribe a quota. The statement by the Prime Minister that the The taxation required Washington Conference was not the success that was anticipated is an absolute condemnation of the present-day system by anticipating the renewal of war. While the right honourable gentleman may endeavour to make Australian sacrified their lives. people believe that some great service will be rendered to this country by the establishment of the Singapore Base and the consequent obligation to contribute to its eost, I feel that this move on the part of Imperial statesmen is likely to strain the cordial relations existing between Great Britain and certain foreign Powers. Japan is not without justification for her declaration of fear as to the intention of Great Britain in proposing to place at Singapore a Naval Base to govern the Pacific. It can have significance to only one country, that great nation of Japan, with which England is allied. To-day, in spirit, we are continuing for an indefinite period the advantages of the AngloJapanese Alliance'. Right in the very face of this friendly association we are In 1914, the total inspiring fear and suspicion by this proposal. Japan is justified in feeling that it is a direct insult to her, and a reflection The total amount of on her integrity and honesty of purpose, so far as the British race is concerned. I hope that our statesmen, before it is too late,will realize the indiscretion of such a proposal. It should 'be more becoming of Great Britain and the Dominions to devote their influence to a further extension of the scheme of Ausinternational arbitration provided for by the League of Nations, and the inauguration of other international gatherings, to bring about a. better understanding between nation and nation, rather than to build up fortifications and armaments, which inevitably must bring war, sacriIf the Australian people are fice, distress, and also heavy burdens on those who have to accept the consequences.

Imperial comI hope that the mercialism has turned to the task of economic mobilization with multiplied enthusiasm, which will precipitate its victims into the whirlwind of war, bringing in its train disaster, tears, and anguish. to the sacrifices and difficulties at all times occasioned hy war. That is the reason why Labour places on record its policy that it is desirable to promote world peace, and, consistently w i th Australia's good-will to her kindred overseas, declares its readiness to take f u l l responsibility for Australia's defence, but is opposed to the raising of forces for service outside the Commonwealth, or promise of participation in futur e overseas wars, except by a decision of the people. the honourable member get the decision of the people? obvious Prime Minister made use of the words "" obvious PrimeM in is t e r"" is that the right honourable gentleman used the word "" obvious"" so frequently in his speech last week that I felt that everything would be quite obvious to him , and to some of his obvious supporters. The words "" by a decision of the people,"" are surely selfexplanatory. I desire to place on record a declaration of the Parliament of Canadai n respect of defence. I find, in the Empire, volume 4, No. 2, page 285, the following resolution:In the opinion of this Housei t is expedient fco declare that, save in the case of actua\ invasion, the Dominion of Canada shall not be committed to participation in any wav without the consent of the Parliament oi Canada. That is akin to the declaration made by the Leader of the Labour party in this House, and consistent with the pronouncement of the British Parliamentary Labour party. The spirit of Canada is in keeping with that of the Australian Democracy, and I am pleased that we are in such excellent company. Our desire is, not to participate in oversea war, but rather to promote principles of peace and good-will. Federation, the late Sir Henry Parkes, was able to effectively deal w it h the defence requirements tralia. He did not approve of placing Australia,in respect of its defence and will prove to be the true growing spot of protection, under any obligation to, or Imperial Federation. The workers. are subject subject to the dictation of, the Imperial Government. A f t e r returning from one of his famous European tours, he referred to Australia in this wise:Distance from other Powers would alone be to her tbe element of immense strength. She has already learnt to rely on herself for the means of armed defence. Unitedly she could pour upon any point large bodies of enthusiastic defenders without being under the necessity pf burdening herself with standing armies. She could easily create a navy adequate to her wants. Within her own shores she would possess all that is necessary to keep the machinery of civilized society going with the minimum of privation and inconvenience. In the possible case of being cut oft"" from the In what way would rest of the worlda very remote probabilityshe could, better than any other country on What has he in mind? the face of the globe, sustain herself. Those words were most ' prophetic, and they justify the opinion of the Labour party, that if Australia had to defend The reason why I itself against foreign aggression it would be able to do so. I now t u r n to the question of Imperial preference. I take it that this is the ""star"" item of the Prime Minister's list of subjects for discussion at the Imperial Conference. It was not the desire of the British statesmen that it should be placed on the agenda-paper, but, in consequence of the urgent request of the right honourable gentleman, it was listed for discussion. It may be well to remind some of the most rabid Imperialists that the Journal of Parliaments of Great Britain's consideration for Australia was observed simultaneously with the increased prosperity of this country and the decreased export trade of Britain. Australia is now Britain's second best customer, and Britain, therefore, has begun to take some little notice of the concerns of the Commonwealth. You, Mr Speaker, are not altogether unfamiliar with what Imperial Federation might mean to Australia, because at one time you were associated with the general council, of the Imperial Federation Leaguei n Victoria. That organization declared emphatically its views concerning the subordination .of Australia's in terests to those of Great Britain. In January, 1911, the Imperial Federation League issued a pamphlet, to which Mr. The great father of E.

Britain has the advantage of preference to the extent of £8,750,000 with respect to imports from the United Kingdom, while Australia enjoys a preference from Great Britain amounting to only £1,660,000. is not correct in making that comparison.

If I were you, I would push matters witb Fillmore, who has no interest to pander to the populace like Webster, and make an honourable and speedy settlement. It is interesting to discover that such a distinguished statesman as Disraeli considered that such countries as Australia were merely a millstone round the neck of Great Britain, and that it would be a good thing when Britain was r i d of us. It now happens, however, that we are the second best customers of Great Britain, and certain Imperial statesmen are preT h e Prime Minister's pared to take some interest; but unfortunately that interest f a r too often is calculated on the sordid basis of trade. Little sentiment has entered into Britain's trade relationship w i th Australia. If it came to a choice between Australia and India, I should not be surprised if preference were shown to India, because it is Great Britain's best customer. member believe that Britain's interest in us is purely commercial ? tent; and the fact is shown by the declarations of British statesmen from time.

He saidWe have been offered trade treaties by practically every country of any standing in the world. Those countries are quite prepared to give us preferential treatment of our primary produce in exchange for preference for their manufactured goods which come into Australia.

83,Mr Makin,"V e r y well. In hisThe right honourable member for North Sydney remarked that the PrimeM in ister, in stating that Australia could enter into trade treaties with this or that country, had conveyed a wrong idea. He said that if the Prime Minister went to the country with a policy like that, he would not have come back as Prinie Minister because the people had pronounced in favour of preference being given to GreatB r it a in . In his concluding remarks, the righ t honourable gentleman declared that, if the position was as the Prime Minister had stated, it was the duty of the Government to avail themselves of tlie opportunities that had been presented. right honourable 'member cannot have it both ways; either he supports trade arrangements with other countries or he does not. His attitude is illogical and inconsistent. I say definitely that, if the countries indicated by the Prime Minister were prepared to accept our products, it was the duty of the Government, in the interests of our primary, producers, to conclude trade agreements with them. If we are not unduly in fluenced by Imperial statesmen in connection w i th foreign policy, Australia may ultimately become master of her own business. Canada, by effecting a trade agreement w i th the United States of It should be possible for the Commonwealth to conclude trade agreements w it h other countries without prejudicing her position as a self-governing Dominion. I hope that something in this direction may be done, and that it may be possible to say of Australia, if not of the EmpireGod bless our native land; May Heaven's protecting hand Still guard our shore; May peace her powers extend, Foe be transformed to friend; And Britain's rights depend On war no more. May just and righteous laws Uphold the publio cause, And bless our isle. Home of the brave and free : The land of Liberty; We pray that still on the Kind Hoaven may smile. The speech made by the right honourable for the Empire foreign policy. If the the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) last Prime Minister had come to this House week was one of the gloomiest to which I have listened in this Chamber. It appeared to be concerned only with the eternal question of war, and still more war. Honourable members were led to believe, early in the session, that they would be afforded an opportunity of expressing an opinion upon certain definite principles to be advocated by the PrimeM in ister, as the mouth-piece of Australia, at full the forthcoming Conferences. We were given to understand that the Leader of the Government would place definite proposals before the House. That has not been done. I cannot see how the Prime Minister can claim to represent Australian sentiment at the Conferences, because The honourable members have had no opportunity of registering their opinions upon the questions that w ill be dealt with in London. The Prime Minister has admitted that, as to the things that really count, he is not sure of his position. He mentioned as one of the probabilities, that, in future, Australia might have a resident Ministeri n GreatB r it a in , or that there should be a secretariat at the War Office. H is speech last week was somewhat similar to his remarks in the short session earlier in the year when replying to the censure motion. On that occasion, he mentioned about 250 problems which, he said, had to be solved, but he offered no solution to any of them. America, has set an example. We are in much the same position to-day concerningthe matters to be dealt w i th at the approaching Imperial Conferences. Judged by former gatherings of this nature, Australia is not likely to reap any substantial benefit from the Imperial Conferences this year. We have been told that if we remain w it h in the E m pire, we cannot avoid the responsibility of participating in its foreign policy, and that the alternative is to get out of the Empire. I am not going to express an opinion about the latter course, because I do not think that question is involved. I believe that the Dominions, as part and parcel of a far-flung Empire, can function satisfactorily, and at the same time keep clear of the entangling effects of British foreign policy. If the position is as the Prime Minister states it I do not admit that it is-ther e may be very good reason why Australia should stand clear, and not be in any sense responsible",44,Members Hear Hear Him I N This Matter I Trust That Thc
84,Mr Lazzarini (Werriwa) [9.20],"with a definite statement of policy for the solution of our difficulties, honorahle members could have debated the position on its merits. We have been told, however, that if we do not become identified w it h Empire foreign policy, we might as well get out of the Empire altogether. I do not agree that the Prime Minister's diagnosis of the Imperial position is correct. He told ns that the component parts of the Empire must grow closer together, and he then mentioned the possibility of the Government appointing a resident Ministeri n London. I cannot see how we can grow closer together with out taking a definite step in the direction of Imperial Federation. I point out, however, that when the test came, in 1914, the Empire, without the existence then of definite Imperial relationships, now suggested as necessary, stood solidly together. I should like to know what the Prime Minister means by his references to this phase of our Imperial relations. His statement, like opinions expressed by interested statesmen in Great Britain, lacks frankness. much better if the Prime Minister had come to this House w it h a definite policy concerning onr association w it h Imperial foreign policy, and had intimated that he intended to advocate a certain course of action at the forthcoming Conferences. I believe there is something more in this proposal than merely commercial interests. The tendency in all the debates in the B ritish Parliament is towards some system of Imperial Federation. I quote the following from Strathspey in the British Parliament on 1st March:Every Home question was an Empire question. Every Empire question was a Home question. That was why he wanted to see the English Houses' of Parliament in reality Imperial Chambers, just as the race was Imperial in blood and ideals. Colonial members permanently living in this country and representadopt such a policy. We ought surely ing the great Colonies could save the Empire from the catastrophe of misunderstanding. He pleaded, therefore, for the establishment of a lead to a war, and we should have some truly Imperial Parliament, and not merely an English Parliament. Many of the speeches in the Hansard Because the Labour party believe that, it from which I took that extract are on the is not willing to pledge Australia to take same lines. I believe the purpose behind part in any war outside Australia in this move is ultimately some form of Imperial Federation. Britain cannot be concerned only with spent to save us from trouble; we, therecommercial interests, for she has now all fore, should be prepared to fight. If the concessions that are possible to her Mr Lazzarini. under any form of Imperial relationship. I see behind this the mark of militarism. For that reason I wish the Prime Minister would be more definite, and tell us exactly what he means when he speaks of the necessity for a closer unity and a tightening of relations between Great Britain and the Dominions. I was astounded' to hear the remark of the right honourable member for No r t h Sydneya remark which was applauded -that , in his opinion, it was inconceivable that Great Britain could go to war without this country automatically becoming engaged in that war. Let honourable members realize what that means. The Prime Minister told us frankly the other day that, a httle while ago, owing to an unfortunate mistake by the then British PrimeM in ister, we were very nearly at war again. The right honourable member for North Sydney said that only by a miracle was war averted. Miracles very seldom happen, but we are told that a miracle prevented this war. We must realize, therefore, that, except for a miracle, we should It would have been once more have been engaged in bloodshed in the Near East. And why? Not simply because a Prime Minister blundered, but because there were valuable oil wells in the Near East. Lord Curzon, who was closely in touch with matters at that time, told the people that the object for which we might have been at war was not worth the firing of a shot, the spending of a shilling, or the killing of a man. He said it was a frivolous matter altogether. Yet what appeared to him to be a speech by Lord paltry reasons might have involved this country in all the bloodshed and sacrifices of another war. The right honourable member for North Sydney tells us that, had GreatB r it a in gone to war, then ipso facto this country also would have had to go to war. That doctrine is monstrous. Australia cannot afford to to know something about the causes that reasonable purpose in our minds before we pledge the country to support a war. to bring about which the Empire is concerned.

In my opinion, it is a mistake to talk of a League of Nations. We have nothing so f a r but a league of some nations. While some countries refuse to j o in the League, and others are not permitted to j o in it , the so-called League of Nations is nothing but an alliance or entente between a few of the leading nations of the world. President Wilson's conception was that it was to be -a league ofall the ° nations of the world, including the victors as well as the defeated, in the GreatWar. The United States of America was' all-powerful at the end of the war, inasmuch as it had not suffered from the raA ages of war as the other nations had. r If it had chosen to j o in the League, we could have got ridof war.

During We should last Parliament the Hughes Government ( Mr permitted a reduction in the Defence something more than vague Estimates, and I thought that the temper of the'worl d as displayed at the WashHe certainly ington Conference would have induced the present Government to make still f u r or of Austher reductions in those Estimates, but, Nothing has been put before this after hearing the Prime Minister and the No honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr. Marks) the other day, one would think upon that the war spirit in Australia was becoming more strongly pronounced than The maze of speeches here and ever, and that we must still go on in the about Imperial relarush for armaments. It is proposed that screen-I the British Empire shall unite so that its Forces w ill operate jointly under one plan or scheme in any future war. When the German Government started on its mad rush to build up a navy, and the arrangeother nations realized that the pressure was becoming too great, a Disarmament through Conference was held at The Hague. A t The Prime that Conference the German delegates held that the naval strength of the coloHe nies of Great Britain should be taken into consideration' in arriving at the naval strength of the British Empire.

T h is a r t i c l e is dealing w it h the state of E u r o p e before 1914, and sayaAs every Continental Power under the pre-war system of the balance of power became more highly organized for war, as the whole of every nation was conscribed and put in training down to the last button and the last man, time became an increasingly important factor. Military numbers ceased to be the most important thing. The army which could mobilize quickest, and strike an effective blow first, would win the war, because it would destroy its opponent's capacity to fight before it was ready for action. Thusi t was, as was pointed out in this review in 191.5, that the terrible time-table of the European General Staffs had far more to do with the actual outbreak of the world war than the deliberate decision of any man or Government. Europe had l.iecome an armed camp under the impulse of German ambition. The crisis was precipitated by the decision of the Cabinets of Vienna and Berlin to take theopportunity afforded by the assassination of Franz Ferdinand to attempt, by means of a forty-eight hours u l t imatum, to win a diplomatic victory, which would mean the establishment 'of an AustroGer.man hegemony over Serbia and the Balkans. There, .again, we see the dangerous nature of the game of bluff played by the diplomats. The Governments of Austria and Germany were not deliberately planning war, but were attempting to carry out a huge piece of diplomatic bluff-whic h would not have been attempted if the negotiations had not been carried on in secret. They bluffed to gain a diploand [30 JULY , 1923.] Economic Conferences. 1799 matic victory, and their attempt led to war. The article proceedsButi t is almost certain that no one, politician or general, deliberatelydecided to start the world war. It was the military timetable itself which swept .them, like everybody ' else, headlong into the struggle once the first button had been pressed. This was the march of eventsA t the same time that the u l t imatum was presented in Belgrade, the AustroHungarian Government ordered the mobilization of the southern part of the Austrian Army in order to prove that they meant business in their ultimatum, and would, if necessary, enforce it by occupying Belgrade: No sooner did the Austro-Hungarion Army mobilize than the Kussia.ii General Staff went to the Czar and pointed out that, if AustriaHungary were allowed' a start, and a general The. war grew out of the crisis, Eussia would start at an .immense disadvantage. They insisted, -therefore, that there must be a preliminary mobilization of the southern section of the Russian Army as a parallel move. T h is was s t ill b l u f f Immediately there was the utmost excitement in Berlin. The time-table moved onI f the Russian iarmy were allowed to mobilize, what would happen to the German plan for victory in the event of war? That plan depended entirely on the capacity of the German army to mobilize a few days faster than tlie French, and upon its being able to defeat .the French army before the Russians could .take the field in France. It. goes on to refer to frantic telegrams with which I will not weary the House. The writer concludes by sayingAnd this is a situation which must always arise where national security is based upon competitive armaments. The time w ill inevitably come when the deliberations of diplomats and statesmen w ill be rudely broken into by considerations of military necessity, and nations will be rushed headlong into war whether tbey want it or not. The article then elaborates the sequence of these happenings., showing clearly that the statement is true. ETo one will question the honesty of the magazine itself. The article was compiled from Blue-Books and from different secret documents relating to the war. We see clearly that the Great War of 1914 was the result, as are most wars, of secret diplomacy, For that reason, I regret that the Prime Minister has definitely stated that the Government cannot depart in any way from the policy of secret 'diplomacy, and that it must continue. The policy of immigration will be extensively -dealt"" with at the Imperial Conference. spired articles in tlie press, that during his stay in GreatB r it a in the PrimeM in 27th March, saidister intends to visit many important centres in the B r it is h Isles on a.mission of immigration.

The Briti sh view-point in respect of i m migration is alarming. One gleans from reports published in the press of the deIbates of the House of Commons, that many British statesmen are earnestly looking to Australia as an outlet for, not only people who wish to settle on its lands, but also Britain's surplus' population. I shall read extracts from speeches in order to show that I have some reason for making this statement. The Secretary oi the Overseas Trade Department, Lieut. ColonelA . Buckley, on 27th March last, speaking of the best type of immigrant to send to Australia, and dealing with the sending out of boys, single men, and married men w i th families, saidThe last class is the married men with famicountry spent on the war. It has come lies, and here you have thc ideal person to to this-that cold cash is the only consettle in a new country. The husband and sideration. wife take the children out with memories of the Old Country and look after them and bring them up, not so much as citizens of the new Dominions, but with closer feelings towards right honourable member for No r t h the Old Country than orphan children and Sydney? other young people will have. That statement emphasizes the fact that member should make his own speech. I families are to be sent out to Australia am putting my own interpretation on the in order that the children w ill be brought speech of the right honourable member for up, not so much as patriots of Australia, No r t h Sydney. In making that statebut imbued w i th B r i tish Imperialistic ment, he made no reference to the 60,000 ideas. £7th March, Colonel Alexander, Napity was for the £400,000,000 spent, and tional Liberal member, saidThe master key to the .solution, of Empire came back maimed, if one may judge by settlement and unemployment rested, first, the nature of their treatment.

If normal emigration were likely to start again .the problem would be largely settled. Those statements clearly show the trend If the Prime Ministeri n of thought and the nature of the propaganda existing in GreatB r it a in . We know from the result of debates which have taken place in this House, and the declarations and statements made by many of the immigrants who come to this country, that the present scheme of immigration is meant to tickle the ears of the people. The. policy of immigration for land settlement is so much camouflage in order to obtain funds from this Parliament and the State Parliaments to bring out any one who w ill help to reduce the existing economic conditions of the workers of this country. The right honourable member for No r t h Sydney, i u his speech this afternoon, when expressing regret for some features of the war, referred only to the monetary loss. He spoke of the condition of Germany, and had pity for the German people. He said that there ought to have been some regret for the £400,000,000 which this In the House of Commons on soldiers who died for the Empire. H is not for the wounded and fallen.

86,' Mr Lazzarini,"The honorableus, and that it held that right only hy the non-exercise of it. I cannot understand -what he means. In a speech at Bendigo just prior to leaving for the last Imperial Conference, he made a definite statement which was reported in the press, -and whioh has been referred to in this House. It was to the effect that Australia had self-governing powers, and its people could make any laws they pleased; hut that a Parliament existed that could take all these rights from us, and no man could deny it. We are told to-day that there is a power that can take that right from us, and that that power is held only by the non-exercise of it . It would be interesting to know what is the attitude of the Prime Minister on this question. .What position will the right honorahle gentleman take up if there is an attempt in, future to exercise any such power ? It is very important that the people of Australia should know the exact position. It is absurd to ask us to believe that the power is held only because we know that it will not be exercised; It is well known that the Government have beerf interfered with at different times. As has been admitted by the ex-Prime Minister( Mr W. M. Hughes), the Government have, without murmur, taken direct instructions from the Imperial authorities. The Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page), too, confessed' that he had caused certain items to be excised from the official statistics of Australia on instruction from tlie Imperial Government, When the war was in progress, a Tariff was framed to deal with certain goods coming to Australia, but that Tariff never saw the light of day, because the Government were advised that it might interfere with the diplomatic negotiations of tbe Empire, and might offend an Allied Power. It is obviously idle to say that Australia has all the power it requires. The Government Bhould not be hampered as they evidently are. Debate (on motion by Mr BX^KBLKY) adjourned.
