That is about £1,900)000 less than the appropriation for the corresponding period of the last financial year; so that it will be seen that every attempt has been made to keep these votes well under the original Estimates.

The trouble is that the consideration of the Senate's requested amendments of the Tariff Bill is holding up other business and throwing our finances out of gear. There is nothing unusual in this Supply Bill, and I hope it will be agreed to without much debate. agree that the Treasurer should be granted Supply as early as possible, in view of the fact that honourable members will shortly have an opportunity of discussing any grievances when the Estimates are dealt with. In addition, we desire, if possible, to avoid' late sittings. colleagues that we have not such power. There is a disposition on the part of certain honourable members to sit on additional days and late, but a good deal of our time might have been saved, and we might have been further ahead with our business, but for the attitude of those very honourable members. In view of the promise of the Prime Minister that, before bringing in legislation to give effect to the decisions of the Premiers' Conference in regard to amending the arbitration laws he will consult the trade union bodies, my remarks will be very brief. I shall be careful not to condemn the proposal in view of the fact that the details are not before us, but the scheme does appear to be far reaching and to involve a complete change of arbitration procedure. In the past there has been no appeal from the finding of the Arbitration Court. Nowi t is proposed to establish a Court composed of Eederal and State Judges, which will have power to deal with two of the most important questions which arise in connection with arbitration, namely, the basic wage and the hours of labour. If they have comLarge plete jurisdiction over those matters, there will not be much left for other industrial Courts to deal with. In addition, we are told that the Court will decide what are State disputes and what In the meantime, this is the only are Federal. of appeals. will be, and probably the effect will be to we break down the system of arbitration.

In addition, provision is to be made for State instrumentalities to be removed from Commonwealth jurisdiction. For years we have been appealing to the people for power to deal with State instrumentalities in view of the ruling of the late Chief Justice Griffith and his Recently, however, the High Court, differently constituted, decided that thc Commonwealth had power to deal with State instrumentalities, and now the Government propose, of their own volition, to surrender that power.

Premiers' price. what it is, and I shall not discuss the merits of the proposal until the details are before us, but, on the face of it, it appears as if it is not likely to be satisfactory. However, until the different unions have had an opportunity of presenting their views to the Prime Minister and the legislation is actually before us for consideration, I shall refrain from further comment. During the last weekend I received the following telegram from the Town Clerk of Darwin:I am directed to convey Prime Minister rewho were sent overseas after having been solution passed meeting Darwin Town Council held 7th instant as follows:-"" A largelysigned petition by the unemployed of Darwin, received by the mayor, praying that the Federal Government be requested to provide immediate employment as the present state of the unemployed is very acute, amongst whom are many married men with large families, who are on the point of absolute starvation. The council wishes to point out that Christmas and the wet season is .close at hand, making the position worse, and sad, indeed. A copy of this telegram handed Administrator."" Apparently, many meu at Darwin are in a sorry plight, and they should receive special consideration from the Government, because they are practically isolated. They are not in close contact with the rest of Australia, Darwin is a most difficult place to get away from, aud there is no employment for them-pro bably through causes over which they had no coutrol. I ask the Government to give consideration to their circumstances, and see if anything can be done to relieve them. We are approaching the Christmas season, when everybody likes to have a little money to make conditions as bright as possible. Unemployed men cannot do that, and I am. satisfied that there would not have been a public meeting and a resolution such as I have read to the House unless the conditions justified that action. As the people of Darwin have no representation in this House, I deem it my duty to place this matter before the Minister for Home and Territories, with a request that Jie will make inquiries and do what is possible to relieve the distress at present existing at Darwin in consequence of unemployment. The Assistant Minister for Eepatriation ( Mr Eodgers) stated, in answer to a question to-day, that the Government propose to introduce during this session amendiug legislation relating to soldiers' pensions. I am very pleased to hear that pronouncement, and I hope that the legislation will be presented to the House reasonably early so that we can give the fullest consideration to this matter and have the opportunity of amending the Bill if necessary. The returned soldiers' cases call aloud for consideration by this Parliament, and I hope that the measure introduced by the Government will be liberal and will not permit the administration to deprive of their pensions men medically examined and accepted as fit for military service. The quibble about incapacitation not having been due to warlike services should be swept aside. The mere fact of the Government having accepted the services of any man after a medical examination ought to be sufficient to entitle him to a pension if , during his period of service, he suffered incapacity from any cause. I hope that the measure will be a ful l and comprehensive one, and will do that justice to the returned soldiers which they so much deserve. In view of the fact that the Estimates are to be discussed at an early date, I agree that this short Supply Bill might be allowed to pass speedily. I desire to emphasize the request made by my colleague to meet four days instead of three per week. The more speedily we dispose of the business of. the House the earlier will honourable members be able to return to their homes in order to spend, at any rate, a short period at Christmas with their families. per week?",25,Leasi Ng Of Ferry Boat Biloela Wargratuities Invalid Pensions Immigration Of Employees M Jewel

30,Mr Considine,"Why not sit five daysto do that if it w ill mean expediting the business. My furthe r remarks I w ill defer u n t i l the Bills which have been promised are before us. I endorse the remarks of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) with regard to the treatment of those men who were sent overseas, became in capacitated, and subsequently were deprived of their pensions. I trust that the B ill to be introduced by the Government w ill propose to give substantial relief to those men. To-day, however, I am concerned particularly w i th the case of Frank Dunn, of Marrickville. brother brought the matter before the State authorities, but could get no satisfactory reply. This man has made certain claims against the Defence Department. He says that he is entitled to a pension of -which, he has been deprived; but he has been told by correspondence over the name of the Secretary for Defence that he has no right to a pension. He has asked for leave to appeal to the Military Board, and I made-the request to the Department that the matter might be brought before the Boardf o r early finalizatipn; July, 1921, this request was declined. Consequently, the man has not been able to make his appeal, 'and complains that he is being illegally prevented from p u t t in g his claim before the Board. I do not know what the procedure is ; but if the man has the right to appeal to the Board no official should prevent him from making the appeal. He says that his pension has been illegally taken from h i m . H is discharge, which I have now before me, is a first-class one, in which his conduct is referred to as exemplary, the reason given for ' it being medical unfitness. It has been said by honourable members in all parts of the chamber that justice should be done to our returned soldiers, and I appeal to the Acting Minister for Defence( Sir Granville Ryrie) to allow this manto bring his case before the Military Board. If he is allowed to do so, he will be more satisfied than he is now, even should his claim be disallowed. But he, is confident that if he can put his case before the Board his pension will be restored. It has come to my knowledge within the last day or so that the Government I am prepared has inaugurated an economy stunt which takes the direction of curtailing expenditure in the Postmaster-General's Department, and that it is likely that the erection of telephone exchanges in the outer suburban areas of Melbourne and the other capitals, and other important postal works, may be held up. economy. I repeat what I have said before, being careless of press criticism on the subject, that if this or any other Government will come to Parliament with proposals for the expenditure, even of millions of pounds, for the extension of My postal and telephonic communication in country districts and city areas, I w ill support those proposals. The Railways Commissioners of Victoria, headed by a man imbued with American ideas for saving money, seem to be acting in a manner similar to that in which the Postmaster-General is acting. So long as the Postmaster-General's Department, which is a Federal one, and the Railways Commissioners, who control State concerns, work for the development of the country, I do not look for them to make a profit member is referring to is the legitimate investment of' capital, to which no one is opposed. Minister shut down on questions without notice to-day, I would have asked the Postmaster-General whether it is a fact that the Government have inaugurated this economy stunt. back the Government in regard to all proposals for legitimate expenditure on the Postal Department, even though there should be a deficit, so long as that expenditure will have .the effect of sendingthe country ahead. I 'am glad to have the assurance of the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook). I had understood that deputations had been told that the right honourable gentleman was sitting so tightly on the Treasury chest that there was no possibility of erecting telephone exchanp/es in the outer suburban areas.

It may be said that the Commission is administering a commercial undertaking, but it is also a Government undertaking; and to t u r n men out of these homes at this critical time would not benefit the Government, which must have regardfor the welfare of the citizens. I direct attention also to the desirability of the Government acquiring a block of land in Sydney as a site for Comfuge, as I shall show by reading a letter monwealth offices. been presented the report of the Public Works Committee on a proposal to erect a building in Oastlereagh-street for the accommodation of the Taxation officers and some other branches of Commonwealth Departments, and the proposal to move the General Post Office to another site is under consideration. Premises for the accommodation of Commonwealth officers are rented in all parts of Sydney. They coat us a considerable sum in rent, and it is most inconvenient for those who have occasion to visit a number of Commonwealth from one to another. strongly urge Ministers to consider whether it would not be the truest economy to not a whole block, not in the most central situation, but in a position easily accessible, where all or most of the Commonwealth offices 'could be concentrated. The waste of public money in the renting of premises in all the capitals is known to every member, and the erection of buildings on scattered sites will continue the inconvenience to which those are put who have business w i th Commonwealth Departments. It should be possible to direct a citizen wishing to go to a Commonwealtb. office to tbe Commonwealth buildings in the city in which he may be. It would greatly convenience the public, and mean a large saving to the taxpayer as the years went by, if most, if not all, of the Commonwealth offices in each capital were placed under one roof. [499] [4.3] -Whil e the Treasurer and Postmaster-General are both present, I wish to bring a matter of great importance and urgency before the Committee. ] Such treatment should not be have here a number of letters, resembling scores of others which I have been getting recently fro m the country parts of my electorate, complaining about delays in the erection of telephone lines. I cannot understand the departmental attitude towards these cases. Let me mention one that is typical of many others. When I make complaints to the Department on behalf of my constituents, I get the reply which I am sure goes to other country members as well, and probably to city members, too, that the line asked about cannot be proceeded with because material is not available. That excuse is a subterThere has recently sent by the Department to two of my constituents who wished to connect their homestead by telephone w i th the Narrandera Tost Office. The extension was agreed to by the Department on the condition that they should erect half the line at their own cost, the Department erecting the other half. They had no trouble in getting material, and erected their half of the line; but when, on their behalf, I asked why the Department was not going on with its half, I was told that material was not available. These gentlemen then asked me to get permission for them to erect the other Departments to go half of the line themselves, because they I therefore could find the necessary material. I obtained permission from the Department for them to do that which the Departacquire a considerable area, if ment said it could not do because of lack of material, and within a month the line was finished. This is a portion of the letter to them which was sent by the Department:With reference to your application for service to Narrandera Exchange from Station, I have to inform you that the material is not yet available to 'erect the departmental portion of the line. As an alternative, the Department is prepared to allow you to provide the material and erect your private line on the Government poles to within 1 mile of the Narrandera Exchange, under Part XVI . of the Begulations. Every day we get the excuse from the Department that they cannot provide these facilities, which mean so much to people in outback places, because they cannot get wire. I want to expose that position. Private people can get wire. There seems to be no scarcity of it .",27,Leasi Ng Of Ferry Boat Biloela Wargratuities Invalid Pensions Immigration Of Employees M Jewel
41,Mr Pabkeb Moloney (Hume),"Sir JOSEPH. COOK -Privat e people may very well have made use of some of their fencing wire. cannot use wire which does not come up to the standard laid down by the departmental regulations. I want to show how urgent the matter is, and how many people are affected, by reading a reply forwarded to me in answer to representations I had made concerning the delay which was taking place in regard to another case. The following report upon the application was forwarded by the sectional engineer:Mr Cox submitted his application on the 4th August, 1921, and the shortage of wire is causing delay. At present it cannot be stated' when a supply of wire in sufficient quantity will come to hand to enable this, line and the many others of prior application to he completed. This line is third on the list for Wagga, and seventy-sixth on the list for the trhole engineering district. If there are seventy-six outstanding cases in one district, what must be the position all over Australia? It must be appalling. It is bad enough for people to have to live in the country, and face the adverse conditions there, without alsor being seriously hampered by the inability of the Postal Department to provide these works. the Treasurer comes in : The last letter I have received from the Department deals with an application submitted by Mr Kensitt, of Tarcutta. I had complained that the inability of the Department to carry out these works could not be due to shortage of wire, because private people 'were getting supplies. The reply of the Department was that the work for which ' Mr Kensitt had mad'ef application could not be carried out because of the scarcity of material--and the lack of funds. I want the Postmaster General to tell the House and the country the* real cause .of thei delay, and I want the Treasurer to say whether ifc is due to lack of funds. I am heartily sick of getting these letters every day. They oalusei me no end of worry. It is most unsatisfactory in every way to be told that there is no wire when I know that such is not the case, and now to be also informed that there a're no funds available. bear knows that nearly £1,750,000 hasgation Act.

The Postmaster-General says he is anxious to provide these facilities in country districts, and if , therefore, they are not supplied there must be something wrong somewhere. There is no Department more capable than his of providing opportunities for making,, life worth living in country districts, and a strong guiding hand is urgently needed to cope with, the hopeless state, of chaos which exists. I would have no hesitation in cutting money out of the Eefence vote, and spending it in providing postal facilities for rural, areas. But here is where We could very well spend in this direction half of the £7,000,000 which it is estimated to spend in the Defence Department this year. But the answer to such a proposal^ is that money already voted for expenditure in the Postal Department, has not been spent.. A t any rate the grievance I have put forward to-day is indeed, serious, and I shall keep on protesting until the people living in country districts are treated fairly, and given the facilities of which they are now deprived. A t any rate, I hope we shall hear no more of these false statements that material is not available a subterfuge too long used by the Postal Department to cover up its ineptitude. not intend to delay the Treasurer's Supply Bill, but I avail myself of the opportunity. of again bringing before honourable members the tremendous disadvantage the people of Albany are suf-",28,Leasi Ng Of Ferry Boat Biloela Wargratuities Invalid Pensions Immigration Of Employees M Jewel

A l though I stand for economy, I say deliberately that it would be false economy to cut down the provision made for exbending the means of communication w i th those who are producing the money on which Australia lives. I would not stand for anything of. the kind. Every telephone line erected in a country district, to say nothing of many of those erected in metropolitan areas, is a distinctly economical proposition, and, therefore, I will not vote for a reduction of the Postal Estimates in respect of the provision made for the extension of telegraph and telephone facilities. endorse the complaint made by the honourable member for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney) and the honourable member for Swan( Mr Prowse) with regard to the delay in supplying postal, telegraph, and telephone requirements in country districts. different telephone lines, the construction of which was sanctioned and the deposits in. respect of them paid some months ago, cannot be erected this year, we are now told, because the money is not available. I give the Government warning that when the general Estimates are before us I shall require from the Postmaster-General( Mr Wise) a f u l l and clear statement as to why something cannot be dono to prevent the holding up of works in this way. Eveni f city requirements have to go short, these country facilities must not be cut down. If the Department caref u l ly examines its. Estimates I am satisfied that it will find a means of so re-allocating its votes that justice can be done to rural districts. It is not fair that the Department should agree to carry out a certain work, and that months later those who have raised the necessary deposit should be told that it cannot be done, and asked whether or not they desire that the deposit shall be returned.

64,Mr Poynton,"I have replied to sevegiven by the Minister to questions which I have put to him have served only to mate the case for him and his Department worse than ever. His answers to my questions show that the boat was Scott Fell during the first week in September, that it was supplied with coal, oil, cotton waste, and water by the Department, and that up to last week, at all events, not a penny had been received by the Department from the company. Surely that calls for an explanation! Mi\ JOWETT -Perhaps the Department has not yet sent in its bill commentary it is on the business methods of the so-called Business Board which is in charge of operations at Cockatoo Island! there is more behind the leasing of this boat than we know. Mr Scott Fell is a political friend of the Government; he is chairman of the Beception Committee which entertains the Prime Minister( Mr morning; and I think it is about time Hughes) when he goes to Sydney. A company promoted by him could obtain a lease of the Biloela behind the backs of the people for £15 per week, and although some eight weeks have elapsed since the running of the boat was given up by that company, the Department has not received a penny in respect of the lease or of the materials supplied. Over8 tons of coal were supplied by the Department for the use of the boat during the time that the company ran it. Surely that warrants an explanation! Let me show honourable members an even worse and more sinister side to this question. Mr complained, and I then quoted facts Scott Fell's company could obtain a lease of the boat for £15 per week, but when the citizens of North Sydney, who are represented in this House by the Assistant Minister for Defence( Sir Granville Byrie) applied for a lease of it in order that they might run it in opposition to the them. Apparently, these replies from the monopolistic Sydney Ferries Company, which, within the last few weeks, has increased its fares by over 100 per cent., they were told that they would have to pay £60 per week for it. That demand for £60 per week was made a few weeks after Mr Scott Fell's company had been given a lease of the boat for £15 per week. I do not want to make any insinuations. I wish only to state the bald facts. It is for the Minister to explain them. stated by the honourable member, they speak for themselves. stated by me. I await an explanation from the Minister, and shall bring this matter forward again and again until he furnishes one. The people of this country demand that the matter shall be cleared up. I . want to know why the Department, after leasing the Biloela to the company promoted by Mr Scott Fell for £15 per week, a few weeks later asked the people of North Sydney £60 per week for a lease of it. Within th© last few weeks I have alluded to certain cases in which, in my opinion, soldiers and soldiers' dependants bave been treated in an unjust manner by the War Gratuity Board. The Minister( Mr Rodgers) was handed the papers in these cases, and he promised to have an investigation made of the charges. I have received a reply this that honourable members took steps to see that more notice is taken of their representations. Tha reply in reference to the first case I spoke of is merely a departmental one, to the effect that the matter had been referred to the Board by the Minister, that careful consideration had been given to it, and that the decision of the Board could not be altered. The letter goes on to say that, in view of this, no good purpose would be served by again submitting the matter to the Board. That is exactly the kind of reply of which I previously which, to my mind, showed that thos* 1 interested had not received a fair deal. Surely the Minister is something more than a "" rubber stamp."" In regard to the other cases, the replies are similar, the Board simply refusing to re-open Chairman of the Board put an end to the matter. The Minister, in his letter which I received to-day, after quoting these replies from the Chairman of the Board, says that, speaking generally, the Central Gratuity Board represents the "" final court of appeal,"" and on its ultimate refusal to alter its decision, it is impossible for any further action to be",31,Leasi Ng Of Ferry Boat Biloela Wargratuities Invalid Pensions Immigration Of Employees M Jewel

70,Mr Atkinson,"If the facts are astaken. What a> confession of weakness, that is on the part of a responsible Minister! What justice can a soldier or his dependantsobtain under such circumstances? The Board may treat a mau in the most unfair manner, and it can simply refuse to make any further inquiries. In my opinion, the Minister himself should be the final court of appeal. I mention these cases in the hope that when the Estimates come before us some drastic action may be taken by honourable members; at any rate, it is about time that an end was put to such replies as I have quoted. It seems to me that the time haa arrived when honourable members who desire a reform in these matters should take steps, when the Estimates are before us, to cut off the supplies which are necessary to keep such a Board in existence. I have in my mind the case of the lady whose son was killed at the war, and who was granted a pension of 10s. per week. Since then her husband has died, and this pension represents her only source of income. I communicated with the Department, pointing out that this sum. was wholly inadequate; and the reply I received was to the effect that she could not be regarded as being without sufficient means for her maintenance. Such treatment is beyond my comprehension altogether. understand how any sane, reasonable man could send a reply of the kind. However, as I say, I am merely mentioning these oases in the hope that some action will be ta&en when the Estimates are before us. Some explanation is due from the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) in regard to the expenditure of the Postal Department. I understood the right honourable gentleman to say, by way of interjection, that he had allocated more money to this Department than it was likely to spend. when we ask for the postal facilities, the departmental officials, in Victoria, at any rate, declare that there is a shortage of material, and that the shortage of material is due to the shortage of money? Many telephone extensions are held up owing to the lack of wire, although, if I ' am rightly informed, such wire is now manufactured in Australia. It «eems to me that the whole postal business is in a complete tangle. If I quoted individual cases, I could .occupy the attention of the Chamber for an hour. I h my electorate, there have recently been three railway extensions into the dense Mallee scrub, where soldier settlements have been created. There we find whole communities utterly without telephone or telegraphic communication, isolated from the rest of the State. If I send a telegram to any person there, it will be wired to the nearest town, arid then carried on a three-days-a-week mail service to the person for whom it is intended. This, to my mind, is a scandalous state of affairs. I have been agitating and interviewing departmental ofncials until I am tired; all I get in reply to my complaints are stereotyped departmental excuses. I am sick and tired of keeping up this agitation in order to obtain facilities which should be provided without the asking. indulging in such agitation for thirty years-yo u must be patient 1 ditions remain as they are in my electorate I shall keep on agitating. In any case, an explanation is required of the seeming contradiction-thaf c thedepartmental officials cannot get the money to I cannot buy material, while the Treasurer, according to his own statement, has provided more money than he thinks the Department can spend.

77,Mr Stewabt,"I have not blamed anyarises because honourable members opposite keep howling for economy-fals e economy-and the Government have not the pluck to stand up to them. So long as money is spent in his own electorate, each of the honourable members. I have named regard the money as well spent, whether the lines they suggest pay or not; but the moment any money is spent on a paying line at Melbourne Ports, it is regarded as badly spent. MT . McWILLIAMS -D o you not think that the people in ""the country require these facilities? vocated the spending of money on postal facilities in the country. I am merely pointing out the peculiar methods of economy advocated by honourable members opposite. The situation arises, as I say, purely from the lack of courage on the part of the Government. The members of the Country party ought to have been spoken to in the most straight way when the want of confidence motion was before us a little time ago. the more courage was necessary. Government out. However, I leave the economy crowd on one side, and"" now propose to ask the Treasurer to spend more money. I understand that the right honourable gentleman is leaving shortly for the big Australian building in London, there to carry out certain duties which some people are uncivil enough to say are unnecessary. But before he leaves the office of Treasurer I wish him to do something for the relief of certain people who endeavour, without success, to obtain the invalid pension. I think action can be taken by regulation. There may be two families, in each of which there is an invalid daughter suffering from tuberculosis. Onef amily gives the invalid all fche care possible, impoverishing itself in buying necessary medicines and comforts. Application is made in her behalf for the pension; but. because of what her family have done for her, the application is refused. The other family regards the sick daughter as a nuisance, and turns her out of the house. Application is made in her behalf for a pension, and because she has been thrown in the gutter the application is successful. This discrimination is made under a regulation relating to "" adequate maintenance."" If a family tries to adequately maintain the invalid she cannot get a pension. I do not care how honourable members may howl foreconomy, or what the granting of these pensions would cost the Government, the continuance of this anomaly is ablot upon Australia, and we should take steps at once to remove it . The officials say that they are bound by certain regulations made in accordance with the Act itself. If that be so, the Act should be amended; but I believe that fche necessary action can be taken by an amended regulation. I have worried the Treasurer upon this question often. I do not pretend to have finer feelings or wider sympathies than he has, but the injustice of which I have spoken exists, and I believe that every honourable member would be agreeable to its removal. When the Government proposed to extend the invalid pension to the blind, honourable members practically agreed that the Bill should go through without opposition. I appeal to them to show similar sympathy for the class of people to whom I have referred. It will be to our honour if we remove this blot from our pensions scheme, and we shall be rising another step in the ladder of civilization. I ask the Treasurer to again consider if something icannot be done to assist families which impoverish themselves by the maintenance of an invalid, in view of the fact that this Parliament intended, when it passed the Old-age and Invalid Pensions Act, to provide against any family being burdened to the ground by sacrifice for an invalid dependant. Belief should be given, even if it costs the country £100,000 or £200,000. If the Treasurer will do what he can to give the help to which these people are so justly entitled, we shall always think more kindly of him. sympathize with and support the reauesfc made by the honourable member for Melbourne'Ports( Mr Mathews).

Similar cases m my own district have been brought under my notice, and I recognise f u l l v the burden placed upon families who are struggling to maintain an invalid, and can get no assistance from the pensions scheme. I rose mainly for the purpose of supplementing the remarks of the honourable member who advised the Government to concentrate Commonwealth activities in the city of Sydney. The same claim can be made in respect of every capital city and large town throughout Australia. In the various cities where I have had to do business with Commonwealth Departments, I have experienced great difficulty in locating the officers. I have had to go to one end of tbe city to see a Commonwealth opposite direction to consult another Department. In the chief seaports of Australia the same disability is experienced, and in my own electorate, it is particularly in evidence. The District Naval Officer is in one locality, the quarantine office is somewhere else, the electoral officer is in another quarter, and the Cusness interests, and public officials is what toms House in yet another. All the Commonwealth ClVces are scattered in different partis f<f Port Adelaide, and that means not only inconvenience for those who have to do business with the offices, but also inefficient and uneconomical administration. For the last twelve years the people of Port Adelaide have been agitating for better postal conveniences. The present Post-office is in a most unsuitable building i u a very inconvenient locality, and is an absolute disgrace to the Commonwealth. The room in which the whole of the public business is transacted measures not more than 8 feet square, and, in addition, it contains private letseemed rather desirous that they should ter boxes. A t 6 p.m. this office is closed, and business people who subscribe for private boxes are unable to get access to their correspondence arriving by the late mails. The patience displayed by the people of Port Adelaide is marvellous and beyond my comprehension. I pay a special tribute to the Citizen's Committee for their untiring efforts. Certainly, the Postdo not think master-General has offered additional facilities, but the people of Port Adelaide, having seen the plans and specifications of the proposed building, regard I think a l l honourable them as inadequate, and not in keeping with the importance of the city. They prefer the present inconvenience to be continued for a time, rather than be saddled with an insufficient and unsatisfactory building located upon a site not acceptable to the citizens. They particularly desire a suite of offices established in the Port to accommodate all Commonwealth activities, including the new Post Office. If that desire were gratified, visitors to the Port who have to do business with any of the Federal Departments would know where to find them. I am sorry that the Government have removed from the Estimates an amount bhat was placed there for the purchase of a site for the new Post Office building; and I trust that the Minister may yet have an amount included; but I do not desire this remark to be regarded by the Minister as a justification official, and in an for proceeding to erect a building on what is known as the morgue site. Rather than that should happen, we would prefer to wait longer, in the hope of securing a greater measure of satisfaction. The only site which can be regarded as suitable for the purpose and which is universally approved of by the citizens' busiis known as the Police Station corner, but there appears to be a difference of opinion between the Chief Secretary of South Australia and the Postmaster-General as to the price to be paid for this block. It is a grave anomaly that a deadlock regarding the transfer of a block of land required for the convenience of the community should occur between two public men serving the same taxpayers. For the continued unsatisfactory circumstances, I blame, largely, the exbald). He did not press the claims of the people as he should have done, but accept anything that the Government might be prepared to give them.

Tbe carrying out of this work would effect economy, and give the efficiency which is necessary, in the Commonwealth interests. draw attention to a matter of grave importance, on what is perhaps the last opportunity that I shall have of bringing it under the notice of the Treasurer before he leaves for Great Britain. Yesterday afternoon, in Sydney, I was interviewed by a number of immigrants, who had just arrived from England. They showed me aii advertisement in a jewellery trade journal, published in Birmingham, stating that ten men used to watch-making, clock-making, and gold ring drawing were required in Australia. Those who answered the advertisement were supplied with forms, in which it was stated that their destination was Melbourne, but at the last moment Sydney was substituted for Melbourne. Of course, knowing nothing of Australia, this meant little to them at the time; but when they got to Sydney they found that nearly 100 pelsons belonging to their calling were out of work there, and were informed that eighty men, following the same occupation, were out of work in Melbourne. I saw Mr Shearer, a much respected gentleman, whom I have known since boyhood, who is secretary to the Jewellers' Employees Union, and heard particulars of the case from him. These immigrants are ex-Imperial Service men, who followed the trade before the war, and took it up again on -being discharged. They wish to know how they can get back to England, because they think it is of no use to remain here, seeing that there arts more men in. the trade here than there are positions for. Moreover, gold, the commodity in which they work, is not easily obtainable now. Many gold mines are closed down because their ore is of low grade. These are craftsmen skilled in the fine work of watch-making and ring-setting, and although a man like myself, should the necessity arrive, could take up hard manual labour, they are not able to do so. There should be some one responsible for the advertisements which appear in trade journals, which are regarded as reliable sources of information about the doings of a trade all over the world. I do not oppose immigration, but I think that men should not be brought out here to work in callings in which there are already many out of employment. The men whom I saw seemed to be between forty-five and fifty years of age, and were thus at a time of life when they could not start again in another avocation. Besides, they have behind them their training, and the skill that they have acquired in a particular business. The Treasurer will do good work if , when he gets to England, he makes it his business to see that would be immigrants are not deceived by advertisements. When persons come here there should be employment for them; they should not be left to walk the streets in search of it. I do not know what these particular immigrants will do. They have been fixed up for the present by the secretary to their union, aud will not want for the necessaries of life. If my remarks are brought under the notice of the Department concerned, tbey may have some effect in preventing, in the future, the sort of thing to which I have drawn attention.

I have here a copy of a letter forwarded by the Electrolytic Zinc Company to the Phosphate Co-operative Company. It is as follows:Phosphate Co-operative Co. of Australia Ltd., 440 Little Collins-street, Melbourne. Dear Sirs,-As arranged at the interview with your deputy chairman, Mr Morton, and your general manager, Mr Augustus Wolskel, this morning, we enclose herewith copy of a letter which we are sending to the Minister for Committee (Consideration of Customs. 4th This is the letter forwarded to me as the outcome of that interviewI am instructed to advise that zinc concentrates will be made available to the Phosphate Co-operative Co. of Australia Ltd., of 440 Little Collins-street, Melbourne, on the same terms and conditions as are now offered, or may be subsequently arranged with other Victorian manufacturers of superphosphate. The terms now under discussion with the manufacturers the Electrolytic Zinc Co. shall erect the equipment and handling appliances required in connection with the roasting of zinc concentrates, or shall arrange that this work shall be done at their expense. The Electrolytic Zinc Coy. is willing to make the same arrangements with the Phosphate Co-operative Coy. We are advised by the Phosphate Co-operative Coy. that their first requirements of zinc concentrates will be in about eighteen months or two years' time, and will then be at the rate of 20 tons daily (equivalent to approximately 5 tons of sulphur). Tbese requirements may increase during several following years to an estimated maximum of 20 tons sulphur daily, should the Phosphate Coy's, initial efforts on the business side prove successful. The Electrolytic Zinc Coy. is willing to allow this offer to remain open for two years from this date, by which time the Phosphate .Co-operative Coy. should be in a position to determine its future policy. The Electrolytic Zinc Company thus pledge themselves to make available to the Phosphate Co-operative Companyf u l l requirements. available to all companies? available to this particular company, the only concern which so far has raised the question. have protested against the increased duties. cern which has raised the question with the Electrolytic Zinc Company, but I have not the slightest doubt that the same terms can be obtained by any other company. which aprjlv to private companies?",36,Papers

107,Mr Greene,"Speaking fro mcome to a definite basis of agreement with the Electrolytic Zinc Company, and were prepared to withdraw their opposition to it . A member of the deputation, who put the case at greater length than any other, was Mr Swinburne, formerly a member of the Inter-State Commission, and I think that honourable members will agree that when that gentleman expresses an opinion it is a considered one, and his judgment on matters is entitled to every consideration. I put a certain question to him. I cannot mention the figures, because they are confidential. I said, ' ' You are manufacturing now on a certain basis for sulphur. That being so, and this arrangement being on, the basis of so much per ton-considerabl y lower than the price at which you are manufacturing now-takin g the existing price of sulphur if freights and wages do not rise from what they are to-day-coul d you say it would not lead to a higher price for super, than is being paid?"" That is a clear, definite question, free from ambiguity, and to it Mr Swinburne replied, "" U n doubtedly; it would be a considerable reduction on super."" Mr Swinburne's statement that it would mean a considerable reduction, we have to. remember that the extent to which the price of sulphur enters into the price of superhposphates is not very great. Taking the generally accepted basis of ] ton of sulphur to 10 tons of superphosphate, every £ 1 variation in the price of sulphur means a variation of 2s. per ton in the price of superphosphates. quently, if the price of sulphur under this arrangement fell, let us say, for the sake of argument, to the extent of £ 2 below the existing price, that would make a difference of 4s. per ton in the price of superphosphates. If the f a l l were £ 3 per ton, it would make a difference of 6s. per ton in the price of superphosphates. I want honourable members to be quite clear that, while Mr Swinburne talks of a "" considerable reduction "" in the price of superphosphates, as the result of this arrangement, it cannot amount to more than about 2s. per ton. As the price of sulphur enters into the price of superphosphates to the extent of 2s. for every £ 1 in the value of superphosphates, that is the f u l l extent to which the fall or rise in the price of sulphur can affect the price of superphosphates. it would not affect very much per acre of fertilizers. Sir. Greene. fertilizers used in wheat-growing ia somewhere about 75 lbs. pen acre, a fall or rise of 2s. per ton in the price of superphosphates would make a difference of a little more than l j d . per acre in the cost of fertilizers. Here we are talking of a fall, and not of a rise. There is one other factor in this situation to which I wish also to direct the particular attention of the farmers' representatives. Under the arrangements which have been entered into by the Electrolytic Zino Company and the fertilizer companies, the Electrolytic Zinc Company undertakes, no matter what may be the price of sulphur outside Australia, not' to raise the price of the concentrates to the fertilizer companies above the actual cost of working. ment ? ment. what the cost of working is? may be sure that the terms of the agreement between the fertilizer companies and the Electrolytic Zinc Company will be such as would constitute a proper business arrangement between business men. When that agreement is drawn up, we may be very certain that the fertilizer companies will see to it that its terms enConseable them to f u l l y determine what will be the actual cost of working, since they are bound to pay that particular sum whatever it is, although not above a certain maximum. MrH n x I should be glad if the Minister would repeat his last statement w i th regard to the price or costs not being above a certain amount. deavouring to make may be readily put. Supposing, for the sake of argument, that Japan and the United States of America were to go to war and our outside sources of sulphur were entirely cut off, w i th the result that the price of sulphur outside went up to £20 per ton, as it might do in those circumstances, under the arrangement which is being made between the fertilizer companies and the Electrolytic Zinc Company, no the cost may be, unless there is some special factor in the shape of shipping freights, or some-",38,Customs Tariffbill

MrM c WILLIAMS practically everything the farmer uses, and while there is a 50 per cent, rise in the price of phosphates, everything that the farmer produces has experienced a reduction in price of about 50 per cent, on last year. I should say that 4s. 6d. f.o.b. is about the best price that the farmer can look for during the coming season for his wheat. he will be well satisfied! now, when prices are tumbling about the farmers' ears in the case of his butter, meat, wheat, oats, hay, and everything he produces, we are imposing a Tariff to tax, as I say, practically everything he uses. Unless the farmer can get superphosphates at a reasonable 'price-the y are the very essence of life to the wheat growers, especially on the lighter soilsa great proportion of the light lands will go out of production. The figures to-day show a serious decline in the acreage under wheat. This year there has been a slight increase,"" but for the two preceding years the decline was, as I «say, serious. I repeat that this proposal may help the mining industry to a small extent. It is a good thing for us to be self-contained; but if this is a national industry, is it fair that one class, and one class only, should pay for establishing it ? I am now speaking for myself, and not for my party, and I say to the Minister( Mr Greene) that I am quite prepared to vote a reasonable bonus for the creation of such industries. I am prepared to support a reasonable and f a i r , and even a generous, bonus on sulphur to enable the industry to be established, for then every class in the community will bear its share of the cost. We are told that the manufacture of agricultural implements is an industry which must be established in Australia. We are told that the iron and steel industry must be established in Australia, that the manufacture of rabbit traps is a key industry which must be established, We have to reand that the establishment of sulphur works is also essential; and one class of the community is asked to bear the whole cost. Isi t reasonable or fair? happen to be correct. MrM c WILLIAMS The Minister has put the syndicate view as it was supplied to him. He stated the case quite fairly from thestand-point of the manuY e s . We tax facturer of superphosphates. I am stating it from the stand-point of the man who uses the superphosphates. The manufacturer does not care what duty is imposed, because he will pass it on. member recognise that those who produce the sulphur are among the primary producers of Australia? MrM c WILLIAMS I have adI f he gets that mitted that to a limited extent this duty will assist the base-metal industry, which is in such a condition that anything we can do to help it should be gladly done. But anything done to assist the mining industry should be at the expense of the whole community, and not only of one particular class.

Have the men who are mouthing most loudly about a cheaper loaf said that the M ill in g Combine and the bread carters should pay * a copper towards the reduction in the price of bread? No . It is a fine thing to get a reduction in the price of the bread if the whole of the expense is borne by the man who grows the wheat.

Are they prepared to demand that the miller, the baker, and the bread carter shall contribute a farthing towards the cheap loaf? No; the whole sacrifice is to be made by one class only. The attitude of honourable members is not fair. While the consumer is to get a cheap loaf, the -men on the sun-baked Mallee country, and in the interior of New South Wales and Western Australia, are working below the living wage; for a man who has to cart his wheat any distance cannot profitably sell it at 4s. per bushel f.o.b. Melbourne, or even a f 4s."" 6d. A sweating wage is being paid to the man who is producing on the land, and he is being taxed on everything he uses; even on the manures that are necessary to enable him to live at all, he has to pay tribute to the Combine. I desire to help the sulphur industry, and I again ask the Minister not to proceed with this duty, but to bring in a Bill to provide for the payment of a bonus on the production of sulphur, and I will assist him to the point of generosity. Experience in South Australia, where there Is the only cooperative company handling superphosphates, can of the producer. Do not further load one class of the community that is bearing its full share of every duty imposed -in this Tariff and a supercharge also. Already we tax everything the farmer uses; do not go to the extent of penalizing Japan, but from America, which 'can him by an impost on the fertilizer that he must use in order to live and give the people the cheap loaf they are so anxious ""to eat. the Committee will not agree to the imposition of this duty. The people interested in mining, electrolytic work, and the manufacture of manures may haye decided, in consultation with the Minister, as to what is a reasonable duty to impose, but those who use the manures also have a right to be heard. The Minister stated that he obtained an assurance from the manufacturers that this duty would not increase the cost of the manure, but I do not know whether the Minister bore in mind that they had a very big margin upon which to work. In Western Australia we were paying, at the commencement of 1914, £4 2s. 6d. per ton for superphosphates of the same standard as those for which we are paying to-day £6 15s. I have already stated that the manufacturers had, in the additional cost of freights, a reasonable excuse for the high cost of fertilizers during war time. W""e forgave them for that increase, and endeavoured to pay the' price they demanded, but we confidently expected that when the war was over and a greater tonnage of shipping was available, and also in view of the fact that the Commonwealth is a partner' in the Nauru Island deposits of phosphatic rock, the farmers would be able to purchase cheaper manures than even in pre-war time. To say that manures will become no dearer than the price to which they rose during war time is no argument in favour of this duty. The Government, who have promised so much to the man on the land, and talked a great deal about encouragement of primary production, as a means for paying the national debt, now ask the Committee to impose a duty on sulphur to assist the firms which are making money out of the sale of zinc concentrates. There is no objection to shows that this duty them doing that, but not at the expense be used to the detriment of the primary producers, and I remind the Committee that it is not the natural sulphur that is best for manures. The manufacturers are now using a considerable amount of natural sulphur, and it ' is not coming from supply us even cheaper than can Japan. There is no reason to fear opposition from Japanese manures. As a matter of fact, no country is foolish enough to sell cheap manures. The Government, however, seem to be foolish enough to refuse cheap manures. I repeat that cheap fertilizers would benefit everybody, and I would not vote to increase the cost of manures by one farthing. The Minister( Mr Greene) was quite correct when he referred to the importance of fertilizers to the Australian producer, for they can be used with advantage, not only in the production of grain and wheat crops, but also, if they are cheap enough, on grass lands. The",43,Foster If That Is So Matter What The Price Of Sulphur Outside

In South Australia and other States land that is not regarded as suitable for producing wheat has been brought under crop solely through the use of fertilizers. In Western Australia the Government so realize the importance of cheap fertilizers that they carry them on the railways at the lowest rates in the schedule. at the rate of i d . per ton per mile. order to benefit by increased back freights in the form of wheat and other commodities. I ask the Minister to realize the difference between pre-war and present prices. Cannot he regulate the price in some way? At what price do the manufacturers-get their phosphatic rock from Nauru Island? now than they paid before. good of the Nauru deposits? later. The manufacturers are paying higher freights now than they paid formerly. hindrance to the farmers securing the fertilizers they need. seems to Ibe intended for the betterment of the mining industry; but the primary producer should not be burdened to effect it. All primary productions are nearly back to pre-war prices, but the primary producer has to pay at least 50 iper cent, on pre-war costs for this and other requirements. In eating houses they are still charging on the war tariff. though they are getting their meat, butter, and all the other primary produce that they use, at 50 per cent, less than was charged during the war. The primary producer ds levied on by nearly every item in the Tariff, and the proposal to increase the cost of his manures is about the last straw. I hope that the Committee will determine that sulphur and manures shall have free admittance into Australia. If superphosphates were sent; here from Japan, that would benefit Australia, and would bea loss to Japan; but they are likely to come not from Japan, but from America, and as we expect the Americans to buy so much from us, we should purchase something from them. This is the first item during the Tariff discussion in connection with which the Minister has expressed any anxiety concerning the mining industry. The Tariff has increased the cost of raising ore in Australia Iby 6d., and probably 7d. or 8d., per ton; but the big mining companies of BrokenH ill, Mt. Lyell, Mt. Cuthbert, Mt. Morgan, and the others, have not protested against the imposts. At the same time, they have asked their employees to accept lower rates of wages, notwithstanding that the cost of living has been increased by the duties. knows the reason. swim. The present proposal is almost wholly in the interests of the Broken Hill people. Hitherto the mining companies have been in the habit of dealing directly with their products. Copper ore might be sent to Port Kembla, and other ore might be sent to the Electrolytic Zinc Works in Tasmania for treatment; but in either case it was paid for at its value, or a charge was made for its treatment, This proposal the mining company taking the results. But Parliament is now asked to interfere in most intricate' and delicate financial and business arrangements for the treatment of ore, and the disposal of resulting products. Ore which requires roasting is not to be dealt with by the company whioh raises it, but by another company, which, in the process, will extract sulphur from it, and make sulphuric acid from that sulphur, using this by-product and returning the ore to the mining company; but the connection between the two concerns is too intricate for honourable members to understand. Manufacturers of superphosphates have told me that they have recently been importing sulphur rock from America containing 99 per cent, of pure sulphur, from which they make sulphuric acid. Australian mining companies have for many years been making sulphuric acid. The Mt. Lyell works, fourteen or fifteen years ago, commenced to manufacture superphosphates, and began also to make sulphuric acid, mostly from the copper pyrites that the company was mining. Messrs. CumingBmith bought a copper mine at Murren Murren, in Western Australia. I was Minister for",44,Foster If That Is So Matter What The Price Of Sulphur Outside

The only ones of practical value for munitions manufacture are those of high grade, and particularly the variety called "" Oleum,"" which was manufactured by the English Government at all the plants that it erected during the latter stages of the war. It is known that the English Government used sulphur for making this acid (oleum), and not Broken Hill sulphides, though it used the latter for making zinc. English experts will have been fully aware that it was chemically possible to make high grade acids from the zinc sulphides, but by a roundabout process. Leighton, Director of Munitions, whether he would purchase from this company (should it make it) sulphuric acid of the chamber or scrubber type for use at the Commonwealth arsenals. His reply was, ""Ko, the oleum type is required."" I have had over thirty years of general experience as a technical chemist. I know the Broken Hill sulphides, and I have been engaged as a consultant on munition works (though not of recent years). I know of my own knowledge that high-grade acid is a requisite in munition manufacture. The preparation of low-grade sulphuric acid (scrubber and chamber acid) from zinc sulphides of one kind or another has long been known to the chemical profession, and has been utilized in practice for more than fifty years, the acid being used for metallurgical and like rough purposes. Until the last few years the processes were operated with handworked furnaces. Latterly, efforts have been made to introduce mechanical furnaces for -roasting zinc sulphides. The Electrolytic Zine Company claim to have recently succeeded in this roasting. The two separate processes, viz., the manufacture of low-grade acid from Australian sulphides mechanically roasted .and the manufacture of high-grade acid from Australian sulphides are experimental matters. While I regard the two processes as being within the limit of near future attainment, they are not commercial processes, and much experimental work remains to be done. The onus of making the acid from concentrates should be taken up by the Zinc Company Bponsibilty. not. These people desire to forward their kind in Australia.

The writer of this letter continuesSuperphosphates can be, and mostly are, made from low-grade acids. Against this the 1 asked Mr E. modern tendency is to produce high-grade fertilizers from purer acids, the object being to avoid the possibility of adversely affecting plant life by metallic poisons. There is a doubt, in connection with the use of sulphuric acid made from zino concentrates, whether there is not danger of poison. plant life in the use of these poisons, such as the honourable member suggests, it would have been demonstrated long ago. here that the process is merely in the experimental stage. Mr Wolskel says that they have been using the hand-worked furnace, but that the mechanical appliance is still in its experimental stage. He continuesI have advised Mr W. C. Hill, M.P., as regards munitions that it is not practicable to make Australia self-contained at the present time. It will probably he at least twenty years before this can be done. 1 base this opinion on the position as to nitre, of which there are no known supplies in Australia.

For instance, when we were considering the duty upon reapers and binders, the Minister told us what a small percentage per acre the increased duty would mean. increased cost of superphosphates would not amount to more than 2d. per acre. excessive duties on every item we require; however, we are looking forward to an increased cultivation. In 1915 we had 18,528,234 acres under cultivation. That area had decreased to 13,332,393 acres in 1919, the latest figures available; but since then I believe there has been an increase, and that the area now under crop is 20,000,000 acres. We are exceedingly hopeful that in New South Wales, Victoria, and Western Australia there will be a considerable increase in land settlement. made to open up the Mallee country of Victoria. We have enormous^ areas of splendid country in ' Western_ Australia, and I am hopeful of seeing a steady immigration from Great Britain to the three StatesI have mentioned. The possibility is that, within three years, we shall have from 25,000,000 to 30,000,000 acres under cultivation. That will mean in itself an increased demand for superphosphafes, but we also know that by means of harrowing and using superphosphates a marvellously increased production has been secured from ordinary grazing land. In all these circumstances an earnest effort should be made in this Parliament to provide the farmer with cheap superphosphates. We know the wonderful results that have followed the researches of Professor Lowrie. Farmers in South Africa New who, twenty-five years ago, were suffering trials and tribulations, and were hardly able to make ends meet on impoverished farms, are now possessed of beautiful homes and motor cars, all being due to the use of superphosphates. When I was Minister of Eailways in Western Australia, 1 not only reduced the railway freight on superphosphates to £d. per mile, but also induced the manager of the Midland Railway Company to do the same on his line. I pointed out to him the possibility of increasing the value of the lands through which his railway ran. As a result of our joint efforts, the railways of Western Australia paid better in the few succeeding years than they had ever paid previously. superphosphates do not pay. they do indirectly. Any sane Administration'would do all it possibly could to give the farmers cheap superphosphates. Four years ago the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) stated that the Imperial Government had made a special grant to enable plants to be erected in Australia for .the purpose of treating electrolytic zinc. I do not know whether the Hobart Company have obtained any of that assistance. of that nature. Strong efforts should be ter mentioned on one occasion that it had not been applied for. been applied for up to the time.

Let us come to bedrock in regard to the proposal before the Committee. .The sulphur rock imported into Australia contains, so I am informed, 99 per cent, of sulphur, whereas zinc concentrates, according to the average assay, contain not more than 25 per cent.

Another gentleman, however, says that there must have been something wrong with the plant at the time of the other's visit, and that not more than four men are. required upon the process. the Electrolytic Zinc Company's process requires two men per shift. simply repeating what he has been told. I am doing the same. In addition to the fact that four men are required in the process, it must also be borne in mind that they have to handle four times the quantity of material for the purpose of getting the same result that can be obtained from the treatment of imported rock sulphur. Therefore, the process must be ever so much more expensive wheu the enormous handling charges are considered. only extraction from the process? traction that the fertilizer people get. They do the roasting, extract the sulphuric acid, and then return the concentrates to the Electrolytic Zinc Company, who again treat them for their own mittee that an agreement has been made Furtherfor the handling of this product.

Their metallurgists and chemists have been working on the problem for years. experimental stage. that the whole matter is still in the experimental stage so far as mechanical appliances are concerned, and that the high grade sulphuric acid required for the purpose of making superphosphates can only be obtained from zinc concentrates by a very laborious process of extraction. ous process to doi with the honourable member's side of the agreement? agreement, referred to to-day, we should look to the Electrolytic Zinc Company to manufacture their own sulphuric acid and name the price, at which they are prepared to supply it. The whole matter is so mixed up between various companies 'that it will be impossible to know what will happen in a few years' time. It is not a question of fche present only. I think it only fair, at this stage, to mention that the superphosphates manufacturers of Australia acted very fairly to the consumers during the war period, considering fche increased cost of their raw material. But while we express our. satisfaction at this fact, we cannot forget that the price of superphosphates is now higher than it was in pre-war days.

It is pressure that counts. from the Country party now. this party can alter the Minister's proposals, then, as far as I am concerned, they wil l be altered. The Minister, remarked a few minutes ago that this duty would cheapen the price of superphosphate. That statement is on all fours with statements that he and other members behind him-and not only those behind him, but those who sit on the Opposition side of the House-hav e made during the course of the Tariff debates. If increases in duties w ill bring down the prices, I cannot understand, for the l if e of me the duty. whether this Committee realizes the value of superphosphate to this country, or realizes the extent to which experiments in the use of superphosphate have emphasized its value to the agricultural industries. I have conducted wheat-growing experiments, and, included in those experiments were plots of wheat with various amounts of superphosphate added to the soil. The same variety of wheat was sown in the same soil, under exactly the same 'conditions. In one plot no superphosphate was added; in a second plot, 30 lbs.; in a thir d plot, 60 lbs.; and in a fourth plot, 90 lbs. to the acre were used. It was commonly held, even amongst experienced wheat-farmers, up to recently, that, .in the dry areas of this country, the addition of too much superphosphate had a tendency to burn off the crop. To test these beliefs we set to work and experimented. charge of the experiments in my district, I am in a position to state what the results were. I found that, even in the driest years, the commonly-held theory, that a generous application of superphosphate to the wheat crop had a tendency to burn off the crop, was entirely wrong In the driest years the application of 80 to 90 lbs. of superphosphate to the acre gave the greatest yields. We found that it was not profitable to apply superphosphate in excess of 90 lbs. to the acre. Although when more than 90 lbs. to the acre was applied a greater yield was obtained, it did not pay for the extra amount of superphosphate. In the northern Mallee country, which is being opened up in Victoria very largely for closer settlement, where the rainfall is about 12 inches, we have found that from 60 to 80 lbs. of superphosphate per acre If pressure from is the most profitable dressing. The average amount applied is from about 40 to about 50 lbs. per acre. Farmers are realizing the value of this extra application of superphosphate, particularly on well-cultivated ground. Undoubtedly, the tendency in the f u t u r e w ill be to use more superphosphate to the acre if superphosphate can be obtained at a reasonable price. If Parliament is going to load this industry with extra duties, w i th the object of enabling local manufacturers of superphosphate to increase their prices, and if Parliament is going to put a duty upon sulphur, which will work out at an increase of from 6s. to 8s. or 9s. per ton I do not know in the price of superphosphate, then I , as a farmers' representative, am not going to allow this item to pass without entering my protest, even though I know before I speak that my protest will be of no avail. monstrated that the duty will not operate as the honourable member suggests? argument in connection w i th every item that has come before this Committee.

The Government that is responsible for such a Tariff as this ought to be booted, neck and crop, off the Treasury bench. If I had had my way they would have been off it long ago. w ill mean to the company directly interested £60,000 or £70,000 per annum. Dampier( Mr Gregory) says that it w ill mean a present to them of about £100,000. I wonder how much of this amount w ill find its way into the fighting funds of the National party at the next elections. Honourable members think the honourable gentleman is justified in imputing improper motives. ducers have not the facilities for lobbying that are possessed by other sections of the community. The men who are going to foot the bill are a long way from this chamber at the present moment. We are told again and again that the primary producers are our best citizens, but when a burden has to be placed on some section of the community it is the ""poor old backbone of the country"" that gets it in the neck every time. My. honourable colleagues have complained that this burden w ill be placed upon the shoulders of the primary producers. honourable member that the Minister for Trade and Customs' is as big; a primary producer as is any member of the Country party. mary producer. I have not suggested that he is not; but I do not know what the primary producers of his constituency think of the Tariff which he has fathered. I do not know what the primary producers represented by the honourable member for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney) and other members of the Labour party think of this Tariff. I do not know what they think when they see the representatives of organized Labour joining forces with the representatives of organized capitalism and commercialism, and helping them to bludgeon through the Parliament a Tariff of this kind. We are told that it is necessary to have these To impose burdens upon duties in order to protect our infan t industries from the Combines and dumpers of other countries. The old cry was, "" Give us a little protection in order that we may build up our industries, and as soon as they have been built up you can remove the duties.""

We still hear the same cry, but it is not used to the same extent He may be a prias in years gone by. Four or five Customs Tariff Bills have been passed by this Parliament, and every one of them has provided for increased duties. Cani t be said the agricultural machinery and i m plement-making industries are in the in fantile stage? What has been the result of the imposition cf duties to protect such industries?

The greatest industry of all the one industry that can save Australia -is having burden after burden imposed upon it . What is to be the result? Do honourable members think the primary producers can continue to carry on-under conditions as they exist to-day? these imposts. enter my protest against this item. Having regard to present conditions, I do not think the agricultural industry can hope for a rosy future. The people who are slaving out back are not going to continue to work for nothing, as they are doing to-day. They will flock to our capital cities; they will join with those already in the labour market there, and compete with them for employment. They are going to come to this city and others where theatres and picture .shows, public gardens, art galleries and museums offer them amusement and interest. They will come to this city, where they will be able to visit this House and listen to the speeches of the Minister and others who talk about the necessity for developing the great waste spaces of Australia. They cannot continue to pay Protectionist rates for everything they use in production, and at the same time sell their produce at Free Trade rates. I enter my protest against this proposal. I consider that, so far as the farmers are concerned, the imposition of these duties is plain robbery. The farmers have been robbed, cheated, and lied to by a Government, the individual members of which are never tired of talking of the great value of our primary industries to Australia. When the Government were floating their war Joans or peace loans-wheneve r they were appealing for money in this country-to whom did they apply? They issued placards and posters showing illustrations of what? Did their illustrations relate to factories? No. The illustrations depicted flocks of sheep, herds of dairy cows, or fields of growing corn, and printed across every such poster were the words: '' Invest in the Loan! Australia's security is behind it ! "" It was able member to withdraw that observathe great primary industries that stood behind Australia during the war. They are standing behind Australia to-day, and the imposition of a duty such as this is a blow at the very industries to which we are looking to pull Australia through her present financial difficulties. I could say a good deal more, but as I remarked at the outset, "" facts are of no avail; talk is useless."" I know that I am only wasting my breath; I know that the item will be passed as proposed by the Minister. I , however, make these few observations of protest, and I hope I shall be followed by other members of the Country party. I Nothing could bring out mora clearly than does this proposal the necessity for having in the 'Commonwealth Parliament a separate party that will put up some kind of a fight for the men and women out back-fa r removed from our capital cities-wh o are unable to fight for themselves, and who would look in vain, at the present time, to either the National party or the Labour party to champion their cause. already spoken to this question, but feel that I should be lacking in my duty if I did not again address myself to it , particularly as the position has somewhat changed since Friday last. I am very disappointed that only the members of the Country party, who have Ibeen taunted times out of number by honourable members on both sides of the House with the fact that they claim that they alone represent the primary producers, have raised any opposition to this duty. Where aTe the members of the Nationalist party or the Labour .party who have the courage to stand up and say what they ought to say in defence of the primary producers in connection with this item? With one exception, not one -member of those parties has discussed this item. The exception I refer to is the.honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt), and he spoke as the champion of the huge Combine which is carrying on operations in Melbourne at the present time.

I take the increased rjrice at 6s. 3d. per ton, and assuming that the average user of superphosphate in Victoria uses 8 tons, this means a tax upon him of £2 10s. a year.

330,Mr Considine,"No, because thewins in thecontest between agricultural interests and manufacturing interests, tbe workers lose. Honourable members opposite are the advocates of cheap labour when it comes to the case of agriculture. the honourable member to address himself to the question before the Chair. question is whether this duty is to be imposed on sulphur in order to benefit the industry in Tasmania and other parts of Australia. The Country party claim that the duty will adversely affect the man on the land, and I think I am entitled to point out that when they use that argument they should remember that they have, also claimed that the industrial workers in the factories and workshops should take less wages in order that the agricultural interests may be benefited. They ignore both the agricultural and the industrial worker, and are, in common with the manufacturers, merely trying to get the best they can for themselves. It is a case of "" Codlin's your friend, not Short."" vote? . part; I am simply utilizing the opportunity to point out that the sincerity of the representatives of agricultural interests is on an equality with that of the representatives of manufacturing interests. The workers, whether engaged in agriculture or manufacturing, will note that the representatives in this Chamber may be broadly divided into the two classes I have indicated, each' voting for itsown hand, not concerned with the interests of the workers-the y put their own interests before those of the great mass of the people of Australia, who are the working population. we are wrong in saying that we are unduly taxed. is that the honourable member, and those with him., desire to "" take it o u t "" of the wage-earners. Only the other night, the honourable member pointed out that in the various metalliferous centres there are mining companies which are seeking to reduce wages by 20 per cent. duty on sulphur will re-open the mines at Broken Hill? able members to cease interjecting. Unless they do so it is impossible for me to keep order. that a duty on sulphur will, have the effect of re-opening the mines at Broken Hill. As a matter of fact, there are about 3,500 men, or 50 per cent, of the normal number, working there at the present time. What will determine whether these and other mines shall be kept working is whether it suits the interests of the proprietors to work them; and what applies to the proprietors of the mines applies equally to the honourable in bis own particular industry. If he considers that it will pay to employ labour he employs it , but, if not, he disbands his workers. The question whether this duty would mean the re-opening of the BrokenH ill mines does not enter into the discussion. It is not a question of how this or any other item affects the people of Australia. There is scarcely an item, including the present one, on which we have not heard members like the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt), declare that the particular industry affected was necessary for putting the defences of the country on a proper basis. As I said when speaking on another item, there is not an industry in Australia to which the same argument could not be applied. with which the honourable member is more familiar than myself. able member, apparently, knows as much about chewing gum as, by his silence, he shows himself to know about this item. honourable member not to take notice of interjections. if you, sir, do not keep honourable members in order. to keep order if the honourable member replies to interjections. you, MT.

No doubt the request made by the Senate was sent to us Avith the intention of getting protection for the local producer of hides, but I am satisfied that if the amendment were made it would not have that effect, and that if there were a duty of Is. per lb. on green hide3, there would still have to be imported as many as are now imported. Green hides are imported because there is a shortage in Australia of a particular class of hide. hide. Because of our climatic conditions, the hides produced have not the body and substance that is required for certain kinds of leather, but there is a superabundance of light hides, of which we export annually a vast quantity. If we tanned all the light hides we produce, we should still have to import as many heavy hides as are how imported, or their equivalent in leather. That being so, the only effect of a duty on green hides would be to increase their price, and to increase the price of the leather made from them. The duty would be an impost on the raw material, which in the subsequent processes of manufacture would greatly increase the cost to the users of particular kinds of leather. tanning industry without benefiting our primary producers; indeed, it would injure the latter, so far as they may use those kinds of leather for the making of which heavy hides are required. ence between Tasmanian and New Zeahours. land hides, the climates of the two countries being practically the same? heavy hides are produced in the Commonwealth, but not sufficient to meet our requirements. needed ? sole leather, belting leather, and the heavier classes of harness leather, and a certain number of clean skins are needed for upholstery work, such as that in this chamber, in which whole hides that do not bear a mark of any description are neeessary.

What reason has the Ministerf o r refusing to foster an industry which is in such a bad way at the present time that the graziers cannot even sell their cattle? Almost every other industry in the Commonwealth has received its fai r measure of protection, and, in some instances, the Minister has refused to reduce the duty because revenue is required to carry on administration. member know that Australia has exported over £1,000,000 worth of hides per annum ? furnish the quantity of butter, cheese, bacon, and other produce exported; and yet We have import duties upon them. The Minister argues that the duty will not help the pastoralists, because hides will be imparted, but why cannot he give those pastoralists the benefit of the doubt ? In any case, even if hides are imported, what difference would I d . per lb. make in the price of boots or belting? It would probably not amount to more than 2d. on a pair of boots. If pastoralists are not entitled to protection, neither are good Protectionist, I every industry should be given whatever protection it needs. We should not compel any portion of the community to labour under an injustice. Sir Joseph Carruthers is appealing for 1,000,000 farms for 1,000,000 farmers, and a l l our public men are saying, ""Get on the land,"" and complaining that every one is coming to the big cities, where l if e is comparatively pleasant. If we want people to get on the land, here is an opportunity of encouraging pastoralists. We are hoping to get a large flow of immigrants to Australia, and we do not want to put them in the cities, where there are already large numbers of unemployed. We want them to go out into the country, and develop this immense continent of ours, which is nearly as large as Europe, b u t the men who have already gone out into the "" Never Never,"" and taken up land 200 miles or more from a railway terminus, subjecting themselves to all sorts of hardships and to the deprivation of social comforts, are refused a simple request for I d . a. l b . duty on hides. I ' am afraid our expenditure upon immigration w ill be wasted if we do not protect the primary producers. We have thousands of pounds upon the Estimates for advertising Australia. It is a very fine advertisement to refuse the pastoralists the protction afforded to other industries^ .1 hope that the Minister w ill see fit to report progress, because I feel very strongly upon .this point, and as honourable members seem to ba very obstinate, it w ill be necessary for me to -speak longer than I might do to-morrow. about 800,000 people in Melbourne, and over 1,000,000 in Sydney, whom we are protecting at the expense of those who are not residing in cities.

The pastoralists have not many votes.

I do not suppose that any industry in Australia is suffering to-day as much as the pastoral industry is doing, and I am convinced that a very large number of pastoralists and dairymen could not at the present time obtain for their stock one-fourth of the price at which they were valued for income tax purposes last year. not help them. stand the attitude taken up by the honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett), who professes to be thoroughly familiar with everything relating to the pastoral industry. He may be familiar with sheep-farming, but he cannot know anything about cattle-raising, otherwise he would not have given utterance to the remarks just made by him. I prefer to accept the opinion expressed by the United Graziers Associations in Queensland, who have written to honourable members pointing out the absolute necessity of giving them a protection of this kind on hides during these strenuous times. the Country party, who profess to be the friends of the primary producers, are not prepared to stand up for the pastoralist and dairy farmers in connection with this proposal. They advocate duties on dried f r u it s, potatoes, onions, and also wheat, -in the interests of certain relatively small constituencies, but everything else must be free of duty. They are not prepared to champion the cause of the primary producers who have gone into the back-blocks, and who, having purchased stock at very high prices three or four years ago, are now faced with a tremendous slump in the price of cattle. Surely the Country party should be prepared to assist them, by agreeing to the imposition of this duty of I d . per lb. on imported hides at the unanimous request of the Senate. member knows that the price of Queensland hides is not affected by the hides that are imported from New Zealand. does not know as much about this subject as do the Pastoralists Association of Queensland. He imagines that he knows a great deal more than the public generally give him credit for. The men engaged in the industry in Queensland know more about this matter than he does, and I hope the Committee will take into consideration the representations the in terested associations have made to us. I have voiced my objection to the M in is ter's proposal, and I hope the Senatefe request w ill , in common justice, be agreed to. is unnecessary that I should repeat what has been said by the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs) and the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr. Corser), but I should like to say that I entirely agree with their remarks. I represent one of the largest cattle districts in Queensland, and I know the hardships which the cattle people are going through at the present time. The bottom has fallen out of-the stock market, and in many cases cattle owners do not take the trouble to send their hides to market. If we are going to import hides the result must be that 'they will come into competition with those produced in I do not know why Australia, and the price of local hides must come down. Every cattle association in my district has written to me on this question, as has the United Graziers Association. Some honourable members have asked how members of the Country party intend to vote on this question, and as a member of that party I say that I am entirely in favour of the request made by the Senate. The Minister( Mr Greene) has said that he does not think that the imposition; of a duty of I d . per l b . on hides would do any good, but, if so,, it would not do any harm. Under the description "" green hides,"" all classes of hides might be imported, and their importation musttend to reduce the price of hides grown here. It is time that the pastoralists received a little in the way of protection. They have been loaded . w i th duties on wire and wire netting, and even the few extra shillings which 'this duty would represent upon a hide is being refused them. I repeat that I entirely endorse the remarks which have been made by the honourable members for Capricornia and Wide Bay.",67,Paths
