I repeat that the service was primarily established with a view to promoting trade. Unfortunately, our trade has not increased as we should have liked, and from a postal stand-point the service does not commend itself very much to us. There is no doubt-and the fact can be borne out by those who have crossed the Pacific-that if a better service were provided, by means of larger steamers travelling at an increased rate of speed, a great development might be made in that particular direction. So far, however, we have not managed to attain that desirable result. I presume that one of the reasons which prompted my predecessor to extend this twelve months was his desire to afford us an for a better service in the interim. My predecessor in office was at the time confronted with great difficulties in regard to the renewal of the mail contract with the Orient Steam Navigation Company, and consequently had to proceed very warily. I think that under the circumstances the best possible course has been pursued, and that we should ratify this contract, knowing that we shall have an opportunity before it expires to ascertain whether some improvements cannot be made in the service. From a postal stand-point, the service is of little or no value to us, and, unfortunately, the trade carried on by means of these steamers is also on the down grade. That, however, may be due to special circumstances which can be remedied. I am sure that if we could do anything to improve this service, and so place us in closer communication with other parts of the Empire-if we could, at a reasonable cost, do anything to promote trade between Australia and Canada, in addition to giving facilities to travellers-it would be a step in the right direction. in the cost to the Commonwealth ? £ 3 , 0 0 0 for the one year. these facts in view, I think I can with T know that Sir Edmund Barton made a confidence ask the House to agree to the promise to enter into such a contract, and motion. appear to be a disposition to discuss the motion, but surely one of the ex-Postmascompany give for demanding an increased ter-Generals will speak to the question. arrangement. General appeared to damn it with faint praise. I should therefore like some one more conversant with the details of the contract than I am to throw some further light on this part of the preferential trade proposals of the Government. It cannot be denied that this is part of the Government's Imperial scheme to keep trade routes open on the easiest terms, and to increase trade with the rest of the Empire by preferential rates. It seems to me that the failure to extend our trade by means of this subsidy throws a very curious light on the other preferential trade proposals made by the Ministry. If we have been unable, by means of a direct subsidized contract for steam-ship service, to encourage trade between Australia and Canada, I fail to see opportunity to arrange how we shall accomplish that object by the remission of a small part of our import duties in favour of the exports of that part of the Empire. Canada and Australia produce the same class of goods. of this subsidy shows the folly of resorting to artificial expedients to encourage trade which, under ordinary circumstances, follows the line of least resistance. As the proposal, however, is merely to extend the contract for twelve months, I do not feel disposed to oppose it. I did not think it was necessary to speak to the motion, but in view of the remarks of the honourable and learned member for Angas, I may say that I accept the f u l l responsibility for having entered into this contract when holding office as Postmaster General. I think that the contract was originally entered into some years ago by Sir Edmund Barton, who was at the time Premier of New South Wales.

43,Mr Watson,"What reasons did thepresently with that point. I thought at one time that it might be possible to avail ourselves of this service for the conveyance of our mails to England, and I inquired whether the company could put on a fast line of steamers between Sydney and Vancouver, with a view to our making more satisfactory arrangements with Canada for the speedy delivery of our mails in London at a much lower rate than that at present paid. I was informed, however, that the company would require two years' notice to enable them to secure the steamers necessary to land our oversea mails within anything like the time occupied by the vessels of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, and that a much larger subsidy would be required. which they demanded compare with that paid to the Orient Steam Navigation Company? they asked for a subsidy of something like £ 2 4 0 , 0 0 0 , but that was a proposal that I could not accept. I felt, however, that it would be undesirable to allow the contract to lapse while the House was in recess. The service connects us with an important part of the Empire into arrangements with France and other countries. I was anxious that, if possible, we should maintain this connection between Australia and Canada, as it would be free from many of the complications that might arise in time of war in connection with our mail service via the Suez Canal. It seemed to me that we might be able to arrange for a more expeditious service, which would possibly enter into competition with those of other companies. them this increased subsidy? pany were first approached with a view to securing a renewal of the contract they demanded an increase of something like ,£20,000, but eventually agreed to accept an increase of £ 6 , 0 0 0 per annum, our share of the increased payment being less than £ 3 , 0 0 0 per annum. stated that the line had not been as successf u l as had been anticipated, and, while it was hoped that it would develop, they would be unable to continue the service in the abI shall deal sence of an increased grant. A proposal was also made that the vessels of the company should call at New Zealand instead of at Queensland ports, but it did not meet with the approval of the late Government.

HadI remained in office I should have taken steps-anc l I dare say the present Minister will adopt this course-to ascertain whether we could not secure an improved service, and'so develop our trade relations with Canada, and have come to Parliament with a clear and definite policy with respect to this and other oversea mails. It would have been a mistake to A t all events, abandon the .service whilst Parliament -was in recess, rather than agree to pay the increased subsidy. We all hope that the Empire line, as it has been described, will grow in popularity, and that the time is not far! distant when it will be greatly improved. In that event it is quite possible that we shall be able to land our mails in England nearly as quickly by this service, as by that of the Orient Steam Navigation Company. If the service had been abandoned great difficulty would have been experienced in inducing another company to take it up. matter of sentiment, but I must say that I x am stronglv in favour of maintaining the connection between the old country and Australia by means of this route, if it can.

In regard to what has been said about our trade with Canada, I think that most of the timber coming here from the Dominion is brought by sailing vessels, and will continue to come here, even if the present line of steamers ceases to run. The point that concerns us is that, while we have a contract with the Orient Steam Navigation Company, and various other outlets for our mails, the Canadian service is worth comparatively little from the postal stand-point; and the subsidy really means that we are practically paying £ r for every £ 1 worth of goods exported from Australia. Last year we exported £ 2 9 , 0 0 0 worth of goods, and paid a subsidy of , £ 2 3 , 0 0 0; and this year we shall pay a subsidy of £ 2 6 , 0 0 0 . a large quantity of goods. expected to subsidize the carriage of goods thousands of pounds to support a line of sent here from other countries.

66,Mr Wilks,"He is now willing tosaid that a two years' contract would induce the company to put on faster boats, and to provide better facilities for the carriage of perishable produce; but they have not done so. The fact is, that this company, which is subsidized by Canada, the Commonwealth, and Fiji, has to meet the fiercest competition from an American subsidized line, whose boats run from Sydney to San Francisco, and are owned by Spreckels, the sugar king. That line is running the Canadian British-owned and British-manned service off the Pacific. The Union Steam-ship Company is also making it more difficult for the Canadian-Australian line to get trade. The volume of our trade with America is to be measured, not by what the Canadian-Australian boats carry, but by what is carried by them, and by the San Francisco and Union boats. prepared to say at this juncture that I am entirely opposed to the payment of subsidies. When nations like America and Germany are forcing their trade throughout the civilized world by means of subsidized steam-ship companies, it is necessary for us to consider whether it would not be wise for British communities to follow their example. No doubt, if I voted for such a line of policy, I might be considered as acting contrarily to the creed of a free trader; but my action would certainly not be stranger than that of the present Ministry, who at one moment declare for the policy of Australia for the Australians, and the next bring forward a proposal like that now under discussion. I presume that twelve months hence we shall be asked to renew this contract again, if not on the terms now arranged for, still under terms which will involve the payment of a heavy subsidy. When Sir Edmund Barton urged the payment of'this subsidy, he argued that the existence of the Canadian-Australian line would make it possible for the Commonwealth to make better terms in connection with the mail service via Suez; but it was recently shown, when the contract with the Orient Steam Navigation Company was being arranged for, that the Commonwealth received no advantage from the existence of the Canadian-Australian Company. about that. member knows more about the matter than I do, and I am sorry that he did not refer to it when addressing the Committee. In arranging the contract, I am sorry that an opportunity was not taken to require the company to undertake the training on board its vessels of a certain number of boys from our reformatories. If they were apprenticed to these subsidized lines, we should gradually build up a force to man our Australian Navy and mercantile marine, a very necessary thing, seeing how difficult it is to induce our people to go to sea. I believe that the shipping company would have been willing to take a certain number of these lads as apprentices, and the training of them would have been of great future advantage to the Commonwealth. I intend to vote for the motion, but I again emphasize for the comfort of the Minister of Trade and Customs the fact that it strikes a direct blow at his action in resisting the I am not importation of harvester machines. Parliament is being"" asked to ratify this contract. The statement of the Postmaster General shows that the business of this steam-ship line is not increasing as we hoped .it would. At present in our trading relations with Canada, the balance is against us; that is, Ave are importing more goods from that country than we are exporting to it. One of the reasons for this is, I think, that Canada has representatives in Victoria and New South Wales, whose business it is to push her trade in Australia. But we have in Canada no representative to push our interests, and in that respect we are failing in our duty to our producers. I was recently in the Dominion, and: met the members of its Board of Trade, who expressed a desire to reciprocate with us. They referred to the large amount which Canada pays to maintain this steami-ship line, and spoke of their desire to see its business increase. Unless special inducements are offered to passengers and traders in the shape of better accommodation and increased speed, the Canadian service will never take the place of that which is conducted vid the Suez Canal. I feel that we can do nothing but ratify this contract. It would be disastrous to our relations with Canada and the Empire, as a whole, if the service were to be discontinued, and I think the late Postmaster-General acted wisely in extending the contract. It is painful to notice the lack of interest on the part of honourable members in this important subject. It is quite true that the lion's share of the",20,Chapman A S A Mat

Canadian merchants are fully alive to their own interests, and they have in Mr J. S. Larke, their commercial representative in Sydney, a very able and efficient officer.

Spreckles .and Co., but I It would be affectation on my part to say that I was not disappointed at the condition of affair's revealed by the Postmaster General with regard to the Vancouver service. After having subsidized the line for from twelve to fourteen years, it is not encouraging to find that our trade is a dwindThose vessels are perfect ling quantity, and that the outlook for the future is anything but hopeful. I certainly expected that, on the inauguration of The Postmaster-General should the Pacific cable, a great fillip would have been given to our trade with Canada and other parts of Northern America. However, it seems that the more we multiply the means of intercourse, and the more we pay for them the less we get out of them in the way of business, and direct intercourse between the various peoples of the Empire. I agree with the honourable Within a very short member for Kooyong that it is time that the Government seriously tackled this proend, and it will be necesblem, and made a thorough investigation to enter into a fresh coninto it, with a view to recommending a Surely the Postmaster-General policy for the future. We certainly cannot continue for an indefinite term to pay a larger amount by way of subsidy than the value of our total'export trade with Canada. I was bitterly disappointed when I heard the figures that were read by the Postmaster-General. Ten years ago our export trade with Canada was something substantial, but gradually it has dwindled away until it now represents a value of only £ 2 9 , 0 0 0 per annum. I felt the more keenly disappointed because of the very great interest I took in this enterprise some years ago. I .remember that, when the mail service was first started in New South Wales, a very great struggle was entered upon, and one man-the late Sir James Huddart-is now in his grave largely owing to the difficulties he had to encounter. He was the pioneer of the line, and if it should succeed in the future, to him will belong the chief credit for having established this I think that arrangements means of intercourse between Canada and Australia. He embarked upon the enterprise in the hope and belief that the development and expansion of our Empire trade would assume proportions far greater than we have seen in recent years. It has been said by the Postmaster-General that this is not merely a mail subsidy. It has",21,Chapman A S A Mat
70,Mr Joseph Cook (Parramatta),"never been so regarded. vice it has been worth very little to Australia, because the mails cannot be so expeditiously sent by that route as vid the Suez Canal. Our support of the service has always been based upon sentimental and Imperial considerations, as well as upon those relating to the carriage of the mails; and the case made out abundantly justified the inauguration of the service. We cannot, however, go on in the present lackadaisical and haphazard way. I hesitated to speak upon this subject, because I felt that I should much prefer to have been able to say something in favour of the service. It is unusual appointed commercial agents here. Surely for a Minister to make a proposal of this kind without having anything to say in its favour; but we must sympathize with him when we investigate the facts, and find them so unpromising. In my opinion, there are several directions in which we might conduct inquiries in order to ascertain what our prospects are. In the first place I would refer to the advent to our shores of Earl Jersey, who has been in Canada, who has taken a very keen interest in all matters rea course which would be followed by any lating to Inter-Imperial trade, and who is, perhaps, one of the best authorities upon such subjects. He has also taken a keen interest in the inauguration of the Pacific Cable, and I believe that he attended one or two conferences on the subject in Ottawa, and is, perhaps, more au fait with our relations with Canada than is any other disinterested iman in London to-dav. I think the Government might very well obtain his opinion as to the prospects of our trade with Canada as well as with regard to the successful working of the Pacific Cable. Whilst we are paying a subsidy of -£30,000 per annum for the Pacific Cable connection with Canada, and £26,000 for our commercial connection by means of the Vancouver mail service, the volume of our export trade represents a value of only £29,000 per annum. These facts cannot be regarded as unsatisfactory. We -have recently received some large importations from Canada, but T regret to say that these are on the down grade-instea d of increasing, they appear to be decreasing very materiallv. The statistics for the last year, for which we have the returns, show a falling off of £100,000 in the value of our imports from Canada. sent wheat. it consists of grain, and our large importaAs a mail sertions in recent years may have been due to the scarcity of that product in Australia. The fact that we are now more nearly satisfying our own requirements may account for the tremendous drop in our imports from that country. But whatever may be the nature of that produce, the fact remains that the total trade between the two countries is not increasing, but, on the other hand, is decreasing. I am not quite sure that we ought not to accept the suggestion of the honourable member for Kooyong. I am of opinion that we ought to appoint a commercial agent in Canada, just as the Dominion has already if we are justified in expending -£26,000 annually by way of subsidy to a mail company, and a further sum of £[30,000 in connection with the Pacific Cable, for the purpose of developing trade, we are warranted in spending a few thousand pounds per annum extra upon a commercial agency, with a view to attracting trade to the routes that we keep open by means of these subsidies. Unless we are going to adopt that courselarge commercial house-w e had better not enter into the matter at all. That is one direction in which I think the Government might see their way to make a beginning. They might well appoint a representative in the Dominion, whose duty it would be to search out avenues of trade, and ascertain if there is not a possibility of developing commerce between the two countries. There is another reason why I would hesitate to interfere with this arrangement by the Government. I recognise that the Vancouver service keeps open an avenue of communication between Australia and another part of the Empire, and we have not too many of those avenues. We do not enjoy the special facilities that are enjoyed by some other countries, and we cannot afford to sacrifice any of those means of communication which link us, so to speak, with the enterprise and commerce of the world. For that reason alone, I would hesitate a long time before doing anything that would obstruct the further extension of this contract. Nevertheless, I think it is due to the House that the Postmaster-General should inform us of what he proposes to do in connection with our mail services. The Government ought to present contract vid Vancouver is running",22,Chapman A S A Mat

72,Mr Joseph Cook,"Very probably, out, and unless some fresh arrangementsare speedily made, we shall inevitably find ourselves in the position that we occupied in our recent negotiations for a renewal of the agreement with the Orient Steam Navigation Company. It is high time that some policy was announced in respect of all these oversea mail contracts. we used to consider that two years was a short enough period to allow for the expiration of any of these ocean-going contracts. It is certainly little enough notice to give those who own the boats to make fresh arrangements for meeting changed requirements in the service, and it is little enough time to allow us to complete our arrangements, in case we desire to terminate any of these contracts. In the present instance, we are extending the contract for a year only. I think that some definite policy ought to be submitted to the House in regard to all these mail contracts, seeing that they link us up with the world at large. I would suggest that the Postmaster-General should make a complete declaration of policy in regard to the mail communication of Australia with the rest of the world. expires ? not a moment to lose if the thing is to be done effectively and in a business-like way. Of course, we cannot blame the present Postmaster-Generalf or not having submitted such a policy, because he has not been"" in office sufficiently long. At the same time, I do earnestly ask him to tackle this question at the very earliest moment, and to see if we cannot make some better arrangements in regard to our mail communications with, and our trade routes to, oversea countries. As I have already said, we should have some commercial agency in Canada, so that we might be in a position to thoroughly exploit the possibilities of the Canadian market for our own exports. Personally, I am not so sanguine as to the lines of trade which we might develop with Canada. For instance, I find that our exports at present consist of butter, hides and skins, a little coal, and a small quantity of wool. We do not export much in any of these lines. The total value of our exports to the Dominion, viz., £ 2 9 , 0 0 0 , is split up amongst these four main items. Honourable members will, therefore, recognise that any one of them must represent an insignificant sum in itself. I suppose that our coal comes very severely into competition with the coal of the'Dominion, of which there is an abundant supply. Our butter, I am afraid, is not likely to find a permanent foothold in competition with the Canadian article, at any rate, in the Dominion market. I see no reason why it should not compete with Canadian butter elsewhere, but I scarcely think that it can do so in the Canadian market, In the old days having regard to the high Tariff which is operative against Australia as well as the rest of the world. It will thus be seen that all our exports to Canada are such as that country itself produces in abundance. Consequently, the outlook in the direction of developing a permanent export trade with Canada does not appear to be very rosy. Our imports from Canada also consist of commodities which are common to both countries, and in the production of which both excel. As an example, take the item of timber. We have an abundance of that in Australia. sure that we have not every class of timber that Canada exports here. Of course, it is more profitable commercially to obtain certain kinds of timber from Canada, otherwise we should not do so. It seems to me that the possibilities of developing an export trade with Canada are not of the rosy character we could wish, entertaining as we do a sincere desire to keep open our means of communication with every part of the world with which they are possible. However, this is a matter for further inquiry. I do not think that the possibilities of the situation have been exploited at all. We have been content to allow trade to come here if it cared to do so, and to do the other thing if it did not. None of the big trusts of America or Canada would act in that way where their own interests were concerned, and this Parliament should not vote large sums without taking care that they find their way into remunerative channels-that is, into channels which will bring us an adequate commercial return. I do not suggest that we should embark upon these enterprises simply for commercial gain. I think that for us to be linked up with one of the countries of the Empire is worth something, and I shall always be prepared to pay a subsidy to any line of steamers for that purpose alone. But we ought to know exactly what we are paying this subsidy for, what are the prospects in regard to our means of communication, and whether trade with Canada is likely to be developed after we have tided over our present difficulties.

There would be no room then for complaint on either side. orable gentleman mean a fixed total sum, or a fixed per capita amount? a fixed sum should be annually returnable to the States. I do not say thali it should be. paid immediately on a per capita basis, inasmuch as such a system at this stage would operate unjustly to the States. To my mind, the sum to be returned to tbe States should be based upon the amounts which they receive during the operation of the Braddon section. Our ultimate goal, however, should be to make a fixed distribution. That should be part of any arrangement made, but it would be a matter of no moment, if it were provided that a per capita distribution should not be made for many years hence. We should take care not to adopt a system that may cause in jury to any State. I take it that all that the States desire is to secure what is really their own. I have heard it said by representatives of Tasmania and Queensland, that it is desirable that a per capita distribution should at once be made. A perusal of the figures shows that such a distribution would probably be advantageous to those States, and that may account for this desire on the part of their representatives. I am confident, however, that it is only a passing fancy. It should be our object to see that each State So that the right shall, as f a r as possible, have its own, and to work towards the making of the distribution on a per capita basis.

93,Sir John Forrest,"We must takeif we took over their debts, we should not relieve them of the responsibility of providing the interest. They are liable to indemnify the Commonwealth in regard to any deficiency that may occur in the amount requited for interest on transferred loans, so that after the expiration of the Braddon section, we might expend the whole of the Customs and Excise revenue, and still call upon the States to pay the interest on the loans taken over. That being so, my honourable friend's proposition would not assist us. As long as the Commonwealth is bound, as it is, under section 94 of the Constitution, to return to the States any surplus revenue, we can never have financial independence for the Commonwealth, and security for the States. Mv own idea is that the sooner we secure financial independence for the Commonwealth, and arrange a carefully prepared scheme, by which a fixed amount will be payable to' the States, the better it will be. Those are the ideas to which I gave utterance in my Budget speech, and I have since seen no reason to change my views in this matter. I am glad that the Premier of New South Wales has accepted the proposition, and has communicated with this Government in regard to it ; but I am not aware that any of the other States has moved in the same direction. Some of those in power in the States act as if the States were the masters of the situation, whereas it is the Commonwealth that is in that position. I do not wish to take advantage of the States, and I hope that it will never be said of me that I had any desire but to help them. I am as ready to be the friend of the States as to be the friend of the Commonwealth. Indeed, I consider that Commonwealth Ministers and members of Parliament are all trustees for the people of Australia, who are the same people as the people of'the States. If we do anything to injure the States we injure the very people whom we represent. me that the States are technically, at any rate, in a position of insecurity, so far as their finances are concerned. security for Queensland and Tasmania. may, I feel sure, rely upon receiving fair consideration from this Parliament, but, notwitfistandirur ffiat, the States should not It seems to me that the Government might act as if they were independent and able to impose what terms they like. This matter has to be dealt with on business lines, so that what is best for both States and the Commonwealth may be done. I have given it a good deal of attention recently, and the solution of the difficulty, which appeals to me, is to free the Commonwealth from the condition which will hamper it in the future, and to give to the States the security which is necessary for their financial"" stability. The taking over of the debts of the States is another matter which is not necessarily associated with the return of the surplus. The States are responsible for the debts which they have incurred, and no proposal' has yet been made or suggested which would relieve them of that responsibility. It is impossible to deal, on a -per capita basis, with tbe £203,000,000 which' was borrowed by the States prior to the inauguration of Federation, as the amounts, per head are different in each State. I desire, however, that the debts of the States shall be taken over by the Commonwealth, because I think that such action will be of advantage to both States and Commonwealth. The Commonwealth will, in the future, be in a far stronger position to finance these loans than any State can possibly be in. Any saving that may thereby accrue should go to the State in regard to whose debts it is made, and thus assist its finances. I did not intend to speak on this matter, but as the deputy leader of the Opposition invited me to disclose my opinions, I have willingly done so, freely and unreservedly. know whether it is intended, because of the financial statement which the Treasurer has been drawn into making, that there shall be a general debate on Commonwealth finance, but if that is to take place, I would suggest that the Committee requires additional information from the Government. If there is to be guaranteed fo the States the return of a certain amount of revenue It seems to each year, the question must be asked, How is that revenue to be obtained by the Commonwealth? If the present Government is true to its protective principles, ( and imposes a Tariff which will benefit the industries of Australia, our Customs revenue must decrease as our industries increase, and, consequently, we shall ultimately not be in a position to return to the States as much revenue as they require. declare in favour of the imposition of direct taxation.

I did not anticipate a community. Land is the source of all wealth, and all revenue should be raised by means of taxes upon it. We must either adopt a protectionist' policy that will have the effect of entirely shutting out imports, or we must throw our ports open and raise our revenue by some other means than Customs duties. When we come to consider the fiscal question, the discussion should range between these two extremes. the first to seek for fiscal peace. me, because I am regarded as a fiscal atheist. policy for the Government, and as Ministers are protectionists I anticipate that they will prefer to adopt a reasonably high Tariff, which will have the effect of shutting out imports. If that course be adopted, the revenue now derived from Customs duties will be lost, and the Commonwealth and the States will have to raise money by some other means. The States could impose a land tax to meet their requirements, and I think it is preferable that they should do so, because if they have to collect their own revenue they will be more careful in spending it. At present we have to perform the disagreeable work of collecting revenue whilst the States engage in the pleasurable occupation of spending it. I would suggest that the discussion of this great issue might very before the session closes that course will well be postponed until we are called upon to consider the extension or otherwise of the we shall have made substantial progress in Braddon section. told us that the Commonwealth was the master of the financial situation, and I was glad to hear him qualify that statement by indicating that he had no wish to act in any manner antagonistic to the interests of the States. I think that it will be a subject Cusfor lasting regret if , in connection with the settlement of the States debts question or the extension of the Braddon sections, we fail to carry the States with us. We are sometimes apt to forget that the people of the States and of the Commonwealth are one, and that they have to carry the burdens imposed both by the States and this Parliament. I believe that the extension of the Braddon clause will be necessary in the interests of the States, unless we can make an arrangement for the payment of a lump full dress debate upon the States debts question to-day. Indeed, I do not think it would be fair to the Treasurer to discuss that matter, except incidentally, at this stage. PerhapsI may be pardoned for once more referring to the fact that a motion upon the business-paper standing in my name contemplates the appointment of a Select Committee, which would be of great service to us in dealing with those complex questions of finance which must be settled in the near future. I know that my motion has the approval of the Government and of a majority of honourable members, and I regret that an opportunity has not been presented for the full consideration of the proposal and the appointment I am now seeking to outline a of the Committee. I have no hesitation in saying that if the proposed Committee had been appointed we should by this time have had before us some practical recommendation, which could have been remitted for the consideration and approval of the States. I believe that the opposition to the appointment of the Committee proceeds from the desire of some honourable members that the Treasurer shall bring down a specific scheme, which may be torn to shreds. I hold, however, that this great question should be dealt with, apart from party considerations, and without any regard to the personnel of the Ministry. A practical scheme should be formulated, and it seems to me that the readiest means of bringing about that result is by appointing a Committee such as I propose. I hope that be adopted, and that within a short time the direction of solving the intricate problems which will soon have to be faced.

Of course, my action in questioning the wisdom of the very eminent men who drafted our Constitution may be regarded as very ridiculous, but I think that the way in which they dealt with this matter was absolutely absurd. In many respects, our Constitution is not what it should be. Its framers apparently preferred to follow that of America, rather than the freer Constitution, of Canada. The Dominion confederation started its existence by returning to the States a fixed sum. If we had adopted that course it would have been very much better. If we desire to take over the States debts, it would be wise for us to return to the States Treasurers a specific amount each year. We should then be able to make better terms upon the London money market, and any advantage which might be secured in that direction would be enjoyed by the States, which would be called upon to contribute a smaller amount by way of interest. I wish to know what the Treasurer proposes to do in this connection? He is always so I am not in favour beautifully indefinite that we can never extract any statement of policy from him. Indeed, the entire Government are very indefinite in regard to everything that they undertake. Their policy is one of d r if t . They cannot control even the business of the House in the way in which they ought to control it. Any statement which is made by them appears to come from dreamland.

Time after time we have seen burdens cast upon the smaller States-burden s which they should not be asked to bear. We bad an instance of that only this afternoon, when the Vancouver mail contract was under consideration. We then saw how responsibilities which were originally assumed by New South Wales and Queensland were transferred to the whole of the States. It is admitted that the Vancouver mail service i's being carried on at a loss, and that it is doing no good to Australia, although it is benefiting Canada. I presume that we have no power to stop the payment of the subsidy during the next fifteen months; but I do hope that before the contract is renewed this House will be consulted upon the matter. I should not have arisen to address the Committee but for certain statements which were made by the honourable member for Darling. 1 He argued, inferential!}', that if money is not exacted by taxation from the people, it must remain in their pockets. That is an absolute fallacy. It is quite possible that a protective duty may be imposed upon any article, and that people may be compelled to pay just as much for it as they would be if no such duty were operative. The money may not find its way into the revenue, but it may go into the pockets of certain manufacturers. For example, there is a duty of 2d. per lb. upon starch. The other day, as the result of inquiries, I ascertained that practically no revenue was derived from that item. duty upon starch. of id. per lb. locally manufactured is being sold at 5^d. per lb., and that 6d. per lb. is being charged for imported starch. Naturally, the people use the cheaper article, and, as a result, very little imported starch is consumed. Thus, whilst the present duty prevents the importation of starch, the consumers still have to pay for that article within Jd. per lb. of what they would be required to pay i fTOduty were operative. not in order in discussing the Tariff. to a statement which was made by the honourable member for Darling. Take another article as an illustration; I refer to sugar. Prior to Federation, Tasmania received between £[60,000 and £[80,000 per annum from the duty on sugar. During the past two years she has obtained only about £[27,000 per annum from that source. But under the per capita system she has been compelled to return about £13,000 annually by way of sugar bounty. Consequently, she is £[40,000 a year worse off that she was previously. Yet colonial sugar is being sold at the same price as is the imported article. Although Tasmania is losing that amount of revenue, the money doss not find its' way into the pockets of the people, but into the coffers of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. the Excise duty ? production of starch, and allow the State to obtain all the profits. ber's party declares itself in favour of the nationalization of industries, but does not accomplish anything.

I have risen merely to say emphatically that, unless a more advantageous scheme be proposed, the proposition that the Braddon section shall be renewed will have my support.

The speech of the Treasurer came to me somewhat as a surprise, because, if I understood him aright, he raised a difficulty respecting the taking over of the debts of the States which had not previously been, placed before this Parliament. that he said that if the Commonwealth took over the debts of the States they would still be responsible for them.

Sir makes stand under be relieved of responsibility, unless the Constitution is amended. a taking over of the debts without conversion, the States would continue to be responsible, but if there were a conversion, the Commonwealth would be responsible. I am surprised that the Treasurer should raise this bogy. I see no difficulty in the Commonwealth takirg over the debts and getting an indemnity from the States for the payment of the interest. The proposal to guarantee the States the return of a fixed amount of Customs revenue is one upon which I shall speak upon another occasion. Mr G. B. EDWARD S (South Sydney). -The Committee seems to be entering into an academical discussion about taking over the debts of the States, and the relative financial positions of the Commonwealth and the States; but I think that the matter is one which might be allowed to stand over The electors are the until some future occasion, because it is hardly ripe for settlement yet. It should have been discussed, if necessary, during the debate on the financial statement, though I do not think the Treasurer put before us any definite proposal. Something must be done in the future, and whatever is done should be in the direction of ending once and for all the financial dependence of the States on the Commonwealth. If the Braddon provision is not renewed, and I believe that ultimately it will cease to have effect, we shall have to relieve the States of their debts, and to adopt some scheme of finance under which will be known the burden which the Commonwealth has to bear, while the States will be aware that if they require I think further revenue they must provide it for themselves. I wish now to make some suggestions which I think are capable of yielding fruit immediately. In discussing the JOHN FORREST -Read section 105 Treasurer's Financial Statement, I asked the Government if they would take into conT h e States sideration-as two previous Governments promised to do-the advisability of appointing a Committee of Public Accounts. I pointed out that such a Committee would greatly assist the House in dealing with the Estimates, and would give more security to honourable members that proper economy was being observed. The Estimates for the JOHN FORREST -The Constitution present financial year have now been under the States responsible. consideration during several sittings, but I D o I undermust confess that, after each succeeding that the conversion is impossible dispute in regard to particular items, I the Constitution? have been still more in the dark than I was before; and I think that other honourable members have been in the same position. If the Committee which I suggest were appointed, its members would obtain If there were information in regard to the Estimates from the heads of Departments and other officials, and would submit a report to this House, which would guide honourable members in their subsequent action according as the evidence disclosed that there was or was not warrant for the proposed expenditure. I know that a proposal of this kind, when made to a Minister, generally goes into one ear and out of the other, but I hope that the Treasurer will consider this matter. In my opinion, the appointment of the suggested Committee would facilitate the transaction of business, and ease tlie consciences of individual members, who now have to vote for items in regard to which they cannot get proper information, sometimes because the Minister himself does not possess it .",33,Batchelor

In the House of Commons there has been such a Committee for many years, and if honourable members turn to its reports they will see that it has done very good work. mittee in Victoria. Mr G. B . EDWARDS out that most of the troubles in connection with the War Office scandals and the wasteful expenditure of money were first discovered by the Committee of Public Accounts, connected with the House of Commons. A similar Committee has been in existence in Victoria, and I find, upon inquiry, that, although for some time it did not work with any great degree of success, it has at last settled down to the discharge of very useful functions. I notice that the press, in referring to the last report of the Committee, admitted that the results of its inquiries were most valuable, and most instructive to Parliament, and that they facilitated the transaction of business. Under these circumstances, I think the Government might consider whether such a Committee should not be appointed, and also be given power to sit during recess to inquire into the various ramifications of our Commonwealth finance, and ascertain where economies might be effected in connection with the expenditure upon our Departments. The other matter to which I wish to refer is the difficulty I have experienced with three Ministries in connection with the decimal coinage system, of which the House has approved on two occasions. I think that this is a fitting opportunity to refer to the matter, and I desire first of all to ask the Treasurer why no provision is made in the Estimates of his Department for the expenditure that would be incurred in taking the preliminary steps to carry out the expressed will of Parliament in this connection. We were engaged yesterday in discussing a proposal for the appropriation of £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 for a very high and noble pursent. pose, and it was regrettable to notice that so much noise was made with reference to the expenditure of that amount. The Decimal Coinage Committee, after the most caref u l inquiry, made it clear that the Commonwealth, by minting its own silver coinage, upon the decimal system, could derive a profit of £ 3 0 , 0 0 0 per annum. Whilst a great outcry is being made about the expenditure of the £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 to which I have referred, honourable members are content to allow Ministry after Ministry to occupy office,' without insisting that effect shall i"".e given to its will in reference to coinage. member considered how we shall be able to get rid of our present silver coinage? Mr G. B. EDWARDS I might ask the Treasurer whether he has considered the I may point question. I think there is a difficulty. Mr G. B . EDWARDS -There is no difficulty whatever, and! the Treasurer is quite at sea if he thinks that any serious obstacles present themselves. There is nothing to prevent the Commonwealth from transferring the whole of its silver coinage to some other part of the British Empire. Mr G. B . EDWARDS I would take it at its face value, if the Commonwealth paid, me a commission for placing it elsewhere. I know what I am talking about, because I have made inquiries which the Government should have entered upon long ago. I have ascertained from leading bank officials that there would be no difficulty whatever in removing the. coinage we now have here to other parts of the British Empire, and replacing it with our own. The Commonwealth would be required to pay a commission to cover the cost of transferring the coin to the agents of the banks abroad, and the loss resulting from its temporary withdrawal from circulation. I acknowledge that if we shipped the whole of the present silver currency to England in one lot, and distributed it there through agents, we should act in a most unfriendly way towards Ihe mother country ; but there is no necessity for us to proceed to such an extreme. gold?

What is the use of our meeting here and declaring upon two occasions that a system of decimal coinage should be adopted, ancl that the Commonwealth should mint its own silver coins, if no action is to be taken to give effect to our decisions? Is the resolution of the House to come to naught because Ministry after Ministry, are occupied with other subjects which should not occupy their time to the neglect of a matter which has the most important bearing upon the economic working of this young nation? The report of the Decimal Coinage Committee has been pigeon-holed. Sir been pigeon-holed; we are waiting for a reply from the Imperial authorities. Mr G. B . EDWARDS surer had been managing a business outside, and he had been required to wait for a reply as long as the Government have been kept waiting in this instance, he would have taken some steps to stir things up. The late Government were about to enter into an arrangement which would have had the effect of perpetuating the present nonsensical system of coinage. They did not understand the question, and they thought that they would be doing a good stroke of business if they could secure a douceur of £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 per annum from the British Government in respect to the silver coinage in circulation in the Commonwealth. I arrested that movement^ and the late Prime Minister promised me that nothing should be done until the question was again submitted to the House. The correspondence that has since taken place reveals the fact that, in the first ""instance, the late Ministry misinformed the British Government as to the intentions of the Commonwealth in this matter. They represented that we desired to obtain the replv from the Imperial Government. profits to be derived from tbe minting of our silver coinage, whereas this Parliament know whether the Government intend to decided to adopt the decimal system. The give effect to the report of the Selate Government actually asked the I m lect Committee upon decimal coinage, perial authorities to furnish them with deand. if so, what steps they intend to take signs for half-crowns and threepenny in this connection ?

The correspondence proceeded until a correction was made, so far as that aspect of the question was concerned. I do not wonder that the Imperial authorities deferred their reply, because it appears, from the correspondence, that we do not know our own mind. Finally, the British Government were informed that we desired their assistance in getting rid of the present silver coinage to the extent of £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum. It was proposed that the Imperial authorities should reduce their mintage of silver coins by that amount, and that they should utilize the £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 worth of silver coins withdrawn from circulation in Australia for supplying requirements in other parts of the Empire. The intention was that the silver coin thus withdrawn should be replaced year by year by Commonwealth coinage. I think lhat such coins should be minted here. We have a protectionist Ministry, and as we have JOHN FORREST -No; it has not the silver we might as well mint it here. If , however, it is considered undesirable to establish a silver mint, we might arrange If the Treafor the minting of the coins at Birmingham, where work of that kind is largely carried on. If we withdrew from circulation every year £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 worth of the present currency, and replaced it with Commonwealth coinage to a similar amount, plus £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 or £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 worth to provide for the natural increase, we should, within ten years, have a currency entirely our own. That coinage would cost us only 75 per cent, of its face value, and we should have an amount equivalent to 125 per cent, of the face value of the coins stored awav somewhere, earning interest which would vield us £ 3 0 , 0 0 0 per annum, after defraying all costs, and making allowance for the wear and tear of the present gold coinage-for which no provision is made at present.

The States which will be more particularly affected by any suggested change have a right to know, before their respective Parliaments assemble next year, what is the policy of the Commonwealth in respect of this question. As the Treasurer is very well aware, the States Treasurers, in preparing their Estimates for next year, ought to have some idea of what the financial policy of the Commonwealth will be for that year. It is unfair to delay an announcement upon this matter until next session, and then to spring it upon the States, especially if we decide to make some radical change in the existing arrangement. If , by timely action upon this subject, we can avoid engendering further friction with the States, we ought to do so. From press reports which I have seen, I understand that the Treasurer leans towards a continuance of the bookkeeping system. If that be. so, he should experience no difficulty in convincing the Government that it is the best system. At one time.

Although it was stated twelve months ago that a new system was to be introduced, there has been a sudden change of front. reply from the Imperial authorities. -silver coinage is being minted in England, and the British Government is making a profit that should really be secured by the Commonwealth. March that the last letter was written. a Select Committee to deal with the question of coinage, and has thoroughly discussed the whole matter. The right honourable member for Balaclava read a letter some time ago which suggested that finality had almost been reached in the negotiations, but, judging by the statements made to-day by the Treasurer, a settlement of the question is impeded by some difficulty as to what shall be done with our present silver coinage. There must be some way of absorbing it in Great Britain, and it seems to me that unless the Government are prepared to take a decisive step we shall have to wait some time for the reforms necessary to enable the Commonwealth to secure from this source the profit to which it is entitled. pleased to hear the statement made by the Treasurer that he was not disposed to favour an extension of the Braddon section. I have been from the first stronglyopposed to the principle embodied in that provision, and fail to see that it affords any protection to the States. It certainly does not conduce to economy on the part of the Governments of those States in which a large amount of revenue is raised by means of the Customs and Excise duties. Our experience of its operation is that, whilst the States which lost revenue by the transfer of their Customs and Excise Departments to the Federation have had a hard struggle to pay their way, the other States have gained enormously, but those that gained with those that lost have been faced with financial difficulties, .the difference being that while the needs of the one compelled economy, the extravagance of the other rendered it equally necessary. New South Wales has gained more largely than has any of the others by reason of the transfer, and the question of economical administration has now to be faced by it. The Braddon section requires the imposition of an enormous tax upon the people. Turning to the Budget papers, I find that at the end of the current financial year-if the Treasurer's estimate be correct -Ne w South Wales will have contributed something like £12,779,000 to the revenue by way of Customs and Excise duties. When that State entered the Federation her Customs and Excise taxation amounted to about £ 1 6s. 4d. per head of the population ; but, as a result of the Federal Tariff, it amounts to-day to £ 2 os. 9§d. per head. During the drought, when New South Wales was compelled to use a larger quantity of imports than she requires in normal seasons, her taxation under this heading increased to £ 2 9s. 7jd. per head of the population. If the State Parliament during this period had had the control of the Customs and Excise Department, it would not have levied such enormous taxation. When the fiscal question was handed over to the Federal Parliament, the people of New South Wales no longer had the sole determination of their Customs taxation, and consequently duties were imposed which gave a very much larger return than the State was in the habit of getting. I find from table F, inserted in the Treasurer's Budget tables, in which are given the gains and losses of the States from Customs and Excise revenue, and the net gains and net losses, after deducting the cost of Federation The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN.

191,Mr Joseph Cook,"My point is thatdeputy leader of the Opposition a very important one. It is the duty of Parliament to safeguard the public funds, and I submit that an honourable member, in dealing with a matter with which the States are so much concerned, as they are in the matter to which the honourable member for Canobolas is referring, is quite in order in advancing the illustration which he is about to put forward. It is obvious that this is not a "" stone-walling"" discussion, and, therefore, it would be a serious matter to curtail the rights of any honourable member. Tbe TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. The only items which are now properly open for discussion are those which appear on page 33 of the Estimates; but, in accordance with the practice of the Committee, I am allowing greater latitude until the first item of Division 27 is passed. At the same time, I ask honourable members not to allow the discussion to develop into a Budget debate, covering the whole range of financial policy. fined to the discussion of the items on page 33. we could refer to only the Administrative division, the Accountant's branch, and the Correspondence branch of the Treasury Department. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN Those are the only items which are formally before the Committee, and properly open to discussion. Committee has been to have a general discussion of the administration of a Department on the first item of its Estimates. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN As I have said, it has been tlie practice to allow greater latitude while the first item is before the Committee; but if honourable members attempt to debate the whole of the financial proposals of the Government, I must, to conserve the time of the Committee, and to conform with the rules of debate, ask them to confine their remarks to the matters immediately before the Chair. a question of the Chairman giving a certain amount of latitude, but of the rights of honourable members. If honourable members are in the ignoble position of having to seek a favour from the Chairman to enable them to discuss these matters, we shall have to resort to other methods, and I shall lie compelled to ask Mr Speaker to give a direction on the subject. All we desire is I consider the point of the to exercise our right to enter upon a general discussion of the administration of the Department of the Treasury. Mr Temporary Chairman, do not propose to curtail the latitude which it has been usual to allow in dealing with the first item of the Estimates of a Department. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. I have already stated that. were not allowed, I do 'not see how we could get on. It is a very old custom to move to reduce the salary of a Minister in order to give an opportunity to debate the administration of his Department. The last Liberal Government went out of office on a proposal connected with cordite, which raised the whole policy of defence, just as the question of the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States is being raised now. I take it that the honourable member for Canobdlas may, if necessary, move to reduce the salary of the Secretary to the Treasury, to open up the questions he wishes to discuss. to discuss the effect of the Braddon provision upon the relation of the States ant the Commonwealth,and thought that I had ample precedent in the speech of the Treasurer this afternoon. I would also remind you, Mr Batchelor, that other speakers today have been allowed considerable latitude. One of them urged the adoption of a certain line of policy in regard to this very matter, while another dealt with the coinage of silver. I should like to know to what extent your ruling curtails my right to address the Committee on the subject which I wish to discuss? The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. I wish to assist honourable members, and have no desire to unnecessarily curtail debate; but, at the same time, it is necessary to keep it within reasonable limits. If we go into the whole scope of these financial proposals, we shall have practically a Budget debate, which would not be proper at this time. I believe that I am correct in saying that, properly speaking, no honourable member has a right to discuss now any subject other than the items immediately before the Committee; but it has been customary to allow some latitude while the first item of a Department is before the Chair. I ask honourable members not to construe that into a licence to discuss anything and everything under the,",40,Batchelor

South Wales has received very much more from Customs and Excise taxation since the inauguration of Federation than she was previously receiving.

Had the control of the Customs and Excise been left to the taxpayers of New South Wales, it would have been impossible for the Government of that State to raise this large amount.

One of the great troubles that has arisen in connection with the Braddon section, is that the States desire to shirk their own responsibility in the matter of raising direct taxation. They are endeavouring to convert the Commonwealth into a mere taxing machine for their purI do not know to what poses. It is with this object in view that they are advocating the extension of the Braddon section.. The principle now in operation is a vicious one. It imposes burdens upon the Commonwealth, which it should not be called upon to bear. The spending power should be required to appeal directly to the taxpayer to foot the B ill , but under the present system the States Governments spend the money, and leave the Commonwealth to bear all the odium attached to the levying of taxation. Whilst the States' Governments are advocating the extension of the Braddon section, they That repreare keenly watching the expenditure of the Commonwealth--so keenly, that apparently they have no time to look after their 1 own. They have no legitimate ground for complaint in respect to extravagance on the part of tbe Federal authorities, but the taxpayers of some of the States have every reason to feel aggrieved at the way in which the revenue raised by the Commonwealth has been expended by the States authorities. Under the Constitution, the Commonwealth is entitled to retain, one-fourth of the revenue derived from Customs and Excise, but since the inauguration of the Federal Tariff, we have returned to the States out of that one-fourth a total of £4,500,000. Of this amount, New South. Wales has received think it is desirable that £ 1 , 8 3 0 , 0 0 0, and Victoria£ 1 , 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 .

I am glad to know that the Treasurer is not disposed to view with favour the proposal to extend the Braddon clause for any considerable period beyond the time fixed in the Constitution. He proposes to return to the States a fixed sum annually, but I shall strongly resist any attempt to make the Commonwealth a mere taxing machine for the States. We should be left to exercise a free hand in the matter of taxation, on the understanding that any monev we might have to spare after meeting all our requirements should be handed to the States Governments. Of all forms people of raising revenue, I think a revenue Tariff is the most objectionable, because under the system, the burden of taxation is unequally distributed',, and falls most heavily upon those who are least able to bear it .

Sir Treasurer) I certainly cannot promise member desires without first looking into has arisen between the Government of New South Wales and the Commonwealth authorities in regard to the claims of several officers for retiring allowances. Two of these were referred to by the honourable member for South Sydney, and I understand that the case cited by the honourable member for Wentworth falls within the name category. It appears that under a provision of the Superannuation Act, which is not compulsory in any of the States, these officers were entitled to a month's pay for every year of their service. Mr G. tute law in New South Wales. Federation was consummated the regulations have been altered by the JOHN FORREST I settled those States to provide that these officers shall be entitled to only a fortnight's pay for every year of service. The claimants naturally expect to receive a month's pay. I have looked into the matter, and I W ill the right honourable have come to the conclusion that their claim is a just one. The Constitution provides that these officers shall be entitled to such pension as is "" permitted "" by the law of the State concerned. The Commonwealth authorities are therefore the judges of what the amount shall be, so long as it is "" permitted"" by the law of the State. That being so, I had no hesitation in deciding that the officers in question say in were entitled to one month's pay for every year of service. I am assured by the Secretary of the Treasury Department that the I think it is time case referred to by the honourable member for Wentworth is upon all fours with those that I have mentioned. Instead of endeavouring to prevent these men from getting their pensions, I have actually been fighting their battles. surer's statement is correct in every particular save one.

I think that £ 8 0 0 is by no means too much for this office. It is about time that honourable members ceased from reflecting on the high salaries paid to those who hold the responsible positions of heads of Departments. able member for Corangamite is hardly fair to the honourable member for Dalley, who did not mean by his amendment to reflect on the Secretary to the Treasury. ber hear the remarks made by the honourable member for Dalley prior to moving bis amendment ? of the Chamber during the early part of his speech; but I understand that the honourable member for Dalley has moved to reduce this salary solely to put himself in order in regard to the discussion of quite another matter. not Corangamite was quite fair to the honourable member for Dalley, who had no wish to reflect on the talent or ability of the Secretary to the Treasury, but desired to obtain an opportunity to address the Committee on a subject in regard to which the Chairman had ruled his previous remarks out of order. All the honourable member for Dalley desired to do was to complain that the Treasurer is not doing his duty in allowing himself to be dictated to in regard to a matter of policy. I say, myself, that the Treasurer should tell the Committee what the financial policy of the Government is. That is a matter which he alone can put before us. The TEMPORARYCHAIRMAN The hpnorable member is not now discussing the amendment before the Chair. should be called upon to place before us his policy with regard to the States debts, the sugar bounties, the transferred properties, and the extension of the Braddon section. We should rely upon him for information on these subjects, and no outside body, even though it be composed of members of this House, should intrude. the honourable member for Dalley was quite within his rights in demanding that the Treasurer should discharge to the fullest extent the responsibilities attaching to his position. He has done nothing more than his duty in calling attention to the neglect displayed in regard to the important financial questions which demand attention. These matters have been before the Commonwealth Parliament from its inception, and yet no attempt has been made by the Treasurer to afford us any guidance. The honourable member for ' Dalley does not in any way seek to attach any reproach to the Secretary of the Treasury, whose salary is not too large in view of the work which has to be performed.

I am aware that some bank managers receive salaries of £ 3 , 0 0 0 , and I am willing to admit that their duties may be no more important than those discharged by the Secretary of the Treasury. I am not cavilling at the salary provided for that think the honourable member for officer, but I am proposing the reduction of the item in order to emphasize my objection to the attitude assumed by the Treasurer in regard to important financial questions upon which the policy of the Government should be announced. It is the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury, amongst other things, to supply his Ministerial head with information with regard to the States debts, the financial relations of the Commonwealth with the States, and a number of other matters of importance. If he is capable of doing that, his position should be defended. If , on the other hand, he is not competent to do it, his services should be dispensed with. Apparently it is intended to interpose between the Secretary of the Treasury and the Treasurer a foreign body, in the form of a Committee, consisting of members of this House. I desire to ask whether the Treasurer now holds The Treasurer the same opinion that he expressed three or four weeks ago in regard to the proposal of the honourable member for Kooyong for the appointment of a Select Committee to inquire into the States debts question.

S. Brain foir services rendered in connection with printing for Parliament, the money goes not to that officer, but to the State of Victoria. I am not acquainted with the Victorian Government Printer, but I think he does his work well, and that if we vote this allowance he ought to receive it. I am informed that the allowances voted to other officers for services rendered to the Commonwealth were originally absorbed in this way, but that they are now being received by the officers themselves. That being so, there is no reason why an exception should be made in the case of trie Government Printer. If we had to appoint a Printer far the Commonwealth, we should have to pay him a salary of at least £800 or £900 per annum, and I trust that the Treasurer will make a special effort to see that Mr ment, more particularly if it be true, as Brain receives this allowance. prised to learn that, notwithstanding that this item appears on the Estimates as an allowance to Mir.

If the money is absorbed by the State Treasury, that fact should be shown in the Estimates. hoping to secure a change. the item is absolutely misleading.

If it be correct, as asserted by the honourable member for Dalley, that allowances passed by this Parliament for services rendered to the Commonwealth by States officers are paid in all other cases to the officers concerned, it is wrong that of Mr Brain. There is no doubt that £he Department is an elaborate one, and that it carries out a large quantity of work for the Commonwealth. The statement has been made by the Treasurer that we are under a compliment to the Government of Victoria for the use of their printing office. The situation does not present itself to me in that light. When business representing several thousand pounds per annum is given to a private establishment the conductors of it usually consider that they are the gainers by the transaction. It must be remembered that the printing staff employed on Commonwealth work is paid by the Commonwealth. gratuities are received by the men. which is done solely for the Commonwealth. I take it that in deciding the actual cost of the printing done for the Commonwealth, the State takes into account the item of rent. If that be so, I do not consider that the Commonwealth is under a compliment to the Government of Victoria for the work done in this Departstated by the honourable member for Coolgardie, that work of the same nature is done more cheaply by the Government Printing Office of New South Wales.

The honourable member for Coolgardie rose a few minutes ago, and in most solemn tones declared that the Opposition were responsible for the payment of overtime to officials in the Government Printing Office, and for the conduct of the business of the establishment under present conditions. Above all, he blamed the honourable member for North Sydney, because, forsooth, at some time or another, away back in the past, he objected to a motion which the honourable member for Coolgardie had on the business-paper for the appointment of a Select Committee. If the honourable member is so anxious for the appointment of .this Committee, all he has to do is to hold up his finger to the Government, and the thing will be done; or if he himself cannot get it appointed, the appointment will be made instanler at the word of his leader.

I can only say that I-have no objection to an inquiry into the working of the Government Printing Office. AllI did was to suggest that the Printing, Committee, whose duty it is, should undertake the investigation. I regarded the action of the honourable member, as practically passing censure 1 upon the Printing Committee. I think that the printing ararngements of the Commonwealth should be the subject of searching inquiry, and that the investigation should be systematically conducted by a Standing Committee, instead of in a spasmodic manner by a temporary body. The Printing. Committee is appointed for that purpose, and if they do not recognise the fact, they should be specially instructed upon the subject. If they then fail to do what is required of them, they should be removed. I might mention that no delay need have been involved if my suggestion had been adopted. have no wish to intervene in this matter between the honourable member for North Sydney and the honourable member for Coolgardie, but as I happened to be in temporary charge of the motion standing in the name of the latter honourable member, I may be permitted to say that I distinctly remember that the honourable member for North Sydney opposed the appointment of the proposed Committee: I am somewhat surprised at the honourable member's statement that he has no objection to an inquiry, because it was owing to his action that the Committee was not appointed. It is proposed by the honourable member for Coolgardie to hold an inquiry, which cannot be conducted by the Printing Committee, and it would have been futile to adopt the suggestion of the honourable member for North Sydney. I do not think that the remark that the proposal of the honourable member for Coolgardie amounts to a vote of want of confidence in the Printing Committee is worthy of serious notice. member say that the Printing Committee could not conduct the contemplated inquiry ? Committee'have no power to do so. they have not. The honourable member for Coolgardie was perfectly justified in his remarks regarding the action of the honourable member for North Sydney.
