As far as the suggestion that the vessels should go straight from Adelaide to New Zealand, I do not think there is anything in that at all. In the first place, we have a written pledge in a letter from the contractors to the effect that Melbourne and Sydney will be ports of call. Indeed, I expect the boats to call at both ports -and I hope Brisbane, too. .'Besides the written pledge to call at Melbourne and Sydney, there is a clause in our mail contract which has an important bearing on this business. It is clause iS, and the last portion is very pertinent to the new development"" ? 2. If that statement is correct, was the pledge a result differing from that which would be given voluntarily, or was it exacted, and was it given before or after the contract was entered into ? 3.

I think that a smaller number of electors would take part in the second ballot than would take part in the first ballot, so that the system of the second ballot, in addition to being more costly than the preferential balloting system, would give the result of a smaller number of votes.

That is always the cry of the Opposition when proposals for legislation are brought forward. ' I admit that the measure is being discussed very late in the session, and that if it is passed there will be hardly sufficient time to provide for its administration. We are told that the electors would not be able to geti a grip of the system if it were applied to the next election; but I think that they are intelligent enough to do so. last election, we adopted an entirely new system. Previously, the electors in nearly every State had been accustomed to strike out the names of the candidates for whom they did not desire to vote; but at the last election they were required to place a cross in the square opposite the name of the candidate whom they wished to elect. At the forthcoming election, the squares will be placed on the right hand instead of at the left hand of the candidates' names, and under the system provided for in the Bill electors would be asked to indicate the order of their preference by numbers placed in those squares, or if they preferred, by placing a cross opposite the name of the candidate for whom they voted. mit that it is inconsistent for 'Parliament, having made it compulsory that, in the Senate election, electors shall vote for three candidates, to make the preferential system optional. I opposed the provision which requires electors to vote for three candidates in the. Senate election, because I thought that they should be allowed to vote for only two candidates, or even for one, if they did not wish to vote for more. gained two senators by the system adopted. those who were responsible for the adoption of that system are sorry for it now. Like a number of other schemes for dishing the Labour Party, it did not work out as it was thought it would. dish the Labour Party? -opposite thought that it would have that effect they would support it. of quibbling, as the honourable member is, I should never do anything else. I believe that the electors will readily understand the preferential system of voting, and that fewer informal votes will be cast under it than under the old New South Wales system. In Victoria preferential voting has been tried, in connection with the selection of labour candidates for the House of Representatives and the Senate. I have here.a copy of the ballot paper used. Professor Nanson, in speaking of one of these ballots, stated that the preferential system had received a setback, because in March last it took more than a month to ascertain the result of the voting; but he claimed that he could have At the ascertained the result in four, hours. I was connected with the ballot in question, and was present during the greater part of the time that the count was going on. The actual count of ballot-papers did not take much more than a week. We had, however, to obtain returns from branches scattered all over Victoria. All the ballot papers issued, used and unused, had to be counted to. make sure that the balloting had been conducted in a straightforward manner. The Labour Party's system is different from that adopted by some of the other parties. Evidently machine politics is being introduced on the other side, at least so far as Victoria is concerned; but we find that a candidate who was alleged I adto have been endorsed by his party, a certain Mr Brown, is now ordered to stand down in the interests of someone else. The executive, which meets in Collins-street and pulls the strings, has no doubt decided that he is not good enough. Every candidate chosen by the Labour organizations, however, is permitted to go to the poll. No such candidate would be asked to stand down in the interests of someone else. Professor Nanson, in an article on the preferential ballot which appeared in the Age, gives as an illustration an election in which the result of the first count showed the strength of the free-traders to be 500, of the Labour Party 400, and of the protectionists 300, and says that as soon as these figures were announced the merest tyro could foresee the result of the election. He declares thatWhen the protectionist candidate at the foot of the poll is rejected, all the protectionist votes will go to the Labour candidate, who will thereby secure election.",14,Preferential Ballot Bill Second Reading

They will depend entirely upon the merits of their own platform. torney-General say at Warrnambool? to the report of the Attorney-General's speech, he appeared to be very rapidly coming round to our way of thinking. But his position in that respect is not peculiar, because many honourable members are every day becoming more liberal in their ideas. The honourable member for Dalley, when he was proposing his amendment, suggested that we should adopt a system of selfregistration, which he said would be cheaper and more effective than that now adopted, and would lead to the enrolment of a much larger number of electors. We have had a modification of that system in operation in Victoria for some time. In addition to-the ratepayers on the roll, any person who desires an elector's right may apply to the registrar and obtain one. At the first Federal election in my constituency the number of electors on the roll, prepared in the way I have described, was 13,000 adult males. When a little later on the police made a collection for the purpose of compiling a new roll, over 4,000 names were added, making a total of 17,000 electors. There had not been an increase of anything like 10 per cent, in the population in the meantime, and yet the number of electors on the roll was increased by 33 per cent. there in the percentage of votes recorded ? because the ratepayers' roll would include the names of many persons who would be entitled to vote elsewhere. Probably, with the increased number of electors on the roll, the percentage of votes recorded would be less than formerly. I think that we should extend to the people every opportunity of exercising the franchise in such a way as to insure that this House should accurately reflect their views. I do not know whether the measure now before us would promote that object, but I think that it should have a trial. I shall, therefore, support the second reading, of the Bill, and"" do my best to make it effective. I candidly confess that I liave a decided preference for the extension of the voting power of the electors as far as possible. But I cannot understand why an important measure such as that before us should have been introduced in the closing hours of this Parliament. at the eleventh hour. think that the more simple our system of voting is, the: better it will be for the electors and for this House. If a measure of this kind had been passed in the first session of. this Parliament, the electors would have had opportunities to familiarize themselves with the new system of voting. Buti f the Bill be passed at this stage much confusion is bound to arise. If an elector does not vote for three candidates for the Senate his ballot-paper will be informal. In the case of the election of members of the. House of Representatives, however, the electors will have the right to exercise a preference, but may refrain; from doing so if they choose. In all these matters we should be guided by past experience. It is admitted that the optional preferential vote in Queensland has been a failure. Personally, I think that the Labour Party have been quite right in advising their supporters not to exercise the preferential voting, power. If I had an opportunity of plumping for two out of three candidates, I should certainly not throw away 33 per cent, of my voting power by giving a secondary vote to another candidate and thus run the risk of bringing about the defeat of One of those in favour of whom I had cast my primary vote. in Queensland is perfectly sound and ra-",16,Preferential Ballot Bill Second Reading

47,Mr Mcwilliams,"Just so, but Itional, and doubtless if this Bil l became law the majority of voters of all parties would refrain from expressing their preference. We know that when the hordes of Russia were being defeated by the Swedes, Peter the Great said to His men, "" G o on fighting-ou r enemies are teaching In other words, the admirable discipline of the smaller body was impressing its lessons upon its opponents. I say that, in their system of organization, the Labour Party have set a splendid example to the rest of Australia, and it is a great compliment to their methods that those who differ from them in politics are now employing similar methods. I understand from the representatives of Queensland that, in that State, the system of allowing voters to express a preference for particular .candidates at the ballot-box has been discarded by both political parties. Neither of them use it. Consequently, we are being asked at the eleventh hour of the session, when time is the very essence of the contract, to pass a Bill embodying a system of preferential voting which has already been tested in one of the States of the Commonwealth, and which has absolutely failed. some work?

MrM c WILLIAMS State in Australia in which the system of preferential voting has been tried. system embodied in the Bill is the very antithesis of what is known as the Hare system of voting. The honourable member for Bass supported the measure because he is an advocate of the Hare system. But the method of voting provided in the B ill is exactly the opposite of that system. The Hare system aims at securing the representation of minorities. Under it, as soon as a candidate has obtained his quota, the surplus votes recorded in his favour are distributed amongst the other candidates. The experience of the working of that systemat two elections in Tasmania was such that, when an appeal was made to the country, scarcely a single candidate advocated its continuance. The ex-Attorney-General, Mr Clarke, who had written pamphlets in support of it , was obliged to give a public pledge that, if he were re-elected, he would not seek to re-introduce it . The aim of the optional system of preference which us how to defeat them."" is incorporated in this Bil l is to insure majority rule, and, if there be any virtue in it at all the exercise of the franchise ought to be made compulsory. duced ? MrM c WILLIAMS My opinion is that it was introduced with the idea of making the preferential system of voting compulsory, but, as the result of pressure which has been brought to bear upon the Government, an optional system has been substituted. SirJ OHN FORREST -Giv e us credit for honest motives. MrM c WILLIAMS I will. If the measure represents an honest attempt to secure majority rule, it should provide for a compulsory system of voting. So long as the preferential system is an optional one, so long we shall find that electors who vote upon party lines will not throw a.way a portion of their vote upon candidates other than the particular individual they desire to see returned. I was very much interested in the statement of the' honourable member for Yarra that the names of 4,000 electors had been added to the rolls in his electorate as the result of a house-to-house canvass by the police. In my opinion, the persons who In Queensland. do not take the trouble to secure enrolment are the individuals who do not take the trouble to vote. I find that in NewI t is the only South Wales, at the last general election for this House, only 48 per cent, of the elecThe tors enrolled, or less than one-half, exercised the franchise. In Victoria, only 53 per cent., or a little more than one-half of those enrolled voted. Of the electors of Queensland, who hold the place of honour in this connection, 57 per cent, voted, in South Australia 40 per. cent., in Western Australia 30 per cent., and in Tasmania 45 per cent. In Western Australia, not one elector out of three took^the trouble to exercise the franchise. .In my judgment, parliamentary representation has now become something more than a privilege.

MrM c WILLIAMS hear that, because I recognise that the present system of allowing vehicles to be utilized for that purpose is open to very serious objection. My idea is that we should remove every obstacle between the electors and the polling booth, and that we should then insist upon them exercising the franchise. I understand it has been arranged that the Bill shall be pressed forward until it reaches Committee, and that it will then be dropped, just as another measure was dropped last session. Should it reach Committee, I shall endeavour to introduce a provision which will render the exercise of the franchise compulsory. At the same time i cannot help expressing 4 the opinion that to bring forward the measure at this late hour of the session is distinctly farcical, and, if the Government seriously intend to proceed with it , the best thing that we can do is to defeat it upon the motion for its second reading. I regard this Bill as so much electioneering bluff, and I am glad to hear that it is not to be pressed very far this session. learned member has only heard that from members of his own party. the lobbies. it provides for an optional system of preferential voting shows how farcical the measure is. A representative of Queensland, for whom I entertain a very great respect, has informed me that the party In that case I with which he is identified does not avail itself of the optional system of prefePential voting in that State, and has stronglv advised me to see that it is discarded in my own electorate. To my mind, those candidates who' have an organized party behind them would act wisely if they ignored the system. It seems to me that the Bill is a mere make believe. If the honourable member When we read rhetorical outbursts such as those in which the Prime Minister indulged at 'Maryborough, where he practically declared that the Government were prepared to die at the stake in order to insure majority rule, and when they introduce a Bill which does not attempt to secure majority rule, we are justified in saying that the measure is a miserable piece of bluff, and that the honourable and learned gentleman's rhetorical outbursts are so much political fudge.

A Bill of this kind, which does not attempt to provide for the compulsory exercise of the contingent vote, but merely sets forth that the elector may, if he chooses, mark his preference on the ballot-paper, is so much fudge, and it is only a waste of time to seriously debate it. There is one part of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Dalley with which I agree. I allude to the reference in it to the fact that we are on the eve of a general election, and that it is absolutely impossible to coach the Electoral Department and the electors themselves in the newsystem before that election takes place. The Federal electoral system is vastly different from that to which the electors were previously accustomed. At the last general election is was responsible for many informalvotes, and for appeals to the High Court, which subjected two or three candidates to very serious expenditure. Just as the people are beginning to understand the working of that system, however, a proposal is brought forward that, so far as elections for the House of Representatives are concerned, it shall be discarded.

The evil which it is intended to cure is not very serious. If it could be cured we ought to cure it ; but I hold that this Bill does not really attempt to remedy it. The Ministry are practically prescribing a bread pill for what they say is a very serious disease, and I do not know that bread pills, whether administered by the Deakin Government or any other body of political physicians, are likely to prove beneficial. I do not hesitate to say that it is considered by the Government that the Bill will save the seats of certain honourable members who are to be opposed both by Opposition and Labour candidates. It is thought that the supporters of those candidates may record their second preference for the Government nominees, and thereby enable them to save their seats. Majority rule may be most speedily secured under an arrangement that only two candidates shall contest each electorate. Under such an arrangement we should have a straight out fight, and would have no difficulty, in determining which party had a majority of votes behind it. The Labour Party have gained their strength by means of well organized and closelv-knit forces, and those who do not believe in their programme should in that resnect follow their example.

Properly carried out, it is one of tlie best systems that could be adopted in connection with general elections for the CommonwealthParliament. Although the Hare-Clark system had been applied for some time previously to State elections in Hobart and Launceston, it was not until the holding of the first Federal election in Tasmania that it was extended to rural electorates. many of the more elderly people there, as elsewhere, have not been so well educated as are the younger members of the community, remarkably few mistakes were made. A system of that kinda system that I have always advocated-is a good one; but that proposed in this Bill is a hybrid. cise of the contingent vote should Le made compulsory. The fact that the Government propose that it should be optional is sufficient to satisfy any disinterthe Senate elections. The electors must ested party that the Bill has been introduced for one purpose, and for one purpose only. rule. lieve that it has been introduced to enable the Government to increase their strength at the next general elections. would not blame them for that. say that I should at any time blame a man for endeavouring to save his political skin, but when a Minister introduces a Bill of this kind, I think that he ought to tell us plainly that it is designed not for the good of the community as a whole, but to save the political skins of certain honourable members. Government, in proposing that the exercise of the contingent vote should be optional, have but one object in view. They know that in many cases their candidates will be opposed by representatives of the Opposition and of the' Labour Party, and that in nine cases out of ten_ the unionist, will not cast a contingent vote. They also know what are the tactics usually adopted by the Labour Party ^>when they discover at the last moment that their candidate is not likely to be successful. In such circumstances the Labour leaders would probably say, "" We cannot secure the return of our man for this electorate, and the Opposition are of no use for our purpose. We can, however, squeeze the Ministerial candidate, and perhaps we had better chuck him a vote. '""' That happened a few years ago in connection with the election for Denison. The Labour Party on that occasion preferred the present representative of Denison to myself, and a large number of them voted for him at the last moment. Whether this Bill be passed or But although, unfortunately, rejected it will always be open to the party to adopt such tactics; but I appeal to honourable members to say what useful purpose this Bill will serve unless the system which it embodies is made compulsory. I am not prepared to say that if it were made compulsory I should not, at all events, give it my serious consideration. If we provided I think that the exerthat every elector must vote for the full number of representatives for his electorate, the contingent vote would be compulsory. MT.

As none of the States except Tasmania has had practical experience of this system, it would probably be advisable to postpone its adoption until after the next election. If the Minister of Home Affairs will withdraw the Bill, and, next Parliament, introduce another making the preferential system compulsory, I shall, if I am here, support it, and I should give even stronger support to a measure embodying the HareClark system. My desire is that the majority of the electors in each division shall be represented in Parliament.

While, no doubt, we are all desirous of establishing majority rule, the effect of the Bill would not be to secure it. In my opinion, its tendency would be to give us minority rule in more instances than occur at present. Under the existing system, in divisions where party feeling runs high, the attempt is made to keep back unnecessary candidates. A weak party often refrains from putting a candidate into the field, knowing that it is unlikely that that candidate will be elected, and, fearing that, by splitting the voting, it may bring about the election of a candidate to which it is absolutely opposed. however, every party would be likely to put forward a candidate, because the chances of weak parties would be increased. An objection which has been urged against the Bill is that it makes the adoption of preferential voting optional, and not compulsory. Government desire majority rule, though, of course, I have my private opinion on the subject. To my mind, we get majorityrule practically only when the majority holds definite opinions on certain questions. members object to the Bill because it makes preferential voting optional', and say that they would support the measure if the system were compulsory, I should then resist it even more strenuously, if possible, than I shall under present circumstances. I am not opposed to compelling electors to go to the poll, and I think that if we Had compulsory voting, penalizing electors who did not go to the poll, it would play into the hands of the Labour Party. A large number of those who at present take no interest in politics, sympathize with, the pulsory preferential system for the reasons Labour Party, and would, if they voted, vote for Labour candidates, while there are others who would certainly do so, but are prevented by their employers from going to the poll. about the recording of the votes of all such persons. the electors being compelled to vote for any one or any number of the candidates, because some electors might be opposed to every candidate nominated. Under the present system an elector is not compelled, even if he goes to the poll, to vote for any candidate, because he can make his ballot paper informal. At the first Federal election, there were three candidates for Parkes. One of them was the present representative of that division. orable member had little hesitation about voting for him. him, because, while I agree with him on some points, there are many points upon which I differ from him. The second candidate was a protectionist, who may have been in favour of protection and freedom of contract, as Mr Charles Atkins announces himself to be; but, at any rate, I did not feel inclined to vote for him. The third candidate was announced as a Labour man; but he had not been endorsed by the executive, and I knew nothing of Under the preferential system, him. I went to the poll, however, because there were two Labour candidates for the Senate, and, while handing in a formal ballot-paper for the Senate election, I made my other ballot-paper informal by scratching out every name on it. I take it for granted that the tor scratching out the names of all the candidates on the ballot-paper and writing in his own. ing, the elector should be able to deal as he But, although some honourable likes with his ballot-paper; but if , on the occasion to which I refer, the compulsory preferential system had been in force, and there had been a Labour candidate for the electorate of Parkes, I should have been compelled to vote for that candidate, and, to make my vote formal, to show a preference for the remaining candidates, none of whom I wished to vote for. would bring the horse to the water, but would not make it drink. which I have given.

There is a strong probability that each of the three big parties will, in Victoria at any rate, run three candidates for the Senate. Both the Labour Party and the Protectionist Party will run three candidates each. I believe that the Free trade Party has been joined by the honourable member for Echuca, and that he and the honourable member for Grampians, and a third candidate, will stand in the interests of that party, or, if honourable members like to term it so, the anti-Socialist party. It is generally believed, too, that no one of the three tickets will have a great advantage, in the matter of votes polled, over either of the other two. That being so, the Ministry should surely take advantage of tbeir preferential system-and they are prepared to die to secure majority ruleto apply it to the Senate. Why not at least experiment with the Senate? seen to work well in Senate elections, we could subsequently adopt it for elections for the House of Representatives. Surely the Minister will give us a better reason than that already furnished for not applying the principle to Senate elections. too short in which to do so. is not time to apply the principle to Senate elections if there is time to apply it to the House of Representatives elections. It would be just as easy for electors to indicate their preference for Senate candidates as to do so for candidates for the House of Representatives, although in one case there would be three candidates to choose, and in the other only one.

The votes polled for him at the last election numbered, according to the Age, 4,600, while 4,036 votes were cast for a candidate named Dunne, 1,484 for a candidate named Woods, and 2,968 for a candidate named Wynne. The writer of the article contends that if the preferential ballot had been in operation, the Labour candidate, Dunne, would have been declared elected, because the 1,484 votes polled for Woods, the candidate lowest on the poll, would have been added to Dunne's 4,036 votes. man. statements of the Age. It is very kind and considerate of the Age to endeavour to secure the return of a Labour main, especially in view of the leading article which they published some short time ago in condemnation of the Labour Party and all its works. They forgot to say any/thing whatever about the 2,968 votes cast for Mr Wynne. As Mr Wynne is a Conservative, we have every right to suppose that any secondary votes recorded by those who supported him would go to Mr Wilson. Thus we may assume that, even if preferential voting had been in vogue at the last election, the honourable member for Corangamite would still have been returned. The Age would no doubt have been very sorry to see a Labour man defeated, but that could not be helped under the circumstances. I am not very strongly in favour of the amendment of the honourable member for Dalley. He states that a, general election is imminent, and that consequently there is not sufficient time for the proper consideration of the measure. I do not know that that is a very strong reason, because most of us have made up our minds, and do not require to spend very much time in discussion. We need not concern ourselves as to the electoral arrangements, because that matter can very well be left to the Department. I am opposed to the Bill, not because of the tiddlywinking objections raised by the honourable member for Dalley, but because I object to the principle underlying it.

It has been claimed that an » attempt is being made to bring about majoritv representation, but the Bill would utt e r l y f a i l to accomplish that object. The Age states that the preferential voting system has been successfully applied to the selection of Labour candidates. no doubt correct, because the system is applicable to cases in which all the voters believe in the same principle. should not introduce any system that would require Socalists to vote for anti-Socialists, or free-traders to vote for protectionists. I would advise the Minister to withdraw the Bill and proceed with some useful measure. -No wild enthusiasm is being displayed by the supporters of the Bill, and I am afraid that I cannot say very much in its favour. Ever since I took part in politics, I have been an advocate for a system of voting which would secure-a just representation of the people. it is worthwhile to lake much trouble to bring about majoritv rule, because the loss of a seat by the splitting of votes of one party in a certain electorate is more often than otherwise counterbalanced by a gain in another seat through the splitting of votes on the opposite side. On the whole, therefore, we arrive at majoritv representation. We ought to aim at the accurate represen I adtation of the feeling of the electors. At the last elections for the House of Commons, a very small surplus of Liberal votes proved sufficient to enable that party to alEvery most annihilate the Conservatives, and the House of Commons does not at present afford anvthing like a fair representation of the opinion of the electors. servatives there, even now. many of the ""other fellows."" must try by propaganda work and other means to reduce the numerical strength of No ; I do not approve of prethe "" other fellows "" as much as we can. If the principle of majority rule were applied, it is quite conceivable that the Senate might be composed entirely of representatives of one party in politics. In fact, that result may be brought about at the next elections. I am inclined to think that next session the Senate will be composed almost entirely of Labour members. Whilst such a result might be very gratifying to the members of the Labour Party, I am not so biased as to think that it would constitute a fair representation of the views of the people. If the.

Under the Government proposal, the number of informal votes would probably be largely increased, because two systems of voting would be in operation at the one election.

How a Government which professes to be fighting, strenuously for majority rule can take up such an attitude is to me incomprehensible. If they wish to insure majority rule, they must insist upon all voters going to the poll, and voting in accordance with the system which is necessary to secure majority rule. by looking at each elector's ballot-paper. deavouring to compromise between what is called principle and what is undoubtedly convenience.

Anything short of that is little better than a farce, and it is little more than a pretence to urge that it can insure majority rule. If there are 25,000 electors in a constituency, and only 15,000 vote, and if one candidate secures 10,000 votes out of the 15,000 votes polled, he will not represent a majority of the electors, but merely a majority of those who exercised the franchise, assuming that a proper system of counting the votes is observed. If the Government are in earnest in their desire to ascertain who is the real choice of a majority of the electors, they [31 AUGUST, 1906.] Ballot Bill. 3783 must abandon this lottery, under which a obtained the smallest number of first preferences. If , in the illustration given by the Government, Robinson were the second preference of the supporters of Smith, Brown, and Jones, Robinson-wh o would be defeated because he happened to secure the smallest number of first votes-woul d really be the candidate who ought to have been elected. I object to the Bill on purely arithmetical grounds. It breaks the very rule which it professes to lay down. In fact, as I have already said-and this remark summarizes my position upon tlie question-if it ibe wrong to elect a candidate because he has obtained the largest number of first preferences, it is equally wrong to reject him because he has obtained the smallest number of first votes. One system is just as bad as the other arithmetically and mathematically, and if the Government .really wish to insure majority representation-quit e apart from all questions of compulsion or of insisting that those who go to the poll ferences-the y must adopt not this .system', which would result in the defeat of a candidate because he chanced to obtain the smallest number of first votes, but the system of adding up the preferences recorded and of averaging them.

In this connection, it is interesting to note the attitude which is assumed by newspapers like the Age, which at one time enthusiastically opposes all systems of. preferential voting, and at another supports the principle. I suppose that it gets more light every day, although I should not be surprised if in two or three To insure majority years it was again found reconsidering its position. The Government have brought forward this Bill at the end of a Parliament when honourable members have neither the time nor the opportunity to carefully consider the actual mathematical merits and demerits of the various systems of preferential voting.

The matter has only to be stated to show that in the Bill exactly the same principle is being followed as is being followed at the present time. The only difference is that the Government start at the bottom instead of the top. But it is the same system exactly, and it is therefore liable to the same mischances. that if the scheme proposed by the Government be adopted at the forthcoming election, it will result in the return of more system embodied in this Bill?"" If they representatives of minorities than does the present system. lieving as I do in majority rule. I intend to vote for the second reading of this Bill. The complications that have arisen in connection with the application of the contingent voting system to two-member constituencies in Queensland show that it would be unwise, if not practicallv impossible, lo apply it to elections for the Senate. The honourable member for Franklin has given notice of his intention to move an amendment that voting shall be compulsory, and I should certainly be glad to give my support to any sound scheme that would resuit in majority rule. The Government have some justification for bringing forward this scheme, which, theoretically, is a perfect one, although practically it is not. Anyone who is in favour of the second ballot system would be equally favorable to that provided in this Bill since, if the people would fully avail themselves of it, we should secure under it all the advantages to be derived from the second ballot. Unfortunately, however, where the contingent vote is optional, the people often fail to exercise it. The Minister of Home Affairs would have done well if , instead of using purely imaginary figures in the illustration of the working of the system which he gives in his memorandum, he had used the actual figures relating to an election in Queensland. The honourable member for Wilmot asserted that the preferential voting system had proved satisfactory in connection with the Tasmanian elections for the House of Representatives. I would point out, however, that it resulted in the casting of a large number of informal votes-a n evil which we should all wish to avoid. At the first Federal election in Tasmania, 16,575 votes were polled, and, as the result of complications due to the preferential system of voting, 533 informal votes were cast. In South Australia, where the primary voting system obtained, 62,892 electors-o r almost four times the number who recorded their votes in Tasmania-wen t to the poll, and yet the number of informal votes cast.there was only 985. The experience of Tasmania clearly indicates lhat the preferential system leads to a larger proportion of informal votes than is posI venture to say sible under the ordinary system of primary voting. The question naturally arises, "" Will the electors avail themselves of the would, I should be still more inclined to support it, but our experience in Queensland shows that where the contingent vote is purely optional, the electors, as a rule, do not trouble to exercise it. What we need to do is to make our electoral system as simple as possible, and, in the circumstances, it seems to me that we shall have to content ourselves with the system of primary voting. That for which the Bill provides would encourage a superfluity of candidates to come forward. One of the strongest arguments that could be used against the Bill is supplied by thefiguresemployed in the illustration furnished by the Minister as to the probable working of the system. In his memorandum he takes, as an illustration, an election at which there are four candidates--Smith, Brown, Jones, and Robinson-and at which, on the count of the first preferences, the result is as follows-Smith 5,000, Brown 3,500, Jones 3,400, Robinson 2,100; total, 14,000. He then proceeds to theorize on the assumption that all the voting papers showed that the preferential, or contingent voting system, had been availed of. As a matter of fact, it is unfair to assume anything of the kind. I propose to put before the House some figures relating to a Queensland election in which I was interested. Speaking! from memory, one candidate received 409 primary votes, another 439, and still another 458. As no candidate obtained an absolute majority, the man lowest on the list dropped out, and cognisance was taken of the second pre-",26,Argus
106,Mr Culpin (Brisbane) [12.15],"Beferences. credited to the candidate who had polled 439 votes, and 31 to the candidate who had polled 458, so that the voting was 480 and 489 respectively. The contingent votes in that case, therefore, did not alter the result obtained on the count of primary votes. A review of the returns in respect-of the first Federal elecspect, our position is very much like that tions held in Queensland emphasizes another difficulty; it shows that the number of informal votes cast in electorates where the opportunity to apply the contingent voting system offered was far greater than in those electorates where only primary votes were 1 cast. For instance, only forty-five informal votes were cast in connection with the election for Oxley, where the contingent vote was not exercised, but no less than 388 informal votes were cast at the election for Moreton, where advantage was taken of that . system. I do not think that a stronger argument could be urged against the B ill . In the election for Brisbane, where the contingent voting system was also used, 234 informal votes were recorded. These figures ' show that the risk of informal votes is much greater under the contingent vote than it is under the primary vote system. Before resuming my seat, I should like to refer briefly to the statement which has been made that I was returned on a minority vote. In response to that assertion, I invite the attention of honourable members to the statement made at the declaration of the poll by one of my opponentsthe late Honourable Macdonald Patterson, a man who was well respected, and whose death was regretted byall -that had he not stood, 1,500 out of the 1,799 votes which he received would have been recorded in my favour. That statement was reported in the Brisbane daily newspapers, and it shows that it is unfair to suggest that I really represent a minority vote. I shall vote for the second reading of the B ill , reserving to mynella? self the right to support any amendment that I consider will be likely to improve it.

In this reof the surgeon who, even at the eleventh hour, is prepared to perform an operation if he thinks that by doing so there is a possibility of saving life. It should be our desire even at the eleventh hour in the life of this Parliament, to secure majority representation for Australia. We have three parties almost evenly balanced, and under the existing system, when a candidate is opposed by representatives of the two other parties, he has a chance of being returned on a minority vote. IfI were opposed by another Labour man as well as by a Conservative candidate, I should have no chance of being returned to represent Melbourne, and in the same way the Conservatives would have no hope of winning the seat if they ran two candidates in opposition to myself. I trust that those who believe in majority rule will not take up the attitude that we have nof time to deal with the Bill during he present session, and that it should be held over for the consideration of the next Parliament. Surely something more than party considerations should influence us. We should be influenced by something more than the mere question of which party is to occupythe Treasury benches, or which party is to sit in Opposition. Australia cries for sound legislation, and if we adopt 'an effective voting system we may speedily secure majority representation and afterwards good legislation. member hear the argument advanced by the honourable and learned member for Coriwhen he oasts off rough shavings, but I think that a man of his 'great abilities could have done more for the country than he has.

Out of the love which I bear to Australia, which is greater than that which I have for any other country, I express the hope that, even at the eleventh hour, that system will be adopted which will be most beneficial in its results, and that the absurd existing system will be discarded. that honourable members will not raise small points to hinder this from happening, because the time is not opportune for doing so. the preferential system has been tried in Victoria by the Labour Party in connection with the selection of three candidates to carry the flag of labour at the Senate elections. mitted, and the papers were rendered informal if only one mistake was made in the allotting of preferences, while the perplexities of the voters were increased by the fact that they had to vote for three candidates, whereas under the B ill only one candidate will have to be voted for. Nevertheless, only 5 per cent, of the votes cast were informal, and I doubt if one per cent, would have been informal if the electors had had the option of voting straight out, or expressing a preference. I hold that in all cases the majority should rule. regrettable that those who oppose the measure must expose themselves to the insinuation that they are doing so for personal ends: but that personal gain is not the reason for my opposition is clearly shown by the record of the voting at the last election. If there is one division, which, for many years to come can be expected"" to cast an outright majority for the jparty to which I belong, it is that which I have the honour to represent. that the Bill has been introduced on the eve of a general election. peating itself. last election, the Government of the day refused to accept the recommendation of the Commissioner appointed to distribute the State of New South Wales into new electoral divisions, and thereby obtained in that State the name of "" the gerrymandering Government."" Now, a Government under the same leader, and supported by the same partu. is bringing forward ill-considered members will recall the and crude proposals which it is hoped will achieve a result similar to that gained by If we have triangular conthe gerrymandering tactics to which I have referred. There appears to be something in the political conscience of the Cabinet in which the Minister of Trade and Customs is so dominating a personality 'which makes it easy for them to treat sacred things like the franchise as matters to be dealt with for their political advantage. If the B ill has been introduced to secure majority rule, I hope which is the claim of the Minister, I ask him. why he has not made it apply to Senate elections. Is it less important that majorities should be represented in the In conclusion, I would point out that Senate than it is that they should be represented here, where a party of eighteen governs in a house of seventy-five by means of the support of another party of twenty-five? The Minister has informed us that Twentv-three names were subthe representation of nine Victorian divisions would be different had the preferential ballot been adopted at the last election. It may be news to him that one only of the four candidates run for the Senate by the Age newspaper would have been returned under that system. Is that why the Government have not applied the provisions of the Bill to Senate elections ? They must give far more cogent reasons for the distinction which they have drawn, if they wish the people to believe that their object is other than it appears to be. I have always endeavoured to consider questions of this character uninfluenced by party considerations. honourable member's preceding remarks. my indignation at the attitude of the Government towards a non-party question.

111,Mr Groom,That is indicated by the,29,Argus
112,Mr Kelly,"Those remarks expressverse of representative of the popular feeling. Preferential voting is not made compulsory by the measure; but even a compulsory preferential ballot would not give a true indication of the views of the electors. Let us see what would happen if that, system of voting were adopted. Supposing that there were four candidates for a division, whom we will call Smith, Brown, Jones, and Robinson, and that one of them was very much stronger than any of the other three: would not the efforts of the three weak candidates and their supporters be directed chiefly, not against each other, but against the strong candidate who was their common danger; and would nof the strong man be compelled, in an effort to gain an outright majority, to direct his efforts against the other three candidates without discrimination ? In such a case how would the ballot-papers be marked? Obviously, the supporters of each candidate would give their first vote for the man whom they desired to elect, and their preferences for the remaining three in the order of their supposed weakness, casting their second choice for the candidate whom they thought would have the least chance. Suppose that the number of votes polled was 10,000, of which 4,999 were cast for Smith, 1,800 for Jones, 1,701 for Robinson, and the remaining 1,500 for Brown. Brown's name, after the first count, would be struck off the list, and his preferences would be awarded to Robinson, who would thus Have 1,701 first votes and 1,500 second votes. It is assumed that the second vote expresses the preference of the elector in regard to the remaining candidates; but, in casting it, he, in reality, makes his choice of the least evil. trusted all fhe candidates in the .field, there would not be the bitter fights which now take place. fact, they trust only their own candidates, and dislike all the others, some more than the rest. Consequently, in awarding their preferential votes, they would give their second preference, not to the candidates whom they liked most, but to the candidates whom they disliked In the case I have put by way of illustration, Robinson would have 1,701 primary votes, and fhe modified dislike of 1,500 electors. Thus he would have more votes than Tones, the second man on the list, who would be knocked out. Jones' supporters would naturally give their second preferences to the man they conceived to be their least dangerous opponent, and Robinson would be elected instead of the man who received more than three times as many of the first preferences of the electors. Surely when possibilities of this kind are presented, honourable members should pause before they agree to the principle of the Bill. Robinson received the secondary votes of a large number of electors, not because they trusted him, but because they did not want Smith to be elected. It should be our aim to secure the return of the man who is most trusted in the constituency. No one could say that, in the instance I have just quoted, the man who received only 1,701 primary votes out of 10,000 would be the most trusted. The Government proposal is obviously not designed in the interests of majority rule, or the true representation of the wishes of the people in Parliament. Under these circumstances, it is natural for us to ask in whose interests the Bill'is designed? I think that the object of the Bill must be clear to all honourable members who have listened to the figures quoted by the Minister. We have been told that the measure would have affected only two seats in'Tasmania, and two in Queensland, as against nine in the State of Victoria. have affected those seats, but it might have done so. except Victoria, the great issue which is dividing the electors into two camps is that of Socialism. In Victoria, however, that issue is clouded by the further question submitted by the Government, namely, whether we shall adopt the principle of If the electors prohibition or inordinately high protection. Therefore, in most of the States we shall have the electors divided into two camps As a matter of and two only, whereas in Victoria there will be three parties represented. It is apparently hoped by the Government that in Victoria those who cast their primary votes either in favour of the socialistic or of our democratic party will give their preferences to those whom they fear least. least, namely, the candidate who is the rail sitter. We are told by the Age that at the last election in Victoria a number of seats were won by candidates who did not secure a full majority of the votes. Four of these seats were won by Deakinites, four by supporters! of the Opposition, and one by a Labour candidate. The Government hope that if the measure is passed, the sup-, porters of Labour candidates in Victoria will",29,Argus

In every Statecast their second preference votes in favour of Government supporters, and that the voters who favour supporters of the ReidMcLean faction will also follow the same course, because they will have less fear of the Deakinite than of the Labour man. In this way, they expect that the candidate who is sitting on the rail, upon the socialistic question, will be able to ride into Parimminent ? liament. When we are dealing with matters relating to the suffrages of the people we should be entirely free from considerations such as those I have mentioned. enable the constituencies to record their verdict upon current political questions in a thoroughly straightforward and honest way. It would be childish to suggest that because a Labour man gave his preference vote to a Deakinite, rather than to a Reid-McLean candidate, he would therefore be in favour of the former. We know what the Labour Party think of the Deakin Government. They have made it plain that they do not trust the Prime Minister, and yet it is now proposed to induce them to vote foT his supporters-for men in whom they do not believe. Therefore, I contend that we should not give the slightest quarter to the Government proposal. We know that it is not intended that the measure shall be carried beyond the Committee stage. An arrangement has been made in order to enable the Government to save their face. The Bill is to be read a second time, and subsequently dropped. The Government naturally do not want to have their plans exposed. Therefore, some honourable members, although they abhor the principles of the Bill, are prepared to assist them over the second reading to extricate themselves from a dilemma. tain amount of sympathy with Ministers under the circumstances, because they have not been treated by the Labour Party so well as they expected, although quite as well as they deserve.

Mr Kelly. tirely, agree with the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Dalley. In my opinion, it is not expedient to proceed further with the Bill during the present session, for the reason that a general election is imminent. orable member know a general election is ber's white face. There is consequently not sufficient' time for the proper consideration of the measure, or for making Our anxiety should be to the necessary electoral arrangements. I thoroughly agree with the honourable member that the proposals contained in the Bill are crude and incomplete, and that no provision is made for increasing the total number of votes polled, or for effective voting. Moreover, the question of introducing a new system of voting has not been considered by the constituencies. Upon the last occasion that this proposal was made, it was condemned in the most unqualified terms by the honourable member for Bland, who thought that it would tend to confuse the electors. If that objection held good then, it would have still greater force at the present time, when we are upon the eve of an election. The Bill appears to me to be an opportunist device to shelter the Government from the consequences of the indignation of the electors. We now have a Government, representing a .party of eighteen all told, controlling a House in which it is necessary to have twenty-five members to form a quorum. I believe that when the elections are over, there will not be a sufficient number of Deakinites to constitute a Ministry. The Age, in a. singularly able article, recently expressed the opinion that the introduction I have a cerof the preferential voting system, would foster party feeling, which was "" the salt of elections."" Only quite recently the same newspaper was crying out loudly for the abolition of party government and party feeling in politics. Why this, somersault?

The Bill merely embodies proposals for gathering up the vote which is now cast, and for a fresh manipulation of it. There is no guarantee that under that fresh manipulation we shall approach any nearer to the ascertainment of the will of the majority of the electors than we do under the existing system. The Bill will not insure the ascertainment of the desires of the great majoritv of electors. When the Prime Minister made his adverse criticisms of the attitude which, is taken ^ up by the leader of the Opposition, he did not touch that question at all. The Bill itself is not intended to touch it. It is merely designed to deal with the votes which are now voluntarily cast by the constituencies. that this scheme has already been discussed in this Parliament, and has been repudiated by the Government. As a matter of fact, it was opposed by them, because they recognised that it would be an imperfect instrument with which to achieve the results at whicfi they now aim.

178,Mr Joseph Cook,"I s it easier f orThe Prime Minister himself has furnished the best of. reasons why the Bill should not be rushed through in the closing hours of the session. He admits that it takes time to instruct the people how they shall vote, and I presume that the poll clerks and returning officers must have any change of system explained to them rather elaborately. Therefore, the Bil l should be put on one side until there is an opportunity for framing a complete system, and giving time to the people to become acquainted with it before being called upon to use it . The Prime Minister says that the complaint of the Opposition is in regard to the manner in which votes are now manipulated, but our complaint is, and it is being voiced every day by our leader, that of those entitled to vote less than 50 per cent, do so. the electors would be very simple. orable and learned gentleman was speaking idly when he saidRecognising the period of the session which -we have reached, we brought it forward in a milder form, as the electors perhaps could not have sufficient notice to enable the whole of them to be instructed in the system without the possibility of mistake. system which we regard as ideally desirable. difference be made between the House of Representatives and Senate elections ?

It is not proposed that it shall be compulsory. if we had time and means to apply it to both Senate and House of Representatives elections. now not in compelling electors to express a preference, but in getting them to vote. Why not wait until next Parliament, when a definite and concrete proposal can be put forward for providing for the expression of the opinion of the electorates ? The Prime Minister admits that this is only a tentative proposal, and that it is in every way imperfect. There is no violent hurry for a change of the kind proposed, and it has not [i33] p been asked for, except by the Age newspaper and Professor Nanson. fessor Nanson about three years ago. preferential voting ? selves have spoken against this system.. The Minister of Trade and Customs has de clared it to be clumsy and unworkable, but, on the eve of a general election it is discovered to possess all the virtues.

While we have conflicting party interests and elements, we shall seek in vain for an ideal system of representation. If we could apply-some principle of proportion to the gathering in of the votes which are cast, that would be an ideal system; but I see no possibility of doing so.

If the position is anything like as bad as has been depicted by the honourable member for Parramatta, it is his duty to try to improve it. member think that the passing of this Bill on the eve of a general election would be rather confusing to the electors? electors are so unintelligent as the hofnorable member seems to believe they are. the last general election in connection with the new requirement that the elector should put a cross in the square opposite the name of the candidate for whom he desired to vote. WhilstI should like to see the edntingentvoting system made compulsory, I am prepared to accept the Government proposal as a moiety of a reform the need for which will become more and more apparent as present conditions develop. yield to no man in my desire that we should secure what is known as majority representation in the counsels of the nation. Every effort should be made to insure that Parliament shall reflect the will of the majority of the people; but, after carefully examining this Bill, I have arrived at the conclusion that it would not enable us to achieve that result. I am not convinced that it would carry us even a reasonable distance in that direction; it seems to me that it would make cdnfusion. worse confounded. It would be impossible for the electors, before the next general election, to master the details of the system which it embodies. But there are still stronger objections. When the first Parliament of the Commonwealth was dealing with the Electoral Bill, several new voting schemes were submitted, together with explanations, by the Chief Electoral Officer; but, in the end, the Department itself was so befogged that the responsible Minister was very glad to drop the proposed innovations. If the Government carry the Bills that have been foreWhen will shadowed we shall have several referenda with regard to contemplated amendments of the Constitution. half a day to record his votes. vernment propose at the /next general election to take a referendum on the proposition that the Constitution shall be so amended as to enable the general elections to take place early instead of late in the year. They propose also to take a referendum on a suggested alteration of the Constitution in reference to the transfer of the States debts, and to take another in relation to what is described as "" special duties ""-whic h I understand covers a proposal to ear-mark certain revenue for specific purposes. Then, again, several important amendments of the Constitution, are proposed by private members. In one case, it is proposed that a referendum shall be taken on the question of whether the Constitution' should be so amended as to empower the Commonwealth to take certain action with regard to monopolies, and also to extend its powers to legislate in connection with labour and industry. At the last general election, the Government of New South Wales took a referendum on the question of whether or not the Constitution of that State should be amended to provide for a reduction of the number of members of the State Parliament, and it has been suggested in many quarters that the first election of shire councillors under the new Local Government T Act of New South Wales should take place simultaneously with those for the Federal Parliament. Having regard to these various referenda as well as to the fact that the electors will have to vote for candidates for both Houses, it seems to me that the position will be somewhat confusing, and that if, at this stage, we further complicated the present electoral system, defective as it may be, the result would be most unsatisfactory. We should probably have a repetition of our experience in connection with the first general election in New South Wales, when, owing to the fact that there were something like fifty candidates for the Senate, many informal votes were cast, whilst some electors refused to go to the poll. I repeat that this Bill will not secure majority representation. The primary voting system enables us to ascertain directly the opinions of the electors with respect to a candidate,",40,Argus

265,Mr Brown,"That is so. The Goand, indirectly, their view of the policy, which, for the time being, he espouses. When a vote.is so split up that the successful candidate does not represent a majority of the electors, the inference is that the electors themselves are so divided in their opinions that it is impossible for a candidate to secure an absolute majority vote in that division. An attempt to secure a complete expression of the will of the people by means of preferential voting has been made in Queensland, and also in Tasmania, but from what we can learn from authoritative sources, it has not been wholly satisfactory. Queensland is practically a dead letter. Candidates representing all shades of political thought unite in recommending the electors not to avail themselves of the preferential voting provisions of the Act. The result is that those provisions are not availed of to any material extent, and do not appreciably influence the elections. Doubtless the same position would arise under this Bill. Is it worthwhile further encumbering our electoral machinery with the complicated provisions set forth in this measure? The only way to secure by a direct vote a true expression of the opinion of the majority of the electors is to have a second ballot, but the carrying out of that system is surrounded with difficulties. The extent of the Federal electorates and the expense which would be incurred in holding a second election, practically places such a proposal outside the arena of practical politics. This method of preferential voting practically means voting in the dark. When the Seat of Government Bill was under consideration, and honourable members had to select one of the nine or ten sites proposed, it was suggested that we should take a preferential vote; but when honourable members saw what that proposal would really mean, they promptly rejected it. They recognised that the knowledge they possessed of the way in which the primarv votes would be cast would materially influence them in recording their contingent votes, and the result was that we had a straight-out ballot. The same difficulty would apply to an election under this system. If three or four candidates, were nominated for one electorate, electors would record their primary votes, and their second preference would depend largely on the position of their candidate and of the other two or more candidates. While I am desirous that that system shall be adopted which will enable the wishes of the majority of the electors to find a clear and definite expression, I am not convinced that the measure provides it. In my opinion, the provisions of the Bill, if passed into law, would materially complicate the holding of elections, and would interfere in cases where no alteration is desirable. That being so, I cannot support the Bill, and shall vote against it, though if it gets into Committee I shall not offer it factious opposition, but shall do all I can to make it as perfect as possible. periment proposed by the Government is, The contingent voting law in under all the circumstances, worth making. Some four years ago, when a similar proposal was before the House, I opposed it, and the right honourable member for East Sydney has been good enough to refer recently to my attitude on that occasion. He ignores the fact that since then we have had a general election, which returned a large number of minority representatives. No fewer than thirteen of the members of the' House were returned by minoritieSj and, though I do not contend that most of them would not have been elected under a system of exhaustive ballotting, it is possible that they do not represent the views of the majority in their electorates. That in itself is a reason for reconsidering the position. Furthermore, I have of late had the opportunity to listen to the persuasive eloquence of the right honourable member, not in advocacy of the method of Voting here proposed, but suggesting the desirability of some system which will remove the present anomalous position of affairs in this Parliament, and provide for majority rule. These considerations have weighed with me in coming to the decision that it is worthwhile to make an experiment to ascertain how far the' optional system of contingent voting will be taken advantage of by the electors when there are more than two candidates. I am not prepared to go to the length of compelling electors to indicate their preference on the ballot-papers, because I fear that that would lead to the casting of a large number of informal votes. It is desirable that any new system adopted shall be made optional, so that electors who prefer to keep clear of possible entanglements may have their primarv vote recorded. I am not prepared to do more than try the experiment of allowing an optional preference. It seems to me desirable, especially when three parties are contending for the suffrages of the",41,Argus

Whether the proposed system will benefit the Labour Party or one of the other parties, is problematical. No one can say how far it will assist any party if adopted at the forthcoming election. But the leader of the Opposition has emphasized so greatly the desirability of having returned a party with a strong working majoritv, that I think it worthwhile to make' an effort to discover a system which will accomplish that. I am not wedded to the proposals in the Bill, and shall be prepared in Committee to vote for any other method which appears more likely to secure majority rule.

So much has been said against the preferential system, that there is little or nothing for me to add. The system is in force in Queensland, but it is very little used, because candidates nearly always ask their supporters to vote directly for them, without indicating their preference for others. As the system has not been found of much advantage in the Queensland State elections, I do not think it wise to adopt it for Commonwealth elections. A great deal has been said about majority rule, but I am not convinced, that it is absolutely necessary, if two parties can agree to carry on the business of the country, that one of them shall have a majority in the House. Indeed, it is not always a good thing to have too strong a majority. The Opposition, perhaps, has found that out. I regard the preferential system as a useless one, and nothing is tb be gained by placing on the statute-book a measure which will Bill is to be abandoned. compulsory, fining those who do not go to for voting against the second reading, because I am determined that mo opportunity in many cases, find it impossible to vote,",42,Argus

278,Mr Groom (Darling Downs,"Ministe rof representation has been mentioned, but it has been forgotten that that system is inapplicable where there are single electorates. against the measure has been that the system provided it not the best obtainable. The honourable and learned member for Corinella says there is a better one, which he calls the average system, and which would provide a remedy for the evils which now exist. When a ballot was taken on the Capital Sites question, the plan of excluding the lowest name on the list was discussed, arid the honourable and learned member introduced another method which he said was known as the average system. The condemnation of that system for electoral purposes is to be found in his own judgment, which is given in Hansard, at page 3482, volume 20The system of averaging and knocking out proposed by us. the sites which have above the average of points, and retaining those which have below the average, and if necessary, re-averaging again, insures the adoption of the absolute choice of the House. The system could not very well be used at a general election, because, if the scrutineers had to count up 20,coo ones, twos, and threes their work would be stupendous. In an election of 1his kind, however, with a small number of votes, it is possible to adopt it, and produce such results as I have shown. I contend that the honourable and learned member, in fairness to the House, should have told us, when he suggested that as a aire, that he had himself condemned it ns absolutely impracticable. Instead of doing that, he left upon the minds of honourable members the impression that the method he suggested was a better one, and preferable to that proposed by the Government. He admitted) on a previous, occasion, that it would be impracticable to apply the average system to an electorate containing 20,000 electors. should like him to explain how the system could be practically applied to the Senate elections, seeing that there are 687,000 electors on the roll, and that 324,364 votes were recorded at the last election.

The writer deals with the average system of voting, and saysI have myself used this method in various The one criticism directed small church and other elections during the past twelve years, and I can bear witness both to the extraordinary power, simplicity, and finality of this method, and also to the excessive and wearisome toil involved in the scrutiny. And hence I do not think it possible for use in the large elections which occur in politics. The only criticism levelled at the principle contained in the Bill, putting on one side the question of whether or not preferential voting should be made compulsory, was that it might work out differently, and would not give the same accurate result as could be arrived at by means of the average system. I have already shown that that system is impracticable, and', that being so, I would ask what method we are to adopt? Not a single honourable member has suggested any method better than that you' make it compulsory. of the majority whether they shall express their views in a certain way. I submit that if the majority who have a right to express this preference do not care to exercise it, we can rest content with having afforded them the opportunity. If the majorityelect to say, "" So far as we are concerned, although we have a right to exercise the option, we prefer to stand by our first vote, and if our candidate is not returned, we shall be contenf to' abide by the result."" what objection can be urged?

The exhaustive system of preferences provided for under the Bill is absolutely the best and most practicable that I has yet been devised. replied to the vital objection urged by the honourable member for Corinella? honourable and learned member. He stated that under the proposed system it would be quite possible to throw out a candidate applied the whose election would be secured under the average system. But I have proved that the average system is hopelessly impracticable, whereas the method we propose can be effectively applied.

I admit candidly that the system has not been used to the extent that was expected; but I would point out that when the matter was recently under discussion, and it was suggested that the preferential voting system should be dropped, the absolute equity and fairness of the principle was admitted. If it affords an equitable and just means of voting, why should we not stand by it. We have been told 'that we ought not to adopt it, because we do not propose to apply it to the Senate elections. As I have explained, however, we should have to deal with an entirely different problem in connection with the return of representatives to that Chamber. A number of conflicting systems would have to be considered, and it would be extremely difficult to deal with the matter at this stage Ewing, T. T. with any prospect of success.

In the case cf the election for the House of Representatives we have a simple matter to deal with, and can make all the necessary arrangements in time for the general election. ever, we should have to face a number of difficult problems. Of course, if the SenStorrer, D. ate could come to an agreement on the point quicklv,° I should be very glad. which is thoroughly practicable, and in connection with which we can make all the necessary arrangements. No one has suggested that the electors are not sufficiently intelligent to enable them to vote in the manner proposed. The honourable member for Dalley admitted that the electors were just as intelligent as we were, and that they could exercise the franchise with due regard to the consequences of their actions. We have ample time within which to carry the new system into effect, and the electors can very readily be made acquainted with what is required of them. There is absolutely no reason why we should decline to which we all desire, namely, a better representation of the people in Parliament. I trust that we shall have the assistance of the majority of honourable members in making the measure effective and bringing the new system into operation at the next general election.
