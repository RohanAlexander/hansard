Mimster for the Navy whether his complacent confidence that all is well, peaceinl, secure and happy in our northern waters has any better basis than the similar confidence which was expressed by a former. Minister for the Navy in 1940 in respect of all warnings, and which proved so tragically misplaced ? the confidence expressed by a former Minister for the Navy in 1940, but I have complete confidence in the Royal Australian Navy and its personnel. I believe that the honourable memher for Eden-Monaro, if he had ever had tlie good fortune to come into contact with members of the Royal Australian -Vfivy, particularly the senior officers, would have an abiding faith in them. AsT stated earlier, the Navy has a splendid reporting organization in our northern waters. Being the organization best fitted for the purpose and being responsible for patrolling those waters, the Navy spring cruises round the coastline of Manus Island and New Guinea, with a "" turnabout"" to the western coast of Australia: I shall ask representatives of the Navy for their comments about the cruise, and the strange reports that have emanated from some sources, and I shall certainly convey their remarks to the lionorable member for Eden-Monaro, who pan then make un his mind about the situation.

Is there any possibility repatriation benefits. that this scheme will be extended to allow greater numbers ot Citizen Military Forces personnel to gain the benefit of such experience, and if so, will the Minister consider the inclusion in the scheme of other ranks? It has been stated that full repatriation aud other benefits will apply to the selected officers during their period of duty in Korea. Does that mean that Army records will show such service against the personnel concerned as active service in Korea? is a matter which could, be discussed in the Committee of Supply. matter fully in the Committee of Supply if honourable members so desire, and accordingly I shall give only a brief reply at this stage. Every honourable member will appreciate the important part that the Citizen Military Forces play in Australian defence, particularly if we should be called upon to mobilize our forces at any time. For that and for other obvious reasons that will come readily to the minds of honourable members, it is of the utmost importance that officers of the Citizen Military Forces, who are. part-time officers only, should be given every has decided to undertake opportunity to learn how the war is being conducted in Korea against the "" reds"". The honourable member has asked whether consideration will be given to the sending to Korea of other ranks in thc Citizen Military Forces to act as observers. When the six selected officers return to Australia from Korea they will furnish a report on their appreciation of the wisdom or otherwise of the continuance of the practice. I shall also ask Brigadier Daly, who is commanding the brigade in which both the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the Royal Australian Regiment are fighting, for his appreciation of the practice and whether he would recommend that it be continued.

Does the decision of the House last week on the position of under-secretaries affect in any way your ruling that the appointment of under-secretaries is unconstitutional ? If it does affect your ruling, what action or fresh plans have you in mind to enforce your ruling? tice to comment on the decisions of thc House. Health aware that there is a serious shortage of clinical thermometers in Sydney? If so, does he attribute the shortage to the methods of administering the import restrictions ? If his answer to either or both of those questions is in the affirmative, will the Minister inform the House what steps he will take to correct the position? whether or not there is any shortage of clinical thermometers. If there is, I shall consult the Minister for Trade and Customs to ascertain if any import restrictions are interfering with the supply of thermometers. I should tliink that import restrictions are not interfering with supplies because all equipment necessary for the sick is admitted to the country freely. question to the Minister for the Interior in relation to tenders for the erection of buildings on behalf of the Department of Works. ' By way of explanation, I inform the Minister that tenders have been invited for the erection of 192 sleeping units for immigrants at Newcastle -which those countries were themselves Other contracts are for the erection of 130 units at Holdsworthy and from 60 to 70 units in other places. The smallest contract is for sixteen units at Bichmond for the Royal Australian Air Force. Some building contractors are unable to finance or provide equipment for the bigger projects. Is it possible to reduce the number of units or buildings specified in the contracts for the benefit of smaller contractors? details of the tenders or the contracts to which the honourable member has referred. I shall look into the matter and give the honourable member an answer later. Commerce and Agriculture in a position to indicate whether there is a possibility that the back lag in orders for agricultural machinery, particularly harvesters, will be overtaken this year and whether it will be possible to meet the current demand ? Is the shortage of this type of machinery general among the manufacturers of agricultural machinery, particularly harvesters, in Australia? In view of the importance of . agricultural machinery in speeding up rural production in Australia, has the Government taken any measures to assist and encourage an increase in the output of machinery? wishes to encourage agricultural production, and it is very conscious of the fact that production cannot be increased unless farmers are able to get equipment of the kind, and in the quantity, that they need. There is a shortage of certain kinds of agricultural machinery in Australia. There is no shortage of tractors, but there is still a shortage of headers and some kinds of harvesters, though not of all. Some of the scarce kinds are being exported, but only to South Africa, a country which has been traditionally dependent on Australia for such machinery. A small, controlled export trade has been permitted with South Africa in recognition of that country's need, as well as of the need to maintain a trade connection. Australia, in turn, has had the benefit of importing from other countries goods of short. I have been negotiating with the more important manufacturers of agricultural machinery, and for a considerable time past the Government has been supplying those firms with equipment and skilled local and immigrant labour, a? well a3 with metal, machine tools, and equipment needed to expand their production. However, more harvesters are still being imported into Australia than are being exported.",6,Korea

Can the Minister see the association between those two facts, and will he do his utmost to ensure that the importation of rubber tyres is stopped? member's question should have been addressed to me. Unfortunately, I did not hear the whole of it because I did not at first realize that it concerned my department. However, I shall not put him to the trouble of repeating the question; I shall read the report of it, and supply him with an answer as soon as possible. question last week, the Minister for Social Services cited figures concerning the number of persons throughout Australia who had made application for unemployment relief. Can the Minister now inform the House of the number of ' persons who are drawing from this fund at the present time? House will be pleased to know that the number of applications for unemployment relief is still falling.

Is it .also a fact that in some instances when tenders have been called, contracts have been let to those contractors at such low rates that economic mining operations would be impossible and that the board has made secret adjustments to increase the rates ? If so, will the Minister explain why such contracts are not publicly f27] negotiated in the usual way, and will he also table details of contracts in which secret changes have been made during the last two years? not become seized of all the points that the. honourable gentleman sought to make.

Supply may answer the question although questions which deal with policy should go on the notice-paper. ported that 15,000 Germans were being brought to Australia. I have already told the House that that report is unfounded. Within the last day or so another report has been circulated to the effect that 10,000 Germans are coming here. I have received a cable from my colleague, the Minister for Immigration, and I am able to inform the House that the figure of 10,000 is also wrong. Mr Holt has just concluded an agreement of individuals must not be mentioned during question time. Immigration'has just concluded an agreement with the Bonn Government. The agreement does not specify any numbers or a term. It is, however, intended to bring in not more than 1,500 skilled tradesmen and experienced rural workers to Australia this year.

By way of example, a man who has a wife and three children is required to pay a total of £11 a week for board and lodging.

The attention of the Chifley Government, and, I have no doubt, that of preceding governments also, was directed to the practice that had grown up in all textile-producing countries whereby manufacturers worked up as woollen goods old clothing, clippings from new material, and all sorts of fibres. Unfortunately, that practice is being f o l lowed in Australia. In this process, manufacturers -using wools weave those materials into products that are placed on the market and sold to consumers who are led to believe that they are buying products that consist solely of pure virgin cerned about that practice and, after much investigation and acting upon the advice of the best authorities on the subject, it came to the conclusion that the Australian Government possesses adequate power to pass regulations to require exporters of textiles to Australia to label such textiles to show distinctly whether they have been manufactured fro m virgin wool or wool that had not previously been worked or mixed w i th synthetic fibre or any other kind of fibre. A regulation was drafted under the Customs Act. By virtue of the fact that wool came within the jurisdiction of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture, I , as Ministerf or Commerce and Agriculture, and the oflicers of my department assisted the Ministerf o r Trade and Customs to draf t a regulation to stop this nefarious trading practice. It was considered by both the then Government and the Australian Wool Board, which was then presided over by Mr Douglas Boyd, to be adequate. The Government realized that, although the regulation would require the exporters of woollen goods to this country to label their products as to their composition, after the products had been distributed within any Australian State the ComThe lionorable gentleman monwealth had no power to enforce",12,Healthand Medical Services

That was suggested as a possible method of dealing with the problem. We were told then that dishonesty on the part of textile manufacturers might cause difficulties. There may be an odd dishonest textile-manufacturer in the United Kingdom, but surely it will not be said that, generally speaking, British textile manufacturers would issue dishonest declarations about the percentages of the various fibres contained in a roll of material. Despite all those arguments, the present Minister for Trade and Customs (Senator O'Sullivan), for some reason or other, has not implemented the regulations. I do not know whether the officer to whom I have referred was able to persuade the Minister that the regulations would not be effective, or whether other influences have deterred him from permitting them to operate as from the 1st January, 1950. The honourable member for Indi( Mr sition, or apparent opposition, of a parBostock) and the honourable member for Franklin( Mr Falkinder) have raised the matter in this chamber recently, as also has the honourable member for Gellibrand ( Mr Mullens). It was raised first in the Parliament some years ago by the honourable member for Wannon( Mr and none of the textiles that enter AusMcLeod). But we have got no further. Begulations of this type operate in the United is a very urgent matter. I was Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, a cablegram was received by my department which stated that in one year the Japanese had purchased abroad, at a price of ls. per lb., approximately 2,500,000 lb. of old clothes,"" cumstances, that some strange influence had mixed the fibres from those old clothes with fibres of pure virgin Australian wool and had sold the cloth overseas as pure woollen material, in competition with material that really was made of pure wool. A member of a delegation from Bradford, after he had thrown onto my table a piece of stained wool, and after I had told him in plain farmers' terms what it was, asked whether I would claim that material for a suit made from that wool would be a better wearing product than ifr. PoUard. would material which consisted of 75 per cent, good merino wool and 25 per cent, synthetics. I said that I would not claim anything of the kind, and added that if he believed that a cloth made from 25 per cent, synthetics and 75 per cent, pure wool was a better wearing product than one made from stained wool, he had nothing to fear, because the public, on test, would buy the article that had the best wearing conditions. And so we have, unfortunately, a continuation of this period of vacillation, one might almost say of indifference. I do not think that the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture is indifferent, but I urge him, with all the persuasive powers at my command, to examine closely not only the relevant file but also the influences that are at work. Not only the British textile industry, but also the United Kingdom Government itself is perturbed. The industry is so concerned about the position that a delegation from the mills at Bradford came to this country to make representations to the Government. Then there is the oppoticular officer in the Department of Trade and Customs to the application of the regulation on the ground that it would be ineffective. Despite the fact that the regulation was to operate from the 1st January, 1950, it has not yet operated, tralia from Japan, tKe United Kingdom, or anywhere else, carry any label to indiStates of America. This cate to the wholesale or retail purchaser When that they contain virgin wool, no portion of which has ever been re-processed, re-worked clothing, or re-processed clippings. The proportion of syntheticmaterials that they may contain is not. indicated. I consider, in these ciris at work. The State governments have not implemented any regulations in this connection, but I urge the Government at least to ensure that, as a result of action applied at the point of entry of such goods, people will at least know exactly what materials are contained in imported textiles, and so will gain protection from the risk of purchasing goods that they might not otherwise purchase. When thc Government has taken that action, and the manufacturers overseas have been forced to reveal the proportion of fibres in the materials that they send here, perhonorable member why, in full detail,, if haps the State governments will be moved to take some additional action in the matter. I suspect that interested parties have gone the rounds of the State governments and have exercised some influence on them, and have persuaded them that it is not desirable to apply regulations or legislation in respect of those imports. I know that the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture himself is perturbed about it. The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. wish to draw a comparisonbetween the needs of the Northern Territory and the amount of money provided in the Estimates for its devolpment. The proposed vote for the territory totals £2,498,000. In view of the remarks that I propose to make about the territory, I invite the committee to compare that small provision with the budget total of about £1,000,000,000. It is commonplace nowadays to talk about two great needs for Australia. One is the need to produce more food; the other is the need to increase the volume and value of our exports in order to increase our external balances and enable us the better to finance imports. I ask honourable members, where in Australia we can look for a sudden increase of food production, or hope to achieve a sudden increase of our export trade. There is only one part of Australia in which these can possibly be found. It is in the northern part of this continent. There is no expectation of any dramatic change in the volume of food produced in the southern and closely settled parts of Australia. There is also no expectation of any sizeable increase of the volume of export goods produced in industrialized southern parts of Australia. member says that there ought to be. As a member of tbe Labour party he ought to know, far better than I do, the reason why there cannot be any expectation of an increase of production in the south of this continent. I had time to do so and were allowed to indulge, during this debate, on a survey of the activities of the Chifley and Curtin Governments during their eight years of misrule. If I were permitted to do so I could easily make quite clear the reason why we cannot expect an increase of pror duction of food or of goods for export in the south. .However, those matters are outside the scope of this debate. It should be obvious to all of us that the two needs that I have referred to can be filled in our lifetime only as a result of the development of the Northern Territory. The Northern Territory has immense possibilities for an increase of the production of beef, particularly beef for export, but, at present, the pastoral industries are in the grip of the worse drought that they have ever known. In fact, this year, for the first time in history, the annual mon* soonal rains have failed completely. Thia is particularly unfortunate at a time when the products of the territory are so badly needed. Disabilities from which the pastoral industries in the Northern Territory have suffered in the past include the lack of assured tenure of land, the immense distances over which the materials required for production, and the produce of the territory, have had to be transported, and the shortage of labour, particularly skilled labour. But perhaps more important than any of those, has been the low price of beef. Until the post-war period, the pastoral industries of the Northern Territory were not profitable because of low beef prices. An examination of the production problems of the Northern Territory leads inescapably to certain conclusions. I am sure that all honourable members will agree that the first aim of any government should be the closer settlement and full development of the temtory by resident land-holders. Clearly, the realization of any scheme of closer settlement is a long way off. There is no prospect whatever of achieving closer settlement of the pastoral lands of the Northern Territory in the immediate future. Enormous capital expenditure will be required before any substantial increase of production or closer settlement",13,Department Of Territories

86,Mr Keon,Tel l me why.,16,Department Of Territories
87,Mr Osborne,"I should tell . thein the territory can be achieved. It is fairly well known throughout the territory, which I was privileged to visit during the last recess, that a test settlement was conducted, on paper, to determine the cost of settling an ex-serviceman on the land. An area of land, deemed to be sufficient to support an ex-serviceman, was selected in the vicinity of Alice Springs, and the cost of the improvements necessary to put that land into production was calculated. It was found that approximately £30,000 would be needed for improvements on one property. That did not include the cost of the land itself. the land would be leased to the ex-serviceman by the Government at an annual rental and that no capital charge would be made. It is clear therefore, that the Northern Territory is not a suitable place for war service land settlement. Much more could be done in southern areas with the same sum. Substantial capital will be required for the development of the Northern Territory. Whose capital is this to be? Is it to .be private capital subscribed by Australians, by citizens of the United Kingdom, and by -Americans, or is it to be Australian Government capital ? To any one who has studied government enterprise in Australia, the answer is obvious. I sincerely hope that the Northern Territory will never become the object of a paternal government which seeks by the expenditure of public money to provide for closer settlement. ment of the territory as a government enterprise would inevitably result in heavy losses, and the prospects of success would be remote. The Australian Government's function is clear, to me at any rate. It must establish conditions in the Northern Territory, under which private capital-for the reasons that I have given it must be large capital-wil l be able to develop the territory effectively for of the bill, and I notice that it takes the use of Australians. The first need is for transport. There again the role of the Government is obvious. If adequate transport facilities were provided, private capital could be applied usefully to developmental work. The Government must also make conditions in the Northern Territory such that settlement will become Mr Oshome. popular. People must be attracted to the territory. As I have said, there is at present a serious lack of population and a serious scarcity of labour, particularly skilled labour. The pastoral industry of the Northern. Territory has its own peculiar problems which are not known to the industry in southern areas. Those problems arise from the fact that the Northern Territory bas a tropical summer rainfall. It receives all its annual rainfall in four or five months, and in those months there is a lush growth of grass. In the succeeding dry months, howI t was assumed that ever, the herbage dries and the movements of cattle are restricted to the areas around waterholes and bores. Stock movements are limited first by distances from water, and secondly by distances from feed, as the grass in the vicinity of water supplies becomes eaten out. Until water sunnlies are provided in much greater numbers, therefore, the land that is available for grazing purposes, even in ordinary seasons, will be limited. The difficulties are, of course, much more acute in adverse seasons such as the present. Although in some parts of the Northern Territory to-day there are good areas of grass, cattle cannot reach them because they are too far from water supplies. One may well ask why development of tbe Northern Territory has not proceeded faster. I suggest that the first reason is that graziers have not had an assured tenure of their The developholdings. Northern Territory leases have always been the subject of doubt and speculation. Therefore, I welcome the statement made earlier to-day by the Minister for Territories ( Mr Hasluck), that Northern Territory leases are being placed on a proper basis by a bill that is being introduced into the Legislative Council of the Northern Territory to-day. I have since been shown a summary the very wise course of providing for a separate agreement for each lease. In future an individual who contemplates entering into an agreement with the administration for the lease of a pastoral area will be able to make his own bargain in respect of the lease. On the one hand he will have a tenure of occupancy of 50 years, and on the other hand he will be required by the administration to carry out certain basic improvements of rhe property, which will make provision for future closer settlement when the lease is ultimately terminated or is surrendered by the lessee. I trust that the question of security of tenure of leases in the Northern Territory will now be satisfactorily resolved. The only doubt I have abont the matter is whether a bill passed hy the Legislative Council for the Northern Australian more particularly to ' foreign investors, should like to extend to them. The Legislative Council for the Northern Territory as' we all know, consists of a preponderance of official members. To some degree its membership will be influenced by changing politirates, which brings the maximum rate cal parties and ideas. Fifty years is a very long time in Australian government and during that period great changes may occur. Perhaps the Northern Territory Administration had that fact in mind when itprovided for agreements to be entered into between the lessee and the administration. agreements will give to lessees that essential security of tenure which hitherto has been lacking, and will enable them to expend with some confidence large sums of money on capital improvements.

The last report submitted by the Director-General of Social Services, whicli covered the year ended the 30th June, 1951, revealed that claims for invalid pensions received during the year totalled 10,765. Having regard to the number of claims received, one can rightly appreciate the need for the provision in these Estimates of £13,000 for medical examinations. In my opinion that amount is totally inadeTerritory will give to quate. In order to shorten the time lag investor's, and perhaps in dealing with applications for invalid pensions, the Government should conthat security which we sider the possibility of appointing additional permanent medical referees. I make this request because I have some personal knowledge of the time taken to deal with these claims. The proposed increase of the pension of pension to £3 7s. 6d. a week, is by no means adequate having regard to the increased cost of living. The old and infirm in the community are experiencing great difficulty in their battle to keep alive. It is frequently said that honourable members in this chamber speak with I hope that these tongue in cheek, as it were, about deserving cases among the recipients of social services benefits, particularly age and invalid pensioners. That, of course, is not true. Honourable members on this side of the chamber represent a greater or invalidity, are forced to rely upon the Consequently, as",16,Department Of Territories

90,Mr Cbemean,"I shall state myof pensioners than do honourable nienibers opposite. I do not intend to suggestindeed, it would be indecent for me to do so-that honourable members opposite are completely indifferent to the claims of the pensioners. All I say is that the logical protagonists of the pensioners are on this side of the chamber. In the electorate which I have the honour to represent over 3,500 persons are i i i receipt of age or invalid pensions. If we multiply that number by the number of other. electorates that contain large industrial areas, whioh are represented in this Parliament by members of the Labour party, the truth of our claim that Labour members represent a greater number of aged and invalid pensioners is amply demonstrated. The increased rates of pensions covered by these Estimates are entirely inadequate to sustain the aged and invalid pensioners in these days of high costs. Would any honourable member opposite like to see his mother or his father, or both of his parents if they were alive, trying to subsist on the rate of pensions paid by this Government? like to think that his parents were trying to subsist on a combined income of £6 15s. a week, or that either his father or his mother should have to exist on a pittance of £3 7s. 6d. a week? In their hearts honourable members opposite know that such a prospect would appal them. We, who represent the greatest number of pensioners in the Commonwealth do not like to contemplate i lie fact that the aged and infirm are compelled to live on such inadequate pensions. have shown perhaps much better than I can show that by comparison with the basic wage the maximum, rate of pension has constantly depreciated since the Chifley Labour Government went out of office in 1949. At the risk of .tedious repetition, I propose to give these figures to the committee. In 1941, the maximum pension rate was 21s. 6d. and tbe basic wage was 85s. The proportion of pension to basic wage in that year was 25.29 per cent. The percentages of the maximum rate of pension to the basic wage in the succeeding years when a Labour government occupied the treasury bench were 28.41 and 27.42' in 1942, and Mr Cremean. 27.37, 27.60 and 27.55 in 1943. In 1945, the percentage of the maximum pension to the basic wage received a fillip which was a credit to the government of that day. power ? Labour Government was in ofiSce and it raised the maximum, pension rate to 32s. 6d. The basic wage in that year was 96s. and the percentage of the pension to the basic wage was 33.S5. In 1947, the percentage had risen to 35.38. It reached a record high level in 1948 when, it increased to 36.64 per cent, of the prevailing basic wage. Then the people of Australia decided to elect a new gorerninent and they returned to oflice just such a government as that which now occupies the treasury bench. From that day to this, there has been a depreciation of the percentage of pension to basic wage. In 1950 it diminished from 36.G4 per cent, in the last year of the Labour Government to 30.8 per cent. In 1951 it rose to 31.7 per cent., but even allowing Would he for the proposed increase of 7s. 6d. and remembering that the maximum rate is 67s. 6d. compared with a basic wage of 237s., the percentage of the pension to the basic wage at 28.6 is the lowest for many-years. will i-ise again shortly. the percentage of the pension to the basic wage will diminish accordingly. Social services are not granted as an Other Opposition members extra payment to people who do not really need the money. To emphasize that point, I draw the attention of the committee to the Tenth Eeport of the Director-General of Social Services for the year ended the 30th June, 1951. That is the last report available from that source. It shows that 95.7 per cent, of the persons who were in receipt of age and invalid pensions in that year either earned nothing or less than 30s. a week or owned nothing or less than the statutory maximum. In other words, 95.7 per cent, of persons who are in receipt of age or invalid pensions were really in indigent circumstances. The proposed increases will be acceptable to persons",18,Department Of Territories

A reasonable percentage would be 40 per cent, of the prevailing basic wage, and at that level the pensions should be subject to variations in the cost of living figures as they occur from cime to time. The provision of such a pension rate would be merely social justice. On that basis, the maximum pension would be £4 15s. a week. That inadequate sum surely is not too much to give to people who have done so much for Australia. The aged and in f i r m are the most deserving section of the community. If the Government can spend money for trips abroad and for defence it should be able to help those who have done much to build the nation. I have seen the efforts that are made by humble pensioners to eke out their existence. It is pathetic that these grand and simple people, who are too old to be employable, should have to struggle to put aside small sums to add to the enjoyment of others at certain seasons of the year. My and invalid pensioners are applicable also to those who receive' unemployment benefits. Whilei t is true that provision has been made for an increase of 100 per cent, in unemployment benefits, the rate has not kept pace w i th increases in the basic wage. If it had done so, the rate of unemployment .benefits to-day would be £3 2s. 6d. for a husband, £2 10s. for a wife' and 12s. 6d. for each child. The DEPUTYCHAIRMAN Tbe bonorable member's time has expired. I wish to Gomment on the proposed vote for the Department of Commerce and Agriculture, and first I congratulate the Ministerf o r Commerce fact that agricultural production in Australia is rising. The honourable member for Yarra( Mr Keon), who does not often make mistakes, asked a question recently on the subject of dairy production. Apparently the honourable member liad obtained some old statistics. Changes are so frequent in such figures that one must go to the factories themselves, almost week by week, to discover what is happening. I visited a factory recently and asked for information about milk production. I was informed that it was 86,000 gallons. I replied that that did not mean anything and asked how the figure compared with last year. A comparison snowed that production had risen by 60 per cent. to one factory? . commodity which uses surplus m i l k production. Present indications are that Australia's butter production this year will be 1S5,000 tons. That is more than 50,000 tons above last year's output. IT, might mean an increase of £20,000,000 of export income. So any honourable member opposite who attempts to deprecate dairy production is out of date, hopelessly inaccurate and has no contact with what is happening in the industry. I compliment the Minister on the results of the past year. I believe that the results in the coming year w ill be even better. The spring is one of exceptional promise and production in some sections of primary industry w ill reach unpreremarks in relation to age cedented high levels. This department, which was bequeathed to the present Minister by the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) , could well be reorganized. I am pleased to see the Under Secretary for Commerce and Agriculture enter the chamber. He has a sound knowledge of rura l matters. We all know that it is necessary to increase rura l production. Eveni f the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) can find Order ! uranium in the Northern Territory, ancl the honourable member for Swan( Mr. Grayden) can find other precious minerals elsewhere, it is still necessary to export our primary products in order to provide ourselves with overseas credits. In the United States of America, there is a Department of Agriculture which plays an important and intimate part in rura l production. In Australia, although the Ministerf or Commerce and Agriculture makes a magnificent effort through the Australian Agricultural Council ancl State departments to increase primary production, his department does not help him very much.

Finally, there is the Division of Agricultural Production, which is to cost £42,000, or 3 per cent, of the total expenditure. It is evident, therefore, that the department does not allocate a sufficient proportion of its expenditure to actual production. You yourself, Mr to draw £1,750 a year. His place ha? Deputy Chairman, representing as you do tbe magnificent district of Gippsland, realize the possibility that exists for increasing production in high rainfall areas. It has been suggested that a rural production Minister might be appointed as one of a group under a senior Ministei, similar to the group of Service Minis1 ters under the Minister for Defence. Surely food production is as important as are the activities of the five defence portfolios. The rural production Minister could concern himself with the problem, of providing fencing material, superphosphate and other requirements needed for immediate seasonal production. Secretary for Commerce and Agriculture would be the man to do the job under the distinguished Minister for Commerce and Agriculture. I cannot see that such an arrangement would in any way cut across the work of State departments. It is proper that, State authorities should be particularly concerned with rural production, because they a.re closest to the actual producers. Indeed, I think it might be a good thing if there were appointed district production committees as in the United States of America, where there are agricultural extension mittees, &c, which concern themselves with rural production.

The honourable member hopes to get back to office some day and to take control of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture again.

I appeal to the Minister, with his fine intellect, to look at his department, to re-organize it, or to split them to be. it up, if necessary, and try to get from it a department which can deal with rural production. Production and distribution should be separated. They are highly specialized and separate activities. Commerce should be associated with trade. There is no doubt that primary production can be increased. A little while ago we entrusted work of this kind to the Department of National Developmen t, and its magnificent achieveof farmers. It will be recalled that the ments included an increase of the production of black coal by 16 per cent. Although the production of superphosphate increased by 10 per cent., it is still not sufficient. We require at least 30 per cent, more superphosphate this year for our wheat crops. Electric power increased by 7 per cent, and refined petroleum products by 10 per cent. Those figures prove that the job can be done. I believe it to be proper that the State governments, which are closest to the points of production, should carry out the major part of the job. I congratulate some of the State governments, including the Government of Victoria, for bringing about increased primary production. The black sheep of the family, of course, is the New South Wnle. Government. e in the country!

The greatly decreased production in New South Wales has offset the increases in other States. The DEPUTY CHAIBMAN has expired. The honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr Jeff Bate) has stressed the need for greater primary prodtiction. I am sure that everyone will agree that, increased primary production is necessary, but not all will agree that the causes of decreased production are as the honourable member stated He spoilt his contribution to the debate by his slighting references to the New South Wales Government. He stated that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Besearch Organization is doing a good job and is helping to improve farming methods. WhilstI agree that that is so nevertheless it is only a part of the picture. The greatest factor in our decreasing food production is the lack honourable member stated that socialists have been the stumbling block in the way of increased primary production. I remind him that only by a measure of socialism we may obtain greater production. I do not know of a financial institution that supports the political party to which the honourable member belongs that is prepared to finance the establishment of young men on tbe land.

An American, firm that sells woollen cloth has distributed a book which contains tbree samples of material, one of which is 100 per cent, pure wool, the second 50 per cent, pure wool and 50 per cent, shoddy, and the third 100 per cent, shoddy. The average person cannot tell the difference between them. The Government should take steps to ensure that, there shall be no further delay in acting on this important matter. 14.29] I shall discuss the proposed vote for the Department of Social Services. I a in not satisfied with what the Government has done in regard to this department. The people of Australia generally, and particularly the pensioners, are completely dissatisfied with the Government's neglect of the requirements of the age and invalid pensioners, the tuberculosis pensioners, the service pensioners and the unemployed. During the financial year 1950-51, 411,724 people were receiving invalid and age pensions in Australia. In addition, 41,962 the late Mr Chifley was Australia's people received the widow's pension; and 16,512 people received the service or tuberculosis pension. The position in regard to age and invalid pensioners is rather serious. Since October, 1948, the pension payable to such pensioners in Adelaide has been reduced from 36.64 per cent, to 30.1 per cent, of the basic wage in that city. I cite the figures for Adelaide because I represent Hindmarsh, which is in the centre of that city and there is a large number of age and invalid pensioners in it. My figures will differ from those that were cited by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) and other honourable members from New South Wales and Yictoria because the basic wage-is on a different level in those States. Having compared the Ohifley ago and invalid pensions of 1948 with the Menzies pensions of 1952 it will be interesting to ascertain whether a statement which the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) made during the last general election campaign corresponds with his subsequent performance. At that time, referring to pensions, the Prime Minister saidWe will, mucli more importantly, increase their true value liy increasing their purchasing power. I ask thc committee to judge whether the Prime Minister has honoured that solemn undertaking to thc people of Australia. Many thousands of people thought that the Prime Minister would fulfil his promise. The pensioners have discovered to their great regret that the promises of the Prime Minister were merely catchcries for the purpose of persuading the people to reject the late Ben Chifley who, inmy opinion, was the greatest Prime Minister Australia has had. ber should emphasize that that is only his opinion. opinion of the people of Australia generally. According to the Government parties and the press of this country, the late Mr Chifley was a Communist two days before he died. Immediately after he died he was transformed into Australia's greatest son. The people of Australia will agree with me when I say that greatest Prime Minister. If the Government wished to maintain age and invalid pensions at the same percentage of the basic wage as they represented in 1948 it would be necessary for it to increase the present rate of £3 a week to £4 2s. Yet the Government has proposed that it shall be increased only to the miserable amount of £3 7s. 6d. The age and invalid pensioners have a perfect right to have their pensions adjusted in proportion to the increases that take place in the cost of living just as every one else has the right to have their wages automatically adjusted in proportion to those increases. The adjustments should be made quarterly as the basic wage",23,Department Of Territories

It it; not true to say that pensions rates have ever been adjusted in the way that I now advocate. repealed that section of the act which provided for a form of automatic adjustment of pensions but the formula that was used by the Lyons Government to effect automatic adjustments had steadily reduced the ratio of pensions rates to the basic wage, as an examination of the relevant figures will show. An accurate formula should be devised and introduced for the purpose of ensuring that pensioners shall not be used as a political football to be kicked round at election time. They should not have promises made to them, merely for the purpose of obtaining their votes. I hope that honourable members on the Government side will give close attention to what I am saying about pensions. Age pensioners are human beings; they are not like cats or dogs, because if cats or dogs are hungry they rummage in garbage tins to get enough to eat. Our old people cannot go to the garbage tins like animals, and when God calls them away the fancy word "" malnutrition"" is inscribed on their death certificates. It is not an exaggeration to say that there are hundreds of age and invalid pensioners who are literally starving because they have not the means with which to buy enough to eat. It is useless for Ministers, who can travel abroad and spend huge sums on their fancy trips, to say that the Government cannot afford to pay the pensioners enough to live on. If the Government can afford to give to the wealthy landlords of King William-street, Rundle-street, and other city localities about £6,250,000 through the abolition of the land tax, it can afford to help the pensioners. If the sum that will in effect, be handed to the wealthy landholders of Anstralia, were used to increase age pensions, they could be increased not to £3 7s. 6d., but to about £3 14s. a week. Such !an increase would not cost the taxpayers an extra l d . and, consequently, the Government cannot plead that it did not have enough 3lr. Clyde Cameron. money to increase pensions to a greater degree than is proposed. The age pension rates are cruelly insufficient because pensioners have the same fixed commitments that we all have. They must pay their rent, they must pay for The Curtin Government the light and fuel that they use, and they must replenish their household necessaries. Moreover, clothing and shoes ultimately wear out ancl must be replaced. After they have satisfied their most pressing needs there is often not. sufficient left out of their pensions for them to buy the food necessary to keep thern in lieal th; and I remind honourable members that the high prices that now prevail are becoming more exorbitant as time passes.

I shall now quote from an article that appeared in Bunyip, a Gawler newspaper that has the widest circulation of any provincial newspaper in the electorate of the Minister for paper ? not a.

Then readers are informed of the places to which they may send their left-off clothing. That article connotes a disgraceful state of affairs, because the pensioners want only a decent rate of pension; they certainly clo not want charity. They want justices, and I submit that they are entitled to receive justice particularly from this Government which promised them so much during the last general election campaign in order to get their votes. I venture to prophesy that never again will this Government get the votes of the pensioners, whether it tries t.o drag across the political path the red herring of",24,Department Of Territories

113,Mr Clyde Cameron,"No, it iscommunism or any other red herring, because the pensioners, liie all other electors, now know its worth. Another important matter that I wish to place before honorahle members concerns the property qualification for the age pension. I am gratified to see the Minister for Social Services( Mr unemployment benefit by 100 per cent, Townley) present during this debate because J. hope that he will be able to do something about the specific case that [. intend to mention. If an aged person owns two houses and lives in one and lets the other for 30s. a week, he is not entitled to any age pension if the rented house is assessed at a value that is greater than the maximum permissible value of property under the Soeial Services Consolidation Act. If a person owns two houses in the circumstances that I. have detailed, the capital value of the second house should not be regarded as property in order to disqualify the person from receiving the age pension. I suggest that only the income of the second house sbould be taken into account, and then merely for the purpose of determining wliether or not that income is to' be used as a means of reducing the rate of pension. The plight of an aged couple who live in Adelaide has been brought to my notice. If necessary I can give their names to the Minister for Social Services, and I ask him in this particular instance to use whatever discretion he is given under the legislation. These people, who have had twelve children, were farmers on the west coast of South Australia during the whole of theiv working lives. When it is known that they were indebted to the Farmers Assistance Board for some time, houorable members will realize the nature of their circumstances. After years of struggle tbey finally decided to leave their farm. Their four sons had worked on it all tbeir lives and had not received any wages, which circumstance is not unusual with farmers' sons. The aged couple sold it to their sons for £1,500. They applied for the age pension and were told by the Department of Social Services that thcy were ineligible for it because the farm was worth £8,000 when they sold it, and that they had no right to give it to their sons for less than that sum. I hope that the Minister will consider this matter and try to increase the depletion amount allowed in such cases. The farm was sold to the sons because they had spent tlieir whole lives working without pay for their parents. The Government has announced with great gusto that it has increased the l n this connection I desire to cite some figures from the Quarterly Summary of Australian Statistics. The average number of persons who were receiving unemployment benefit each week in the financial year 1946-47 was 9,371; in 1947-48 it was 3,939; and in 1948-49 it was 1,573. The number of persons who at present receive unemployment benefit is at least 18,000. I remind honourable members to compare that figure with the weekly average of 1,573 which represents the number of persons who received it during the year 1948-49. It should also be realized that more people would at present be in receipt of unemployment benefit if it were more widely known that unemployed persons who have money in the bank aire still entitled to the benefit. That fact should be made more widely known to the unemployed. At present there are about 100,000 unemployed persons in Australia and they should be made aware of the fact that, although they may have money in the bank they are still entitled to unemployment benefit under the social services legislation, which was first introduced by the Chifley Government. The TEMPOBABY CHAIRMAN member's time has expired. is not necessary to reply in detail to honourable members whose statements are as reckless as those of the honourable member for Hindmairsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron). The honourable member is known _ for his recklessness, not only in this chamber but also outside it, so it is hardly necessary to argue seriously about any of the matters that he raised. I suggest that the honourable member knows more about auctioning promises for votes than do most of the honourable members on this side of the chamber. The honourable member spoke at length about social services, and said, sarcastically, that this Government could be proud of its record.",25,Department Of Territories
114,( Mr Mcleay),Order! The honourable 1,26,Department Of Territories
115,Mr Bland (Warringah) [4.44],"It[ suggest quite seriously that the Government is proud of its record in the field of social services, and that any one who takes the trouble to consider the matter dispassionately will be convinced that the Government has honouired all the promises that it ever made about improving social services. The committee is now considering the proposed votes for the Department of Commerce and Agriculture, the Department of Shipping and Transport, the Department of Social Services, and the Department of Territories. The activities of the first three of these departments provide me with an opportunity to discuss certain complex problems that will arise from the important decision by tbe Government to abandon the system of uniform taxation. The services provided by these departments, in particular the Department of Social Services, impose a claim upon the resources of the Commonwealth that is indefinite and almost incalculable. The abolition of the means test is a declared policy of the Government, and when that policy is put into effect an even heavier claim than at present will he made by the Department of Social Services. The activities of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture and the Department of Shipping and Transport have grown considerably in recent years. Prior to 1942, like social services other than age pensions, these activities were almost entirely in the hands of the States. The Commonwealth will need much greater resources to finance those .services than it heeded in 1939. Thus, when we consider the proposal to abandon the uniform tax system, we are confronted with the problem whether these services should be retained by the Commonwealth or returned in the main to the States. Unless the Government decides to abandon some of the services that it now performs, or to restore them to the States, the difficulty of abolishing the uniform tax system will be extremely complex. At present there is a great deal of overlapping of the activities of the Commonwealth and the States, especially in the fields of transport and agriculture. The developments that have taken place in respect of the overseas representation of Australia can be justified, but' many Jfr. Bland. items in the divisions of the Estimates that we are new considering refer to aspects of Commonwealth activity that are of doubtful legitimacy. I suggest that as the weight of taxation becomes increasingly onerous, it will be worthwhile for the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) to approach the duty of estimating revenue and expenditure from an entirely fresh stand-point. Under the present system, the various departments prepare Estimates of Expenditure that are designed to cover the activities that they wish to undertake. These are examined by officers of the Treasury, who decide which of the items shall be approved. Finally, the revised Estimates of all departments are examined by the Government which, having decided how much is to be expended, sets about, the task of determining the best ways to raise the necessary money. That system was all right in the days when taxation was light and the Government was not required to provide all the services of the social welfare State. However, the task of the Government has become so onerous that I suggest a new approach to the problem of budgeting is needed. The Government should first decide how much it can afford to expend rather than what it proposes to expend. If it approaches the problem from that stand-point, it can then ask itself: "" At what stage will income tax be so heavy that people will refuse to do more than theii ordinary share of work? "" We all know that workers in industry generally refused to work overtime when taxes were at their highest levels. They refused to work to the utmost of their ability because they considered that, if they did so, they would be merely earning extra income for the Treasury. The same result is produced by severe indirect taxation. The Government must ask itself, "" At what stage will indirect taxation cause a curtailment of industry on the one hand, or a loss of revenue on the other hand ?"" It should approach the task of budgeting in the same way as any housewife approaches her housekeeping problems. The housewife says, "" I nave so much money and that is all I can afford to spend"". The Government should say to itself, "" How much money can we afford to raise ?"" Having answered that question, it can turn to the people and say, ""-We have so much money and we propose to allocate it to these services "". It must abandon the old system of determining first how much money it must expend and then how to raise the necessary revenue. Two thoughts are foremost in my inind when I consider the proposal to abandon the uniform tax system. The first is that the competition and the overlapping of activities in the Commonwealth sphere and in the State sphere must be eliminated before the proposal can be implemented. The second is that this Government must review very carefully the services it provides and decide which of them it will retain and which could be more satisfactorily carried out by the States. The idea that I want to leave in the minds of honourable members is that of the need for an entirely new approach to the task of budgeting. Governments must decide what they can afford to expend, not what they want to expend, and budget accordingly. honourable member for Warringah ( Mr in respect of the second and subsequent Bland) criticized the honourable member children was later increased by a Labour for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) for government. having made, very properly, a strong plea for the aged and the invalid members of party-Australian Country party alliance our community.

The rate of those A little more than ten years ago, the only payments has not been increased during social services administered by the Commonwealth were the age pension, the invalid pension and the maternity allowance. The honourable member for Hoddle( Mr Cremean) and the honourable member for Hindmarsh have shown that, in relation to the basic wage the purchasing power of the age pension is less to-day than it was when the pension was introduced in 1910, and that the purchasing power of the maternity allowance to-day is less than it was when it was introduced in 1912. The purpose of those social services was to give social security to all persons in all circumstances. ' The field of social services was not extended until 1941, when child endowment was introduced by a Liberal government in such circumstances that the payment could be claimed to have been a trick. At that time, the basic wage was 12s. or 13s. a week less than it should have been, and the Liberal Government of the day, in order to prevent a sharp increase of the basic wage, made provision for the payment of endowment for each child of a family under the age of sixteen years, with the exception of the first child.

However, the relation of unemployment and sickness benefits was greater in 1944 than the increased rate will be in 1952-53. The Labour Government also made provision for free hospitalization, but that scheme is to be destroyed by this Government. Under the Ohifley Government's plan, a patient who occupied a bed in a public ward of a hospital was not charged for accommodation and treatment. This Government has decided to interfere, with that scheme, and, in future, patients in public wards will be subject to a means test. Whilst certain persons will benefit from the altered conditions, the cost of the scheme will be met by people who formerly enjoyed free hospitalization. I now propose to refer briefly to the operation of the unemployment and sickness benefits scheme. As the Chifley Labour Government had adopted a 1 policy of full employment, the number of* applications for the unemployment benefit when it was in office was negligible. More jobs were available than there were men and women to fill them. The position, unfortunately, is reversed at the moment and many persons are in receipt of unemployment benefit. A few years ago, the breadwinner of a family, if he became ill, was able to feel financially secure because he was entitled to free hospitalization and medicine, and the sickness benefit, in addition to child endowment, made his income almost equivalent to the basic wage. That position has deteriorated, becanse this Government has failed to honour its pre-election promise to put value back into the f l , and the income of a breadwinner from the sources I liave mentioned is now equivalent to only one-third of the basic wage. Another social service introduced by the Labour Government in 1946 was the allowance payable to the wife of an invalid pensioner. My only objection to the innovation at that time was on the ground of its inadequacy. I consider that the wife of an invalid pensioner is entitled to receive an amount equivalent to that received by any other pensioner, as the woman, because of the disability of h**r husband, is Mr Costa. obliged to remain at home in oTder that she may care for him, and, therefore, she is unable to supplement her pension. She is not able to earn the permissible income of £3 a week, because she is the nurse in the home. I hope that the Minister will examine that matter. In 194S, the Chifley Labour Government made provision for the rehabilitation of physically handicapped persons. The Tenth Report of the Birector-General of Social Services gives the following information about the progress of that scheme:Fiom the beginning of the scheme in late 1048 to tlie eiicl of June. 1951, 2,688 handicapped persons have been found suitable employment. Of this number, 1,037 won* invalid pensioners. It is estimated that for tliese persons ;i saving of not less than £2,000,000 in the payment of future pensions alone bus been affected. This is apart altogether from thc payments tbey may make later as taxpayers and tin* valuo of their contribution to the national income. The earnings of these rehabilitated pensioners may be expected to total smm* £500,000 a year, whereas previously tbe cost of paying them pensions and wife's allowance was nearly £150,000 a year. Reliabilities are drawn mainly from the younger groups of pensioners. It has come to my notice that some rehabilitated persons in my electorate, because of their handicaps, are not able to find a place in industry. In my opinion, the Government should evolve a plan to make provision for their employment in suitable vocations. The rehabilitation payment of £1 a week while rehabilitees were undergoing training, and the allowance of £20 to enable them to purchase their tools of trade, remain at the figures determined in 1948. Those amounts should be increased, and, as I have stated, arrangements should be made for the employment of rehabilitated persons, because the report of the Director-General of Social Services indicates that they become of considerable value to the nation. The funeral benefit of £10, which is payable' in respect of a pensioner, was determined by the Chifley Labour Government in 1946, and should be substantially increased. cost of dying?-",28,Department Of Territories

I support the contention of the honourable member for Hindmarsh regarding the circumstances of elderly people who own more than one property. The eligibility -of a man and his wife for the age pension is not affected if they own the house in which they live, but they are disqualified if they own another property, the value of which exceeds £1,000. A person, on becoming a pensioner, is entitled to a number of benefits such as free medical attention and free medicine within prescribed limits, and, in the State of New South Wales, transport concessions. But persons who own property of a value in excess of £1,000 are not eligible to receive those benefits. Yet, I venture to say, their standard of living is virtually lower than that of age and invalid pensioners. In any social services scheme that is worthy of the name anomalies of that kind should not be permitted to exist. Our social security scheme should be expanded to provide additional benefits snch as a nursing service for aged people in their own homes. Many aged people, for sentimental reasons, prefer to be nursed in their homes rather than enter hospitals. Marriage aud home ownership allowances also should be provided. The Government should establish reciprocity in respect of social services benefits with tlie United Kingdom Government. Such reciprocity already exists with the New Zealand Government. I am aware that t.he Minister has this matter under review. I urge him to expedite consideration of it. Many British immigrants in Australia are in receipt of a pension from the British Government of 26's. a week, which, plus exchange amounting to 6s. 3d., gives to them a pension of \ « 12s. 3d. a week. That is their total income, because until reciprocity witb the United Kingdom is arranged they cannot qualify for other social services such as age and invalid pensions and medical benefits. The DEPUTY CHAIBMAN ( Mr man or a woman Bowden) -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. [5.7""| I am happy that the Government has found it possible to increase social services benefits, particularly age and invalid pensions, to the degree set out in the budget. The Government is fully aware of its responsibility to provide the greatest assistance possible to this most deserving section of the community. able member think that the increase of the age and invalid pension by 7s. 6d. a week is sufficient? orable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) and his colleagues do a disservice to pensioners by presenting their claims in a. way that is designed solely to gain some party political advantage for the Opposition. I commend the Government on the increases that it proposes to grant to all classes of pensioners. This is the third successive budget, under which it has increased social services benefits. Whilst the rate of age and invalid pension is to be increased on this occasion by 7s. 6d. a week, that rate was increased by 10s. a week under each of the last two preceeding budgets. This increase will involve a total additional expenditure of £12,700.000 in the current financial year, whilst it is safe to say that each of the last two increases involved a total additional annual expenditure of approximately £17,000,000. Increases of all classes of social services benefits will involve an additional expenditure for the current financial year of £26,500.000. Tbe increase of the rate of child endowment, which this Government also increased on previous occasions, will involve an additional expenditure of £0.1.79,000. It is all very well for members of the Opposition to claim tliat the rate of age and invalid pensions should be increased to £5 or £6 a week on the basis of the present cost of living.

125,Mr Beenaed Corser,"The hontbat the present increase may not be all that could be desired, the fact remains chat the Government is now increasing the rate of pensions for the third time, bringing the total increase since it assumed office to £1 7s. 6d. a week. To-day, an aged couple receive each fortnight by way of pension £5 10s. more than they received under Labour which was in office for a period of eight years. continuedIn addition, this Government has increased hospital benefits by £6,500,000 for the current financial year whereas Labour provided only an allowance at the rate of Ss. a day for each occupied bed under a system which permitted persons of adequate means to obtain free hospital treatment and thus limit hospital accommodation for persons in poor circumstances. ment's scheme, adequate finance will be made available to hospitals of all classes, by the Lyons Government, it is useless the management of which will thus be enabled to conduct them on the most modern lines and to pay adequate remuneration to those who devote their lives to nursing the sick. During the current financial year, the Government will also provide the sum of £1,300,000 iu respect of child nutrition. Members of the Opposition, particularly the honourable member for Hindmarsh, repeatedly make irresponsible statements in which they claim that pensions rates should be directly related to the cost of living. But what did the Government that those honourable members supported do in this matter? On thc 14!th June, 1949, the honourable member for Mallee (' Mr Turnbull) asked Mr Chifley, who was then Treasurer, whether his Government intended to increase the rate of age and invalid pensions and, if so, whether the increase would be between 3s. and 5s. a week, as suggested in the press, or whether his Government would ensure that the new rate would have some practical relation to the cost of living. The reply that Mr Chifley gave to that question, which I shall read for the information of the honourable member for Hindmarsh, was as follows:No consideration has heen given to a further increase of pension rates. The Government considered this subject not long afro and made a general increase, and it is law were in existence when the present Mr Bernard Oorser. unlikely that a further increase will be considered so soon after that. Tlie law provided at one time that pension rates must be related to thc cost of living and must rise or fall according to variations of the cost of living index figures. I point out that that provision was placed on the statute-book by the Lyons Government and that it was abolished by a Labour government. Mr Chifley However, when C"" scries index figure? fell about threo years ago thore was a great protest against any reduction of pensions.. . . . Therefore, the pension rates are uot now affected by the cost of living. Yet, the honourable member for Hindmarsh has attacked this Government because it has not related pensions to the cost of living. In view of the fact Under this Governthat a Labour government abolished such a provision after it has been introduced for honourable members opposite to try to tickle the ears of pensioners in dealing with this matter. It is clear that this Government is making the fullest possible provision for pensioners consistent with its financial capacity. Of course, the honourable member for Hindmarsh would not agree that, having regard to the present cost of living, drought-stricken dairy farmers should receive 5s. per lb for butter. In the 1949 general election the Australian Labour party promised the people that if returned to office it would increase age and invalid pensions by 10s. a week. In effect, Labour offered to buy the votes of the pensioners. On the other hand, the anti-Labour parties made no promise in this connection but undertook, to consider at the appropriate time, the claims of pensioners as well as those of every other section of the community. After coming to office this Government increased age and invalid pensions by 10s. a week. Subsequently, it made another increase of 10s. a week, and now a further increase of 7s. 6d. a week is proposed. This proves that the utterances of the honourable member for Hindmarsh were utterly irresponsible. The honourable member also stated that persons who had transferred their farms to their sons, or who own two houses, are ineligible for an age pension. I remind the committee that these provisions of the Government came to office. I am not blaming the Chifley Government for imposing the restrictions, because they had existed for years prior to that Government assuming in turn, handed on by that Government. will be able to give effect to his great desire to ameliorate the means test in order to permit the payment of age pensions in all worthy cases. The Opposition cannot hoodwink the pensioners into believing that things are going badly for them under this Government's administration. In addition to increasing the rate of pension, this Government has introduced a free medicine scheme for pensioners, and they also receive sickness benefits and free spectacles. tacles ? people provide them. These services were not provided when previous Labour governments were in office, and the people should not be misled into thinking that they would be continued if honourable members opposite were again to obtain control of the treasury bench. The present Government has a very creditable record in relation to the provision of social services. shall direct my remarks to the relatively small proposed vote for shipbuilding. Rumours are current that the Commonwealth intends to sell its ships. Ministers opposite-particularl y the younger memare reported to have stated that the time is opportune for the Commonwealth to get out of the shipping trade. The Aus' tralian Country party should be very vigilant in this matter because it is obvious that if the ownership of Commonwealth ships is transferred to private enterprise the farmers will be faced with considerable difficulty in having their produce carried interstate by sea. The sale of the Commonwealth shipping line is almost an accomplished fact. Kites have been flown about the original cost of constructing these ships, and the Government has been very deceitful about their present value. Spokesmen for the Government have stated that this line of old steamers, as they have been termed, is worth only £8,000,000. As I have worked in the shipbuilding yards, I have a good idea of their worth. If the Government sells the Commonwealth ships for £S,000,000 it will power and were, blatantly give away to the grasping overseas ship-owners £20,000,000 of the I hope that the Minister people's assets. I have before me authentic figures in relation to the cost of the present Commonwealth fleet. They are as follows:Cost. £ 13 "" A "" class ships (9,000 tons) 8,208,000 2""B"" „ „ (0,000 „ ) 1,000,000 0""D"" „ „ (2,500 „ ) .. 3,380,000 3*'E,"" „ „ ( 600 „ ) 701,000 13,349,000 Their replacement cost would be about £17,795,000. The Commonwealth also owns the following vessels that have not been mentioned in ministerial press statements:-SS . Tyalla, MV. Bansdorp, Mt. Austin, Mt. Parker, and the war prize, MV. Nyora. In addition, two bulk carriers, of 10,000 tons each, and two motor ships for the timber trade, of 1,650 tons each, have been ordered from overseas. The market value of the entire fleet, including the ships that have been ordered from overseas but not delivered, is about £22,645,000. The big interests that control Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited ire making ready to grab these assets for a paltry £8,000,000. Honourable members bers of thc Liberal party, who have advocated patriotism and stronger defences-shoul d realize that if the Commonwealth ships are sold our shipbuilding yards will close. Ship-building is booming in Japan, as will be seen from the following article that appeared in the Sunday Telegraph of the 31st August:SHIP-BUILDING BOOM IN JAPAN.

Japan's ambitious civilian ship-building plan is already under way. This afternoon, the Minister for the is gravely concerned about the defences of Australia, but apparently the Government is happy to leave us at the mercy of other maritime powers by scrapping our shipbuilding industry. I speak on behalf of 12,000 shipbuilders, but, indirectly, there are between 50,000 and (10,000 men engaged in the industry. There are engineers, boiler-makers, blacksmiths, moulders, shipwrights, brass finishers, coppersmiths, ship painters, ship joiners, mechanical engineers, and marine architects. They all are members of skilled trades and professions which are essential to our country in time of war. This Government stands condemned in the eyes of the world because it has sold most of the protective assets of the Australian people. Now. to cap all, our maritime progress is to be stopped. Our shipyards are to be closed, and thousands of skilled men put on the track, just as they were in the 1930's. This Government is noted for its deceit. The Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holt), who is now overseas, is trying to gull the people again, because he is saying that we need skilled men from Germany and Holland, notwithstanding that the Government is seeking t.he dismissal of most of the skilled men in the trades associated with the Australian ship-building industry. are we going? Most of our assets have gone, and the last and best of them will be gone also very soon. We stand, as it were, at the front door of the teeming millions of Asia. While the "" Yellow Peril"" is preparing a huge programme for t.he building of warships and merchant vessels, this Government is proposing to sell the only asset of the Australian people that would protect them from, the ""Yellow Peril"". are we doing to build submarines, aircraft carriers, corvettes, mine-sweepers, and submarine detectors? The £200,000,000 that the Government has put aside for defence purposes is being given to the Mr Cnrtin. racketeers who are bleeding the country from day to day. There can be no answer to that charge. Because the Government has sold its assets, it stands condemned for all time in the eyes qf the people of Australia and in the eyes of the peoples of the world. Commonwealth Oil Eefineries Limited, Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, and Trans Australia : Airlines have gone. The Government, before it goes out of office, or before the people have put another nail in its coffin at the forthcoming Senate election, will have completed its programme, and our shipping line will have gone too. How disgraceful! Some Ministers are reported to have said that the Commonwealth ships must be retained on Australian coastal services until existing shipping shortages have been overcome. That is one kite that has been flown. Another is the statement that some Ministers believe that there is likely to be a slump in the Australian coa.stal shipping trade, but, as usual, those Ministers have passed the buck to the wharf labourers, because they have said that if work on the wharfs could be speeded un appreciably-wit h 3,000 wharf labourers out of work!-ther e would be a surplus of shipping on the Anstralian coast. It is the same old story. Our vessels will leave the Australian coast, and the Australian taxpayers and farmers will be left at the mercy of exploiters in the form of the overseas shipping combine. A Labour government pegged shipping freight rates at Where the minimum level in order to protect farmers, who are supposed to be represented by the stockbrokers and other professional men who compose the Australian Country party, but who have not much time for any farmer in the land. We shall be left to the mercy of this overseas shipping combine. I appeal to the Liberals on the other side of the chamber "" What Mr Wrr.soN -What about the young Liberals? some are young.

Let them tell the Government that they will have none of it, and that we must preserve our ships and our shipyards at all costs because they are necessary for our defence. Surely even the honourable member for Darwin( Mr AU honourable members will agree that Luck) will vote against the sale of the Commonwealth shipping line. I see a smirk on the honourable gentleman's face, but I remind the committee that three weeks ago he was imploring the Government to ensure that a ship should run between the mainland and Tasmania at least once a week. What a very weak appeal by a man who represents a portion of the island of Tasmania! If Taroona were removed from the Tasmanian run, practically nothing could be brought from Tasmania to the mainland by sea. If the private shipowners bought the Commonwealth shipping line, freight rates upon the very small quantity of goods that would be brought by sea from Tasmania would be doubled. I ask honourable members from Tasmania and the people of Tasmania to bear that in mind. Will the Government members who represent Tasmanian electorates vote to prevent the people of Tasmania from securing an adequate shipping service? The farmers, apple-growers and potato growers of Tasmania are waiting to see how their representatives in this Parliament will vote upon the proposal to sell the Commonwealth shipping line. If that line be sold, grasping shipping interests assuredly will double freight rates upon goods carried between Tasmania and the mainland. People of Tasmania, accept that warning! [5.34] -We all are grateful that the honourable member for Watson( Mr has established, under the Northern TerriCurtin) has at last awakened to the fact that this country is in danger, and that nioney expended upon defence preparations will not necessarily be wasted. It might be ungenerous to observe that the pure flame of his patriotism burns a little brighter when it is fed by the oil of personal or party interest. But let us he orat.pfu-l for the small mercy that he has awakened to the fact that the country is in peril and that defence expenditure I. should like to refer to a number of points that have been raised by honourable members in this debate, but I shall refer to one only, and that is the position of the Legislative Council for the Northern Territory. we all are in favour of the development of the Northern Territory to the point at which it will become possible to confer upon it full statehood and self-government within the limits of oiir federal system. Honourable members on both sides of the chamber believe in decentralization and democracy. The Government parties and the Opposition do not differ regarding the objective, but differ only with respect to the methods to be used to attain it. I remind the committee of the present legal position in respect of the administration of the Northern Territory. As honourable members are aware, federal authority over tbe Northern Territory derives froin section 122 of the Constitution, whicb reads in partThe Parliament may make laws for the Government of any territory surrendered by any State to and accepted by tlie Commonwealth The Northern Territory comes within the category of territory to which that section refers. It will be noted that the section confers on this Parliament unlimited power in regard to a territory. Therefore this Parliament stands, in relation to the Northern Territory, in the same position as that in which the British Parliament stands in relation to t.he United Kingdom. Its legislative authority over the Northern Territory is absolute and untrammelled. It is a shock(Mackellarl ing paradox, however, that the Parliament has abrogated its-legislative authority and tory Administration Act 1947, which was passed during the regime of a previous government, a state of affairs in which laws embodying that unlimited sovereignty without any constitutional tra.mmei can, in effect, be enacted by the Cabinet without reference to the Parliament and become a part of the body of our legislation without the. Parliament having any authority or",33,Sunday Telegram Service
131,Mr Wentworth,"opportunity to pass judgment on them. That is a shocking state of affairs and it should be altered. The Legislative Council for the Northern Territory consists of fourteen members, who are the Administrator, seven Government nominated members, and six elected members. worth recalling that the Administrator and the seven appointed members hold office "" at the pleasure of the Governor-Generalwhich is a polite way of saying "" at the pleasure of the Cabinet"". In effect, the Cabinet controls eight of the fourteen votes on the council without any reference to this Parliament. Ordinances which the Legislative Council has passed come before the Administrator, who may accept them, disallow them, or reserve them for the Governor General's pleasure. He is required to reserve some kinds of ordinances. But the Administrator is, after all, .only the creature of the Cabinet, by wbich he was appointed. He holds office at its pleasure. After assent has been given to an ordinance it becomes law unless disallowed by the Cabinet should it be so inclined. Once again, the only powei is with the 1 Cabinet and not with tbe Parliament. Honourable members will recall that, under section izEvery ordinance assented to . . . shall, I echo the words that the honourable as soon as may be after being assented to, be laid before each House of the Parliament. It is laid on the table but, under that there were too many public serthis iniquitous act, neither House of the vants appointed by the Government to Parliament has the opportunity to disposts on the Legislative Council. allow it. So we have here the position agree that there may be justification for that any government, acting under powers that were conferred on it by a previous one, two or three public servants to be government, has unlimited power to do appointed as members of that council, what it likes in the Northern Territory. but there is no justification for a It may make any law, confiscate any majority of council members to be public property, and make anybody subject to servants.

The Government should change the method of ment will be recreant to its duty if selection it, does not have this act amended so that Secondly, the honourable member for Mr Wentworth. the despotic' power of the Cabinet in relation to the Northern Territory shall be modified and placed under parliamentary control. It is easy to advance such a proposal without suggesting the machinery whereby it could be accomplished, but It is I shall suggest the nature of that machinery. I suggest that, in place of the provision relating to the disallowance of ordinances by the Governor General, which is contained in section 4.w of the act, we should have a provision under which Northern Territory ordinances shall be on the same footing as are ordinary regulations. In other words, they should be disallowable by either House of the Parliament in the same way as ordinary regulations are disallowed in accordance with the terms of the Acts Interpretation Act. This would restore the authority of the Parliament over the ordinances made in the Northern Territory. Unless we take that action we shall be keeping in abeyance any power of control that the Parliament may still have. I consider this to be an urgent matter. I suggest also that other amendments be put into practice in regard to the Legislative Council for the Northern Territory. member for Farrer( Mr Pairbairn) used in another debate when he said I Every honourable its problems, and have more than the of nominated members. the Northern Territory, whoever he may be at any particular time, should be one of the nominated members of the council. I do not suggest that he be nominated as an extra member but, in order to maintain liaison between this Parliament and the council, it might not be inequitable to embody in the legislation governing the Northern Territory tbe provision that the person whom the residents of the territory have elected to represent them in this Parliament shall be one of the nominated or appointed members of the council. I consider that that would be a step forward. I suggest thirdly that, as the territory approaches maturity, the number of appointed members of the council' should diminish and the number of elected members increase. should do everything that lies within our power to raise the status of the Legispolitical maturity is very often best lative Council for the Northern Territory. The council is, I hope, the nucleus of a State Parliament for the Northern Territory. There are many ways in which its status can be raised. I have already directed attention to some of them. I believe, too, that more of the parliamentary forms should be adopted by the council, and in this connection I commend to honourable members the attitude of the Administrator of the Northern Territory. He is. doing an excellent job, and should be encouraged in every way. We should endeavour , as soon as possible, to establish in the Northern Territory an independent public service that will not be tion. But, above all, I urge that this amenable to Canberra centralization. Such an organization could depend in some measure on the resources of the Commonwealth Public Service, but it should have some degree of autonomy. The authority of the Administrator should be increased. He should have direct control over all Commonwealth departments that function in the Northern Territory. The present situation is farcical. The Department of Works, for example, is responsible not directly to the Administrator, but directly to Canberra. All Commonwealth instrumentalities that operate in the Northern Territory should be brought under the Northern Territory Administration as soon as possible. The present divided control, which stems back to the bureaucracy in Canberra, is not in the best interests either of the territory or of Australia. I believe that by those means and by concurrent ones, we should do everything in our power to raise the status of the Legislative Council for the Northern Territory. There is much discouragement abroad in the territory. People are saying, ""What is the use? The elected representatives on the council are outvoted, and even then its decisions are subject to ministerial veto "". Much of the talk of discouragement is unjustified. One can see how it arises, but I believe that the people of the Northern Territory are being too easily discouraged by their difficulties. A long road may lie ahead before full maturity can be reached, but it would not be out of place to remind the It is important that we people of the Northern Territory, and members of this committee, that full reached by the process of struggle. The history of our Australian institutions shows that. I do not think that the Northern Territory is yet ready or ripe for full self-government. It will show its readiness very largely by the force of its own struggle towards self-government. However, I believe-and I am sure that in this I have the support of all honourable members-that we should encourage this maturity as far as lies within our power, and that, as soon as possible, we should confer full statehood on the Northern Territory. In the meantime, we should be taking progressive steps in that direcParliament assert its authority over the Executive and take from the Cabinet the despotic power that it holds over life and death in the Territory. That power was conferred upon the Executive not by this Government, but by the preceding Labour Government. I do not believe that the present Administration would abuse that power but I do believe that the time to act is now. Amending legislation on the lines that I have indicated should be introduced. Mr W. M. BOURKE (Fawkner) [5.49] -Most members of this committee will agree that three great problems face Australia to-day. The first is inflation which, unfortunately, is still galloping; the second is unemployment. wliicli is emerging in our midst; and the third is the decline of primary production. AlthoughI represent a city electorate and so have no favours to seek from primary producers, I wish to deal to-day mainly with the problem of declining primary production. Nothing could he more important to the people of Australia than to ascertain the cause of that decline, and to determine what can be done to arrest it. A survey of Australia's economic needs, and of this country's future, shows clearly that at no time in our history was an upward trend in primary production more desirable than it is to-day. Our population is ir rowing at the rate of 3 per cent, per annum. Perhaps that increase will not he maintained, nevertheless, the demand of our own population for food is increasing, and I think it can be truly said that the Australian people have -averted food rationing in peace-time during the last few years only by eating into the food surpluses which previously were exported. Those surpluses are falling alarmingly, and adverse seasons might well mean that this great country would have to introduce food rationing in peacetime. In addition to satisfying the food requirements of our own population, we liave a responsibility also to send food to our kinsfolk in Great Britain. It would also be very comforting to know that we were sending some of our exportable food surplus to the starving peoples of Asia. Whilst such a contribution might not be very large, it would be worthwhile, and would do something to assist to raise the deplorably low living standards of these unfortunate people. It is becoming increasingly clear that Australia depends upon its exports to maintain its living standard. We are justifiably proud of the standard of living that we have built up in this country over the years but we are now confronted by the stark reality that, if v/e are to continue to enjoy that standard, we must not merely maintain, but increase substantially our export trade to pay for essential imports. We have to import capital goods. We need heavy developmental equipment. many thousands of immigrants to this country. developmental programmes are to conMr W. M. Bourke. tinue, we must maintain our imports of capital goods, and we can do that only if we export goods in sufficient quantities to pay for them. We also import raw materials for essential secondary industries. I am sure that most honourable members havo industries in their electorates which have been badly hit by the import restrictions. If the flow of raw materials for industry into this country is to be maintained, we must expand our exports to pay for them. In addition, we are bringing to Australia many commodities that are not procurable here, including petrol, tea, coffee, rubber, and so on. If we are to continue these imports we shall have to bolster our export trade. The crucial question that arises is: What goods can we export in order to provide overseas funds for the purchase of the imports whicli we need to maintain our standard of living? I do not believe that there can be much controversy on that point. Primary products constitute the great bulk of the commodities we export in ordor to establish overseas credits with whicli to finance imports. If we are to maintain our standard of living, we must, encourage our primary industries to increase considerably the production of exportable commodities. The latest figures that 1 have seen in relation to our export income reveal that in 1950-5-1 rural products accounted for 90 j>er cent, of our export income and that only 3.4 por cent, of it was derived from manufactured ' goods. There seems to be very little scope for increasing our export income by expanding the volume of the output of our secondary industries. Tn Europe, with industrialized Germany again resurgent, in Asia and the Far East, with Japan rapidly becoming a serious competitor again, and with the huge secondary production of the United States of America there seems to be little prospect of increasing our exports of secondary products. Wc have beeu forced to the conclusion that if our standard of living is to be maintained we must stimulate our primary export industries. Thefiguresrelating to the decline We are bringing of rural production that has taken place are well known to all honourable member.::, If our immigration and but some of them are worth repeating. Compared with, pre-war figures, in 1951-52 our exports of butter declined by 89 per cent., dried vine fruits by 23 per cent., beef by 54 per cent., mutton by 75 per cent., lamb by 82 per cent, and pork by 83 per cent. Our wheat acreage has been considerably reduced, and our slieep population and wool production. have shown very little increase over the comparative figures of the 'thirties. The startling evidence of an alarming decline of our primary industries poses two questions: First, why have our primary industries declined, and, secondly, what are we to do, not merely to arrest the decline, but also to restore and exceed the former level of production? of the Government. Mr W. M. BOURKE -The more we analyse the problem the more are we forced to the conclusion that the honourable member has correctly stated its solution. I do not propose to state the reasons for the decline in detail beyond saying that there is little doubt that, in the post-war years, too great emphasis was placed upon the development of our secondary industries. All of us believe that a sound and well balanced economy must include primary, secondary and tertiary industries. Because, during the war, the importance of our secondary industries was over-emphasized, primary industries were denied tbeir share of essential requirements, secondary industries nourished and primary industries declined. Our rural industries are in a position somewhat analogous to that of our railways and other transport systems. They are run down. Since the war insufficient capital aaid equipment have been provided for them. Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. Mr W. M . BOURKE -What action will be established and tens of thousands has this Government taken to achieve of land-hungry young men will be able to essential expansion of primary producbecome farmers in their own right. tion?

The honourable memfor an increase of primary production by ber's time has expired. 20 per cent. My only comment on that matter is that the time for talk speech to the committee, the honourable is long past. Now we need action. member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde The only other action taken by the Government has been to announce a few piffling tax concessions for primary producers. In doing so, it has merely extended in a small way the tax concessions that have been written into the income tax laws for years, under which primary producers are allowed certain capital expenditure items as deductions for taxation purposes. Those concessions apply to established primary producers and in my opinion they will not make any real contribution to the great problem of primary production. On the land, as in secondary industries, monopoly is being developed in Australia. Established farmers are buying the land next to tbem and statistics show that there are now fewer farmers in Australia than formerly, although the average size of farms is increasing. That development is contributing to the decline of primary production. What is the real solution? It appears to be obvious. But it has escaped the attention of the Government. Surely if we desire to produce more foodstuffs and expand our exports, we must get more farmers on the land. Australia has the necessary land available and we have the technologicalresourcesthat are necessary to put men on to farms. About 25 per cent, of the land mass of Australia is suitable for cultivation and intensive pastoral activity. Experts estimate that about 150,000,000 acres could be used for primary production. Much of it is scrub land at present. Surely the big task for Australia is to clear that land and establish thousands of new settlers upon it. Therein lies the solution of two problems -the increase of the nation's exportable surplus of primary products and the incipient problem of unemployment. We need a vigorous movement back to the land.

133,Mr Hulme (Petrie) [8.4],"In hisCameron) endeavoured to make political capital from the great problem of pensions, both age and invalid. His first suggestion was that the pensions should be related to the basic wage. If that matter is examined fairly closely, the Labour party does not appear in very good light. In 1941 when the Curtin Government was elected to office, the pension was related to the basic wage, but in 1943 the same Labour Government abolished that relationship. the pension rate. dealing with matters of principle, and if the principle is good enough to-day, it should have been good enough in 1943 when it was abolished by the Curtin Government. How is the basis of the basic wage reached by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court? In 1907, the Harvester award came into force. Under that award, the basic wage was related to the needs of a man, his wife and three children. In 1934 the Oommonwealth Arbitration Court announced that it would alter the basis to that which each industry could afford to pay, but it was made clear by the eourt at the same time that it would not disregard family responsibility. Speaking on this subject in 1941 Judge Beeby saidThe Court has always conceded the needs of an average family should he kept in mind in fixing a basic wage. Buti t has never, as the result of its own inquiry, specifically declared what is an average family or what is the cost of a regimen of food, clothing, shelter and miscellaneous items necessary to maintain it in frugal comfort or that a basic 1 wage should give effect to any such finding, tn the end, economic possibilities bave always payers, so that the major burden of penbeen the determining factor. . . . What should be sought is the independent ascertainment expenses, falls upon persons in the ment and prescription of the highest basic wage that can be sustained by tbe total of industry, in all its primary, secondary and ancillary forms. That no doubt is the object, but the adoption of something like the real average family as the unit to be provided for is not without its use in ' the attainment of that object. There is no clear means of measuring the general wage paying capacity of the total industry of a country. All that can be done is to approximate, and one of the methods of approximation is to find out the actual wage upon which well situated labourers are at the time maintaining the average family unit. An examination of the court's determinations reveals that not long after the war ceased there was a 7s. a week prosperity rise in wages. That was granted when wage controls were lifted. In 1950 an increase of about £1 was granted. I submit that those increases in wages had nothing to do with the family unit but they were associated with the ability of industry to pay. Pensioners do not have the same responsibility as families in relation to clothing, fares and all the other needs of a. family man. I believe also that in relation to pensions we have to take into consideration the ability of the community to pay. Therefore, it is desirable that the committee should examine certain statistics in relation to this matter. In 1933 there were 256,000 pensioners in Australia and there were 2,600,000 people working to earn an income. The proportion was almost one pensioner to every ten workers. In 1950, eighteen years later, there were 413,000 pensioners and the work force was 3,400,000. A t that point of time, the pensioners represented one in every nine workers. Those who have studied statistics will realize that the tendency in that direction has been evident for many years. The number of pensioners in relation to the number of workers employed in the community is gradually increasing. That means that fewer and fewer people can be called upon to meet pension costs. According to the report of the Commissioner of Taxation in 1946-47, which is the last year for which figures are available, of the total number of taxpayers, 1,800,000 earned taxable incomes of less than £1,000 a year. That represents almost 99 per cent, of the total number of taxsions, as well as of all other governreceipt of taxable incomes of less than £1,000. Tn view of that, I seriously raise the question whether the community can really afford to pay more in pensions, having regard to other inescapable commitments. The present age pension of £3 7s. 6d. a week represents £6 15s. a week for a married couple, and each pensioner has the right to earn an additional 30s. a week. As has been pointed out, the total income receivable",38,Sunday Telegram Service

I believe that pensioners are realists, which most honourable members opposite are not. It is only necessary to point out that when the Labour party in 1951 offered thepensioners an extra 10s. a week to vote for it, the pensioners did not swallow the bait. They remembered what happened in 1949, when the Chifley Government refused to increase pensions although the cost of living had increased by 11 per cent. promised to increase pensions. has been making promises for years, but has not honoured them. ""When we consider the provision made for pensioners in the way of health services, medical benefits, pharmaceutical benefits, &c, it is evident that they have every reason to be satisfied with what has been done for them by the present Government, which has increased pensions by 65 per cent, since it came into office in 1949. Of course, it would be desirable to increase pensions still further if that were possible, but it is not possible, as the pensioners them^ selves realize. The only way in which to deal effectively with the problem is to abolish the means test, as the present Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) proposed in his policy speech in 1949. I hope that the Government will not delay the introduction of a contributory system under which there would be no means test, and every person upon attaining the age of 65, would have the right to draw a pension. ford-Smith) [S.151 I intend to refer to the proposal of the Government to dispose of the assets of the Commonwealth Handling Equipment Pool. This proposal has been discussed a great deal in. Sydney, and many persons are interesting themselves in the nmtter. r28] a pensioner couple compares Apparently, the Government proposes to sell the assets by stealth, because no .one knew anything of its intentions until the proposal was revealed in the Daily Telegraph last week. If the Government puts its proposal into effect it will act contrary to its announced policy of promoting efficiency on the waterfront, and strike a blow at security and the well-being of the defence forces. Moreover, it will repudiate its responsibility to the ex-servicemen, who represent more than 75 per cent, of the-300 men employed in the handling pool. Many of these men are suffering from war disabilities for which they receive pensions. They were trained during rehabilitation .courses to do the work upon which they are engaged, and tliey have been taught how to take their place in the economic life of the community. They have been working for the Army, Navy and A i r Eorce, as well as for private firms. Many big private firms which operate on the waterfront find that, from time to time, they lack special equipment for cargo handling, and they are able to hire the equipment they need, together with trained oj)erators, from the handling pool. This arrangement makes for efficient and economical handling of cargo. The pool was constituted in its present form in 1948, having grown out of the Allied Materials Standing Committee, which came into being in 1943 at the suggestion of the then Prime Minister, with the concurrence of General MacArthur. Its function was to assemble and operate machinery needed for the handling of cargoes on behalf of the defence forces. This is the pool which, according to a recent statement of the Minister for Supply( Mr Beale), is.to be disposed of. At the present time the pool has 300 employees, approximately 75 per cent, of whom, are ex-servicemen. It has shown a profit on its operations since 1948. Only recently, in New South Wales, it acquired more commodious premises at Leichhardt. Previously it had been accommodated in an unsatisfactory position at Balmain.

140,Mr Gordon Anderson (Kings,"elsewhere. In some instances it would beuneconomical for those organizations to buy machinery which might be required for a specinc purpose and for a relatively short space of time. I wish to refer honourable members to the report on the turn-round of ships in Australian ports, recently compiled by Mr Henry Basten, in tbe course of which the author states that I t is desirable that stevedoring companies such as this and Commonwealth which are large enough in their operation to own these tools should do so. A t the same time, it is true that mechanical handling equipment calls for a good deal of maintenance and only stevedoring companies of some substance can afford to own and maintain it . . . The sensible arrangment is for the companies to own a reasonable amount of equipment and for a pool of equipment to bo maintained from which thcy can hire their additional requirements. I have read that passage from the report in order to support my contention that 'it is essential that there should be a pool of heavy equipment which can be called upon by organizations wbich desire to use it and which do not possess such equipment. Mr Basten states that he is not prepared to recommend whether the pool should be operated by a company established for the purpose, or by some other means. As far as the waterfront is concerned, he is of the opinion that it is important only that there should be efficient pools in the ports. The pool is providing a valuable ser-' vice to many large industrial undertakings in Sydney to-day by providing equipment for landing, stacking and loading cargoes. The fact that such equipment is readily available renders the handling of cargoes much more expeditious. I hope that honourable members who are ex-rservicemen will endeavour t.o prevent the Government from disposing of this equipment. I point out that a number of ex-servicemen who were physically incapacitated during World War II. were trained by this organization to operate and maintain the equipment and have thus become specialists in that work. If the equipment held in the pool is sold, those men will be thrown out of employment. gency arise in the future, the government of the day would have readily available n most valuable asset if this equipment is retained. Mr Gordon Anderson. the proposed disposal of the equipment amounts to a wanton disregard of the public interest. Its sale will endanger the defence potential of Australia and will amount to yet another act of betrayal by this Government of its pledges to tbe people to safeguard the interests of ex-servicemen and to maintain employment. It seems that the Government is eager to dispose of undertakings Oil Refineries Limited in order to get its hands on some ready cash. In my opinion such a policy is against the bast interests of Australia. I wish to address myself to the Estimates covering the Department of Commerce and Agriculture. I hope that my remarks will be factual and of some value to the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr W. M . Bourke) and to other honourable members who have expressed, perhaps for the first time, concern at the decline of our primary industries. Largely because the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr McEwen) will have to face and resolve the problem that confronts the wheat industry with the termination of the present political subterfuge that is so frequently and erroneously referred to as the wheat stabilization scheme, I wish to refer to that political subterfuge and to relate its history to the committee. The matter is of the greatest importance, not only to the wheat industry but also to cereal agriculture generally in our country. This political subterfuge was devised by an interdepartmental committee set up by the socialist government and was designed to deprive the producers of the export parity value of their products. No other political subterfuge has ever succeeded quite so well. The inter-departmental committee included gentlemen from the Treasury, prices authorities and gentlemen from the Department of Post-war Eeconstruction and the Department of Commerce and Agriculture. At their first Should a national emermeeting they agreed that it would be fundamentally wrong for the wheat growers to receive any advantage from the rising export parity price. They In my opinion, said-and it is reported in the minutes of",40,Sunday Telegram Service
141,Mr Roberton (Eiverina) [8.27],"the proceedings-that if the growers received an advantage from the rising export parity price in 1945 they would only spend it. They said the producers would discharge their debts, they would improve their properties, buy more land, establish their sons on additional properties, expand their production and repeat all the mistakes of the past. In order to avoid those happenings, this inter-departmental committee, taking its directions from the socialist government, devised a wheat stabilization scheme, or an instrument that is called a wheat -stabilization scheme, for the specific purpose of depriving the industry of the advantages that would come to it naturally from any increase of export parity. The original proposal provided for a stabilized price for wheat of 4s. Sd. a bushel f.o.b. ports. The export parity price at that time was 10s. GA. a bushel f.o.b. It provided for the stabilized price to be paid for a five-year period during which the export parity price of wheat could reasonably be expected to be above tbe guaranteed price. That fact in itself should have exposed this subterfuge. Of what value was a scheme that guaranteed a price which was half the value of the commodity and which confined the operation of the scheme to that period of years when the export parity price was likely to remain consistently above the guaranteed price? In order to protect the Treasury further, it was provided that all ?ales in excess of the guaranteed price should be shared equally between the producers and the stabilization fund, up to a limit of 2s. 2d. a bushel when contributions would cease and the ful l realization in excess of the guaranteed price would go to the growers. From that point the scheme became an equalization scheme with the socialist government calling the tune and the wheat-growers paying the piper. It has remained an' equalization scheme ever since. The scheme provided for the unbridled selling of wheat by ministerial direction at prices that did not approach the true market value of the commodity. In that way the growers have been involved in cash losses that have exceeded £250,000,000 in seven years. That subterfuge is still called a wheat stabilization scheme. Can anything he more absurd ? Let me state the actual losses that have been suffered by the industry and the nation. In 1945-46, the year in which the scheme was introduced, when the average export parity price for wheat was 10s. 6.5d. a bushel, the growers were required to sell no less than 59,400,000 bushels of wheat at 4s. 7.5d. a bushel through No. 9 pool, a. loss of 5s. Ud. a bushel which totalled £17,572,600 in that year. They called it ""stabilization"""", l n 1946-47, when the average export price of wheat was 15s. S.ld. a bushel the growers were required to sell 5S,200,000 bushels through No. 10 pool at 5s. 0.5d. a bushel, a loss of 10s. 7.6d. a bushel or £30,859,000 iu one year. In 1947-4S, when No. 11 pool operated and the' average export parity price for wheat was 173. 11.6d. a bushel, the growers were required to sell 38,500,000 bushels of wheat at 6s. 2.3d. a bushel, a loss to the valiant men and women who grew wheat in that year of Us. 9.4rl. a bushel or £34,966,000. During the operation of the No. 12 pool in 1.948-49, when the average export parity price of wheat was 13s. 0.4d. a bushel, the growers were required to sell 61,300,000 bushels at 6s. 7.7d. a bushel, a loss of 6s. 4.7d. a bushel or £19,590,000 in that year. Again, they called it ""stabilization'. In 1949-50, during the currency of No. 13 pool, when the average export parity price of wheat was 18s. 9.4d. a bushel, the growers were forced by means of this subterfuge to sell 62,000,000 bushels at 7s. Id. a bushel, a loss of Us. S.4d. a. bushel of £34,203,000. Tn 1950-51, which was covered by the No. 14 pool and when the export parity price averaged ISs 6d. a bushel, the growers were, required to sell 69,300,000 bushels at 7s. lOd. a bushel, a loss of 10s. Sd. a bushel, or £36,960,000. During the year 1951-52, when No. 15 pool operated, the average export parity price of wheat was 21s. 6.3d. a bushel, but the growers were forced to sell 63,400,000 bushels at 12s. 6d. a bushel, a loss of 9s. a.bushel.' I am sure that that has been the cause of the fall in wheat production. A total of £28,530,000 was lost by the growers during 1951-52. And they still call it "" stabilization "". During the last seven years these cash losses by the growers and the nation have reached tlie staggering total of £202,680,000. This loss has heen inflicted on a handful of people who have gone out into the arable areas of this country and brought them into production. The International Wheat Agreement which was designed to reduce export parity prices as a measure of practical aid to a war ravaged world has been made an exclusive charge on these men and women and has involved them in cash losses exceeding £50,000,000. In all the other exporting countries the losses incidental to that agreement were made a charge against the entire community but in this country they were inflicted on this isolated group of people. The difference can only be explained in terms of morality and immorality. I have one admission to make. The originally proposed price was not allowed to remain at 4s. 8d. a bushel, largely because of the advocacy of the organization that I myself had the honour to lead at the time and the advocacy of the people in Western Australia. Against the socialist government's inclinations the price was increased from 4s. Sd. a bushel to 5s. 2d. a bushel when the export parity average was 10s. 6d. a bushel. The price is now 10s. a bushel, which is Us. 6.3d. a bushel less than the export parity average, and that price is due for adjustment in December. NowI have another confession to make. The subterfuge, called the wheat stabilization scheme, was accepted' by a majority of the growers in spite of all my exhortations. However, in extenuation of my failure I should say that the credulous wheat-growers of the Commonwealth were terrified, into acceptance of an arbitrary price by the prediction of catastrophic falls in wheat prices, when at the time the prophecies were made wheat prices were rising from their low pre-war level and beginning to give some indication of the fantastic heights that tbey have reached in the last few years. Wheat-growers were compelled to accept tbe proposed price because the Labour Government threatened that it would impose an export licence system unless the industry agreed to its socialist ideas. Tbe wheat-growers approved of the plan, which was a mere political subterfuge. The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Ifr. Roberton. honourable member for Riverina( Mr Roberton) has just completed a tirade against the previous Labour Government's administration of the Australian wheat industry. I shall deal with that matter first, and later I shall consider the matter of social services. At the beginning of the last war the first Menzies Government acquired tlie whole wheat crop of Australia and continued its control of the wheat industry until it was defeated. When the Labour Government assumed control in 1941, the country was strewn with bankrupt and insolvent farmers who had been driven into that unfortunate state by the administration of the anti-Labour government. After ten years of non-Labour control the best price that the then government had been able to get the farmer for his wheat was about ls. 10-Jd. a bushel. In 1941 the Labour Government gave wheat-farmers a guaranteed price for a certain period of years, and for the first time in their lives those primary producers enjoyed a reasonable return for their labour. The farmers of this country will not be hoodwinked by the specious arguments of the honourable member for Riverina that they have been unjustly treated by a previous Labour government. When that government was in office the primary products cost structure was substantially stable, and farmers were able to sell their commodities at a price which would ensure a substantial and reasonable profit. When the present Government assumed office in 1949 the cost structure commenced to get out of hand. Since then it has gone from bad to worse, and at present the industry is completely unstable. The cost structure is fantastically high, and that is solely attributable to the administration of the present Government. If the international price of wheat were to collapse, its affect on Australian wheat farmers would be catastrophic because of the high cost structure that has been built up by this Government. I remind honourable members' that the history of the wheat industry right throughout the world has been that high prices have caused a surplus of wheat to be produced within a short period, and that that surplus has caused the collapse of wheat prices to a level much below normal. If",41,Sunday Telegram Service
142,Mr Clark (Darling) [8.43],"Thethat should happen our wheat-farmers would very quickly become bankrupt because their returns would not cover their high costs. At about the time. I first entered this Parliament in 1934 an investigation was made into the condition of the wheat industry. The investigating body's report showed that the chief cost in the production of wheat was the interest on loans paid by the farmers. I remind honourable members that the interest that they pay now is much greater than it was in those days. If the market for wheat again becomes restricted and the price fell, the primary producer would find that his interest bill eating up all his profits. Indeed, it would become the most difficult factor with which he would have to contend. Another factor in the cost of production of wheat is the cost of ""land. At present primary producers are paying highly inflated prices for land. If they should be faced with lower prices at some time in the future because of international circumstances, not only would tbey have to contend with inflated interest bills but' they would also have to continue to pay instalments on the inflated cost of their land. farmers realize that the Labour party is the only political party that has ever tried to establish a stable market for their products over a period of years, and is the only party that has ever given security to the primary producers. I suggest that primary producers want a. continuing stable market; not a market of inflated prices to-day and a market of deflated prices to-morrow. In other words, the farmers want security and not insolvency. I draw the attention of honourable members to the entirely inadequate, amount that is paid by this Government to age pensioners. Age pensioners have paid, during their working lives, considerable amounts into the coffers of the Government by way of taxation, direct and indirect. In return for that they are entitled, at the age of 60 for women and 65 for men, to a reasonable age pension. It is foolish to say that the age pension is not on a contributory basis because there are two methods by which contributions can be made for pensions. The first method is to charge each person so much a head during his working life. That is the method that the present Government desires to adopt so that rich and poor will pay the same amount for their pensions: The Labour party believes in the second method which is the only just method. That is to contribute to pensions by way of taxation on a sliding scale according to ability to pay. I suggest that it certainly cannot be said that age pensioners have not paid for their pensions. The Government should increase age pensions by more than the miserable amount that the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Padden) has proposed. In fact, the Government should grant increases commensurate with the increases that have been made in the basic wage. There is no doubt that age pensions, and, indeed, all pensions, have lost considerable value because of the great increases that have taken place, particularly in the last twelve months, in the basic wage. '.rhe honourable member for Petrie( Mr Hulme) said that a Labour government altered the system under which age pensions increased or decreased according to the increase or decrease of the cost of The living. I inform honourable members that that was done at the request of pensioners themselves. For a considerable time they had enjoyed pensions that increased when the cost of living increased and decreased when the cost of living decreased, but on one occasion when the cost of living decreased by about 6d. a week the pensioners asked the then Government to alter the provision that the pension should rise or fall with.the cost of living. The Government complied with their request. It is unfortunate that the request was acceded to because that small decrease of the cost of living was followed by consistent increases. Repeated requests have been made, through me, to the Govern_ ment to restore the link with the cost of living, and I urge again that the Government should give immediate consideration to that request and allow the basis of pensions once more so that it could be linked with the rise and fall of the cost of living. The Government has declared that it will abolish the means test. I have before me an advertisement that was issued on the 10th November, 1949. It is embellished with, a very striking photograph of the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies), and it is headed ""Answers to questions women everywhere are asking "". It is true to say that to-day questions are being asked everywhere, not only by women but also by men, about the inadequacy of age and invalid pensions. One of the questions asked in this advertisement wasWill your Government maintain social services ? The reply wasNot only will we maintain and increase tlieir value, but we will remove present injustices arising from the means test. But nothing has been done to alter the means test! A Labour government fixed 30s. a week as the permissible income under the means test, and that rate has never been increased. This Government has decided to abolish the land tax, which will involve a remission to the wealthy section of the community amounting to £6,500,000 annually. The Ministerf o r Social Services has said that, if £6,000,000 were added to the pension fund , the permissible income level could be raised to £3 a week. The point of my argument is that the Government has not carried out its definite election promise to abolish the means test but has given a concession worth £6,500,000 a year to the wealthy members of the community and that, if that amount had been pro-: vided for the benefit of age and invalid pensioners, the permissible income could have been raised to twice the present l i m it . referred. It was a misleading statement Additional concessions should be granted to the pensioners because of the high cost of living. I have received scores of letters which contain appeals by pensioners for increased payments in order to help them to meet the exceptional costs that prevail to-day. Many of these pensioners have pointed out that they are almost destitute and are unable to provide themselves with adequate food, clothing and shelter. The Government's continued neglect of this section of the community is disgraceful. Another injustice is perpetrated the present system of applying the means test to invalid families. invalid pensioner who goes to work as the family breadwinner Mr Clark. account in assessing the invalid husband's eligibility for pension. The pension of an invalid should not be reduced when his wife is working in order to relieve the financial distress of her family, at least until her earnings reach the level of the basic wage. I have taken up with the Postal Department the case of a woman in my electorate who is working in a post office in order that she may maintain her husband and three or four children. The husband is debarred from receiving the invalid pension on account of her earnings. The woman was threatened with the sack under the Government's staff reduction policy. I have been informed this week that the department now has decided generously to classify "" her as a single person so that she will not be dismissed at once but w i ll be allowed to work unti l the 21st September. The best that the department can do apparently is to allow this family breadwinner to retain her job for an extra month! That sort of grievous injustice is typical of the administration of social services under this Government. The Government's policy should be reviewed immediately with the object of increasing pension rates because the pensioners have earned the right during their active lives to a measure of justice in their old age and infirmity. Many other glowing promises were made on behalf of the present Government parties in the election advertisement to which I have yet it probably helped them to gain power. The promise in relation to the cost of livin g is of particular interest. The advertisement included this questionWill you be able to reduce the cost of living ? The answer wasWe regard it as one of our first responsibilities to increase the purchasinfr power of the Australian £1, to increase production and thus bring prices down. But production has been decreasing since under this Government has been in office! Australia's output of foodstuffs has never pensioners and their been mare unsatisfactory. Our exports The income of the wife of an are dwindling and, for that reason, we have been embarrassed by the dissipation is taken into of our overseas balances. Severe shortages of many commodities have occurred, and we are able to satisfy demands for home consumption only by denying exports to overseas consumers. This is the direct result of the Government's unsound economic policy. The proposed vote for the Department of Territories is under consideration in the group of Estimates at present before the conimittee. I was shocked to learn that the Government proposed to extend the leases of certain pastoral interests tory. It will do a great disservice to Australia if it extends the leases of poor producers as well as those of the efficient producers. The Northern Territory is potentially rich, agriculturally, but much of the land in the great pastoral holdings is not being used in the interests of the people. Any extension of the tenure of inefficient lessees w ill be an utter disgrace to the Government. I have been informed that an area of between 1,500,000 and 2,000,000 acres in the Nortliern Territory is capable of producing rice as good as any rice that can be grown in the eastern region of Australia. That land will be wasted if it is to be tied up in pastoral holdings. The DEPUTYCHAIEMAN Order ! The honourable member's time has expired. for Supply) [ 8 . 5 7 ] I should like to reply to some of what I might euphemistically describe as the rubbish that has just been uttered by the honourable member for Darling( Mr Clark). However, 1 have risen for the specific purpose of replying to the statements made by the lionorable member for Kingsford-Smith( Mr Gordon Anderson) about the Commonwealth Equipment Handling Pool. One would gather, from the honourable gentleman's remarks from the platform of his ignorance, that the Government was wickedly disposing of a valuable asset to the detriment of the people, probably at bucket-shop prices and generally in such a way as to reduce the efficiency of the port handling facilities of Australia. In the first place, I point out to honourable members that the Commonwealth Equipment Handling Pool is a collection of machinery with a replacement value of between £2,000,000 and £3,000,000. It is owned by the' Commonwealth and is either operated by the Commonwealth or, more usually, let out by the Commonwealth to various instrumentalities, chiciiy for the purpose of moving cargo on wharfs but also for the purpose of shifting heavy cargoes throughout the country. The pool includes for k l i ft trucks worth the better part of £1,000,000, tow motors worth £130,000, light wharf cranes worth more than £360,000, trucks and self-propelled e-ranes worth £420,000 and crawler trains worth £660,000. in the Northern TerriOther equipment brings the replacement value of the machinery in 'the pool to a total of between £2,000,000 and £3,000,000. This equipment, which constitutes the Commonwealth Equipment Handling Pool, is scattered throughout Australia, but is located chiefly in the ports of Sydney and Melbourne. It is not without significance that approximately 380 employees are operating this machinery at the present time, and no fewer than 150 salaried officers are performing the administrative work. Honourable members will be able to gauge the sort of organization that requires 150 salaried officers to do the work of administration in a concern whicli employs 380 machinery operators. Minister who is in charge of the organization. tration that occurred under a Labour government, which permitted this fantastic situation to remain unaltered year after year. This Government, when it came into office, had the matter carefully examined, and came to the conclusion that the only criterion to be followed was the best way in which this enormous quantity of valuable machinery could be operated in order to speed up the turn-round of ships and facilitate the moving of heavy cargo and materials throughout Australia. The proposition which is apparently advanced by the honourable member for Kingsford Smith is that, no matter, how high the overhead costs for administration may be, the organization must be conducted by the Government.

The honourable member criticizes us because we propose that the work of moving cargo and materials should be undertaken by a body other than the Government. We considered that an establishment of 150 administrative officers for 380 men was just too silly to contemplate, because efficiency must be the criterion. ment has contemplated that position for nearly three years. ment is careful, in such matters, to make proper inquiries, and does not rush into things in a doctrinaire and foolish way. The Government makes a proper examination of a position with a view to determining whether a certain course of action will be in the best interests of the Commonwealth as a whole. We asked ourselves in this matter whether the organization could be conducted as efficiently, or more efficiently, by private machinery and equipment should be enterprise. clusion that the disposal of the assets in the right quarters throughout Australia, at the right prices, would produce a quicker turn-round of ships and a more efficient movement of cargoes and materials. Therefore, we decided that, when the prices and the buyers were right, we would dispose of those assets. for Ballarat( Mr Joshua) is a doctrinaire socialist who does not mind whether an organization is run efficiently so long as it is conducted by the Government. He believes that an organization, no matter whether it is bankrupt, must be run by the civil service. When I make that statement, I do not suggest that the Commonwealth Equipment Handling Pool is bankrupt. However, the Government considers that the proper question to be askeci in such a matter is, ""Who can run the organization most efficiently and cheaply, and produce the best results?"". think can produce the best results? I know perfectly well that the organization can be conducted more efficiently by private enterprise. In the circumstances, the Government decided to sell the assets to those bodies that would use them to the best advantage. We found that the Maritime Services Board of New South Wales could use a vast quantity of the machinery. That authority is a State government instrumentality and, as such, should commend itself to Opposition members although I have no doubt that it will not be so, because the sole purpose of the Opposition is to ensure that the Oommonwealth will not part with the assets. We also found that the Harbour Trust Commissioners in Melbourne were not only able, but also willing, to take a substantial quantity of the machinery, and operate it efficiently. We had no doubt that, when the proper ai rangements were made, there were many other organizations in the main ports of Australia which could make efficient nse of the machinery and equipment. Accordingly, we decided that the We came to the conmade available, in the first place, to those bodies which would use it to the best advantage. That is the sole test. the friends of the Government.

155,Mr Beale,"The Government willbeen satisfied, tlie remainder of the machinery and equipment will he made available to corporations and others who can use it efficiently. I close on this note. It is only a matter of whether we can get a quicker turn-round of ships, and whether cargoes and materials may be moved more efficiently than in the past. The honourable member for Kingsford-Smith complained that, as the result of the Government's decision to dispose of the assets, men would be thrown out of work. I inform tlie honourable gentleman that the sale of the assets does not necessarily mean that men. will become unemployed. The Maritime Services Board of New South Wales, if it acquires some of this machinery, will need men to operate it, and, no doubt, efficient' men who are a't present engaged by Handling Pool will be first in line for employment. The honourable member for Kingsford-Smith evidently considers that the Government should not sell the machinery and equipment under any conditions. He believes that the Government should not, in. any circumstances, make any changes for the purpose of increasing the efficiency of an organization. If those are his propositions, I , for one, do not agree with them, and. I believe that the taxpayers of Australia will not accept his view of the position. Loss of employment need not be a factor in this matter. The question which honourable gentlemen should ask themselves is whether we want this great mass of valuable machinery to be used efficiently. The Government believes, after mature consideration, that the proposals we have in mind will result in a. cheaper and quicker turn-round of ships, and a more efficient movement of materials. in the brief time at my disposal, to refer to the administration of the Department of Social Services, and particularly to the means test that is applicable to various categories of pensions. My remarks will be directed chiefly to Government policy on those matters. I mention, in passing, that the Minister for Social Services( Mr Townley) informed the chamber last week, when these matters arose, that I apparently had deliberately attempted to misrepresent the position. He read certain extracts from the policy speech delivered by the present Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) during the general election campaign in 1949, and he was good enough to provide me with a copy of that speech, lest my memory was not so reliable as it might be. I propose to read a brief passage from that policy speech, not with reference to the discussion last week, but with reference to the administration of social services. The present Prime Minister made the following statement in 1949 :Wc desire, however, to adjust anomalies . I_ have referred to, and to make such mollifications in the means test as we find possible pending a contributory scheme. This great human problem will have our urgent attention, the Commonwealth Equipment as a matter of priority. Earlier this evening, the honourable member for Darling( Mr Clark) read extracts from advertisements which had been publisbed on behalf of the Liberal party during the general election campaign in 1949 with specific reference to the means test. The Minister for Social Services informed us that the Government's social services plan, which, incidentally, was to be introduced in 1952, had been prepared. I. am wondering whether it will be implemented this year. ""Provision is made in the Estimates for increases of pensions of various kinds, but I have searched in vain in the Estimates, in the budget speech of the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) and in the legislation contingent on the budget for any hint of a proposal to liberalize the means test. That is why I have referred to the subject at this juncture. Cabinet is continuing, unashamedly, to ignore the promises that the Government parties made to the people during the"" last general election campaign. I shall cite a case, which is typical, to 'show how the social services scheme is operating at present and how the Government proposes to continue to operate it. I refer to the case of a service pensioner whose wife receives an age pension, the two rates of pension being equal. Figures that have been supplied to me by officers of the Department of Social Services show that the maximum amount of war pension, service pension and age pension",47,Sunday Telegram Service
156,Mr Bryson (Wills) [9.6],"I desire,payable in respect of a man and. his wife is £377 per annum. As the total war pension received by this couple amounts to £104 Os. 5d. per annum, the balance of £272 19s. 7d. represents the total pension payable to them, and when this amount is halved, the result is a sum of £136 4s. 9d. per annum, or 104s. 9d. a fortnight, being paid in respect of the husband's service pension and a similar snm in respect of the wife's age pension. figures it is clear that, because the husband and wife are receiving a service pension of £104 Os. 5d. per annum, between them the service pension and the age pension payable in respect of both of them has been reduced by 15s. 3d. a fortnight. That is the effect of the imposition of the ceiling of £377 peiannum. I am aware that the Government proposes to alleviate the position of pensioners in similar circumstances by raising tlie ceiling rate to £416 per annum, or an increase of £39 per annum. That increase is equivalent to an increase of 7s. 6d. a week in respect of both the age pension and the service pension. Thus, under tbe Government's new proposal, this couple will receive by way of pension an amount that is 15s. 3d. a fortnight less than tbe full rate of age pension. Tbey will remain in the position in which they find themselves at present. In addition, the Government proposes to increase tbe genera] rate of service pension by 10s. a week whilst partial pensions will be increased proportionately. pension of this man and his wife of £104 Os. 5d. per annum is increased under the Government's new proposal by £10 per annum., the effect will be tliat the husband's service pension and his wife's age pension will each be reduced by another £5 per annum. Thus, any in. crease of service pension that may be gi anted to these two pensioners will be taken from them by a reduction of the age pension by a. similar amount. If that is not, in effect, the application of a the budget makes provision. It must be means test, I do not know the meaning of a means test. The procedure that I have outlined means that altliough the rates of service pension and age pension are to be increased under the Government's who are receiving both of those pensions will suffer a reduction of the rate of Mr Bryson. age pension because tbe husband is in receipt of a service pension as well as an age pension. In such circumstances, the pensioners' last position is worse than their first. The Government should ensure that a man who is entitled to a service pension as a result of war injuries -and cannot earn a livelihood because of his advanced years, shall not suffer a reduction of age pension to which From those he would otherwise be entitled. The Labour Government increased the permissible income of age pensioners in several stages from 12s. 6d. to 30s. a week. This Government has not altered the latter figure although, as previous speakers have pointed out, the basic wage and living costs have more than doubled since the permissible income was increased to 30s. a week in 1948. Even under the Labour Government's legislation it was possible for an aged couple to have a total income of £9 a week, because in addition to the age pension of £3 a week for each person, the couple were permitted to have a combined private income of £3. However, the ceiling of £377 per annum penalizes an age pensioner who is eligible to receive a service pension. Because he risked life and limb in the defence of this country in World WarI . and is suffering from war injuries, he is precluded, under the Government's latest proposal, from obtaining the full rate of age pension that is payable to other age pensioners who If the war not only did not sustain war injuries but also did not even offer to fight in defence of their country. I assure the committee that I am not merely finding fault with the administration of these pensions. I earnestly appeal to the Government to re-examine cases of the kind that I have indicated. The amount of additional expenditure that would be involved in assuring that justice shall be done in such instances would be infinitesimal in relation to the total expenditure for which obvious that an increase of 7s. 6d. a. week, which will bring the rate of age pension up to £3 7s. 6d. a week, whilst it might have appeared to be adequate in 1940. or as late as 1945, will not enable latest proposal, a. couple pensioners to meet present living costs. In spite of each increase of the rate of age and invalid pensions, the actual purchasing power of pensioners Thef u l l rate of pension does not represent 40 per cent, of the basic wage, which might be regarded as being reasonable in that it would enable recipients to live in frugal comfort and to avoid starvation. has increased the rate of age and invalid pensions by 7s. 6d. and 10s. a week under each of its two preceding budgets, the f u l l rate is still inadequate in relation to the cost of living. The Government has failed to honour the promises that it made during the last general election campaign to keep down the cost of livin g and to put value back into the £1. If the Government had carried out ita promise to look after the interests of pensioners it would have ensured for them the maintenance of a standard of living comparable with the standard that existed when Labour relinquished office. If the Government had only partly honoured its promises then pensioners woiild be in a considerably better position than they are in to-day. The cost of livin g has almost doubled since this Government came to office. In order to restore the ratio of pension to the cost of living, that is, the weighted average for the six capital cities, that obtained when Labour was in office, it would be necessary for the Government to now increase age and invalid pension to £4 9s. a week, instead of £3 7s. 6d. a week as is proposed. In other words, the standard of living of the unfortunate pensioners has declined, during this Government's term of office, in terms of the present day value of money, by £1 ls. 6d. a week. This means that although the ratio of pension to the basic wage has decreased by about 10 per cent., the actual reduction of the livin g standard of pensioners has declined by about 25 per cent.

Coming Before that increase was granted, a year to a. broody hen, the elephant said, "" I w ill and three months had gone by without sit on your eggs while you go for a walk "". any increase of the rate of pension. The The point of that simple story is that is steadily being reduced. the elephant meant well. Although honorabie members opposite have meant well by their comments, they have broken a lot of egg's. Unlike an elephant, which is credited with possessing a memory that never forgets, they seem to have forAlthough the Government gotten a lot of things. I can best illustrate this contention by referring again to the passage in Hansard that was mentioned this afternoon by the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser). The attitude of honourable members opposite to pensioners is vastly different to their attitude when they were in office. They have turned a complete political somersault. When honourable members opposite composed the Government of this country they had ample opportunity to do whatever they wished to do in the field of social services. This Government has done many things in that field that the former Labour Government neglected to do during its eight years in ofiSce. In June, 1949, the then honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Turnbull) asked the then Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) whether the Government intended to increase the rate of age and invalid pensions. As reported in Hansard, Volume 202, at page 865, Mr Chifley .repliedNo consideration has been given to a further increase of pension rates. He went on-and I emphasize his remarksThe Government considered this subject not long agoand I particularly emphasize the phrase, "" not long ago "" and made a general increase, and it is unlikely that a further increase will be considered so soon after that. The law provided at one time that pension rates must be related to the cost of living and must rise or fall according to variations of the cost of living index figures.

157,Mr Townley (Denison,"Minister It was nine months prior to the late rightbest way that I can refute allegations of honourable members opposite that this Government has not honoured some of its pre-election promises is to enumerate the actions of this Government, and to read to the committee an extract fro m the joint policy speech of the Government parties that was delivered by the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) during campaign. The honourable member for Hindmarsh has stated that the Government parties sought to obtain votes by promising all sorts of things. However, on that occasion the right honourable gentleman statedWe made no cash promise to pensioners, whose pensions had not been raised by the Chifley Government, in spite of rapidly 1952 a scheme for your approval. rising prices, right through from tlie latter part, of 1948 to the end of 1949, out we increased their pensions in our very first Budget by 7s 6d. a week. We do not yet know what the appropriate alteration should be by the time of the next Budget. But we do say that we understand the difficult problem of the pensioners in a period in which prices are rising. That moderate statement has been interpreted by the honourable member for Hindmarsh as a pre-election promise that was dangled before the electors to buy votes. :t consider that it was a moderate and honest statement. B y its first budget, this Government increased age and invalid pensions by 7s. 6d. a week. That was the biggest increase in the history of social services in this country. ""Within another year we again increased age and invalid pensions, by 10s. a week. I ask lionorable members to contrast the attitude of this Government with the attitude of the former Labour Government, as was revealed in Mr Chifley's wordsThe Government considered this subject not receive an invalid pension or rehabililong ago and made a general increase, and it is unlikely that a further increase will be considered so soon after that. I remind the committee that this Government's first increase of age and invalid pensions by 7s. 6d. a week established an all-time record. Yet that was eclipsed by the 10s. a week increase that was granted during the following year. Now, within nine months of that 10s. increase, thu Government proposes to increase age and invalid pensions again by another 7s. 6d. a week, at a cost to the Treasury of more than £8,000,000. Mr Townley. The honourable member for Darling( Mr Clark) read to the committee a.n extract froma newspaper report to the effect that the Government parties had promised the people that if they were returned to office they would remove all sorts of anomalies associated with thu granting of pensions. He stated that the Government had failed to honour that the1951 general election promise. Other honourable members opposite have stated that we promised to ( Mr Clyde Cameron) abolish the means test in relation to pensions. Let me read to the committee the promise about the removal of the meanstest that was made during the 1949 general elections. It is as follows:During the new Parliament, we will further investigate this complicated problem with ti view to presenting to you at the election of No general election is due to take place in 1952, but I assure honourable .gentlemen that the investigation that we promised to make has been made. What of our promise to investigate anomalies and inequities that were causing friction, and do our best to remove them ? I have not time to deal with all that the Government has done in that connection. Let me enumerate some of the ways in which we have liberalized the means test. In our first year of office, we increased the income means test applicable to blind persons from £5 17s. 6d. to £8 a week, and later to £10 a week. This year, for the first time in the history of social services in this country, the means test hitherto applied to a whole group of persons in the communityI refer to the blindhas been removed completely. When this Government assumed office, a child between the ages of sixteen years and 21 years was not entitled to tation benefits if the child was deemed to be adequately maintained. Under the Labour government, such a child was considered to be adequately maintained if the father was earning £3 a week, the mother was allowed £3 a week, and the child £3 a. week, or £9 a week in all. Eirst, we increased that sum to £4 in each case, making £12 a week in all, and this year we have removed the means test completely. Under Labour administrations, every article of surgical equipment supplied to a person undergoing training under the rehabilitation scheme -had to be paid for by that person. Trainees were required to pay for artificial limbs and equipment of other types vitally necessary to them. This year, this Government has abolished that requirement, and now everything supplied to persons undergoing rehabilitation treatment is supplied free of charge. ""We have liberalized the means test by increasing the statutory tax exemption in respect of age pensioners to £507 for a married couple. The value of the property that a pensioner may own has been increased from £750 to £1,000, and in the case of widows, from £1,000 to £1,250. We have raised the special exemption in respect of life insurance policies from £500 to £750, and similar considerations apply to a reversionary interest in a will. We have liberalized the income means test by increasing the permissible income of invalid pensioners by 10s. a week for each dependent child. I could go on, but I think I have said enough to indicate the honesty of this Government in honouring any promises that it has made. Several speakers have referred to the relationship of age and invalid pensions to the basic wage. Let me remind the committee that during the years which the Opposition has used as the basis for its argument. Labour governments pegged wages. In fact, they pegged wages and robbed the pensioners because the pension was tied to the basic wage. Honourable gentlemen opposite have made an illogical approach to the problem when they have referred to the relationship of pensions to the basic wage because, as the honourable member for Petrie( Mr Hulme) has pointed out, originally the basic wage was calculated on the basis of the needs of a family unitconsisting of a man, a wife and three children. In those days, the workthe average annual expenditure upon ing week was 48 hours. Later, it was reduced to 44 hours, and subsequently to 40 hours. Therefore, the committee will see how the basis of the calculation, has been completely altered. In 1947, the interim award of 7s. a week was made, and in 1950, the basic wage was increased by £1 a week. That increase was made, not on. the ground of need but on the ground of the capacity of industry to pay it. When we examine the matter, we find that all the factors on which honourable gentlemen opposite have founded their arguments are completely unstable. Let me refer briefly to the days when there was a tie up between pensions and the basic wage. When the Labour party was in power, pensions were increased on seven occasions by 6d. a week, or by the coin that one puts in a Christmas pudding. I am not blaming the Labour party for that. It was due to the tying of pensions to the basic wage, a principle which several honourable members are advocating to-day. Prom the 3rd April, 1941, to the 17th February, 1944, pensions were increased by a total of 3s. 6d. a week. The Labour party increased pensions by 3s. 6d. a week in three years, but this Government has increased tbem by 25s. a week in two and a half years. buy as much now as it did previously. able gentlemen opposite do not like these matters to be referred to. This Government has, in the field of social services, a record that the Labour party cannot approach. Let me remind, the members of the Opposition that, in addition to increased expenditure upon pensions, £8,000,000 a year is being expended upon the provision of free medicine in which scheme pensioners participate. Then tbere is the Pensioners Medical Scheme which will cost £1,000,000, to say nothing of medicines w-hich alone will cost about £500,000. This year, expenditure upon social services is at the rate of £173,709 a. year, and, in addition, about £25,000,000 a year is being made available to the .States for expenditure upon their own social services. In the three years before this Government took oflice, social services in this country was £S0,000,000. Since this Government came into power, it has been £139,000,000. Our social services programme for this year envisages the expenditure of a sum twice as great as the whole of the Commonwealth expenditure in 1938-39. No reasonable person could expect much more. We have altered and liberalized over 40 of the payments and. restrictions for which",50,Sunday Telegram Service

159,Mr Townley,"I know that honorthe Social Services Consolidation Act provides but not one of those alterations would have been left for us to do if the Labour party, in its years of office, had done the job that it was put into power to do and not neglected its responsibilities. perused the Estimates for the Department of Commerce and Agriculture, I am profoundly disappointed to find that no provision of a tangible nature has been made to secure an increase of food production. Eor months, honourable gentlemen on both sides of the chamber have realized that it is necessary to improve our rural production, and many fine speeches have been made about the desirability of an improvement being made as quickly as possible. At length the matter was ventilated so forcibly that a few mouths ago ihe Minister for Commerce and Agrimuch blowing of trumpets, that the Government intended to inaugurate a five year plan to increase food production. The details of that Rlan have been shrouded in mystery. It is true that the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) suppleirented the statements of the Minister 'n relation to the plan, but the average member of the public has no knowledge of its details. The Minister claimed in this chamber some time ago that he had consulted producers' organizations in relation ro the plan. A recent copy of Muster, tbe journal of the Graziers Association of N""riw South Wales, sheds some light on that statement. Under the headingNo the journal statesNeither the Graziers' Association of N.S.W. area might not reach 2,200,000 acres. I runthe Graziers' Federal Council had any details of a five-year food programme to increase export income by £100 million, the General Secretary of tbe Graziers' Association of N.S.W., Mr S. Ick-Hewins, told "" Muster"" this week. on din ing the course of the Budget debate by the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, Mr McEwen, that such a plan existed and that it had heen arrived at in consulatlon with producers' organisations. So. apparently, the Minister consulted neither the Graziers' Association of New South Wales nor the Graziers Federal Council about the plan. In fact, to judge from the lack of information about the details of the plan, it would be true to say that the plan was conceived in mystery and is shrouded in secrecy. When the Prime Minister supported the remarks of the Minister about, this plan he said that Australia urgently required an increase of food production, which would require substantial efforts in the direction of the provision of transport, rural accommodation and water supplies, the'production of fertilizers and the production and supply of fanning equipment. Despite the undoubted fluency of the Prime Minister and the numerous blue-prints thnt Government spokesmen have spoken about but have not produced, there appears to be no evidence that any progress is being made with the plan. I should have thought that any progress that was being made would have been mentioned in the budget and shown tlirough the medium of the Estimates of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture. The Estimates, however, reveal no such evidence. The Government approaches the necessity to increase foocl production in a spirit of airy optimism, but tbe fact is that the increase of production, over recent years, of practically all our primary products has not been commensurate with onr increase of population. Wlieat acreage in New Soutli Wales has declined over tiie last few years. That is a serious state of affairs. RecentlyI read in the press, of thc steady decline of New South Wales wheat acreage since 3948-49, when the FOOD PKOGRAJUIR DETAIL S KNOWN TO acreage was about 4.000,000 to last year's sowing of 2,700,000 acres. The newspaper said that this year the total wheat coulcl produce further evidence of that k''?id to T\rdve that the sowing of wheat and the production of other vital commodities have declined, but those matters have already been dealt with in detail by other honourable members recently. This counstatement reported to have been made try's economic stability rests on its balance of trade. Because of certain factors that should bo known to all honourable members, a satisfactory balance was retained until about a year ago. Since 1939, however, the volume of our imports has increased by nearly 100 per cent., whilst the volume of onr exports has increased by",52,Sunday Telegram Service

162,Mr Ick,"Hewins had been asked to commentonly 10 per cent. We have reached a stage at which the Government has heen forced to impose drastic import restrictions, which have had a deleterious affect on the national economy. We have been able to pay our way by our exports in the last ten or twelve years only because the return that we received for our exports was greater than the amount we paid for our imports. That state of affairs is fast changing, and therefore we must utilize every possible method to increase our primary production. The honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr Jeff Bate) to-day gave details of a method by which, he said, we could increase primary production. Basically, however, there is only one way to do so. First, we must stem the drift of population from the country to the city, which has been in progress, slowly but inexorably, since 1941. It was accentuated during the war and the balance between country and city has not been restored since. The Government's basic problem now is to get more producers back to the land. But no provision is made in the Estimates for such a purpose. In addition to the drift from the country to tbe city there is another state of affairs of which the Government should take cognizance. Since 1938-39 the number of people who own rural property has fallen by 2-£ per cent. That is a bad state of affairs. Instead of an increase of the number of rural property owners, which is desirable, there is a decrease. In the same period the area of land devoted to the production of food has increased by 5 per cent. That means that a greater area of food-producing land is now owned and controlled by a smaller number of people than before. Nobody could seriously suggest that that is a desirable position. Statistics show that the production of wheat, milk, meat and some other primary commodities, is slightly above the 1939 level. That increase, however, is not commensurate with the increase of population iu the same period. In the five years that ended in 1950-51 the. level of agricultural production was about 10 per cent, higher than it was in the five years that ended in 1938-39, but over the same period the population had increased by 22 per cent. The problem that confronts any Australian Government is not that OUT agricultural production is declining, but that it is not increasing to keep pace with the rapid expansion of the population. The only way to increase it to the degree necessary is to put more men on the land. The Estimates provide no evidence that the Government proposes to do anything tangible in that direction. We have had absolutely no indication of such a proposal from the Government except a few airy, fluent speeches. Our population has increased by 1,500,000 since 1.939, yet rural population has increased by only 1 per cent, or 2 per eent. during the same period. It is obvious that national disaster faces us if that trend is allowed to continue for much longer. The Government should have made an effort to put more producers on the land. Increased production would naturally follow an increase of the number of producers. The war service land settlement scheme has been a. striking success since the end of the last war, and bas led to a considerable increase of rural production. Governments were careful to avoid the mistakes that were associated with a similar scheme after World WarI . Ex-servicemen settlers, through their keenness to improve their conditions of life, are helping to increase rural production. I think that the Government should have realized this and should have sought to establish some similar scheme. I consider that the Minister for Com merce and Agriculture should have convened a conference of the State Ministers for Agriculture, which could have evolved a scheme that would put on the land more people, not only ex-servicemen but young Australians and new Australians. The nation is not now producing enough primary products to meet its own requirements. Too much of our man-power, both Australian and immigrant, is being wasted and frustrated by employment in inessential activities. The two basic requirements for increased primary production-the land and the. people-mus t be joined. Land settlement schemes on a scale never before visualized must be implemented without further delay; yet this Goverament does nothing. There must be a subdivision of properties that are too large to be efficient, and a full utilization of their productive capabilities. I have no doubt that if the Government endeavoured to implement such a policy-it has no intention to do so if one can judge by its decision to repeal the land tax-ther e would be the usual violent reactions from big land-owners who, under existing conditions, are becoming more prone to the evils of excessive land aggregation. There are still large tracts of land that are capable of much closer settlement. New techniques of agriculture, and the reclamation of areas which previously were considered ,to be useless, are revealing possibilities that were not even dreamed of a decade or two ago. If the Government were really sincere in its professed desire to tackle the problem of declining rural production-frankl y I do not think that it is sincere because its only contribuspeeches and resolutions. Pull employtion so far has been wordy platitudes-it would hasten to the aid of potential settlers. The first problem that confronts any potential settler is finance. In the present situation there is supreme irouy. Australia faces serious economic difficulties because of declining primary production, yet, tens of thousands of would be rural producers are condemned to frustration because of the Governments' credit restriction policy. If the Government earnestly wishes to see this country developed, it should consider the following methods of increasing rural production:-Ne w settlers should be given capital assistance in the establishment of their properties; nominal deposits only should be asked, and easy repayment terms should be made available; equipment co-operatives should be established fo ensure that farmers shall be able to equip their properties as cheaply as possible.; provision should be made for suitable housing for which a nominal deposit only should be asked, and easy repayment terms provided; free technical advice and information on marketing should be made available to farmers when required ; and lastly, .an equitable system of tax rebates should be introduced. The DEPUTY CHAIEM AN ( Mr big fellows who are already there. Bowden) -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Commerce and Agriculture) [9.54] I first, step in this direction is to increase welcome speeches of the kind that the production on existing farms. Clearly lionorable member for Batman( Mr Bird) has just delivered. Whilst the' Government does not agree with everything that he has said, it is a healthy sign indeed that there should be in this Parliament, and in this country generally, a general recognition of the need to expand Australian rural industries, and to restore a balance to the economy. We hear a lot in this Parliament ahout the desirability of full employment and the need to maintain a high level of social services. Those objectives are shared by members of all political parties, but it should be fairly recognized that, just as a factory cannot maintain full employment unless its wages bill is within its financial capacity, so Australia cannot maintain full employment solely by means of ment, social services, and living standards are, in the long run, fundamentally dependent on the ability of this country to pay for them, and that, in turn, depends.upon not only our local income, but also upon our income from, overseas without which we could not pay for the commodities that we must import. Therefore, whilst I welcome constructive suggestions from either side of politics, I am bound to say that it is quite a novelty to hear from the Opposition in this Parliament support for the subdivision of land and the re-introduction of the land tax. In 1942, One of the very first administrative acts of the then Labour Government, was to return to the greatest land-owner in this country,. Alexandria Proprietary Limited, a lease of 11,000 square miles"" in the Northern Territory. And even that was not sufficient. The same Administration took 600 square miles from a neighbouring station and gave that to Alexandria Proprietary Limited. Therefore, if Labour now favours the subdivision of land, I welcome the change of heart on the part of honourable members opposite, bnt I have yet to be convinced that Labour really wants to get more people on the land and not merely to fatten the The aim, of this Government is to",53,Gbazieks Association
163,Mr Mcewen (Murray,"Minister for stabilize the primary industries. Ourit is a mucli more practical proposition to increase the production on established farms that are already fenced and equipped, than to open up new areas wiiere substantial developmental work is necessary. We believe that the output of existing farms can be increased by giving to farmers the incentive of profitable production. Farmers can be assisted to expand production by making available to them credit for the purchase of machinery and equipment, and by giving to them opportunities to increase their efficiency by the use of new agricultural techniques. Our first objective, therefore, is to increase production on existing farms. However, we know that, with our population rapidly increasing, we cannot depend solely on existing farms to meet our long-term requirements. As the honourable member for Batman has said, we must have new farms as well. Without wishing to "" pass the buck "" in any sense, I remind the committee that land settlement is primarily a State function. When the War Service Land Settlement Scheme was inaugurated, the then Labour Government decided that Commonwealth financial assistance should be provided for States wihich considered that their resources were not adequate to finance land settlement schemes on a sufficiently wide scale. That has been done in Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania. Queensland, however, which has vast undeveloped areas, the Labour Government rejected the Commonwealth's offer, and the War Service Land Settlement Scheme has been a p it if u l failure in that State. The Commonwealth has indicated to the States that, in view of the present financial emergency, and the heavy calls that are being made upon its financial resources, the States could assist greatly by giving priority to the provision from tlieir own resources of transport and other services that are essential if new settlers are to be placed on the land, and the production of existing farms is to he increased. Unhappily, not one State has reacted favourably to this proposal. The DEPUTYCHAIBMAN Order ! Thc time allotted for the consideration surer ( SirA r t h u r Fadden) may deny it , of the. proposed votes for the Department that the late Mr Chifley informed the of Commerce and Agriculture, the then Premier of Queensland, Mr Hanlon, Department of Social Services, the Department of Shipping and Transport and the Department of Territories has expired.

(Ordered to be considered together.) propose to make some observations in regard to the Department of National Development and the Department of Immigration, the proposed votes for which are now under consideration. Apparently, members of the Government talk about national development with tongue in cheek, and without the slightest semblance of sincerity, because among the many projects tliat still await development by the Australian GovernIn ment, in conjunction with the Government of Queensland, is the scheme now known as the Burdekin ""Valley Development Scheme. If the people of Queensland learned one thing during World Wa r II . it was the importance from a defence and a developmental viewpoint of the completion of that scheme. Havingi n mind the importance of the scheme, the Queensland Government endeavoured to implement it . When the scheme was originally evolved it was estimated to cost £29,000,000. A t that time the people of Australia were in much more fortunate positions than they are in to-day because a Labour Government was in office in the National Parliament. The Chifley Labour Government agreed with the Queensland Government to meet one-half of the cost of the scheme. It is an in disputable fact, however much the Trea-",55,Gbazieks Association

It does not make sense. TheI suggest that he should go into a huddle with his advisers on this matter. He cannot have it both ways. In the last statement which he made on the subject in this chamber lie indicated that the Burdekin Valley development scheme, which was originally estimated to cost approximately £29,000,000 will now cost approximately £73,000,000. What an indictment of his Government that he should have to admit, in this chamber that because of the delay in granting assistance to the Queensland Government for the implementation of tbe scheme its cost has risen from approximately £29,000.000 to approxihaving mately £73,000,000!

On the average, tbe sugar season lasts for about six months. In tlie past, the State government and local authorities undertook construction works and provided employment for thousands of seasonal workers in the slack periods. ""We hoped that the Government would honour its election promises. a responsible Minister could make such promises slightest intention to f u l f i l them. We looked to the Government's scheme to absorb many unemployed during the slack season last year. But the Government was not satisfied with failure to keep its promises. It introduced credit restrictions which aggravated the position greatly. The Minister for Supply( Mr. Beale.) may grin like a. hyena, but thousands of men and women in north Queensland w ill be unable to get work in the next slack season to provide them with food and comforts. If the Minister thinks that that is funny, his attitude to the problem is different from mine. The people who cannot find employment do not think that it is funny. The effect of thc credit restriction policy was feltonly partially last season, but its f u l l force, w ill be evident soon. Although the Minister has said that the Government has not contracted to keep immigrants in employment for two years, large numbers of them are working on construction jobs in north Queensland while people who were born and reared there, and have reared families, have been told to leave their homes and go to the big cities where the Government claims that 53,000 jobs are available. Eveni f it were possible for those men to leave their wives and children and homes in north Queensland to go to Sydney and Melbourne, they would find that, the jobs are not there for them. This Government must face that position. If it docs not do so now, it w ill be forced ro do so in the next general election campaign.

The Treasurer and the Minister for External Affairs have ancl yet have not the spoken with their tongues in their cheeks. They did not stand up to the promises that were made by the Government. There is not the slightest evidence of the national development scheme that they promised. Whether the Treasurer will be game to go back, during the next election campaign, to the places where lie made those promises remains to be seen. He has not been back since the last, election and I challenge himto go back there now. If he does return it will be interesting to hear what he has to say to the people. The DEPUTY CHAIEMAN Orcier! The honourable member's time bas expired. [ 10.15J I wish to draw the attention of the committee to affairs connected with the Department of Immigration. Eeports in the press that are purported to come from the Minister for Immigration ( Mr. H o l t ) , who is overseas, are rather disturbing. Many immigrants are coming to this country under the impression that the way is open for them to be absorbed into the community. They believe that if tliey do a few weeks, work and live in hostels that have been provided for them, they w i i l soon be able to get suitable accommodation and that within a reasonable period they w ill be assimilated as Australian citizens. The Government, and particularly the Minister for I m m i gration, must consider the position of the immigrants who have come to this country. I do not raise the question of the suitability of the immigrants, nor do I object to any immigrant simply because of his nationality. People have come to Australia from all parts of Europe. Among them, as among Australians, there are people who are very good, there are average folk and a percentage who are not as good as we would like them to be. Generally, they are a fine assortment. Many Europeans who have come to Aus-",56,Oommonwealt H Scientifi Can D Industrial Besearch Organization

167,Mr Thompson (Port Adelaide),"tralia are people of culture and they are establishing themselves in the national life. But Australia has reached an economic position where it is unable to provide employment for immigrants or to give them all the advantages that they have been led to expect. I wish to refer in particular to British immigrants. Before the present Government was elected to office, the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell), who was Minister for Immigration in the Labour Government, did much valuable work in planning and administering immigration. When there was a change -of government, honourable members on this side of the chamber were gratified to learn that the work of the honourable member for Melbourne was to be continued by his successor in office. How-ever, during the period that the honourable member for Melbourne was Minister for Immigration, -directed mostly to mass immigration from European countries. tically no mass immigration Britain. to come to Australia had to be nominated by somebody who could provide accommodation for them and guarantee that there would be work for them also. Ultimately, the system was amended and the Government agreed to take immigrants of British nationality and find work for them. Some literature was issued and I have read copies of pamphlets that were distributed in England. Many people who came to Australia have told me that they sold their homes and arranged to migrate under that scheme. At first the scheme was to be limited to tradesmen whom we needed here, and who could be readily absorbed. I speak of conditions in South Australia, where, at Port Adelaide, the first occupants of the hostel were European immigrants, or displaced persons, as they were called. In Europe, they had occupied concentration camps, and later refugee camps. When they came to Australia they found here accommodation not so different from what they had been used to, but they had freedom and the hope of better things. The first settlements were established in stores which had been built to hold surplus wool during the war. As the wool was sold and exported, the premises were used for the Mr Thompson. accommodation of European immigrants. After the present Government came into office, I was amazed to find that tbese same premises were being used for the accommodation of British tradesmen. They were uot refugees or displaced persons, but men who had occupied liomes in Britain, which they either rented or owned. When I saw that women ancl children were also being accommodated in the wool stores I felt that, something very serious was wrong. It would not have been so bad if they had to remain there only for a month or so, but some of them liave heen in the hostels for a year, and others for as long as eighteen months. Still, they do not know when they will be able to get homes of their own, and. they are becoming desperate. We have heard of the formation of protest committees, and of the refusal of British immigrants to pay the high tariffs demanded. I clo his attention was not say that the tariffs are higher than the costs justify, but I know that after the There was pracimmigrants have paid for their board and from lodging they have nothing left with which British people who wanted to provide for their future. I am illformed that many of them are now looking forward to the time when they can return to Britain. It is time that we took stock of the situation, and set out to improve conditions. I know that in any large body of immigrants there will besome misfits, persons who cannot adjust themselves to new conditions, and will wish to return to their own country. However, my complaint is on behalf of those immigrants who wish to become Australians, but feel that it is impossible for them to do so under present conditions. At the beginning of this sessional period I asked the Minister for Immigration to allow British immigrants living in hostels to pay rent for their accommodation and to cook for themselves, rather than pay for their board. The present tariffs are high because wages are paid to people to do the cooking and cleaning, while the wives of immigrants sit around idle. When these people first came here, the husbands were able to obtain overtime and week-end work, in addition to tbe ordinary 40-hour week, and sometimes the wives oould .get employment, also. In. those circumstances tbey could afford to pay the tariff, and still save something. Now, however, there is no overtime to be had, no week-end work for the men, and little prospect of jobs for the wives. The attitude of the department has been that if immigrant families are provided with flats, and allowed to do their own cooking, they will not try to get homes of their own. The idea is that if conditions are allowed to r.emadn as they are the immigrants will get out of the hostels as soon as they can, thus making room for others. The Minister for Immigration has apparently :acepted that idea, but we know that most of the immigrants just cannot get homes for themselves. The honorablo member for Sturt( Mr Wilson) has interested himself in this matter, and has appealed to the Government to allow the immigrants to rent flats at the hostels. I am convinced that that is the only way to satisfy the immigrants, not only in South Australia, but in other States, also. There is an old saying that an Englishman's home is his castle, but no-one who see3 tbe accommodation available to the British families in immigrant hostels could believe that they have either homes or castles. I plead with the Government :o make conditions more bearable at the hostels. I feel this matter very keenly, and I do not say that members of the Government are indifferent. Erom time to time, we hear it said that we should make a greater effort to bring British immigrants to Australia in order to maintain the proportion of British blood in the population, but if we are to encourage British immigration we must make greater efforts to provide immigrants with better accommodation. The South Australian Bailways Department has provided cottages for its workers, and those immigrants who are employed on the railways are fortunate in that respect, but for the general run of immigrants nothing has been done. It is not possible for the South Australian Housing Trust to give them preference over native-born Australians, many of whom have themselves been waiting for years for homes. The TEMPOBABY CHAIBM AN ( Mr MoLeay) -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. for Supply) [10.30] I do not object to the tone of the observations made by the honourable member for Port Adelaide( Mr Thompson). In fact, I think it should be said that he put his case for immigrants, particularly for British immigrants, fairly and temperately. But I am sure that he would be the first to admit that the problem is not a simple one and that what has been done is really a continuation and a development of a long-standing policy* When the previous Government was in office it promoted, I believe to its credit, a vigorous system of immigration, including British immigration. It brought many immigrants to this country, placed them in hostels, and, in the way of things, made mistakes, as this Government has done, and learned from those mistakes. I. believe that we are improving the lot of the immigrants who came here: the Labour Government put any British immigrants in hostels. I was a member of the Opposition going to a hostel in my electorate which bad British immigrants in it at the time. In due course, this Government came to power and continued and developed the same immigration programme witli, perhaps, even a little more emphasis on British immigration, although I make no great , claim about that point because it has been a somewhat fluctuating matter. We, too, have been compelled to place British immigrants, with other immigrants, in hostels. However, there has been no misconception about this matter. Before the immigrants left England they were informed that they would have to spend a period of time in hostels. That has always been stated, and I have never heard any authoritative information which suggests that immigrants did not know before they came here that that would happen to them when they reached Australia. We have an obligation to immigrants, but we also have an obligation to our own citizens. I am sure that the honorable member for Port Adelaide would be the first to concede that that is so. We are endeavouring to do things under a limitation imposed by a shortage of materials at our disposal. We are attempting to do a great deal in a",58,Oommonwealt H Scientifi Can D Industrial Besearch Organization

That is what this Government, in common with the previous Government, has had to face. ""We have not initiated anything new. ""We have not done anything less generous or favorable to the newcomers than our predecessors did. At the present time there are approximately 30 hostels throughout Australia which have British immigrants in them. It has been said that we should make arrangements under which British immigrants will stay in hostels for only a short space of time and then pass out into houses of their own. allowed to rent parts of the hostels. point in a moment. The gravamen of the complaint which is made, as I understand it, is that arrangements should be made for British immigrants to get into homes. Eecently we cut down the immigration programme from approximately 160,000 a year to approximately 50,000 a year. We did that because economic conditions were such that we felt obliged t,o reduce the intake of newcomers. Some restriction in the call for labour and a considerable restriction in our ability to provide houses and accommodation made that action necessary. Thatf t least is a first step. We have seen fit to reduce the intake in order to lessen rhe pressure on our local resources of various kinds. I am sure that if the honourable member for Port Adelaide has travelled in his own and other electorates he will admit that the hostels vary considerably. I have been to some of them and I know point about the fact that immigrants do that some are not as good as others. I not like eating in common dining-rooms suppose that it is because of the nature but wish to take their food with them of institutionalism the world over that and eat it in their own sitting-rooms. there should be such a variation. Much depends on the human element, and a. great deal on management. I know of one or two hostels which are, indeed, very uncomfortable for newcomers, not. I think that that again depends whereas others are most admirable. I largely upon the individual concerned. recently visited a hostel in my electorate I deny straight away the assertion that a from which there had been many commajority of those in hostels have a sense plaints. A few weeks ago a new manaser of grievance because they cannot cook was appointed, and within a fortnight or less the complaints ceased. Flocks of people came round me during the morning I was there and told me that conditions were now all right. I mention that -matter to illustrate my point that conditions depend a great deal on the human element. I have no doubt that if that "" Admirable Crichton"" leaves that hostel and goes somewhere else complaints may again break out there. The Government is most concerned to pick good men to run these hostels. I agree with the honourable member for Port Adelaide that there is a sense of frustration, of restriction and despondency. matter of cost. Air. BEALE I shall mention the matter of cost in a moment. It is true that British immigrants who come from liomes of their own feel frustrated and restricted when they are obliged to occupy a couple of rooms and to share lavatory and bathing conveniences with perhaps 200 or 300 other people. They are also required to eat in a common dining-room. I should not like to do that myself, and uo doubt many other people would not like those conditions; but, after all, it was known that that would happen. I do not think that anybody who has the courage and ambition to start a new life in another country could reasonably complain about having to put up with conditions of that kind for a reasonable timeand "" reasonable"" depends upon the circumstances. After all, that is one of he risks immigrants take. It is a part pf the adventure: it might be called a Jebit entry in this transaction which has both debit and credit sides.

I knew about this complaint and asked them about it. It is true that a fortnight previously they bad been all iu favour of preparing their own meals, because the chef was unsatisfactory, but in the meantime a very good chef had come. Only about half a dozen of the 316 persons were still harping on that string when I was there. The others thought that the arrangement ' was quite satisfactory as long as, to use a colloquialism, the "" tucker"" was all right. If some one has a very strong sense of privacy he may wish to eat in bis own sitting-room, but the Government feels that there are very good reasons against yielding to the clamour of a few individuals. First, such a method would be more expensive. It is not the desire of the Government to turn these hostels into cosy homes which the immigrants will not want to leave. I know that that sounds rather a rough sort of argument, but the Government does not wish to make the accommodation so elaborate that it will be difficult to get the immigrants to use their own initiative in finding accommodation for themselves. people in some of these establishments who wonld remain tliere for tbe rest of their lives if they were allowed to do so.

However, I rose only to reply to the honourable member for Port Adelaide'who was quite fair in his argument, '.rhe Government has not pursued any new, unfair or restrictive policy. The Government is aware of its obligations and knows that conditions in some hostels are uncomfortable. We shall continue to improve them but we believe that it is in the best interests of the immigrants and Australian citizens generally for tbe immigrants to be encouraged to acquire their own homes. [10.43] -The Minister for Supply( Mr Beale) has gone round and round the mulberry bush and said nothing. He has alleged that the protest of the immigrants is just the clamour of a few disgruntled individuals. He There are said that if the Government made the hostels too cosy most of the immigrants would not want to leave them. That, was an inane observation. However cosy and comfortable tbe hostels were made, the Government would not have of them while thc present rates of tarifi' are charged. The immigrants cannot afford to pay the exorbitant charges that the Government expects of them. All that, Commonwealth Hostels Limited provides for immigrants is food and lodging. the The immigrants have to pay for their clothing and footwear.

It was formed for the purpose of implementing an unpopular policy which the Government was not prepared to implement under its own name. The Government established this fantastic body which is top heavy with ""no-hopers "" who have been shanghaied into it from the Public Service. Commonwealth Hostels Limited is top-heavy with administrative costs and the immigrants are being forced to pay for food and lighting enormous charges which are far out of proportion to the value of the services that they receive. The Government has decided to leave to a man with a family the grand sum of £2 12s. 6d. a. week out of what has been called his "" nominal wage "". The"" nominal wage "" according to Commonwealth Hostels Limited is not the basic wage but the wage that the immigrant receives for a 40-hour week. If the immigrant were a fitter his nominal wage in South Australia would be the basic wage of £11 4s. a week plus £2 12s. 6d. a week which represents the margin and loadings paid to a fitter under the metal trades award. Of that amount these people are allowed to keep only £2 12s. 6d. with which to clothe and provide footwear-and miscellaneous items for a. family of from two to five children. According to the Commonwealth Statistician the basic wage regimen provides nearly £5 a week to cover the cost of the clothing, footwear, and miscellaneous items that I have mentioned. Therefore the Government has no right to take any more from these immigrants than would leave to them that sum.

184,Mr Clyde Camebon,"I amweek for footwear and clothing for his family. In respect of the last item, honorahle members would do well to remember that according to the Commonwealth Statistician a man,wife and three children require to expend almost £4 a week on footwear and clothing. Every man who has a wife and three or four children knows that they cannot be clothed and kept in footwear for less than £4 a week. This man has a wife and two children, and his weekly living expenses amount to £16 Os. 2d. His wages are £13 2s. 3d., therefore his expenses are much greater than his income. Is there any wonder that people such as this man have refused to pay the exorbitant charges that have been imposed upon them by Commonwealth Hostels Limited? Surely, in the light of what I have said, it is not to be wondered at that 90 per cent, of all the British immigrants in hostels have decided to defy Commonwealth Hostels Limited and to refuse to pay their excessive charges. When certain prosecutions were launched against British immigrants by Commonwealth Hostels Limited it was discovered that that government organization had not had enough common sense to approach the South Australian prices commissioner in order to obtain the right to charge immigrants more than the pegged rate of 35s. a week provided for in the relevant South Australian i'egulations. If justice be done in the judicial proceedings now in progress the British immigrants will be acquitted of the charges that Commonwealth Hostels Limited have brought against them and Commonwealth Hostels Limited will be forced to refund the amount that it has overcharged them for board and lodging. The honourable member for Sturt( Mr Wilson), who came in on the band-wagon because the British immigrants live in his electorate, said that the Liberal Premier of South Australia was prepared to provide the immigrants with kitchenettes if the Australian Government would make the necessary funds available. On the 5th August, I asked the Minister for Supply the following question:Has the Brenner of South Australia made a request to the Government forfinancialassistMinister for Labour and National Serance to enable the South Australian Government to equip tbe British immigrant hostels with kitchenettes. To that question the Minister, with the usual grin on his face, saidNot that I am aware of. It is clear that the Premier of South Australia is. playing the same kind of party politics as is the honourable member for Sturt. He is trying to convince the immigrants that he is in sympathy with their cause and that he would have kitchenettes built for them if he could, but no action to help them has been taken. The British immigrants in South Australia are starting to ask whether the tories in the South Australian Parliament, led by Premier Playford, and the tories in the Australian Government, led by the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) Mr Deputy Chairman. I object to the statements of the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron). His reference to myself and to the Premier of South Australia is offensive to me, and his accusation of insincerity on my part is definitely untrue. I ask that the honourable member be required to withdraw his remarks. The DEPUTY CHAIBMAN"" -T h a statement made by the honourable member for Hindmarsh is offensive to the honourable member for StUrt and must bo withdrawn. statement is offensive to the houorable member, I withdraw it.

The Liberal Premier of South Australia has done nothing to carry out his promise to erect kitchenettes for the people concerned, and there is no doubt that at the next South Australian general election, which will take place in March, 1953, the British immigrants will let him know just what they think of his treatment of them.
