The Minister Of Trade And Customs If The Commonwealth Government Is In Negotia","tion with the Government of New South Wales, or of any other State, regarding a proposal by the Government of New South Wales to acquire the wheat of that State. Has the Minister made inquiries as to the effect, if any, that such action applied to the Commonwealth for finanby the Government of New South Wales must have in interfering with the supplies of other States, and infringing the provisions of the Constitution relating to the maintenance of Inter-State Free Tradef not entered into negotiations with any State Government regarding the acquisition of wheat. All I know of the proposals of the Government of New South Wales has been learnt from the newspapers. If the Government of New South Wales buys or takes the wheat of the State, it will have the right, I suppose, to say that that wheat shall not pass out of the State; but, as the question is a legal one, I am not competent to deal with it. negotiations between this Government and the Government of New South Wales regarding the seizure of New South Wales' wheat, will the Prime Minister, before finality is arrived at, inform this Parliament of the nature of the negotiations, and let us know what is proposed to be done? thinks the matter of sufficient importance, it will do what the honourable member asks. are"" likely to result in the fixing of a certain price to producers, will the Prime Minister inform this Parliament of' what is proposed before taking definite action t doubt whether the Commonwealth Government has the right to fix prices. From what I have heard from the other side, I gather that we have not. Therefore, I cannot give an answer to the question. here, and in the press, that the Government of New South Wales proposes to acquire all the wheat produced in the State during the coining harvest, and to retain it within the State. In view of a possible infringement of the Constitution regarding tbe maintenance ofInterState Free Trade, does the Prime Minister think that the people of one State should be assisted with' tiie money bf the people of the whole of Australia to do what is proposed ? Several of the States, New South Wales amongsb them, have cial assistance, and have received it . The buying up of all the wheat now in sight ""in New South Wales will require",4,Setup

If Commonwealth interests are interfered with, this Government will take action. Mr P. P. ABBOTT -I s the Prime Minister aware that bond fide contracts have been entered into by Victoria for the purchase of wheat in New South Wales? Will the right honourable gentleman, if the matter comes under his notice, take steps to protect the interests cf these purchasers? contracts of the kind mentioned have been made, and it is not my business to become acquainted with such facts. If Commonwealth laws are infringed, it will be the duty of the Government to see that the interests affected are protected, so far as our Executive powers can protect them. the Minister of Home Affairs if the Government has yet reconsidered its decision not to proceed with the matter of the competitive designs for buildings for the Federal Capital?

Does the Prime Minister challenge that statement, and declare it is inaccurate ? ber is founding a question on what may or may not be true; and if such a course were permitted questions could be founded on almost every cable that arrives. ask the honourable member not to persist in asking such questions, or something will have to be done to curtail the practice. avoid moving the adjourmnent of the House, because I am sure my action would be misinterpreted, and I wish it to be unAs to the attitude of this Government derstood that everything I say or do in this connection has no hostile intent whatever. But we ought to know whether the Government have in their mind anything definite regarding the future conduct of the war. Will the Prime Minister, at the earliest possible moment, make a definite statement to the House and the country, not as to "" the last shilling and the last man,"" but as to whether it is intended to translate these intentions into the concrete poses, or whether it is intended solely for form of numbers of troops and quantities of munitions ? The information is due to the country. taking every step to provide for the trainable to finance our war expenditure out of ing of an unlimited number of recruits that may offer.

The Minister is reported to have said that, in his opinion, single men should not apply for employment on relief works, but should enlist for the front, where they could fight for the principles of Democracy.

I have not seen the newspaper report referred to, but if the honourable member will put his question on the notice-paper he shall receive an answer. compared with that of any other Government, I have already told the House what we have done, and what we propose to do. Prime Minister say whether any part of the £18,000,000, which it is proposed to lend to the States, is for redemption purpublio works in Australia ? has been able to raise £18,000,000 through the Imperial Government.

The provision in the B ill that has been already so ably exposed by the honourable member for Flinders and others, is only another trick which the unions will eventually realize has been played to encourage them to go before the Court, which has no constitutional power to deal with other than purely Federal disputes. I cannot help thinking that the T he information is beconstitutional provision dealing with industrial legislation is faulty , if not absurd. If we wish to discriminate between local employment and employment that ""is Federali n its nature, it does strike me as being absurd to make the dispute, in stead of the nature of the industry in which the dispute is, the basis of the difference. If honourable members wish to have State Courts and Federal Courts, then I would suggest that we should allow th© Federal Courts to deal with only Federal industries. Do not let the dispute be the passport to the Court; let the nature of the industry be that. Then an industry once declared to be Federal will remain Federal, and the workers will know exactly where they stand. is, if you can. orable member. Under present conditions a dispute is very often engendered, and regarded as the only means whereby any particular body of men can get before Mr Justice Higgins. And in order to insure their getting their grievances heard by him, emissaries have to go throughout Australia stirring up other bodies of men to come forward with a similar grievance.. That is the very reverse of promoting industrial peace. The whole system has become a tonic for industrial discord. I agree that this question of industrial disputes, and the interpretation of what is a dispute, has become an absolute anachronism, and the sooner some means of obviating that costly and futile procedure is adopted, the better it will be for all concerned, for employers and employees, and especially the community at large. However, I do not think we shall get over that difficulty by the provisions in I this B ill . We cannot, without an alteration of the Constitution, take away the power of the H i g h Court as a Court of original jurisdiction on questions of constitutional law.

If they pass this Bill, their own friends outside will be afterwards accusing them of merely devising another trick to get them to embark on all the costs of organization and representation before the Arbitration Court, for no benefit to any other persons than those lawyers who represent their interests and the interests of the other side, in the costly proceedings before the Court. So far as these clauses are concerned, no more comment is necessary. But there is another portion of the Bill to which I may appropriately draw attention at this stage. I notice that there is an amendment proposed to enable others than those actually employed in an industry to become members of an organization. The actual proposal readsSection 55 of tlie Principal Act is amended ney-General is at times a very fitting by adding at tlie end of paragraph (b) of subapostle. section (1) the words "" together with such other persons, whether employees in the industry or not, as have been appointed officers should be allowed on both sides. of the association and admitted as members thereof."" The whole purpose and nature of the Act discriminates, because honourable members we are amending was to secure collective wish to gain the advantage of being able bargaining and community of interests to pay for brains that are not in real among employees and employers; and, consympathy with them, while denying to sequently, men who were not connectedthat is the broad term used-wit h any proposal is not the clean potato; it is industry were debarred from joining any not a fair deal; it is like something else particular union for registration before to which I wish to refer, and which is the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. If the worse feature of the legislation bethere was a desire to form a union of anfore us at this particular juncture. other kind there was nothing in the Act to prevent it ; but any union which desired the assistance of Commonwealth cancellation of registration. I was inArbitration must be composed homogeneterested the other day in noticing in the ously. I now find that it is proposed to attitude of the Prime Minister an indiamend that provision. The words cation of his belief that tins Bill was "" whether employees in the industry or specially urgent and should be passed withnot, as have been appointed officers of out consideration or delay. I believe the association and admitted as members that he would have liked to get the Bill thereof "" seem to point to an endeavour passed on the night it was introduceda to find a way to get round the original huge Bill that required a special print in Act in regard to the exclusion of paid order thab its provisions might be exagents and lawyers who appear in the plained. I ask my honourable friends opCourt. I ask honourable members why posite, especially the honourable member they desire tbe lawyer to be a member of for Maranoa, whether they are aware that the association. Why do they desire some glib person who is, perhaps, only a bush lawyer member could point to many. "" I refer to Consesome person who makes it his business to go before the Court for fees. He would nob be a member of the association because he was employed in the industry, or because his soul was in the association, but only because he would be a paid agent. He would nob be there to promote industrial peace; on the contrary, he would actually gain by industrial discord. This evil may be on both sides-the employer's as well as the employee's-bu t the amendment alters the Act, so far as the employees only are concerned. Honorablo members wish to stop a committee of employers from having a lawyer connected with it, but they seek to allow lawyers to join their organizations, and, as officers of those organizations, appear for tbem in a Commonwealth Court. I do not know that such a proposal altogether carries out those broad principles of fair play and Christianity of which the Attornone on either side.

122,Mr Speaker,"It has always beenwith the merits of this particular case. I know nothing of the case. I only know what is contained in the existing Act, and that it requires that unions should do certain things, and that the claimants in this caseI merely mention the statement of claim submitted without saying whether it is just or unjust-sa y that the provisions of the section of the Act now sought to be amended have not been complied with by the Australian Workers Union. If the claim is upheld, and is a just one, the Judge, under the existing legislation, will have no option but toorder the cancellation of the registration of the union; but, at this time, when this case is before the Courts, or is just about to come before the Courts, a Bill is submitted to us which we are asked to pass without reasonable discussion or reasonable checks. It seeks to take away from the Judge the obligation to cancel the registration of the union, and provides that he "" m a y "" cancel the registration, or if he is not satisfied that the registration should be cancelled, order the organization to alter its rules within a specified time. My point is that if we have an Act which is clear and unambiguous, and gives certain persons certain rights before the Courts, and that if certain persons exercise those rights, and undertake large expense, and go to considerable trouble to approach a Court, then it is not only grossly improper, but something much worse for the Government to step in and say while the case is actually pending, "" No, we are going to alter the rights under which these men bave gone into Court and entered upon their initial expenditure."" It is not right; it is not the clean thing. I do not think that any honourable member opposite is proud of it. I do not think there is one of them who in his heart is not ashamed of it ; but, apparently, it had to be done. If the good name of this Parliament is to be retained, I hope that there will be inserted in the Bill a clause making its provision inoperative so far as existing or pending actions are concerned. Such a provision is often found in Acts of Parliament. If the Government insert it in this Bill they will get over the charge that they are actually using the powers of the sovereign people of Australia to help the defendants in a proceeding in the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court. Such a charge I do not wish to deal is one against which no Government could stand. I think that the sense of fair play and decency of the Australian people would rise up against it. I know nothing of the merits of this case. I do not know what the Australian Workers Union or the Pastoralists Union has been doing, nor do I care; but, as a matter of common decency, this Parliament ought not to handle existing legislation to the detriment of either party before any Court in the country. I do not wish to occupy further time in discussing this matter at the present stage; but I implore honourable members to consider the point I have urged. I do not urge it in any bitterness. Honourable members have heard me before on arbitration matters, and we have had more fun than we have had this morning. I ask my honourable friends opposite to consider their own good name the good name of their party, and, above all, the reputation of this Parliament. planation, I wish to say that, in view of the emphatic denial given by tlie honourable member for Flinders to my statement, made by way of interjection, that he was connected with a certain case before the Courts, I have very much pleasure in withdrawing the remark. do not propose to walk with an incautious step into that Serbonian bog of legal technicalities by which the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court is surrounded. As a layman, I was interested in the characteristic manner in which the Attorney-General introduced this measure. Speaking in nautical language, he towed into port his Commonwealth super-Dreadnought of the union movement. He told us that the vessel, in effect, had been rammed and torpedoed by an uncharitable High Court, and he went on to pronounce upon the judgments of that Court. The honourable gentleman gave us what he claimed to be the mind of the Judiciary, but what really was the view of the dissenting Judge in the recent judgment in the Tramways case, and he told us that certain amendments of the law should be brought about. I think we are all agreed that in respect of any genuine Inter-State industrial troubleany dispute that is legitimately Federal in character-the too great difficulties which to-day beset industrial unionists dn approaching the Central Court should be removed, and greater facilities afforded",13,Willi Am Ibvine Ma Y I Say A He Is Simply Stating That There Is Such A

Every honourable member who has the welfare of the industrial community at heart-and the industrial situation affects every form of enterprise-mus t desire some reasonable and practical amendments offcheprincipal Act; bufc ifc is to bo regretted that the Attorney-General should have given us what I think is a partial view of the industrial situation. As a Minister of the Crown, as a trustee of the people, he is expected to give the House and the country the fullest and fairest view of it. The honourable gentleman told us that if Australia was to have industrial peace-if we wished to preserve the nation from internal upheaval-w e must give easy access to the central Arbitration Court. It seemed to me that fche honourable member, in fairness to the House, should have put the whole industrial situation before us. States has, at enormous cost, set up industrial tribunals for fche speedy and economic determination of industrial disputes within its boundaries, and this super-Dreadnought, which the Attorney General has towed into port witli the intention of repairing it , is now to be patched up. The honourable gentleman said that this was merely the caulking of a leak-the painting over of punctures caused by its enemy. This having been done, he is going to put out to sea, pretending that she is sea-worthy, and to encourage a fresh crew to board her, although he knows, apparently, as the lawyers in the House have been able to point out, that by so doing he will endanger the lives of not only those who in fche past have been forcedfcouse her, but those who, by the force of true unionism behind them, will be led to venture upon this one craft ber heard of any losses? strewn all over the industrial sea.

It is well that Australia should call a halt and view the entire industrial situation from both a State and a Federal standpoint. We should examine the Constitution, and ask ourselves whether it was intended when we federated that the control of the whole of the industrial forces Each of the of the States should be handed over to a central Arbitration Court. Many of the difficulties which have confronted unionists in their attempts to reach the Court, and, indeed, many of their failures, are due to one: or more of thesei too many efforts on the part of the Labour movement, under the Australian Constitution, to do indirectly that which the Constitution does not permit them to do directly. It will perhaps be no information to the House to be told that fche awards made by the Commonwealtli Conciliation and Arbitration Court have been only twenty-eight in number. If there is one matter in respect of which the trade unionists of to-day have made clear their intention, and the Government behind them has emphasized its downright conviction, it is that preference shall be granted to unionists. The Government have expressed their determination, as far as possible, to grant unionists who enter the Labour movement preference, not only in Commonwealth employment, but in all branches of industry in Australia. MightI ask the Attorney-General what hope of this he holds out to the various unions that will be registered under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act? What ashe invites to go before the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, that that Court will grant them preference? In only one case has preference been granted by it.

It is owing to the perCourt, and for the settlement'of disputes suasion of himself and his colleagues. The unionists are told that they will get better possible. But disputes which are not conditions from the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. Unionism is the body and limbs of the political Labour movement. I admired the candour of the honourable member for Fawkner in stating, in his first speech in this Chamber, that there ment. When trouble arises in an indusis to-day no difference between an industrial unionist and a political Laborite. constitutional method, and to send men to Parliament. Now that we have done so, the bonorable member aud others are not satisfied. ' to what has been achieved. My present complaint is that an attempt is being made to operate central machinery when the States can best be left to deal with their own affairs. I listened to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports the other night as to the value of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court in standardizing and equalizing conditions throughout the States; but if the honourable member for Maranoa wished to go shearing, to what State would he go ? that is where my home is. honourable member go to make the biggest cheque ? that is where the biggest cheques are to be made. ber would not go to Tasmania, because that State is the home of the wrinkled sheep. That fact clearly shows that it was a grave injustice to the sheep-owners of Australia to make the rates for shearing uniform throughout the Commonwealth. It means that sheep-owners whose sheep are not wrinkled have to pay more than they ought to pay in order that the rate shall be high enough to cover the cost of shearing wrinkled sheep. Where the conditions of an industry are such that the arising of a dispute brings it proE erly within tha jurisdiction of the ommonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court, it is right that the central authority should determine wages and conditions, and I am prepared to give all proper facilities for approaching that by it with as little cost and friction as Federal in character, which are manufactured and bogus, should not come beforethe Court. In recent years the wages of Victorian workers have been increased by millions of pounds by the adoption of the peaceful methods of the State Governtry, a majority of those concerned may approach the State industrial tribunal, and obtain a Wages Board award. This can be done without direct cost to the worker, and both unionist and non-unionist benefit by the betterment of wages and conditions which follows. But a man joining a union registered under the Commonwealth Act must pay taxes and levies. It costs him not less than £1 per annum to get the benefits of the Act. The delays that have occurred in the hearing of cases have been such as to break the hearts of many of the workers. Indeed it is only the swell, flash, autocratic unions whose affairs are controlled by honourable members opposite that are able to obtain the benefits of the Act; the smaller unions cannot do so. register, but only a strong union can get an award. can afford to brief the lawyers required, as my honourable friend knows well. An army of witnesses has to be summoned, and organizers must play their part. No doubt industrial organizers, and organizers generally, have done a great deal for the benefit of society generally, though some have overstepped fche mark. Then lawyers must be feed. On the other side there is a body of organized employers. You thus have a fight of moneybags against moneybags, or organized effort against organized effort.

A great deal has been said during this debate in regard to the question of arbitration it self, and threats have been made that if this or that were not done arbitration laws would be done away with altogether. Arbitration was not introduced by the Legislatures of the States or by this Parliament in the interests of the employers, or at their instance. introduced at the great desire of the workers, and honourable members opposite in using threats to abolish the principle know very -well that their threats are mere pretence, because they are aware that if the matter were put to the vote to-morrow the employers would not care two straws whether there were arbitration or not. would rather not have arbitration, because they have suffered financially, and in many other ways, through it . tration was brought in to prevent strikes, but I am sorry to say that it has not achieved that object.

Still, I have not altogether lost f a it h in arbitration, for, although it has not succeeded, and there have been many strikes, and more industrial trouble and discontent, the strikes have not been more numerous because of the existence of that Act .

It recalls to my mind the man who, having had a surfeit of oranges, said that he did not like them. The workers, having got much more than was anticipated through arbitration, still have little to say in its favour. The worse feature of all is that the men do not seem to be more satisfied now than when their wages were much lower. they are not going to be, either. Sir judicial utterance from a Minister. the course of this debate a great deal has been said as to what is a dispute, and it is desired that some simple means should be found to determine that question. My suggestion for ascertaining what is a dispute is to cease the present attempts to devise manufactured or bogus disputes. There have been such cases, and the timber workers' citation was a gross instance. People must be pretty gullible to believe that the timber workers in Western Australia, a comparatively isolated State, 1,000 miles away fro m other Australian of an application for change of venue? centres, where the workers have f a r higher wages than in any other part of Australia, and have local Arbitratio n much of an argument.

I do not find much f a u l t in Melbourne, and in Queensland, to the with that provision.

It is to In that case, if there had been any dispute deal w i th disputes that extend beyoud it could have been settled by the local the limits of one State. That ought not tribunal. We ought to do something to to be a hard matter to decide. I agree, encourage the dissatisfied workers to apthat it would be very much better that proach the local Arbitration Courts. I the question of whether a dispute exists should like to see a means devised for ascertaining whether there is a real grievance as the foundation of a dispute. If there is not, a severe penalty should be There must be a l i m it to it , beimposed. It is all very well to induce a few people in Queensland and Western Australia to strike, and then say that pass the inthere is a dispute extending beyond the boundaries of one State. That is, as the Chief Justice, Sir Samuel Griffith, has said, "" a fraud on the Constitution."" It I conis doing something which was never in tended, and something that is absolutely The industrial workers havunreasonable, and not in the public in terest. From an intimate acquaintance with the timber industry in Western Australia, I know that the workers there are quite able to manage their own affairs. They have a local Arbitratio n Court, and they do make use of it . Why, then, should they come over here and t r y and create a bogus dispute and m i x themselves up w it h a similar class of workers in Queensland? Such a proceeding is not in their interests or in the interests of Australia. One great advantage which local tribunals in industrial matters have is that the environment of an industry is known to those who are sitting in judgment. In order to better ascertain the facts they can visit the locality, as, indeed, they someJOHN FORREST -Anothe r times do. B ut if the case is heard in In another part of Australia, it is impossible for the Court to do that. No doubt a point of law can be decided by a Judgei f he is sitting in England, Australia, or anywhere else; but when it is a question of fact regarding the nature of the work, the mode and cost of living, and the gener a l environment, the local tribunal is better than another Courtf a r distant from the locality that cannot know anything about those conditions. or not should be decided before any other",20,Willi Am Ibvine Ma Y I Say A He Is Simply Stating That There Is Such A

The progress of the world has been made by enterprising and thoughtful men who have made those great discoveries and appliances that have led to the advancement of civilized humanity. I repeat that the Attorney-General has not told us exactly what was in his mind as to the reason for tire amendments proposed in this B ill . Whether the reasons for any B ill are palatable or unpalatable, the honourable member, as a Minister, should always be perfectly open. Nothing is to be gained by keeping back anything.

Why the Government at a period like this, when there is so much unemployment throughout Australia, and when the public mind is centred on matters far away from the Commonwealth Parliament, instead of dealing with administrative work and endeavouring to cope with the industrial difficulties of Australia, should submit such a controversial B ill as this, is difficult to understand. must have actuated them. peace. ago we heard interjections to the efEect that no matter how sympathetic Judges might be, and no matter how wages might be increased, the Labour party would continue their fight until , to use their own words, they abolished the wages system altogether. Of what use is it for an honourable member to say, "" We want industrial peace,"" when we know perfectly well that it is the duty of a certain section of the community to be all the time promoting discord between employers and employees. I have very grave objection to this B ill . I contend that the States are quite able to look after their own industrial concerns. Where disputes are of an Inter-State character, as provided in the Constitution, they should be controlled To my by the Commonwealth Parliament, but it seems to me that this Parliament has initiated legislation with the object of securing f u l l and absolute control of all industrial matters throughout Australia. Surely that cannot be for the betterment of the Commonwealth. A ny one who understands our industries, and has any regard for them or the future of this country, must realize that a single Justice sitting in Melbourne cannot control industrial conditions better than the State tribunals who now have control over State industries. To ask one man, no matter how clever or how capable he may be, to define the conditions that should be observed in all the varying industries all over Australia, is an absurd proposal. How can we ask one Judge to fix the industrial conditions for such a large territory as Western Australia? I cannot understand why it is that honourable members seek to bring HadI heard all about the about such a system. Many of the technicalities that now stand in the way of the President of the Arbitration Court dealing with cases are due to the endeavour of the Labour party to take power which they know does not, under our Constitution, belong to this Parliament. We are told by the Attorneys-General that he does not know what will be the effect of the B ill before us. Honourable members on this side know perfectly well what its fate will be. The High Court will say that its provisions are ultra vires. The proposal to refuse to employers the right Some very strong reason to appeal to the High Court other than to one Justice is an extraordinary one. It is strange that, though this B ill deals with such a grave subject as the righ t of appeal to the High Court, almost immediately after the measure is brought into the Chamber the Attorney-General gives notice of amendments to it , showing that there has been little consideration given to the drafting of the measure. It was also amusing to hear the Attorney-General come to us and ask us to amend an Act of Parliament when the measure was not really an Act ; because though it had been passed by both Houses, at that time it had not received the assent of the Governor General.

I feel quite satisfied that the Attorney General himself knows thafc the clause in which we are invited to give one Justice of the High Court full power, in spite of what the Constitution provides, to deal finally and conclusively with any question of law arising in relation to a dispute or to proceediugs or any award of the Court, is not worth the paper ifc is printed on. men are introducing this Bill. to be able to say later on that they have passed amendment after amendment and are unable to go any further with this legislation. which is futile?

In New South Wales, with a Labour Government in power, during the quarter April to June last tliere were no fewer than 51 new disputes, involving directly 6,167 work people, and indirectly 5,088, or a total of 11,255. The total estimated loss in wages, as the result of these new disputes during that period, was £62,506. During the same quarter, in respect of the whole Commonwealth, there were S3 new disputes, involving, directly or indirectly, 16,859 work people, and an estimated loss in wages of £156,415. In the first quarter of the present year there were 113 new disputes in the Commonwealth; in the second quarter of 1913 there were 49; and in the first quarter of 1913, 39 new disputes, with an estimated loss in wages totalling, in respect of these four periods, over £470,000. with those particular trades had submitted a case to the Federal Court we should have had the Justices of the High Court deciding that there was actually no dispute in existence. sible since these were not Inter-State disputes. I am complaining now offchedesire of the Labour party to bring all industrial troubles before the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court. A great deal of delay is experienced in getting before the Court at the present.time. Plaints are filed, but owing to the pressure of business, great delay is experienced, and much expense is incurred in having them heard.

I have a strong stitutionally expressed will of the people. To-day we are asked to allow a B ill to be forced through which takes the power to hear an appeal from the H i g h Court and gives it to one JusticeI admit at once that it is inevitable that there must be such a body to determine the respective limitation of the States aud thc Commonwealth. Isi t not important that there should be an appeal to the H i g h Courti n conuexion wifch legislation transferring many of the industrial powers of the State to the Commonwealth ?It will never do for us to contemplate for tagonism between the employers and the a moment a condition of things in which the States and the Commonwealth may make what laws thoy please irrespective of the extent to which either may trespass upon the other's sphere. TheB ill trespasses upon the sphere of the States, and is to be forced through without due consideration. Y e t it was introduced by a Government which only a short time ago amended the Judiciary Act so as to provide that a F u l l Court cousisting of less than all fche Justices shall nofc give a decision on a question affecting the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth, unless a majority of all the Judges concur in the decision. TheB ill now under discussion takes from the High Court a power which a few years ago the Attorney-General said was necessary for the protection of the Constitution and of the people. The public w ill feel that there is some special motive actuating the Government, and some very ugly rumours are abroad. It would be wise, therefore, for the Government to make a declaration as to fche real necessity for the Bill. good government of the Commonwealth. such absurdity? ber told us to-day that but for the war none of the tramways would be working. It is not the war that has prevented a general tramway strike, but the bad season, and the consequent unemployment. Ministers would do better if they gave attention to Departmental business, with a view to finding employment, instead of forcing measures of this kind through Parliament. In Perth yesterday some objection to the Arbitration Court. I am satisfied that, no matter how the Act is amended, demands for further amendments w ill be made to still further favour the party that is in power at the present time. It is strange-if these arbitration laws are designed, as the Prime Minister says, to secure the peace, order, and good government of the people of the Commonwealth-that there should be so much industrial turmoil in Australia. The Scottish Commissioners who visited this country a few years ago reported that in no other part of tlie world is tliere so much anemployed as exists here. This is due in part to the two parties having to constantly fight each other In the Arbitration Court. This creates animosity, which would not be created by appeals to Wages Boards. No doubt, political trade unionism is also greatly responsible. MrM it chell, general secretary of the English trade unions, who represents some 470,000 workers, saysOur policy has been to obtain the confidence of employers, no less than that of the men, by taking a strictly impartial attitude in our investigations, and making both sides understand that we are more desirous of justice and lasting benefits than mere temporary advantages gained through the use of arbitrary power. Could the trade union leaders of Australia make a similar statement? Has their desire been to promote good feeling between employers and employed ? On the contrary, it has been the effort of nearly all trade union leaders in this country to cause as much discord as possible, and they care nofc whafc action fchey take to secure a temporary advantage when they have the power. There is also their policy of preference fco unionists. I am surprised that fchere is not in this B ill a provision which was introduced some years ago regarding the disposition of union funds. Mr Jabez Dodd, one of the most important and respected leaders of the trade union movement of Western Australia, and a Ministeri n the present Government of the State, writin g to the Worker some time ago, saidWe have been fighting somewhat bitterly, and I hold rightly, for the right of political' notion under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act.

270,Mr Gregory,"An honourable memprinciple, inasmuch as preference to unionists is asked for, and no provision is made for the consciences of the unionists. I contend that to assert that all workers should be unionists, which is what preference means, and then to assert that all members subscribe to the political belief of the majority, and must financially support that belief, is tyrannical, unjust, and illogical. No body of men can uphold such a contention, and no freedom-loving community will tolerate it. He said furtherEvery worker should be a member of a union because his wages and conditions of labour are regulated by the union. further to say that every unionist shall contribute to our political funds and shall, as far as we can force him, vote and work for our candidate, we are seeking our undoing; but when we say further that only unionists shall be employed we are using tyrannical means of coercion of which the parallel would be hard to find. Congress asks for preference and the right of political action. I say the country cannot accede to such a demand, and I am disappointed at a representative body of Labourites asking for it. I do uot think I need add one word to those words, because the opinion expressed is that of every person in the country who believes in freedom. I ask the Leader of the Government what promises have been made to those non-unionists who are leaving the country to fight the battles of the Empire? the men are unionists. that the great majority of them are non-unionists, but, even if there were only 20 per cent, of them, are they to be told that, because they w ill not sacrifice their political freedom, they are to be debarred fro m employment by the Commonwealth? Such a position would be discreditable to all concerned; and, in any case, I do not believe that 80 per cent, of the men are trade unionists. cent, are "" scabs "" ! *' scab "" is a man who declines to refuse a fellow-man employment. Many object to join a union on account of the funds being devoted to political purposes; and my opinion is that, as in New South Wales and Western Australia, unions should be compelled to show how their funds are expended. tralia, in 1913, the unions received £75,486 from members in special levies and ordinary subscriptions. The expenditure was £8,04 5 in sick and accident allowances, £5,02 9 in death claims, and £1,80 9 in other relief. TJnder these heads the total payments amounted to £14,883, or less than 19 per cent, of the total of £75,486. Management absorbed £31,687, including incidentals amounting to £10,122, while"" arbitration cost £1,069, and other payments-honorabl e members should note this-were £19,634. It should be clearly provided in section 60,"" which it is now sought to amend, that all unions registered under the PedeWhen we go ral Act shall publish returns showing how their funds are spent. In New South Wales the revenue of the unions for 1912 was £199,000 , of which only £24,000, or less than 12£ per cent., was returned to its members in sick, accident, and death claims. How much was expended in fighting the political battles of honourable members opposite? On this point we may have some explanation from the Labour party Whip. There is a great difference between unionism in the Old Country and unionism here. According to the figures used by Mr Lloyd George, when introducing his insurance scheme, no less than £1,400,000, or 78 per cent., of the total contributions to the unions in England was returned to the members in the way of benefits in 1909-10. In the Old Country the aim of unionism is the bettering of industrial conditions, while in Australia the aim is to build up organizations, the chief duty of which is to foment trouble between employer and employees. No wonder one of the Scottish Commissioners said that, in no country in the world was there so much antagonism between the employer and the employee as in Australia. One peculiar amendment to the A ct proposed in this B ill provides that every association now registered as an organization shall be deemed to be registered. Apparently it not 80 per does not matter under what conditions the registration has taken place. I was nob I take it that a able to follow the whole of the evidence in the Tramways case, and, therefore, ifc would be unfair on my part to express any definite opinion; but I read a portion, and it appeared to me that fchere was something radically wrong, and, according to the judgment, that there was no dispute. Are we to be told that, whether In Western Ausan organization has or has not been properly registered, the mere fact that it has been registered prior to this Act shows that it has been properly registered ?

274,Mr Gregory,"portant case is coming before the Arbitration Courti n Sydney next week? Has the great desire for haste on the part of the Government any connection with that fact? honourable members to order for referring to that matter. sir, but you will remember that I previously asked the Prime Minister or the Attorney-General to make a statement explaining the urgency of this B ill , and failed to get any response. However, I sincerely hope that the Government will not unduly press the passing of this measure, which is of very great importance, especially when we consider its retrospective character. There is only one other matter to which I need refer. According to one amendment that is sought to be made, no employer may dismiss an employee because of the fact that he is a member or an officer of an organization. It has, of course, been contended by honourable members opposite that equal consideration is shown to the employer, inasmuch as it is provided that an employee shall not cease to work by reason of the fact that his employer has appeared as a witness in a case affecting the industry in which they are engaged. Can honourable members imagine such trash being placed in an Act of Parliament? But the whole measure bristles with absurdities. The Attorney-General is evidently quite satisfied that the B ill will prove ultra vires and useless, and I hope that the Government will hesitate before placing such legislation on the statute-book. question of preference to unionists has been discussed ad nauseam, and it is strange that it should be under discussion now, seeing that the country, and particularly this House, were given to understand by the Government that, in view of the war, no measures of a contentious nature would be introduced during this session. We found, however, that one of the very first proposals of the Government was to give preference to unionists in the Public Service, and now they are supporting that action by proposing legislation to give preference to unionists in the Court. If an employer happens to dismiss a man who is a unionist, then the onus is on the employer to prove that the dismissal was not on that ground; and this opens the door to a great deal of mischief. Why should a man, because he is a unionist, have rights or privileges over another who happens to be a non-unionist? Why should preference of any sort be given to any citizen for such a I have already called reason ? is not a unionist is an unworthy citizen. unworthy? The interjection of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports would imply that the only worthy citizens are the 500,000 unionists, to the exclusion of tlie 1,500,000 non-unionists. No arbitrary privileges should be given to one class of civilians over another in the Court or out of the Court; and I raise my objection to this proposed amendment particularly. On this point I recollect hearing the present Prime Minister and the Attorney-General say that a man who belonged to a union was in finitely better than any man outside a union. a member of tlie Farmers Union? fess to be a better man than any outside the union, and do not claim any preference on account of my membership. The statement that a unionist is necessarily a better workman, or more deserving of tbe consideration of his country, is worthy of a barbarian. In regard to preference, let honourable members consider this argument, and f o l low it to its logical conclusion. I could never play cricket very well, but I have an ambition to do so. A friend of mine says, "" If you desire to qualify as a good cricketer, all you need to do is to join the cricketers' union in Sydney; having done that, you will be immediately possessed of all the accomplishments of a good batsman."" Very foolishly, I take his advice. I join the union, and am picked to play in a first class cricket match. To my astonishment, the first ball carries away my middle stump. The membership of the union has not qualified me one little b it as a batsman. I want honourable members to consider a parallel case. I understand that there are doctors, lawyers, publicans, shopkeepers, and all sorts of people belonging to the Australian Workers Union. I believe D r .

Instead of the workers bringing their disputes before a f u l l Court, which was established at tlieir behest, we find thafc fchat Court is to be set aside, and the case must be taken before one Judgei n Chambers. I think thafc proposal savours of the reactionary. I hold the Wages Board system in high esteem. Wheii the system was first in troduced in New South Wales by Mr Wade, the then Premier, there existed the ordinary Arbitratio n Court, and none of the unions would bring their cases before the Wages Boards. A t last the Typographical Society had the temerity to bring their case before the Wages Board, and for that action the union was regarded by the other unions as a scab organization. A f t e r the case had been heard, fche advantage of going before the Wages Board was appreciated, with the result that before many months 120 unions had made applications for Wages Boards. The operation of the Boards was so satisfactory that in fche first year of their existence fche increments to the workers in New South Wales amounted to something like £500,000, and, in addition, the working hours were greatly improved. have increased wages from £10,000,000 to £13,000,000. could the workers have ?

Legal technicalities are eliminated, and the Board gets down to fche bedrock facts of the dispute. Por fchat reason, the more we can extend fchis principle throughout Australia the better it will be for the workers. The honourable member for Parkes brought under the notice of the House last night the instance of the bakers objecting to night baking. Their union cited a case before the A r b i I was only mentioning tration Court, which turned the application down. What did they do then? The New South Wales bakers immediately brought a case before tbe Wages Board, and what had been denied them by the Arbitration Court was granted by the other tribunal. How, then, could those workers proclaim from the housetops the advantages of the Pederal Arbitration Court as against Wages Boards, seeing that by one tribunal they were denied justice, and by the other their demands were satisfied. I believe, also, that the nearer we can bring justice to the people the better. Ifc is not desirable that justice should be centralized, and thab witnesses and advocates should have to be brought for hundreds of miles to the Court. If we establish Wages Boards, we can deal out justice to them at their doors, and that would be a great advantage to the working classes.

There are many principles in the B ill that have been discussed, if not at sufficient length, at least at advantageous length, but the one that excites my opposition most of all is the principle embodied in clause 10, to which the amendment refers. As far as my reading and experience of the A r b i tration Act goes, the whole jirinciple of it is the open association of identical in terests, either for agreement or award. TheA c t contemplates that the employer and employee shall alike be in associations, which alone can be recognised by this industrial tribunal. The object is a laud.able one, because I can conceive of no better way of attempting to work an A r b i tration Court than by these exclusive institutions. Por the first time, however, there is attempted in this measure a fusion of interests that are not necessarily identical. One of the greatest unions of this continent has, as f a r as my observation and learning go, arrived at new methods, and has been roping in , so to speak, a large number of other in terests not hitherto identified with it . Whether those interests be those of employer or employee, if this B ill goes through in its present shape, they all form part for award purposes of the great Australian Workers Union. mistake, and that good deal to increase industrial coercion, and destroy tlie effect of an industrial decision or determination. great lover of the Arbitration Act, or the Court which it sets up. To my mind, we have made a profound blunder in paying so much homage to the system of compulsory arbitration. In America, for example, most of the great unions, which dwarf into insignificance even the largest organizations in Australia, through the lips of their leaders, have told us times out of number that they do not want voluntary or compulsory arbitration. They say that they have got a stage past that, and they reckon that, if compulsion [2.58] I is introduced into tlie law of the United States of America to compel obedience, either by the employer or by the employee, to industrial mandates, it will mean harking baok to a position through which they the higher form of collective bargaining, which has done so much to establish peace in the greatest industrial nations of the world. I need not labour the arguments of men like Mitchell and Gompers, who, at successive Conferences of Labouri n America, have pointed to fche inherent disadvantages of arbitration and the great advantages of collective or co-operative bargaining; and I hope that the unions of Australia, more wisely led in the future than I consider they have been in the past, will look forward to the time when they will attain fche same efficiency from an industrial stand-pointas their coworkers in America. Somewhere in Siberia there is a race of men known as Yakuts, who have a peculiar form of religion. They believe in worshipping one supreme deity, but they have also to propitiate secondary deities. The Labour leaders of Australia are political Yakuts; fchey believe in worshipping the great god Demos and getting gifts from his hands, but they also think it necessary to propitiate secondary deities, the leaders of the great unions who have so much in fluence in determining the course of the Labour movement in Australia.

After an extensive use of tions have beeh registered much more quickly than would have been the position had the plaints been heard before an Arbitration Court, and there was no other business before that Court. The pace is aided by the number of smaller tribunals that can be brought into operation. There can be 200 operating in one State. There are over 120 in Victoria, and the bulk of them have speedily arrived at determinations. fought by your friends in the Upper House and Lower House in Victoria for years. member mean by my friends? surely knows that every resolution empowering the creation of these Boards was passed by both Houses, and that in nineteen years in only one case has there been a Wages Board refused by the Upper House, and that was for a small industry. Generally speaking, the resolutions have gone through with very little objection from either party or from either House. I shall pursue my argument, notwithstanding the agnosticism of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. There can be 500 Wages Boards in Victoriai f the number of industries require them, and what the State can have surely the nation can have. In consequence, instead of having to take up a position on the cabrank before the portals of the Arbitration Court, as parties to arbitration now have to do, whether the desire for a settlement co-ordinate tliese decisions. That is one of the dispute be urgent or not, many difof the reasons why we have had to take ferent machines can be set working, and eight, ten, or twenty. determinations arrived at in Victoria, even though it appeal to a Judge? exists in Victoria, although the fact is not relevant to this discussion, and., theoretically, either side can appeal against a decision, whether the determination is arrived at in two weeks or two years. But as the Appeal Court may be abolished, There can be Wages Boards without any central authority possessing appellate these machines in Victoria, we prefer a central authority, to which complaints can be brought for final determination. I admit, however, that the matter is an arguable form of Wages Boards on which honourable members opposite take a view different from mine. The facility of despatch displayed by the Wages Board system is denied to an Arbitration Court, if not wholly, at least largely. There are frequently a number of cases listed that cannot be tried, and when an emergency arises which threatens to devastate an important industry, the President of the Arbitration Court is very often asked to postpone all other cases in order to deal with this important one, and though, after Ho consideration, a decision in that case is arrived at, the parties to the other cases must wait until that is done. The only way out of the difficulty would be to create a number of these Arbitration Courts with different Judges, but that would lead to different kinds of judgments springing from varying temperaments and different minds. If we took the present occupants of the High Court Bench, and put them all in Arbitration Courts, if the Constitution were amended and plaints increased, we would find different kinds of decisions, and then, from the workers and also from the employers, objection would arise to the lack of uniformity or lack of principle guiding the determination. The only way out of that difficulty would be to superimpose on this gigantic and costly machinery an Appeal Court to",32,Willi Am Ibvine Ma Y I Say A He Is Simply Stating That There Is Such A

We have had experience in many parts of Australasia of the objections that one of the two interests havo so frequently taken to decisions of learned Judges sitting as Presidents of Arbitration Courts. Some three years ago we had, in New Zealand, a very strong objection offered by the operative unions ""to a ntimber of decisions given by Mr Justice Sim. other Labour journals, published quite frankly the resolutions passed by many trade unions iu the Dominion, in which they freely said that unless Mr Justice Sim showed himself more sympathetic to the claims of the workers they would decline to bring their cases before his tribunal. for his resignation, I tliink. opposition to him even went as far as that. Such a thing is possible here. The presumption lying behind an experienco of that kind is that only a God-given Judge could stand erect, midway between the two interests, all the time; only an absolutely infallible judgment could hold the balance equally between both parties and with the approval of both. There comes a time when even the most upright and learned Judge will occasionally sway unconsciously from one side to the other, or lean to one side or the other, and just at that time, as the judgment is that of an individual, will inevitably come an objection frqm the side which feels itself oppressed or injured against the decision of the one man. These, I recognise, are rudimentary arguments. The Attorney-General, who is in charge of this Bill, has thought them over from his earliest political experiences; but it does no harm to refresh our minds by a reference to them, since they strike at the basic root of the principle of arbitraknows that Rumour is a lying jade.

The fusion attempted in clause 10, which appears to be so vital to this Bill, seems to me to strike down that principle for the first time. The Government may have a reason for their radical and important departure, but I do not think it has been given.

But, before tbe amendment is disposed of, we sbould have some stronger reason than has been given for the inclusion of this clause, infringing, as I think it does, a vital principle of arbitration law procedure. I shall not further consume the time of the House. My amendment is clear and distinct. It asks that this measure shall restore the old condition under which associations that have to appear before the Oourt must be composed exclusively of employers and employees, and in the hope that honourable members on both sides will consider that a wise proposal I submit it to the House. Mr P. P. ABBOTT (New England) [3.20] I second the amendment. There can be no doubt that the recent decision of the High Court in the Tramways case has caused something in the nature of an upheaval in union circles. Before the giving of that judgment, we had existing in Australia a state of affairs that was pretty well understood, not only by unionists, but by the public generally. The State Acts and State Wages Boards were primarily brought into existence to facilitate the early settlement of industrial questions by decentralizing, as far as possible, the hearing of all claims. The Conciliation and Arbitration Act, which desire was to give every organization, whether it happened to be a union of employees or an association of employers, a direct means of reaching a Court in its own State, and there obtaining speedy satisfaction and justice. The New South Wales arbitration legislation was introduced to bring about a condition of industrial peace, and to do away with the turmoil and strife necessarily associated with the use of the terrible weapon of the strike. Those who believed that employers and employees should work in harmony welcomed such legislation. They believed that it would prove a panacea for many evils under which we suffered; that under it the lion would lie down with affairs of the continent to one magnetic the lamb, and the workers and employers would pursue their industry in perfect harmony. The industrial legislation of the different States has brought about a certain measure of industrial peace. The decisions of the Wages Boards in certain cases have not met with the approval of thc whole rank and file of the workers; but, having regard to the definition of the word "" arbitration,"" surely the two parties to an industrial dispute should not be so carried away with the merits of their respective claims as to be hopeful of obtaining, through an award of a Wages Board, the granting of the whole of their demands. In almost every instance the awards made by State Wages Boards and Arbitration Courts have granted practically the whole of the demands of the workers; but I have been unable to discover any universal, or even isolated outcry, worth mentioning, on the part of organizations of employers. It must be admitted that the organizations of employers have been prepared to respect the decisions of these tribunals, whether they were distasteful to them or not. I have no desire to discuss the merit3 or demerits of any particular case. It is sufficient for me to say that the employers have loyally abided by the decisions given. Even where, under an award, wages, in their opinion, have been unduly raised, they have not hesitated to pay the increased rates; when certain restrictions have been placed upon them they have been prepared to conform to them, and have endeavoured to carry out the principles laid down. We now havevi Federal tends towards centralization rather than decentralization. We see in this Federal legislation the cloven hoof. An endeavour is being made by means of it to bring the huge industrial operations of this continent within the control of one central Court. The desire seems to be that the Federal Parliament shall hold these vast industrial operations within the hollow of its hand, and that every industrial dispute shall be determined by one central Court. In Australia, with its vast expanse of country, its varying climatic conditions and conditions of employment, it seems to me a most hazardous procedure to draw the whole industrial centre. Only one section of the community considers that a wise course. Those who have had experience of the Wages Board system say they are perfectly satisfied with the decentralized scheme for which it provides. The Wages Boards, by reason of the limitations to the disputes ""which come before them, and by reason also of their environment, well able to understand and to deal with local conditions. make this drastic departure? to overturn legislation of the States, and to adopt this system of centralization? wish to criticise the judgments High Court. Far be it for me to say that any of its judgments display any partisan spirit. standing of the Attorney-General, such a marked anxiety, and so much fervour in his efforts to take away from the State Courts matters of social concern which can best be dealt with by them. in which month, that two held that there was a It was recognised that the Queensland industrial Acts enabled a case which wholly concerned the State to be properly dealt with by a State tribunal; deavour was made to manufacture a case that would come within the cognisance of the Federal tribunal. a remedy from the local authorities, effort was made to discover a method of bringing authorities. South Wales and Victoria to arrange a combination, so that it might be claimed that the dispute was one which could come before the Federal Chief Justice, however, held that the High Court could not allow an organization to get round the law by devious and winding means. that the Federal Court could not be used for trying cases which could be surely and quickly settled in the Courts of the States. preference to unionists. urged by the Attorney-General good Labour supporters that, in granting preference ference to the best workmen in the particular trade concerned. has been repeatedly used both here and on the public platform. that preference is necessary to secure the employment under the Bill preference may be given to the members of an organization Mr P. P. Abbott. may include among their number persons are who are not connected with the trade or industry affected. Surely that strikes at Is it wise, therefore, to what has been given as the main reason Is it wise for preference. An organization may the social and industrial consist of painters, poets, politicians, policemen, lawyers, doctors, clergymen, I have no and even ladies. It may contain memof the bers who are not connected with any particular trade, but have joined an organization to further their own particular But there seems to be some outends. When an organization contains object in view, on the part members who not only are not the best when he displays workmen in the trade with which it is connected, but perhaps have no knowledge even of that trade, it surely has no right to preference of employment on the score that, by giving preference, you provide In the celebrated Tramways case, for the employment of the best workjudgment was given last men. Clause9 provides that an employer four of the Justices declared shall not dismiss an employee because the there was no dispute, while latter is an officer or a member of an organization or of an association that bar dispute. applied to be registered, and clause 2 speaks of industrial disputes submitted to the Court by an organization or by an association registered for the time being but every enas an organization. Clearly the object is to get round the decision of the High Courti n the Tramways case. That case Instead of seeking revealed the existence of a make-believe every organization or association. When its books and records were produced and the case before the Federal scrutinized, it was discovered that it was Officials were sent to New not an association registered in accordance with the Act, but that it had endeavoured and to bolster up rules, to obtain legislation for the sole purpose of bringing a case before the Arbitration Court. If we pass the B ill as it stands, Arbitration Court. The we shall give a premium to irresponsible make-believe associations, and enable them to get the benefit of awards which should be granted only to bond fide associations.

The provisions of the B ill and other chiefly affecting the public at large are those of clause 5, regarding disputes. A t to unionists, you grant prethe present time the Commonwealth A r b i tration Court can deal only w it h disputes That argument extending beyond the limits of one State. It may be said that it is hard for an It has been said organization to have to prove that a dispute which it wishes to refer to the Fedeof the best workmen. But ral Court extends beyond one State. The Tramways case was a striking instance of who the law's delays, occupying as it did a year and nine months before various tribunals, both claimants and respondents being put to great expense in witnesses' costs and counsels' fees. After the case had been fought on its merits for a long time, the point was raised at the eleventh hour that the dispute in question could not extend beyond one State, and was, therefore, not within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. It is reasonable that a point like that should ance? I hope that when we get into be settled by an interlocutory action before the application is dealt with on its merits. We on this side are not so narrow-minded that we would refuse to facilitate decisions on important questions. But every endeavour had been made in the Tramways case to bring the dispute before the Federal tribunal, perhaps because it was thought that better forensic ability was there displayed, or that the Court was in a better position to deal with the big questions involved than the State tribunal; or perhaps to get the imprint of greater validity on the decision. Labour party in office previously passed industrial legislation in order to have questions of paramount importance dealt with by the Federal tribunal, and they rehonorable friends opposite some food for cognised that the door was then open for review of the decision of that Court by the Full Court. An appeal to the Privy Council is the right of every British subnot be unwise to pass the provisions sugject, from the man in the mansion of the rich to the man in the humblest dwelling of the poor; and that right has been exerhigher tribunal. As to clauses 4 and 5, cised in regard to questions which, while perhaps involving only a few pounds, also involved some great principle. however, although we are living in a Democracy, and honourable members opposite are always speaking and prating about their democratic ideals, we have legislation confining an application under the arbitration law to a single Judge of the High Court sitting in Chambers. This Judge is to be permitted to decide matters which may involve thousands of pounds and the livelihood of thousands of men-whic h may involve invested capital amounting to hundreds of thousands of pounds, while the decision may make or unmake an industry-withou t any right -of appeal to the High Court or the Privy Council. Whether that Judge be right or wrong, the parties concerned must abide by his decision. questions of law are, after all, questions [35] of opinion. In the Queensland Tramways case, some of the leading intellectual lights on the Bench decided that there was a dispute, while others, perhaps of equal ability, decided that there was no dispute.; and I ask whether it is reasonable and proper, under the circumstances, to place it in the power of one man, who is, possibly, not infallible, to deal with matters of, perhaps, even greater importCommittee this particular clause will receive closer attention. Of course, it is quite possible that honourable members on either side may be altogether wrong in the view they take of the proposed amendments. Honourable members opposite may be quite mistaken in the idea that they have taken a road which will lead to industrial peace and the alleviation of industrial distress; while we, on the other hand, may be quite wrong in seeking to defeat the proposals before us. But, whether we are right or wrongThe members of the though I say we are right-the object of debating the second reading, if no other is attained, is to throw light on the problems before us, and to give our reflection. I ask them to view the matter from an absolutely unbiased point of view, and to consider whether it would gested here, and, above all, to take away that much-prized right of appeal to the which deal with the question of the existence of disputes extending beyond the Now, limits of any one State, we know that the matter has been under the consideration of the Judges for ten years; and that in the most recent case they were unable to arrive at a unanimous decision. I should like to direct the attention of honourable members to clause 8, in which an endeavour is made to overturn certain fundamental principles of common law, as apart from Statute law. This clause is intended to amend section 29 of the Act, and paragraph ba provides that the award of the Court shall be binding, not only on the parties before the Court itself, but "" any successor, or any assignee, or transmittee of the business concerned."" This seems to me to be a new Many of these departure, particularly in regard to arbitration; and I ask the Attorney General to consider whether it would not have the effect of abrogating certain comof those past fights is being besmudged mon law rights, and prove to be absoand besmirched when they are accepting lutely unconstitutional.

ABBOTT vour to do so. a system of Syndicalism does not creep into our legislation. There is an organization commonly called the Workers Union, which includes in its membership people of many different callings, employers as well as employees, and if it is allowable to alter the name of an organization, and to embrace different unions in certain groups, we shall be building up associations on tbe same lines as the Australian Workers Union, and will be permitting what is really a quick-time march towards Syndicalism. Surely, in a country such as Australia, we do not believe in organizations of that character. Do they benefit their members? they improving the conditions of the workers themselves ? that when we allow those associations to group together into one vast organization, we are really building up a system of Syndicalism, not on the same lines as in Continental countries, where such bodies are being created in opposition to the law, but by statutory rights conferred by this Parliament ? This is a matter which should be considered seriously, because its effects may be very far reaching. should establish continental conditions in this country, and give a premium to organizations to set up a system of Syndicalism, under the authority of a Statute. Is not this measure one of the most one-sided pieces of class legislation ever submitted in this Parliament? The Conciliation and Arbitration Act has been tested from many stand-points, and, as a measure to secure industrial peace, which was professedly the sole object of its introduction, it has broken down repeatedly. W ill honourable members opposite contend that this B ill is not quite unfair to employers, or that it does not place them in an invidious and deplorable position? Is not its sole object to promote the interests of one section of tbe community by disregarding the interests of another? One of the objects of this kind of legislation should be to minimize as far as possible the inconvenience to tbe public arising from industrial dis[ 3 5 ] -2 putes; but will not this B ill have a tendency in the opposite direction ? It is an indication of what employers will have fco put up with. If this B ill is passed, and I ask him to deal with general it is made possible to give such great powers fco organizations under it , what I shall endeasort of a poultice can the employers of We must be careful that Australia expect if the Attorney-General is able to carry his contemplated amendments of the Constitution ? The outstanding purpose of this measure is to absorb the whole of the industrial legislation of the States. Is that a wise thing to do? If honourable members believe in centralization and unification, they will regard that as a right thing to do, but if they believe in decentralization and the conservation of State rights, they will do nothing to intensify the existing evil. Our High Court is above suspicion. Its personnel meets with the approval of every fair-minded man, whether he agrees with all its decisions or not. We should leave Are ifc untrammelled. We should not attempt in any way to fetter its operation. HavDoesi t not mean ing informed the High Court of its duties and responsibilities under fche Constitution, we should nofc now endeavour to pass legislation which is an attempt to clip its wings. When the services of the H i gh Court are invoked, we should not by our legislation prevent that tribunal dealing with questions of prohibition which might involve the future well-being and destiny of the major portion of the workers of this community. [4.16] I had intended to address myself to the second reading of this B ill , but the ukase issued by the Prime Minister makes it quite impossible for me to do so if the usual termination of the week's work is to be respected. If honourable members are to address themselves to this B ill at this stage, they must remain in Melbourne over the week-end. That is what the ukase of the Prime Minister really means. I say that it is most unfair to attempt in dealing with a Bill of this kind to bludgeon it through in the way now proposed. It embraces questions which are amongst the most ticklish and delicate with which we have to deal, and their f u l l discussion should not be prevented by any Government in any circumstances whatever.

I am calling in question what His Honour said: and I think that the Chief Justice has held that the judgments of the H i g h Court are in no way sacrosanct, b u t may be traversed by Parliament, and even by the public outside, to one's heart's content, so long as the personality of the Judiciary is l e f t alone.

If any one is responsibly, for this Justice coming under criticism, surely it is the Minister who quotes him in favour of something that he is doing. However, I leave the matter. My point is that, while a case is pending-and if there is any urgency in the matter it must arise out of something which is pending-w e should not have this B ill introduced.

There are statements circulating through tlie Chamber that the B ill is necessary because of a particular case pending in the Court; but again we are not allowed to discuss that aspect, because the case is said to be sub judice. The introduction of legislation for the purpose of correcting anything .that has arisen during the course of a judicial in quiry outrages one's sense of propriety, and should not occur i u a free and Democratic Parliament. Our Constitution lays down definitely and clearly the position of the Judicature, which is as much a part of the Constitution as is Parliament or the Executive. Mr P. P. ABBOTT It is a case of passing a good law to win a bad case. Passing a law to win any case means that the law in itself must be bad. cannot be a good motive prompting it .

He can speak to the amendment, but must confine his remarks to it . An y further remarks thab he wants to make he must make in his speech in reply on the main question. The Attorney-General was apparently prepared at this stage to state the reasons for the urgency of the measure, which I and others interested in the amendment are anxious to hear, and it is a great disappointment to me that his remarks were interrupted. I leave it at that. Amendment negatived torney-General) [4.33] I wish, in order that honourable members may not be unnecessarily delayed, to deal very shortly with the main criticisms directed against the B ill and the Government's introduction of it . As to the urgency of the measure, I said, on the second reading, that this arose from the recent decision of the High Court in the Tramways case. Practically every amendment proposed in the B ill has been suggested by one of the Justices or the Registrar of the Court. In particular the amendments in clauses 5 and 12 are urgently necessary. Three of the Justices of the High Court have declared amendment necessary in th© most positive fashion. Mr Justice Isaacs, in his judgment in the Tramways prohibition case, suggested that the Legislature should give jurisdiction to the Arbitration Court under the Judicature chapter of the Constitution to decide what is a dispute. Mr Justice Powers, in the same case, saidI do not see how the work of the Arbitration Court can be continued on present lines after the decision in this case until the Act is amended, and I felt it my duty, therefore, ns Deputy-President of the Court, to point the position out at some length. given about six weeks ago. Mr Justice Higgins has over and again declared tbe necessity for an amendment on these lines. The present position of the Court is obviously hopeless. So much for the amendment in clause 5 of the B ill . Clause 12 has been the object of some special kind of criticism, in which the honourable member for Wentworth was the standard-bearer. To that kind of If I permitted that criticism I take the strongest exception. He said, in so many words, that the object of the Government in introducing the measure was to interfere improperly with the processes of the Court, to taint the fountains of justice. He attributed to the Government motives of the most contemptible character. These insinuations and hints as to what rumour is saying are absolutely without foundation. I resent them most strongly. I repudiate them. They are unworthy of every man who has uttered them, except the honourable member for Wentworth. Attorney-General's insult in order? I am personally not concerned with the opinion of the honourable member, but I draw attention to the remark in order that we may bave something like reasonable feeling in the House. the honourable member said at the time, but if he said anything offensive to another honourable member I am sure he will withdraw it . gather from the honourable member's remarks whether he objects to being considered worthy or unworthy of this thing, but I withdraw it . I come again to the reasons actuating the Government in introducing this B ill , and in. particular to clause 12. I have here the report of tbe Registrar of the Court as presented to the last Government, but not acted upon by them nor published by them. It contains this statementThe President has frequently commented on the fact that, under section 60 of the Act, as it stands nt present, it is mandatory for the Court to order that the registration of an organization be cancelled under certain circumstances. In his judgment in the case of the application of a cancellation of the Actors Union, the President saidIn this case I am compelled to do a stupid piece of injustice. No one has been hurt by the mistake, and all the material W h a t date? objections would be dealt with, if this objection were not taken; but I am obliged to {rive effect to the objection because it is taken. . . . The Act says that the Court shall order cancellation if it appears to the Court that an organization has been registered erroneously or by mistake. . . . I have no discretion.

361,Mr Hughes,"I am unable tofor being forced into the position; but it This amendment is, in its very nature, . is my duty to obey tlie Act at all costs, ancl 1 sliall order that the registration of thc organization be cancelled. A slight amendment of section 60 would overcome the difficulty referred to by the President, and provision might be made that the cancellation may be ordered if the Court see fit. .Section 60 provides that if the Court, on the application of any organization or of the Registrar, thinks that for any reasons the registration of an organization ought to be cancelled, or that an organization has been registered erroneously, As clause 60 of the Act stands the President of the Court has no discretion, and ifc has compelled the Court, as we have .seen in the Actors Union case, to perpetuate an acfc of stupid injustice. In the Federated Miners' case fche position was, if anything, worse. There, the Deputy President had to order the cancellation of an organization whose only f a u lt was that ifc had not made provision for the investment of its funds. But this is a purely internal matter which did not concern the employers or the public. Court, however, had to cancel the registration of that organization, and the effect of that cancellation was to gravely menace industrial peace. It was with the greatest difliculty that industrial strife was prevented. Such a position is in the last degree undesirable, and quite incompatible with the principle upon which the Act rests. We have created a Court to prevent and settle industrial disputes. We ask every organization to register. We ask every organization that can do so to go before that tribunal, to lay its disputes before it , and to abide the result. But no organization can file a plaint nor enjoy the benefits of any award unless it is registered. To cancel the registration of an organization is therefore to put it -outside the pale of the Court. It has no alternative if it wants redress; ifc must strike. That is the present position. It is a most undesirable one. And now to the remedy. We propose to restore to the President the discretion he exercised It is not desired to introduce any novel principle. It is not intended to make an assault upon the judicial power of the President"". It is not proposed to l i m it his authority. On the contrary, it is proposed to extend it . strictly conformable to the basic principle underlying the exercise of the judicial function. jected to that particular amendment. fchis particular amendment does is to restore the law as it was from 1904 to 1911. The objection has been raised thafc this law should not apply fco a pending case. The public is asked to believe that this is a monstrous perversion of what is right and proper. It is said the Court shall cancel it . to be unprecedented, and our honourable friends opposite profess to be horrified. ought to have been told about it . fco the right honourable member. Some unsophisticated persons in this assembly may be horrified. Some may pretend to regard this as an innovation. But fchere is no better settled principle of law than that an amendment in procedure applies immediately, nor is fchere any reason, generally, and certainly not in The fchis case, why that principle should not apply. There is now filed, we are told, an application for the cancellation of the registration of a certain organization. Whether thafc organization has or has nofc done anything wrong is not for us, bufc for the Court, to determine. But the point I desire to emphasize is that the Court, as at present constituted, must order the cancellation of that registration, no matter whether it thinks that it should be cancelled or not. It has no option. important part of the B ill . is. But certain most objectionable criticisms have been directed against it . I shall come to the more important provisions later on. I am dealing with, this point merely because it has been, urged as one reason why the B ill should nofc pass. I was informed that if the Government would consent fco attach to this proposed amendment of the principal Act a proviso that it should not apply under the Act of 1904-11. fco fchis case no opposition would be offered to the B ill . I wish fche position occupied by the Government in this matter to be clearly understood. We are acting upon the recommendation of the Registrar.

If he thinks the certificate ought to be cancelled, let him cancel it ; if he thinks it ought not to be cancelled, let him not do so. power to deal with, the matter on its merits, and as justice dictates, that this particular amendment is being proposed. I come now to clause 5. The honourable member for Plinders brings to the criticism of every measure affecting the Constitution ingenuity of his well-trained mind. He has done so in this ease. I had hoped for some assistance from him, and in the earlier part of his speech we were promised it. said that the first part of the clause was distinctly good. TJnhap-pily he damned the second part with such unsparing emphasis as to leave us no hope, and to create in the minds of the community the impression that their last condition would be worse than their first. Accords, ing to the honourable and learned member the amendment will effect nothing, and is a delusion and a snare. I cannot agree with him. Let us take his objections to clause 5. The first part, which provides for a submission to the High Court to judicially decide th© question of what is a dispute the honourable member for Flinders regards as desirable. I think we all do. The question whether that decision should be final and irrevocable, however, is another matter. We think it should be final. The honourable gentleman says that hy no means at our disposal can we make the decision final. He says that the power of the High Court to issue a writ of prohibition cannot be ousted, and that prohibition will lie against a Justice of the High Court, as well as against the Arbitration Court. He, however, went on to say that, in this case, the writ would b© useless, because the Judge will have decided the question before the writ can issue. Mr Hughes. agree with either contention. Let us ask ourselves first whether prohibition can be granted by the High Court against a Justice of that Court acting under the Bill, or against the Arbitration Court An when the latter is making an award, or after it has made an award, based on a decision of the High Court under the Bill that an industrial dispute exists. It may be admitted that the High Court has already determined that a writ of prohibition will lie against a judicial oflicer, but that a Justice of the High Court is a judicial officer has not been determined. The honourable member for Flinders says It is to restore to the Court the that an attempt is being made to evade the Constitution by providing that a writ of prohibition cannot effectively lie against a Justice of the High Court exercising jurisdiction under the Bill, because such a Justice will have done his work before the writ can be issued, and the all the subtlety and matter will be res judicata. My reply to that objection is that it took the Arbitration Court ninety-three days to get at the facts in the Tramways case, and that the Full Court was further engaged for The honourable gentleman twenty-three in considering whether there was a dispute which would give the Arbitration Court jurisdiction. We must assume, therefore, that the business of th© Justice of the High Court engaged in deciding whether a dispute existed would not be concluded within so short a period that an application for a writ of prohibition could not be made and granted, and theJustice restrained before a decision had been arrived at. So much for that contention, which must, in my opinion, fail. But I do not admit that a writ of prohibition can lie against a Justice of the High Court. I ask the honourable member to cite a case in which a writ of prohibition has been issued against a Court of unlimited jurisdiction. He will find it difficult to support his argument on this point. At page 489 of volume 10 of the Encyclopaedia of the Laws of England it is stated thatThe writ of prohibition is a prerogative writissued out of a Court of superior jurisdiction, and directed to the Judge of an inferior Court. In Halsbury's Laws of England, volume10, page 141, I find thatThe writ of prohibition is a prerogative writ, I do not issuing out of the High Court of Justice, and directed to an ecclesiastical or inferior temporal. Court, which forbids such Court to continue proceedings therein in excess of its jurisdiction or in contravention of the laws of the land. So far as I have been able to ascertain, the -writ of prohibition lies in every case from a superior to an inferior Court, an inferior Court being a Oourt of limited jurisdiction. What is an inferior Court? Halsbury's Laws of England, page 150, saysA Court is an inferior Court for the purpose of prohibition whenever its jurisdiction is limited. The jurisdiction of the High Court is not limited, and, therefore, a writ of prohibition will not lie against a Justice of that Court. Again, there is no authority for the statement, made with such assurance by the honourable gentleman, that a writ of prohibition can be directed by a Court against itself. prohibition is based on the prerogative right of the Crown, and if the honourable gentleman's contention can be sustained, it amounts to this: that a writ of prohibition can be issued by the Crown against itself. A writ of mandamus will not lie against the Crown, because it cannot be enforced by attachment, and the same thing applies to a writ of prohibition. Does the honourable gentleman say that a writ of prohibition by the High Court will lie against that Court itself ? If so, where does he get authority for the statement ? Sir WILLI AM IBVINE to answer these questions when we are dealing with the clause. man devoted a great deal of time to destructive criticism of the Bill, and it is, therefore, important to show that the clause has a reasonable chance of being regarded as valid by the High Court. It has been asserted by members who say just what occurs to them at the moment that we have brought in the Bill well knowing that it must be futile. That is not so. The Bill has been introduced as a result of recommendations and suggestions by the Justices, and after very careful consideration. We have not been able to follow precisely the form of amendment suggested by the Justices. But I believe the amendment put forward will do what is desired. So far as I know it is valid, and will be effective, but in the light of past experience neither my assurance to that effect nor that of tlie honourable gentleman to the contrary is conclusive. I come now to the second contention of the honourable and learned gentleman, that a writ of prohibition would lie under the Bill against the Arbitration Court when the Court is proceeding to act on the decision of the High Court that an industrial dispute exists. I cannot agree with thisview. I would point out that the issue, of the writ under such circumstances would be, in effect, an appeal from the decision of theJustice of the High Court. The existence of an industrial dispute having been judicially determined by the High Court,, the matter would be res judicata, and the High Court would refuse to entertain proceedings to again decide the same question. But even if prohibition would lie. The writ of to the Arbitration Court when that Court was proceeding to act on a decision of the High Court that an industrial disputeexisted, the issue of the writ would be discretionary where the absence or excess of jurisdiction was not apparent on the face of the pleadings, and it would not ordinarily be patent. The issue of the writ would, therefore, be discretionary, and there are special reasons, which do not at present exist in connection with the issue of prohibition by the High Oourt and the Arbitration Court, why the High Court should not exercise its discretion I shall attempt to issue the writ. In the first place, there would have been a judicial determination of the question. That determination would be a determination of the High Court itself. By the issue of the writ, the High Court would, in effect, be calling in question a previous decision of the Court, and it has in a number of cases shown itself loth to overrule its prior decisions. Therefore, I contend that, even if the High Court will, under the Bill, have jurisdiction to issue writ of prohibition, it will not, in the circumstances, issue such a writ. There is one other matter that I wish to mention. It has been suggested by, I think, the honourable member for Balaclava that section 55 of the Act ought not to be amended so as to include officers of organizations who are not at that time employees. He was good enough to tell us that we were departing from some sound and well-established principle in.",43,Willi Am Ibvine Ma Y I Say A He Is Simply Stating That There Is Such A

It is well established in this country that in nearly all organizations of any size the proceedings and business are conducted, almost without exception, by persons who are not employed in an industry. ployers' organizations, but with this difference, that the employer is, by virtue of his circumstances, in a position to employ a secretary who is not engaged in the business from which the gets his livelihood, but who, less, is thus in the employ employer. the employees. fore, naturally tary a person who is able to carry on the business of the organization, in order to enable him to have the time to do this, and to be independent of the censure and influence of an they insist upon him leaving his former employment in order to carry on his secretarial work and no other work. a sensible and even necessary and no one who understands the matter will find any fault with it. And now to another matter. Something has been said about Wages Boards. compared advantageously tion Courts. comparison are entirely ignorant of tbe basic difference which exists between the two systems. disputes, the other has no power to deal -with thevn at all; that is a basic difference. others. But tliis one is fundamental. work of Wages Boards as existing in Victoria cannot be compared with that of the Arbitration serted that on one hand you have a Judge who knows nothing of the circumstances of an industry, while on the other hand you have three employees and three employers, who, familiar with all the facts, and seized of every detail of the industry, terms of an agreement. This is the theory. But the facts shed a suggestive upon it. I have here some of the reports of Wages Boards presented to the Parliament of Victoria in the second session of 1901. Two facts emerge. One is that the representatives of the employers and Mr Hughes. the the employees never settle anything. In rested. 90 per cent, of tlie cases it is the chairman, who knows nothing about the matter under consideration, who settles it . So much for that point. Next, as regards expedition, the Arbitration Court, restricted in its jurisdiction, hampered by technicalities, the approach to which is hedged The same thing applies to emabout by a veritable Serbonian bog, barbed-wire entanglements, and what not, is expedition itself compared w i th the Wages Boards. Here are some of the facts. The Aerated Water Trade employer Boardtook eleven months to gestate. nevertheThe Agricultural Implements Board of his started on the ISth September, 1906, and That cannot be so with arrived at their goal in A p r i l , 1909The employees, therethat is a period of two years and six appoint as a secremonths from the time from which they had lightheartedly set out.

The Brass Workers Board took two years and eight months. The Carriage Board-thi s fact This is ought to be pasted in the hat of every adprocedure, vocate of Wages Boards throughout Victoria-starte d in 1901, and in 1909 they had not yet come to a determination. Expedition, thy name is Wages Boards! The They have been Clothing Board were relatively an express with ArbitraBoard, for they arrived at something like Those who make such a a conclusion in thirteen months. The Fellmongers Board started on the l l t h October, 1900, and the determination One deals with industrial came into force on the 15th May, 1904that is, after a period of three years and seven months. The Ironmoulders Board There are, of course, very many took two years and ten months; the The Underclothing Board, two years and eight months; and the Woollen Trade Board, two years and seven months. There are Court. It has been asother Boards, but the facts I have quoted are typical of the whole system. It appears that, so far as expedition is concerned, the Wages Boards do not begin to compare with the Arbitration Court. Let me briefly bring my remarks to a conclusion. This measure has been hammer out expeditiously the introduced to enable the Arbitration Court to exercise its functions, which light now it is unable to do, according to the public, and oft-repeated, declaration of the President and Deputy President. The statement of the latter, made after the Tramways case, is, in itself, in my opinion, an amply sufficient reason why tliis everything else and go on with this measure. TheB ill has heen introduced, and ought to he passed, because the amendments it contains are necessary for the effective and expeditious working of the Court. It has been introduced in order that a repetition of the Tramways -case and of such an act of stupid injustice as the cancellation of the registration what they mean. -of an organization which had committed no wrong, shall be no longer possible. I invited honourable gentlemen on the otlier side some suggestions to make the B ill better. I have waited in vain for any such suggestions. .and hostile criticism we have had more than enough; but of one useful suggestion not a trace. We have been told by the honourable members for Flinders, Wimmera, and Balaclava that we ought to amend the Constitution. The last-named member said that I have done nothing to enable this Parliament to establish a system of Wages Boards by an amendment -of the Constitution. That, of course, is a supremely silly statement, because the amendment which was proposed by me on two separate occasions in this House would have given this Parliament power to establish, not a Wages Board system on the lines in Victoria, but an effective Wages Board system, if that was so desired. But we find that honourable gentleman and all those who speak in favour of an amendment of the Constitution vehemently opposed in attitude to amending the Constitution. The honourable member for Flinders is the apostle -of an amendment of the Constitution when he is in Opposition, but the angel with th© flaming sword was not a more effective defender of Paradise than the honourable gentleman is of the Constitution when he is in office. Most emphatically I charge that honourable gentleman with knowing the industrial impotence of the Commonwealth, and with doing nothing to remedy it . He knew before the last election that unti l the Constitution is amended our powers to deal with these matters are quite insufficient. Ho knew that perfectly well. He knew that there was an -opportunity to submit these matters to the electors. He knows that they w ill have to b© submitted to them. He stood up here the other night and said that Parliament sliould lay aside they ought to be so submitted. When, he did not tell us. There is about the lionorable gentleman a chronological imjDotence agreeable. the honourable gentleman's susceptibilities I am sorry, because I am not quite sure A t any rate, they were not intended to be offensive. But the honourable gentleman reminds me of a physician who comes with a bottle of to help us with medicine to one who is ill , but who tells the sufferer neither the amount of the dose nor when it is to be taken. Ar© we Of denunciation constantly to look at the label on th© bottle; are we always to remain in rapt admiration of the cork? Are we never to open the bottle and take the medicine ? Sir WILLIAMIRVINE It is because the bottle is filled with such an unholy mixture that I dislike it . man cannot escape his own constitutional disinclination to do anything "" n o w . "" Whilsti t is perfectly true that the Constitution must be amended, and that this B ill is merely a patchwork measure, the fact remains that it is a necessary one, in order that th© Court may not utterly break down. There is not an amendment proposed in it which is not necessary to cany us on to the time when the people will be afforded an opportunity of altering tbe Constitution. I hope that the B ill will receiv© the support of honourable members, and if we are to have any f u rther criticism of it in Committee, I trust that that criticism will be of such a character as to assist us to make the measure better than it is.

377,Mr Hughes,"He can be prohibitedlengthy one, as a good example. Suppose, in that case, that tlie question of jurisdiction, instead of being reserved by the President to be heard by himself, had been reserved to the High Court, or a Judge of that Court, and it had come before the President or another of the Judges, no Court could prohibit that Judge from dealing with and answering the question of whether there was jurisdiction. answer the question, but, if he answers it wrongly, and if some Court then assumes jurisdiction on the wrong answer, the proceedings of that Court are subject to prohibition by the High Court. That is the point which the Attorney-General seems to have entirely overlooked. The point he brought forward was really irrelevant to my argument. In order to show that the High Court could not issue a mandamus against a Judge of the High Court, the Attorney General cited from passages familiar to all lawyers showing that the prerogative w r it of prohibition only goes from a -superior Court to an inferior Court. That is perfectly true, and absolutely well established; but, unfortunately, the basis of the prohibition in that case, as decided unanimously by the Judgesi n the Tramways case, is that the power of prohibition, where the Constitution is broken, as in the Tramways case, for instance, arises not from common-law right, or the power of issuing a prerogative w r it of mandamus at common law, to which his references were applicable, but from particular provisions of our Constitution, which say that the High Court has, as part of its original jurisdiction, the privilege of issuing a prohibition against any judicial officer. This, as I say, was unnecessary to my argument, but I am still inclined to think-thoug h the matter has never yet been the subject of judicial determination-that , even if the H i g h Court had something else to do that could be prohibited, the High Court, in another jurisdiction, could prohibit it from doing it. Under the clause before us, all the High Court has to do is to answer the question whether or not there is jurisdiction, or, under the amendment, is so-and-so a matter of law. the question after hearing the facts. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE member say that, while he is hearing the facts, an application would not be entertained for a decree nisi? Sir WILLIAMIRVINE No ; he has jurisdiction to entertain and answer a question, and determine a matter of law, but his determination is not final. He cannot be prohibited from answering a question put to him, any more than a The Judge is bound to County Court could be prohibited from proceeding to hear evidence. his decision ? Sir WILLIAMIRVINE No ; because the right of appeal is taken away by the clause. honourable member say there is a remedy against a Justicei f he exceeds his jurisdiction ? Sir WILLIAMIRVINE He does not exceed his jurisdiction at all in answering a question as to whether there is jurisdiction. He may answer rightly or wrongly, but he has jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter. If he does so rightly, there is no prohibition, and, if he determines wrongly, there is still no prohibition against him, but there is a prohibition against the Court which proceeds to act on his determination. Court power to determine or review a question that a Justice has settled ? Sir WILLIAMIRVINE To review a question ? his decision, or to prevent his Court being fche final one in regard to the matter ? Sir WILLIAMIRVINE The H i g h Court does not, and under the B ill cannot, issue a prohibition against a H i g h Court Judgef or determining whether there is jurisdiction. I have always said that, because there is nothing to prohibit. He has to answer a question.

384,Mr Hughes,"The honourable memberTramways case it was on an application for prohibition. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE cation for a prohibition, not against the H i g h Court Judge, but against the A r b i tration Court. That is the whole point. The only Court you can prohibit from doing something is the Court that has the power to do something. SupposeI am a Judge, and the Legislature says that, before I decide to hear a case, I must ask the Attorney-General whether I have the right to decide. The Attorney General says I have the right, and I resolve to deal with the matter. No order of prohibition can lie against him, because he has only answered a question; the prohibition will lie against me for doing something that was wrong. I say that in stopping, or pretending to stop, an order of prohibition against a decision of a High Court Judge, you do not in any way affect the jurisdiction of the H i g h Court, either then or ultimately, either on the same materials or on other materials. that this Parliament has no power to circumvent what has already been done. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE thing this Parliament cannot circumvent is the Constitution, and the Constitution says that the High Court is the final arbiter in the case of any other authority transgressing tbe bounds of the Constitution. I should not speak strongly on this question unless I felt clearly that I am right. As to one point to which the honourable member referred, I do not wish to be understood to be expressing a strong opinion. That is as to whether, if a High Court Judge were to be given fche right to carry out a decree, the H i g h Court in another capacity would issue prohibition. question does not arise in this case, because all fche High Court has to do is to decide a question of law. proper remedy of the High Court against the Arbitration Sir WILLIAMIRVINE tration Court is a tribunal which not only pronounces a decree, but carries it into effect. If its decree is not obeyed, the offender is brought up and fined, or, perhaps, put in gaol. It is these subsequent orders that are prohibited. That is the whole effect of a w r it of prohibition. Now you have prevented the issue of a writ of prohibition against a Court that has nothing to do except answer a question, An applileaving the H i g h Court with the f u l l authority which it has now to issue prohibition against the Court thafc carries out the award, even if it does so on the authority of a wrong decision of the H i gh Court itself. fche same as if a Judge of the Arbitration Court proceeded straight away with the case, and determined the question of jurisdiction wrongly. ' Sir WILLIAMIRVINE T h a t is the position. I make this statement, not aggressively, but with all due respect to the position which the Attorney-General occupies.

It does not seek to enable any person I who happens to be casually passing along to file a plaint which will be deemed to have been filed by an organization, nor does it say that this is conclusive evidence that the plaint was filed by the organization concerned. The purpose of the clause is to do something very different. All that this clause does is to provide that any plaint that has been before the Court, or is to be before the Court, and has complied with the requirements of the Act sliall be deemed to have been duly filed. Thab is a sound principle. The question arose in the Tramways case.

I dealt on the second reading with the advisableness of having in the A ct a clause similar to that which appears in the Western Australian Act, and, I believe, in the New South Wales Act. This is, to a great extent, copied from the Western Australian provision, where we have in the reports published by the Registrar each year f u l l and detailed statements of the receipts and expenditure of tire various organizations working under the Act. Section 72 of the Commonwealth A ct makes provision for accounts being submitted to the Registrar, but nothing is said as to the details of the accounts or their publication.

Section 60 of the Commonwealth Act requires that the accounts of organizations shall be duly audited, in pursuance of the rules; and thafc if they are not audited, or if fchey do not disclose the true financial position of the organization, cancellation may take place; bufc, so far, no rules have been prescribed requiring the returns to be made.

In schedule B of the Act of 1904-11 it is set forth thatThe affairs of the association shall be reguvides, have never been prescribed. lated by rules specifying the purposes for which it is formed, and providing for the following matters in relation to the association. . . . :(h) The mode in which the property is to be controlled and the funds invested. (i) The yearly or other more frequent audit of the accounts. (j) The conditions under which funds may be disbursed for ordinary ond extraordinary purposes That, I think, is fairly wide. It is perfectly obvious that the reason actuating our honourable friends opposite in pressing this amendment is that they desire to find out to what extent the unions use their money for political purposes. that the community has not a righ t to know what every organization does with its money. I am rather inclined to t h in k that it has; but we must decide fairl y by all parties. make each individual employer state what he does with his money. He may employ a thousand men. Those men must tell the world what they do with their money; but he is not asked to do so. Take the case of Rockefeller. He employs a great many miners in Nevada. They belong to a union. Possibly they spend their money for, amongst other things, political purposes. They have to disclose that fact, but disclose the fact that he spends money in hiring Pinkerton irregular soldiers to go down to Nevada with machine guns and shoot the miners down. It is said that one organization of employers in this country spent £50,000 to defeat our referenda. thing about that. could show us some constitutional means whereby we could discover how every pershould be satisfied. son spent the money which he devoted to political purposes, I should agree to this amendment; b u t since that cannot be done, I cannot accept this proposal. The Attorney-General is trying to draw a red herring across the trail. There is nothing in my amendment suggesting that we want to know how ithe unions use their money for political purposes. It is only fair that an organization protected by the laws of the Commonwealth should submit from time to time to the Registrar a properly audited statement of its accounts. The regulations in this respect, for which the principal Act proThe amount which every organization expends by way of benefits bo,.its members should be known to the public. As I pointed out this afternoon, 78 per cent, of the total money contributed by industrial unions in the Old Country is returned to the members by way of benefits. In New South Wales, however, only 12£ per cent., and in Western Australia only 19 per cent., of the contributions of members is returned to them as benefits. These audited returns are required under the State Acts, and should be required under this law. The illustration cited by the Attorney-General as to the use to which Rockefeller may put his money is quite I am not going to say beside the mark. I desire, by leave, to amend my amendment by substituting for the word "" union "" the word "" organization,"" so that every organization registered under the Act shall be compelled to We have no power to furnish returns. Amendment, by leave, amended accordingly. The honourable member for Dampier evidently fails to distinguish between a Trade UnionA c t and an Arbitration Act. II we were dealing with a Trade UnionB ill requiring the registration of organizations, his amendment probably would Rockefeller is not compelled to be legitimate and proper; but we are dealing with a measure for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes, and I should like to know how any question as to the way in which the funds of an organization are spent could assist in the settlement of an industrial dispute.

I may not be present at the sittings next week; but the order of business will be, after the disposal of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, the consideration of the Lands Acquisition Bill, the Customs Bill, and the other measures of Government business as they stand on the notice paper. [6.30] I address myself to the Prime Minister in connection with the peculiar position that we are in to-day. I wish to be loyal to my leader; but if we are going to have many repetitions of what has taken place to-day, I am afraid that I shall have to kick over the traces. recognise that the Opposition is justified in fighting in its party interests, and for the policy that its members have placed before the country; but it should not contribute to the discomfort of the House generally more than is necessary. The members of the Opposition cannot properly be subjected to criticism as to the discomfort that they may have caused members generally, when they have merely done their duty by the electors who sent them here. I have warned the honourable member for Wentworth against taking the course he has just taken. He rose in the middle of another honourable member's speech to make a statement which he had no right to utter. He did not attempt to place a point of order before the Chair. If that sort of thing is continued, I shall have to take steps to prevent the honourable member. I intended to submit to you, sir, and which I thought I had done, was that it was no more in order for fche honourable member fco say that the Opposition had contributed to the discomfort offcheHouse than it would have been for him to say that we had been ""stone-walling"" the passage of the Bill. able member has not even now taken a point of order. to whether the honourable member is in order in stating that members of the Op[6.29] I position, by what they have done, have contributed to the discomfort of the House? ber for Melbourne Ports has made no statement which I can rule out of order. Opposition are justified in taking any stand they like within the limits of the Standing Orders, and they have, done so to-day. It has been the custom with most bonorable members to assist one another so far as the meeting of their personal comfort is concerned. The position would be different if the Opposition had intended to fight the measure right through, but they waited till honourable members had missed their train, and then they climbed down. If the Opposition I adopt that attitude on any future occasion, I shall expect the Prime Minister fco help me in contributing towards the comfort of those who desire to leave Melbourne.

MALONEY (Melbourne) [6.35] I want to make a protest, after reading in the Papuan Times an article stating that a European had been tried for his liberty without a jury. If what is stated there is true, he well deserved the punishment. I never heard before that a man could be hanged and remain alive for six hours. I have very much doubt about the accuracy of the evidence which was given. I have no objection to any of my letters being censored, but I think it would be well if a censor was sent from tbe Intelligence Department, so that honourable members could have their letters opened and sent here in as little time as possible. . Strange to say, the letter I hold in my hand carried a protest against the liberty of a white man being endangered without a resort to the fundamental basis of the English law, namely, trial by jury. He was accused of hanging a native, who, after hanging for six hours, escaped with his life. In the history of this world there is no record of that having ever been done. A doctor has said that it is absolutely impossible that a man could live if that were done. I have heard of. a case where a man, by the exercise of large muscular power, held up his own weight for thirty-eight minutes without being killed. Ultimately he died from practising that which he used to do at a public performance. Thirty-eight minutes was the longest time for which he could remain in that position. I have entered my protest, and I hope that the House will see that every person who is tried for life and liberty shall have the right to demand a trial hy jury. Question resolved in the affirmative.
