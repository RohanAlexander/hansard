296,Many Of You Will Know Of Somebody In Your The Speaker,"Order! It being 8 p.m.,1228 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 13 March 2002 Wednesday, 13 March 2002 ----Electronic Voting garding greater participation in Internet democracy and electronic voting, e-voting. It is again time to say a few words for the record on this matter but probably for different reasons to those that I spoke about in 2000. A number of things have taken place since that time-one in particular is the recent ACT elections, where a system of electronic voting was put into place so that people could use a non-paper based system of voting. I was quite encouraged by this progress. Since 2000 I think there has been a wider acceptance of electronic voting or non-paper voting. There is better technology, and a whole range of changes have taken place. We are probably still a long way from reaching what I would call an optimum solution, but one day we will have a universal system of e-voting-a system whereby greater participation can be had by all members of the community. That is why I particularly wanted to raise this matter again today. A number of constituents in my electorate of Oxley have raised the issues of privacy, anonymity and also dignity in terms of voting. These issues were raised by people who have specific disabilities, particularly those with vision impairment. These people do vote and they take quite seriously their responsibilities and duties to participate in our democracy. What they find objectionable, though, is that there is still no proper procedure in place to give them the same right as every other citizen: that they can cast a vote completely privately without any other person knowing what vote they are casting. As yet, there is really no mechanism for this to take place. I believe the time for change is now. It is time the government seriously took on board the task of investigating ways in which not only people with vision impairment but other people can do this. This would assist those with disabilities or the frail, the aged, people who may not be able to get to polling booths and people who might be working on that day. For whatever reason it may be, we need another system of voting. I believe that now the technology is right, that the integrity of the system could be maintained and that people could be given a greater opportunity to participate in our democracy if those changes were made. There is a variety of ways you could do it: through email, through the Internet, through the phone, through touch screens at all polling booths. We actually have the knowledge. I believe that this system is something that will occur eventually. It will reduce things like paper waste and all of the problems that we have with our current system, even though our current system is very solid. (Time expired) Paedophilia tant issue to our society-and I suppose it has been highlighted in recent times for many reasons-and that is paedophilia. The matter was raised in the Senate last night. I wish today to extend my support to, I think, the growing number of calls for some sort of an inquiry in this country to more broadly examine the issue of child sexual abuse within our society. This issue has been raised and it will continue to be raised because the victims of sexual abuse feel that they have been let down by many levels of institution within the Australian society. I think it is a widely held view that they have been let down-as many other victims of crime have been in our society-by no institution more so than the judiciary. Certainly within my electorate of Dickson there is a growing number of calls for a complete review of the way in which we deal with the judicial system, particularly in the area of crime but also in the area of civil liabilities, as we have seen in recent debate as well.",129,Adjournment Whether It Is Likely That They Or Their Partner

We need to do more for families, because in many cases the offenders in this heinous crime are known to the victim-and in many cases that comes essentially from the breakdown of the family unit. So we have some societal changes that I think we need to explore in more depth in the years to come. A good starting point for us would be to investigate the very real possibility of an inquiry and the conclusions that may come out of some sort of an independent inquiry. In my home state of Queensland, we have a government which is particularly weak in the area of law and order. That is widely accepted in Queensland. I think that at this point in time the question needs to be asked: why? What does the Beattie government have to hide? Why are they afraid to listen to the people of Queensland and implement some sort of a view which is representative of the majority of Queenslanders? The Beattie government in Queensland has been negligent, to say the least, in the way in which they deal with criminals. We have a revolving door system, and paedophilia offenders are only a part of that-obviously the most significant part, because in my opinion there is no crime more abhorrent than child sexual abuse. I think the Beattie government in Queensland needs to get serious and listen to the people in Queensland and start on a process of investigating some of these matters. (Time expired) Ballarat Electorate: Aged Care Ms KING (Ballarat) (9.46 a.m.)-I wish to raise the difficulties rural towns in my electorate appear to be having in getting government assistance to build aged care beds for which they have licences. This creates the inequitable situation where there is reasonable access to aged care facilities in the township of Ballarat, but in the smaller towns of Ballan and Stawell, where there is less capacity to raise capital, there is a shortage of real aged care beds. On 30 January 2002, the Minister for Ageing released the names of successful applicants for the 2001 aged care approvals rounds. Not one facility of the three I want to talk about received funding for capital grants to build the aged care beds for which they have licences. This is despite constant empty rhetoric from the government on its commitment to aged care in rural Australia. In the last federal election, Bronwyn Bishop promised $100 million in additional capital funding that was supposed to result in more beds being built in the bush, and promised that additional funds would assist providers by contributing to the cost of upgrading or replacing existing small aged care homes. The Helen Schutt nursing home in Stawell put forward a quality proposal to the minister for $200,000 to build the facility for five aged care beds for which they had licences. This nursing home is doing all it can to work with the community of Stawell to provide quality aged care facilities. It has raised $300,000 of its own money, and now its application for a capital grant to build the five aged care beds for which it has licences has been refused. The CEO of Stawell Regional Health, Mr Delahunty, wrote to me and stated that the reason for rejection given by the minister was that it is deemed that the facility could raise or borrow the capital needed. Stawell Regional Health has yet again had to ask the people of Stawell to dig deep. The previous Minister for Aged Care, Bronwyn Bishop, attacked the Labor Party over our interest-free loan policy, arguing that grants were more valuable than Labor’s interest-free loans, as providers would not be required to pay any money back. I guess you could argue this if you are actually lucky enough to receive a grant. What happens in the case of Ballan and Stawell? What we have now is the minister rejecting the application for a grant and telling applicants to borrow the money for themselves. These are in small, rural communities that are on low incomes and that do not have the capacity to raise the capital. It is complete hypocrisy. This is not the only applicant in my electorate that has been given the same offhanded response. Applications by the Ballan and Districts Soldiers Memorial Bush Nursing Home and 1230 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 13 March 2002 Eventide Nursing Home in Stawell have also been rejected. The CEO of Stawell Regional Health and I have been seeking an immediate meeting with the minister for over a month to pursue our case. I would like to extend an invitation to the minister to visit Stawell and Ballan to discuss the issue. Dorothy dixers to the Minister for Ageing at question time last session may satisfy the people in some electorates, but all they did was insult the people in mine. Flinders Electorate: Medical Services my electorate of Flinders. Let me begin by saying that I am delighted to be able to announce to the committee that the Australian Locum Medical Service will be commencing on 28 March; a new service within my electorate. This is the result of discussions held between my office and the Australian Locum Medical Service-in particular Mr Bruce Richardson, a senior executive of the Locum Medical Service. This means that, as of 28 March, constituents from within the areas of Mount Martha, Somerville and Hastings will all be able to access a service which they were previously unable to access. After hours they will be able to call a number, which will be provided within the next week, and be able to speak directly to doctors or to staff from the Locum Medical Service. As a result of that, they will be provided with after hours coverage and, if necessary, they will be provided with home treatment. That is a great benefit for the people of those areas. I wish to look further, beyond Hastings, Somerville and Mount Martha, all of which are communities that are going to benefit. This service is to be extended before mid-year to the area of Koo Wee Rup. Koo Wee Rup is an area within our electorate which has a significant array of health and ageing needs. By cooperation with Terrona Ramsay, the CEO of the Koo Wee Rup Hospital, the Australian Locum Medical Service is also going to extend its services there. That is a development of great significance to the people of Koo Wee Rup and Lang Lang, both of which have suffered from a significant shortage of medical facilities. I want to praise the staff of the Koo Wee Rup Hospital and the medical service. They continue to provide an extraordinary service despite significant challenges. This leads to a final question within the electorate of Flinders: the issue of aged care. I am fortunate to be able to say that I met with the Minister for Ageing, Kevin Andrews, this morning. He has agreed to visit the electorate to discuss ageing needs. In the recent funding round there were approvals made for 40 beds at Warley hospital on Phillip Island, which has a significant impact for the people there-20 high-care beds, 10 veterans’ beds and 10 low-care beds. On that basis, I would say there is much to be done within the electorate, but that there are significant strides being made in terms of health and ageing. Greenway Electorate: Dean Park Neighbourhood Development Committee of activities of the Dean Park Neighbourhood Development Committee. This committee is one of a number of such organisations spread throughout the electorate of Greenway, which provides the community with social and practical support. I had the pleasure of attending the AGM of this committee last year, and I congratulate all committee members on their election. On that occasion I presented a number of appreciation certificates to volunteers who were part of the community and who had assisted local residents during the previous 12 months. I want to commend Evelina Flores, the president of the committee, and her outstanding team of committee members and volunteers who work so tirelessly for their local community. Some of the activities of the Dean Park committee during 2001, as identified in the annual report, were the introduction of new group activities including senior groups, folk art, competitions, cultural, recreational and social activities. Ongoing support was also provided to people with disabilities and carer support groups. Other group activities at the centre included the Arabic Women’s Group and the Blacktown Roving Child Care Group.

This has enabled the committee to do in-house much of the work that was previously outsourced, at a considerable saving. One of the major achievements of the committee has been greater involvement in the activities of local communities. Part of the role of the management committee has been to facilitate the work of local organisations such as Neighbourhood Watch, park committees and resident action groups, who have all utilised the facilities of the Dean Park Community Centre. This has enabled the local community to be self-reliant regarding home and personal security, the local environment and also to be proactive in influencing appropriate development in the area. Public meetings on issues affecting the whole community, such as the Western Sydney Orbital, were also held at the centre. Arising out of the orbital meeting, representations were made to the RTA concerning the need for sound barriers to be installed around the Dean Park flyover, the beautification of sound barriers and the need to plant mature trees. A major concern for local residents is the increase in carbon monoxide fumes as a result of the heavy traffic expected on the orbital. The RTA has recognised that these genuine concerns of local residents need to be addressed in the early planning stages of the orbital. The Dean Park Neighbourhood Development Committee is a great example of locals working hard for the betterment of their local communities. I wish them every success in their endeavours in the future. Cutler, Sir Roden, VC, AK, KCMG, KCVO, CBE KCMG, KCVO, CBE, who, sadly, passed away on Thursday, 21 February 2002-an outstanding Australian and a former resident of my electorate of Wentworth. Sir Roden, as the Prime Minister noted in his moving address in the House on Monday, 11 March, at page 827 of Hansard, was born at Manly in New South Wales in 1916 and attended Sydney Boys High School and Sydney University. He first made his mark publicly when in 1941, having joined the Second AIF in 1940. In 1941, while serving in Syria, he won the Victoria Cross for his gallantry. Apart from Sir Roden’s record of gallantry, which is perhaps unparalleled, certainly amongst those of my acquaintance-and bearing in mind there remain alive only two of the 17 Victoria Cross recipients-he was perhaps one of the greatest Australians of his day. I especially wish to mention his public service and his record as a family man. He contributed greatly to the RSL, as the state secretary in New South Wales, and was president of the boy scouts movement. I refer also to his diplomatic service in our high commissions; eventually he served as Ambassador to the Netherlands. Most importantly, he served as Governor of New South Wales under four state premiers. Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, you would have known him well in that capacity. He was highly regarded by all and greatly esteemed in that role. In particular, I note that every Saturday afternoon at Sydney University he would come out, stride across the oval and watch the students play in the first division of the rugby competition in Sydney. He loved his sport. He was an avid watcher and a great supporter of the students. I know they would be very pleased if I recorded that point. Finally, I mention his record as a family man. He had a very close and loving family. I know the family well. I was at school with his son Richard. It is a great loss not just for them but for the whole community. I express my condolences to Lady Cutler, who remains a resident of my electorate. I will end my remarks by saying this: we have lost a great Australian. We may never see the likes of him again but we can be very grateful for the service that he gave to our community.

Incentives) Bill 2002. I speak today with the authority of the Hon. Carmen Lawrence, who has carriage of this matter as the shadow minister but who, unfortunately, cannot be with us this morning due to a conflicting obligation. Labor believes that it is a step in the right direction in restoring Australia’s film industry to its previous important position in the arts in Australia and, indeed, as a very important part of the cultural life of all Australians. In the past our film industry told our Australian stories and interpreted our culture and beliefs to us as Australians and to the rest of the world. Labor wants that to happen again. Under the Howard government, the Australian film industry-like other areas of cultural and creative activity-is struggling. Indeed, some would say it is in crisis. I say this conscious of the magnificent achievements of some of our film-makers-our actors, screenwriters, directors and cinematographers-in the face of incredible difficulties in getting their films, our stories, to the screen. For every Russell Crowe, for every Baz Luhrmann, there are many more struggling artists and technicians who cannot make a go of it, not because of their lack of talent but because the value of their contribution to our cultural life is not recognised by this government. For every young actor or director who leaves Australia for opportunities overseas or whose career remains stalled while waiting on tables or typing interview reports, we are all the poorer. At this point it is appropriate to mourn the passing and celebrate the work of Robin Anderson, one of our great documentary film-makers, who died on 8 March. Who, on this side of the House at least, can forget her unflinching view of local politics as portrayed in Rats in the Ranks. With her husband, Bob Connolly, she also produced First Contact, Black Harvest and Joe Leahy’s Neighbours, about Papua New Guinea, and most recently Facing the Music, about the difficulties experienced in Australian universities and particularly the University of Sydney’s music school. The relevance of Robin Anderson’s work to our consideration of this bill is twofold. First, she has interpreted what it means to be Australian; she has told our stories. Second, she has done it through her own very hard work but also with government assistance. If we are serious about the importance of cultural life in this country, film-making is not an activity that can be left to the market alone. I am sure all members would join with me in expressing their sympathy to Bob and to their daughters, Katherine and Joanna. Labor welcomed the government’s film industry package announced in September last year, and we undertook to implement it if elected. We saw it, though, as an admission of failure by the government, an admission that by its neglect and inactivity over almost six years the film industry was in crisis. At that stage the industry had fragmented into two unconnected parts: the big-budget productions, through which we were running the risk of becoming a Hollywood back lot with very little connection to Australian cultural life; and the low-budget, ‘scrimp and save’ productions running on deferred payments, credit card debt and wages earned in totally unrelated employment. Whatever is one’s view of the merits of artists producing their best work while starving in garrets, this production model does not suit the film industry, particularly the modern, high technology film industry. The Australian film industry does need and deserve government support. It does need a targeted incentive scheme such as the one contained in this bill, and we on this side of the House support the measure. As I have said, it is a step in the right direction. Labor went to the last election supporting the film industry package. We thought it did not go far enough. We thought that the damage that the Howard government had done to the Australian Film Commission and to the Film Finance Corporation needed urgent remedy. We were concerned, and still are concerned, about the government’s apparent willingness to use",133,Representatives Main Committee

Finally, we are very concerned about the government’s funding cuts to the ABC, which has been, amongst its other great qualities, a flagship producer of high quality Australian screen entertainment and culture. So this measure is important and we support it, but there is much more that can and should be done. Turning to the detail of the bill: the bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to create an offset for film production in Australia. It allows an offset of 12.5 per cent for film production in Australia for films which have an Australian production expenditure of greater than $15 million and less than $50 million to spend and which spend 70 per cent of their total expenditure on production in Australia. If the Australian production expenditure is greater than $50 million, the proportion of the total budget spent in Australia is disregarded. The films cannot have received other tax deductions under divisions 10B or 10BA or Film Finance Corporation funding. We note that the financial impact of this measure, as set out in the explanatory memorandum, is considerable, rising from $4.7 million this year to over $53.4 million in 2005-06. As we have indicated, this measure is part of the government’s film industry package. This particular refundable tax offset scheme aims to attract the production of larger foreign films to Australia. The necessity for this arose following rulings of the Australian Taxation Office, which found films such as Moulin Rouge and Red Planet were not eligible for income tax deductions under division 10B. Under division 10B, the cost of a film can be written off over two years and the investor is eligible for tax deductions for securing copyright for an Australian film. It is a measure designed to encourage film investment in Australia. But the ATO found that films funded under arrangements such as these were not eligible for tax deductions because they included tax avoidance features: investors received guaranteed returns while not having their money at risk. Widespread media coverage was given to concerns by the industry and the premiers of Victoria and New South Wales regarding possible detriments to the film industry. With an election approaching, and following $100 million worth of cuts to the film industry since forming government, the Howard government announced the film industry package. We support the broad objectives of the bill, which aims to provide an incentive to attract large budget film production to Australia. We were concerned, however, that the bill as originally drafted provided no mechanism to ensure that the incentives actually support workers in the Australian film industry. It was possible that an overseas film producer could receive the rebate regardless of whether local crew members and cast were employed. There was nothing to prevent producers from bringing more personnel from overseas and reducing local work in the industry. Similarly, the pressure to bring equipment from overseas could increase. Industry groups such as the Australian Media and Arts Alliance expressed similar concerns to us. I commend the minister and his staff for their willingness to consult on the bill and to address Labor’s concerns. We, therefore, suggested, and of course now support, the government’s amendments, which will go some way towards evaluating the effectiveness of the scheme, encouraging the production of big budget films in Australia and examining whether the measure delivers benefits to the Australian film industry. I commend this legislation to the House and am pleased that on this occasion it receives the support of both sides of the parliament. tives) Bill 2002 will enhance the incentives available to the Australian film industry. It will amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to create a tax offset designed to attract expenditure on large-scale film production in Australia. All members will be aware of the importance of the film industry to Australia. I am very gratified that the member for Denison has endorsed the bill on behalf of the opposition in one of those important acts of bipartisanship that we so rarely see.",134,Representatives Main Committee
306,Mr Georgiou (Kooyong) (10.07 A.m.),"The Taxation Laws Amendment (Film Incen1234 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 13 March 2002 In 2000-01, $608 million was spent on total film production in Australia. Annually, the film and television industry is estimated to contribute close to $1.5 billion to the economy. It employs, both directly and indirectly, in the order of 25,000 Australians. It enhances the cultural life of this nation and is, by any measurement, a very successful industry of which Australians can be proud. Australians do share a sense of pride when Australian films, Australian actors, Australian production staff and Australian writers are recognised at events such as the Golden Globe or the Academy Awards as being the equal of or more accomplished than others in their particular fields. The government does recognise the importance of the film industry to Australia. The refundable tax offset measures outlined in this bill will enhance the global competitiveness of the industry and its capacity to maintain a high level of local input. It is worth noting that the speedy introduction of this bill reflects the government’s undertaking to the relevant stakeholders in the film industry that these measures would be introduced as expeditiously as possible. The refundable tax offset will be applied at a fixed rate of 12.5 per cent to qualifying Australian production expenditure on a film project provided directly to the film production company. The offset amount will be applied to any Australian tax liabilities of the producer. Consequently, a film with a qualifying Australian expenditure of $100 million, for instance, would have an offset amount of $12.5 million. If, for example, a film’s production company has an Australian tax liability of $2 million, this figure will be deducted from the offset amount and the producer would receive a cheque from the ATO for $10.5 million. The bill includes eligibility criteria to ensure that the Australian film industry benefits in tangible ways. As such, the key requirement for access to the tax offset incentive will be minimum Australian production expenditure of $15 million. Films with qualifying Australian production expenditure of at least $15 million and less than $50 million will have to spend 70 per cent of their total expenditure in Australia to qualify. Films with qualifying Australian expenditure of $50 million or over will not have to meet the 70 per cent requirement. In addition to putting the minimum Australian expenditure requirement of $15 million in place, the bill also proposes that the offset measure applies only to feature films, miniseries and telemovies. These requirements have been put in place in order to maximise the flow-on benefits to the local production industry by encouraging producers to spend more in Australia on Australian casts, crew, post-production facilities and other services. Australian casts and crews will have increased exposure to the new skills and methods used in big budget film productions, as will a number of other people working in the industry. The eligibility requirements will also ensure that a key objective of the offset measure is addressed; that is, to attract large-scale films to Australia rather than, as the explanatory memorandum puts it, ‘a large quantity of projects that may impinge on some existing sectors of the Australian production industry.’ The government has circulated an amendment to the bill which provides for a review of the incentive after five years. I welcome the opposition’s support of this amendment. I think the amendment is important in order to confirm that the incentive’s objectives are met. The review will examine the benefits and the opportunities that the incentive has delivered to the Australian film industry and, in particular, will look at the number of large-scale productions attracted, the opportunities provided for growth in the Australian film industry sector and the extent to which the offset has resulted in opportunities for the employment and skills development of Australian film industry personnel. I feel that this amendment is worthwhile, in that it will assess whether or not the incentive is having the desired effect whilst not undermining certainty for industry stakeholders. The offset incentive recognises that many largebudget film productions, despite having a significant amount of production expenditure in Australia, are not in a position to access other tax benefits such as those currently available through divisions 10BA and 10B of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Wednesday, 13 March 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 1235 The timing elements of the bill are generous. Any film that was not completed as at 4 September 2001-the date that the offset initiative was announced-can, regardless of whether or not it has applied for certification under division 10B, apply for the offset rebate. The offset measure provides a level of certainty to film producers because it is uncapped, and this fact means that film producers will not have any financial grounds to unnecessarily restrict the level of their Australian production expenditure. Not least amongst the benefits flowing from the tax offset proposed in this bill is the simplicity of the initiative. A simple calculation based on a fixed rate of 12.5 per cent will be all that a production company will require in assessing the level of rebate they may receive on their eligible production expenditures. The offset initiative outlined in the bill should attract increasing levels of eligible productions in coming years. The explanatory memorandum estimates that the value of foreign production in Australia will grow by up to $850 million in 2005-06, based on a sizeable increase in the number of large and medium sized productions each year. The initiative will enhance Australia’s capacity to compete with countries like the United Kingdom, Canada and Ireland, which are all benefiting from ‘runaway’ US productions. All three of these countries have taxation incentive schemes designed to lure large-scale offshore productions. Australia currently attracts around six per cent of runaway productions from the US, whereas Canada’s share is around 81 per cent. These figures would indicate that the potential for growth in the multimillion dollar runaway industry is substantial. Even a slight increase in Australia’s percentage share of it would see the overall level of our production expenditure rise significantly, with the resultant flow-on benefits. The offset measures outlined in the bill should also assist Australian films in enhancing their capacity to move from small or medium sized productions to those of a larger scale, consequently improving the quality of locally made films and their chances of commercial success. The offset measures have met with widespread support within the Australian film industry. They have been applauded as a proactive policy that will make Australia a preferred production destination and will enhance the capacity of our talented local film industry to make an even larger mark on the world stage. I could reel off any number of quotes outlining the support of the government’s tax offset incentive from the Australian film production industry, but I will just refer to two. The chief executive of AusFILM said in the Sydney Morning Herald immediately after the announcement of the incentives: The tax offset incentive was fundamental in order to attract more foreign production to Australia. The executive director of the local industry group the Screen Producers Association of Australia said: The industry is thrilled with the package. It will be a boost for domestic film makers and it puts us on a more competitive footing when bidding for offshore productions. This is a bill designed to enhance the capacity of an already successful Australian film industry to capitalise on its strengths. It offers simplicity and certainty to our domestic film industry and to foreign film producers with large Australian production expenditures. I commend the bill. Bill 2002 is part of a series of measures announced by the government prior to the last election in relation to support for the film industry in Australia. In particular, this bill goes to the question of providing a taxation regime to support large-scale productions from overseas in Australia. One of the concerns of the industry, which I think is partly addressed within this bill, is that, if there was going to be support for large-scale overseas productions here with the hope that the benefit would come to Australia in jobs and extra work generated in the production process, there should be equal treatment for Australian productions. That is a significant issue which needs to be borne in mind not just now with the introduction of the bill but after a period of time when it is set down for review.",135,Representatives Main Committee
307,Mr Hatton (Blaxland) (10.16 A.m.),"The Taxation Laws Amendment (Film Incentives)1236 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 13 March 2002 I note that the initiative in regard to the review process resulted entirely from the urging of the opposition. I am pleased that the government amendment to this bill addresses the question of a formal review mechanism. Initially, the government was minded to simply leave it to an administrative decision as to whether or not there should be a review process, but, significantly, the government has taken up the argument strongly put by our shadow minister that there had to be a formal review process. Why is that important? It is important for a number of reasons, but the critical one is this: if you look at the 10B and 10BA propositions in the tax act and the expenditures that over the last number of years the government has made through rebates through those two schemes, you are looking at up to $35 million a year. There were two significant cases recently where the tax office knocked back-under the provisions, I think, of 10BA-concessions for two major films which had a large foreign content but which also had a strong Australian content, the most significant one, of course, being Moulin Rouge. The ATO’s assessment was that, due to the manner in which the arrangements were constructed, there was effectively no basis of risk undertaken by those investors. The ATO determination that the production should not get the benefit of 10BA was based on the fact that, if there was no risk assessment-if there was a guaranteed returnthen, properly, that production could not be eligible. Those problems with the application of the tax act, and problems arising out of a broader situation not associated with that film where tax lawyers have discovered schemes where they attempt to rip out Commonwealth moneys to provide tax incentives in major mass marketed schemes, always have to be guarded against. When you actually look at the projections forward in the schedules attached to this bill about the amount of money that it is proposed will be forgone by the Commonwealth by giving a 12½ per cent rebate, on films of up to $50 million 70 per cent of the production has to be done in Australia and on those films over $50 million there is no specific provision in either the explanatory memorandum or the bill that a certain amount of production has to be done in Australia. I note that in only one place is it clear that giving a 12½ per cent rebate for films over $50 million specifically relates to all of the production activity taking place in Australia. Only at one point in the material I have read is that point made. I discussed this with the shadow minister last night. She said that in discussion with the departmental officials that point had been strongly made. I would appreciate it if, in the minister’s response in regard to this, that point could be absolutely clarified, because in the presentation of these materials it is absolutely clear for under $50 million but it would seem to be almost open-ended when you go to productions beyond $50 million. If you look at the year-on-year costs up to 2005-06, I think that by the time we get to 2006 they are of the order of about $52 million. For a period of about five years the tax concessions are about $168 million. That is a significant amount of Commonwealth rebate directed towards reboosting this entire industry. The film package that the government put forward before the last election was necessary, given the fact that they really had not been up to the game since 1996. The pressure that had come on from the movie industry within Australia had been building and was significant. It was related not just to the tax problems that occurred with Moulin Rouge and with one other production but also to the fact that the basic support-apart from rhetorical support-was not there to run the engine of this industry as fast as it should be running. During the period of the previous Labor governments, particularly during the four years of the Keating government, much significant support was given to the arts in Australia and to the foundation of the Fox Studios network in Sydney. The ongoing effect of that has been such that moves have been made in Queensland and Victoria to establish the same kinds of movie production facilities. I hope that the work that has been done there will be strongly built on. This bill will allow a taxation regime that will be successful in that overseas productions of some magnitude-either under or over $50 million-will be able to be brought into Australia. They will not overshadow the domestic industry but will in fact complement it. But of key Wednesday, 13 March 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 1237 importance is that this is done in such a manner that we are sure of the outcome. That is why the review process, as outlined in the government’s amendment that the opposition pushed for, is very important-that is, that at the end of a five-year period there is a full, open, transparent review process to ensure that we are getting value for our money and that the film industry and the rebate incentives delivered to it do deliver the goods to Australia. There is a particularly significant problem in relation to this. I have read the minister’s second reading speech, and it is full of joy and wonder from his point of view about how wonderful this bill is, how much work went into it and how fabulous it is, but it is short on the detail. It is short on the key factors that need to be taken into account not only at the end of a five-yearly review process but in actually dealing with the realities of this bill. If you go to either the Bills Digest or the explanatory memorandum and look for information that is solid, complete and concrete about the expected effects of this on Australian film industry employment and production, it is just not there, except for one paragraph. There is no real solid foundation except a few statements where the wish, the expectation and the hope is that we will have a greater production capacity and that, if these major films are attracted to Australia in competition with the other major areas of production in the world, we will get work here for Australians and it will be significant work. But there is no assessment at all. There is no real economic assessment of what the impact of this should be. It would be significant if the minister, in returning to this, could give us some clear, concrete notion of whether or not there is any palpable evidence, for the expenditure over five years of up to $168 million worth of taxpayers’ funds, of what we expect to get in return-not just rhetoric; clear, open, planned evidence. So, one, we support the bill. Two, we ensured that the review mechanism was completely laid into place. Three, the foundations for the extension and entrenchment of the Australian film industry were strongly reinforced during the period of the Keating government, and we support this reinvigoration of the film industry. But it has to be done on a concrete and sensible basis and it has to be pursued vigorously. The value for the $168 million over five years has to be ensured by that review process. Dr WASHER (Moore) (10.26 a.m.)-Australia has enjoyed something of a renaissance period in the film industry over the past decade. The bill I am speaking in support of today will be another feather in the cap of this thriving business. The Taxation Laws Amendment (Film Incentives) Bill 2002 seeks to encourage film production within Australia by way of tax offsets with the cost of film-making. The offset will be provided by a 12.5 per cent rebate against expenditure for productions that spend at least $15 million in Australia making a movie, telemovie or miniseries. Films with at least $15 million but less than $50 million will have to spend at least 70 per cent of their total expenditure within Australia to be eligible. Films with qualifying Australian production with costs of more than $50 million will not have to meet the 70 per cent requirement. Part of the federal government’s integrated film package, this tax incentive will provide a significant boost to the Australian film industry. It will apply to both Australian productions and foreign productions and will provide tremendous opportunities for employment within the film industry, from actors to the technical support used in post production. This tax break is a fundamental part of the Australian film industry having the ability to be a strong competitor on the global stage for film dollars. Australia is not the only country interested in attracting film-makers away from Hollywood to take advantage of cheaper production costs, and we have a long way to go to compare with stronger film industries of the likes of those we mentioned earlier-Canada and the UK. In fact, Canada attracts around 80 per cent of all American films made outside the United States. But as a smaller player we can do well simply because of the size of the movie business. In the United States alone it generates $US50 billion a year and directly employs over half a million people. 1238 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 13 March 2002 Last year Australia’s reputation as a viable alternative to Hollywood was put under a cloud when the tax office denied tax breaks to the backers of Moulin Rouge and Red Planet. The ATO disallowed tax breaks under division 10B of the tax act, which had previously helped attract millions of dollars worth of film productions to Australia. I am hoping this new bill will bring back a level of certainty and confidence that was shaken since the ATO’s decision last year. These incentives provide a transparent and simple system that removes the murky situation that has existed for investors since the ATO’s decision. We will all be crossing our fingers on Oscar night that Moulin Rouge will do better in the award stakes than it has with the ATO and break the drought of a musical taking out the best picture award-one of the goals that Baz Luhrmann set out to achieve when making this Australian film. This piece of legislation enjoys fortuitous timing for a number of reasons. Firstly, Australian actors and technical experts are enjoying unprecedented accolades on the world stage at present. Financially, the low Australian dollar makes it an attractive destination for overseas investors, and this new tax incentive will provide an additional attraction as it basically provides a 10 per cent discount on the cost of the film. Overseas films made in Australia have also recently enjoyed considerable financial success. The Matrix and Mission Impossible 2 were notable moneymaking ventures. Mission Impossible 2 was filmed in the Fox Studios in Sydney, as well as in many locations around New South Wales, including Broken Hill, on a budget of $US125 million. To give you an idea of how much this film grossed, it recouped $US70 million on its first weekend of opening in the United States-in other words, more than half of the cost of the film. Currently, the new Star Wars film, Attack of the Clones-sounds great!-is being filmed mostly in Australia. Incidentally, this is the first film ever to be shot entirely in digital, without the use of conventional film. This film will no doubt be a huge financial success for its backers and bring millions of dollars into the local economy. Australian actors are also enjoying big breaks because of these films being produced in Australia. The new Star Wars film features not only stalwart Jack Thompson but also local favourites, such as Claudia Karvan and Susie Porter. The use of tax breaks to attract film-makers to a particular country is not just gaining attention in Australia. The Canadian parliament are looking at dropping their tax incentive, making Australia’s plan look even better, and production companies looking at the bottom line of deciding on the location of a film should now look to Australia. Furthermore, the United Kingdom have raised the prospect of reforming their tax breaks, which are due to expire in the middle of this year. Tax incentives introduced in 1997 provided 100 per cent writeoffs for films costing up to £15 million, which is about $A40 million, and 33 per cent writeoffs for those costing more. These incentives encouraged a record £750 million being spent in the UK on the movie industry in 2000 alone. Apparently, the UK Treasury believe that tax incentives are attracting undesirables looking at using tax breaks as a way to make money on films that were always going to be a flop. This is a common and often justified fear from governments. Certainly, we are not offering a tax deduction for money spent on high risk investments. I trust that this piece of legislation, with the creation of the Film Certification Advisory Board, will provide sufficient safeguards, so that we do not have the same debate as the UK are having after introducing tax incentives five years ago. We have an ideal opportunity here to take the best initiatives from our competitors to develop the most effective scheme. It is interesting to note that the United States is planning its own tax incentive scheme for the movie business. The US plan is to offer a wage based tax subsidy that would amount to 25 per cent of the wages of an employee working on a movie. This is in direct recognition of so-called runaway films travelling to countries like Canada and Australia. The United States sees overseas competition in the film industry as not being based on market forces but, quite correctly, being based on the level of government subsidies countries are willing to provide. Of course, governments are willing to pay these subsidies because of the huge benefits these productions bring to the local economy. Uncertainty as to whether Wednesday, 13 March 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 1239 the generous tax incentives will remain in the UK and Canada will no doubt contrast to Australia’s enthusiasm to offer tax incentives in this legislation. There is no way we could attract another big budget film like Mission Impossible 2 without them. I commend this legislation to the House, which I understand today has support across the board, and I look forward to witnessing both local and foreign films thrive in this new tax environment. Laws Amendment (Film Incentives) Bill 2002 today although, having a look at the speakers list and those scheduled to speak on it, I wondered whether it might be a little bit like a Rocky film-that is starting to wear on the audience as each successive sequel is released. The most interesting aspect of this bill-and it is a bill that is very near and dear to me-is that it directly relates to and has a direct impact on an industry that is very important on the Gold Coast. As the new federal member for Moncrieff elected at the last election, I am keen to see this industry on the Gold Coast continue to move forward, to build and to grow from strength to strength. The bill directly addresses the uncertainty that previously existed with the operation of provisions 10B and 10BA of the Income Tax Assessment Act. This bill introduces a refundable tax offset, or rebate, set at a level of 12½ per cent for those companies that satisfy the minimum film production expenditure in Australia. It is part of the government’s overall film industry package and it is one that I know will move the industry forward very strongly. This total package will directly address and benefit the film industry on the Gold Coast. It is a large, dynamic and growing industry. On the Gold Coast it is directly responsible for employing hundreds, if not thousands, of people directly and indirectly. It comprises a number of different components and incorporates local television and feature film productions as well as overseas financed productions which are principally built on feature films. What is clear from this is that we have, through this government’s film incentive package, the opportunity to continue to attract big budget Hollywood blockbuster films-the type of film that has been seen recently and increasingly commonly on the Gold Coast at Warner Bros studios at Helensvale. This industry on the Gold Coast not only incorporates the feature film industry but also includes those ancillary services that involve the co-production of both television and feature films and those services associated with co-production including, for example, editing, special effects, set building and catering services. Historically, the focus on the role that Australian studios play in the production of foreign feature films has been around Hollywood blockbusters. The types of movies we have heard mentioned in this chamber today are things such as The Matrix I, II and III, Moulin Rouge, and Mission Impossible II. Specifically on the Gold Coast it has also included feature films such as Scooby Doo. But the reality is that this bill not only will assist and encourage foreign runaway productions from the US but also will assist the local Australian industry in the production of film and television series. The Australian Film Commission has demonstrated, and its records show, that between 1994-95 and 2000-01, Australian production exceeded 50 per cent of the value of feature productions in all but two years and reached a maximum of 71 per cent in 1996-97. This clearly demonstrates that the introduction of this bill will ensure the Australian film industry will continue to prosper. I listened with interest as the member for Blaxland spoke about an industry that was, as he alleges, apparently flailing around on the rocks. Quite to the contrary, under this government’s leadership it is an industry that has continued to prosper, and that is best evidenced by the high budget productions The Matrix and Mission Impossible. These kinds of films would not be attracted to Australia if the industry was as bad as others have portrayed it. Quite clearly it is an industry that will continue to grow and to prosper. It is an industry that will benefit from the certainty that is being brought about through the introduction of this bill. It is an industry that currently Australia-wide employs approximately 15,000 people and it is growing. Feature films contribute approximately $149 million out of a total industry value of $1,792 million.",137,Representatives Main Committee
308,Mr Ciobo (Moncrieff) (10.34 A.m.),"It gives me great pleasure to speak to the Taxation1240 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 13 March 2002 The real need for this bill has arisen through the operation of 10B and 10BA, which effectively turned into a mass marketed tax incentive scheme. What was clear from the uncertainty that arose was that there was an incentive for various companies to engage in the mass marketing of tax incentive schemes such that the real return that was provided to investors was the tax deduction rather than the actual profit or return from the success of the film. To this extent the introduction of this bill will directly address the incentive and, indeed, go to the heart of why people should be investing in an industry that is a wealth generator for our country. The 12½ per cent rebate operates so that any company expending more than $15 million in Australia is eligible for the rebate. For those that have expenditure of between $15 million and $50 million, at least 70 per cent of that expenditure must be Australian based. For those that invest over $50 million, that ratio is disregarded, meaning the 70 per cent need not be complied with. What is clear though is that this bill is part of the central element of the Howard government’s integrated film package, a package aimed at providing increased opportunities for Australian casts, crew, post production and other services to participate in large-budget productions and to showcase Australian talent. There are also the concomitant benefits that employment and skills transfer relate to. These are what drive my particular interest today. For the Gold Coast, this bill will directly ensure that not only do we have Scooby Doo but we have a long list of high-value feature films moving through studios and fuelling these ancillary services. Special effects will benefit from this bill. Those investing in building sets will benefit from this bill. It provides the type of competitive advantage this country needs to ensure that we can leverage off our low Australian dollar and continue to attract runaway productions. The provision of the refundable tax offset will also allow Australia to compete, as I mentioned before, on a global basis. Currently we receive about six per cent of the total investment from Hollywood, with the vast majority of it still going to Canada. If we are going to ensure that we continue to build on this six per cent and if we are going to ensure that we continue to remain cost competitive, then this package is just one part of the overall increase that we need to have in our competitive advantage-an advantage built on a cost structure that is associated with having a labour market that is not hampered by too high wages or that is not pricing Australia out of the market. This will ensure that we continue to build on this six per cent, so that in the years to come we might have a total market share that is approaching 20 per cent or 30 per cent. In total, I commend this bill to the House. I believe that it will benefit not only the Gold Coast economy and the Gold Coast film industry but the overall film industry throughout Australia. a diverse and world standard arts sector. There is no doubt about that: when you think about music, literature and the performing and visual arts, these all make important contributions to Australia’s cultural tapestry. But, more than that, the arts sector provides important and valuable employment opportunities for all Australians. Australia is fast becoming one of the most popular destinations for film-making in the world, and I guess this is no accident either. Our technical production and post production services are world class. Our crews are skilled and flexible, and our creative teams have garnered an international reputation. These are qualities which we need to build on. This bill, the Taxation Laws Amendment (Film Incentives) Bill 2002, clearly demonstrates the coalition’s support for taking a coordinated approach to all aspects of the Australian film industry, from training through to development and ultimately into production and archiving. The government’s approach is designed to provide greater cultural and economic benefits for Australia from the outstanding work of our arts sector. This bill creates a refundable tax offset for film production in Australia and was announced last year as part of the Howard government’s integrated film package. This local industry package also included increased funding of $92.7 million for development to improve the quality of Australian film-making, drama",141,Representatives Main Committee
309,Mr Pearce (Aston) (10.42 A.m.),"Australians are richer for the access that they have toWednesday, 13 March 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 1241 production, training for film-makers, infrastructure for the local industry and improved information for offshore producers. As well as the obvious cultural benefits, the economic aspect of the arts is often overlooked. The film and television production industry currently contributes an average of $1.1 billion annually to the Australian economy. It employs over 29,000 Australians. It also earns valuable export revenue. In considering this bill, it is important to recognise that foreign productions contribute substantially to this total. In fact, the value of productions shot in Australia under foreign creative control has increased from $144 million in 1996-97 to $325 million in 1999-2000. Under this new offset, the value of foreign production in Australia is expected to grow to up to $850 million in 2005-06. The offset proposed in this bill will provide a 12½ per cent rebate on qualifying expenditure for productions that spend a minimum of $15 million in Australia. For productions with expenditure of between $15 million and $50 million, 70 per cent of the total budget needs to be spent here in Australia. There is no minimum proportion required for productions with an expenditure of over $50 million. In terms of genre, we are talking about feature films, telemovies and television drama miniseries. They are all eligible for this offset. Eligible films must have been completed on or after 4 September 2001, which was the day on which the initiative was announced. These eligibility requirements for the offset are designed to maximise the flow-on benefits to the local production industry by encouraging offshore producers to spend more here in Australia. But this initiative does more than that. Australia’s domestic film and television industry also benefits directly in accessing this tax offset. As the name of the bill suggests, the offset is a tax incentive. The process involves the company making the film applying for the offset in its tax return for the income year in which the film is completed. The first films will be able to begin claiming the offset from the income year ended 30 June 2002. Tax support for the film industry is not new. Tax incentives for investing in Australian filmmaking are currently, and will continue to be, available. However, a film cannot generally receive both the new tax offset and the existing tax deductions. While this support will be available to all qualifying productions and will not be capped by budgetary totals, the initiative is estimated to cost around $168 million in revenue over the next five years. As we know, film is a global industry. The production and broadcasting of modern film crosses national boundaries on a daily basis. Australia is playing an increasingly important role in runaway productions. This initiative is designed to ensure that we as a nation continue this trend. Runaway productions are US film and television productions which are filmed in foreign locations and are estimated to be worth some $US2.8 billion worldwide. Australia is competing against a number of countries, including Canada, Ireland and the UK, for these productions. We currently attract about six per cent of them. Studios and production houses, like any other private sector business, are driven by economic imperatives. For the film industry to prosper and grow, it is vital that they consider their cost structures. This means that, if Australia is to attract such investment, it must have a simple and transparent tax incentive system that can compete in the global marketplace. The refundable tax offset is very competitive internationally and takes on board the lessons learned overseas in terms of providing simplicity and certainty for film producers. But, importantly, and unlike some of our competing nations, the Howard government’s tax offset is designed to ensure complementary growth of our foreign and local production sectors within Australia. We want two vibrant sectors working side by side, not just a single foreign industry. Certainty is an important element of all business. Risk, of course, is the adversary of certainty. Film studios are no different. The offset will enable those planning new film productions and considering investing in Australia to know clearly the level of support available from the government. This means that all eligible companies will receive the offset regardless of the number and cost of applications that they make. In other words, films will not be competing against each other for support. 1242 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 13 March 2002 We have to look at all of the beneficiaries in this regard, but I believe the real winner from this legislation is our Australian film industry. This bill provides a real incentive and encouragement for the development of large-budget Australian films. It also increases employment and skills transfer opportunities for Australian casts, crew, post production and service industry personnel in large-budget productions, both Australian and foreign. These opportunities will help to showcase Australian talent internationally, building on the excellent global reputation that our film industry currently enjoys. Following the announcement of this initiative, the government has consulted with domestic and international film studios, producers and industry peak bodies. The consultation process involved the release of a discussion paper on the proposal. This consultation has demonstrated that there is strong support for the refundable tax offset. It also provided some very constructive suggestions that have been incorporated into the final legislation presented to this House. The Howard government will provide additional budgetary funds across the whole art sector. For example, we are increasing our budget allocation in this financial year to the National Institute of Dramatic Art, Australia’s premier training institute for theatre, film and television. The government has also increased funding for the Australian Film, Television and Radio School, which provides advanced education and training for Australia’s best and brightest aspiring film-makers. Supporting our local industry has always been a priority for the coalition. In this term the Howard government is continuing this support by increasing funding for the Australian Film Commission by around 30 per cent and also significantly increasing funding for the Australian Film Finance Corporation. The government is keen to deliver this new tax incentive as quickly as possible so that companies planning upcoming productions have access to this important incentive. The Howard government is committed to an Australian film industry which is recognised for the quality of its product and the excellence of its people. Australia’s film talent is second to none. This bill will help maintain an environment in which this sector can develop and present its excellence to the world. I commend this bill to the House. tion Laws Amendment (Film Incentives) Bill 2002 along with other members. We are doing so in a climate that sees Australia’s reputation and success in the film industry riding higher than it ever has before. With the Oscars about to come up and the plethora of awards achieved by people such as Nicole Kidman and Russell Crowe, who have become superstars in the current environment, we can be enormously proud of the work that Australians do in the film and television industry. I would like to give a special mention to Baz Luhrmann because he has not received his fair share of awards in my view. I think his contribution to the arts scene here in Australia as a whole is enormously important, whether it is with regard to Australian opera or to things like Cloud Street or Moulin Rouge. We are debating this bill in the Main Committee chamber because there is so much support for this initiative of the government. It results from an adverse ruling by the Australian Taxation Office which adversely affected both Moulin Rouge and Red Planet and put in jeopardy future productions that would not be attracted to coming to Australia if something had not been done. Basically, the so-called runaway productions done by people running away from the heavy cost structure in the United States provide a very lucrative body of work for Australia. Currently we are the second largest destination for such runaway productions. That sounds terrific, but there is great room for improvement because Canada gets 80 per cent of that work. They have very strong incentives and are over the border from the United States. But Australia gets six per cent of the runaway productions that are available. In making this amendment to enable the adverse ruling of the tax office not to affect this growing industry, we are creating an offset for film production in Australia which will have the following features: films with qualifying Australian production expenditure equal to or greater than $15 million and less than $50 million will have to spend 70 per cent of their total",142,Representatives Main Committee
310,Mrs Bronwyn Bishop (Mackellar) (10.52 A.m.),"TodayI rise to speak on the TaxaWednesday, 13 March 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 1243 expenditure on production activity in Australia to qualify; films with qualifying Australian expenditure equal to or greater than $50 million will not have to meet the 70 per cent requirement. The offset is to be applied at a fixed rate of 12½ per cent. A film, however, may not receive both the new tax offset and the existing divisions 10B or 10BA deductions or FSC funding. A film licensed investment company will not be able to invest any of its concessional capital in a film production seeking the offset. This is a prudent amendment, targeted to achieve the outcome that we wish to have. One of the very pleasing outcomes of the way in which the preparatory work and the consulting was done is that the amendment enjoys the support of the industry as a whole-particularly of the Screen Producers Association of Australia. The New South Wales Film and Television Office is also strong supporter, and of course individual production houses are also voicing their support. Film and television production contributes significantly to our economy. The latest data from the Australian Film Commission indicates that almost 2,000 businesses are involved in the production industry, generating overall income of $1.5 billion and an operating profit of $77 million. The industry has grown since 1996-97, but there have been significant shifts in income. The provision of production services has almost doubled, while income from feature production and commercials has fallen. The production of commercials is particularly important to the industry, because it is here that the nurturing of talent begins. It is here that many directors, animators, camera operators, grips, gaffers and designers can in fact learn their craft. Many suppliers and auxiliary industry spin-offs from this industry are wide and varied. The amount of income has dropped because we have allowed more competition into the market by allowing overseas commercials-that is, commercials without Australian content-to be shown in Australia. At the end of June 2000, the ABS reported that 15,195 people were employed in the film and television production industry. In the area of feature film, Australia has built a solid production industry, averaging 14 films a year in the 1970s and around 28 to 30 since then. Over the last decade, foreign films have played a major role in the amount of feature film activity. These films include Star Wars II, The Matrix and Red Planet. While the majority of the films have come from the US, other countries like Japan, India, Hong Kong and the UK have also shot films here. While the data on post production has not been collected by the AFC, the ABS reports that this is still a growing area of activity. The Screen Producers Association certainly hopes that increased attention is paid to the collection of data in this area. They acknowledge the support of the minister-which is important to do-and his statement that the area of television series production will be assessed for future inclusion in the scheme. This assessment cannot be properly made unless the data is collected, and the industry is well aware of that. According to the AFC, US runaway production outside the US was estimated to be worth $1.7 billion to $2.8 billion in 1998. The total value shot in Australia was around $US118 million, representing approximately six per cent of the total amount. There is a belief in the industry that these amendments will attract additional business here to Australia. It is interesting to make some comparisons. In the seventies, the majority of funding was through government agencies, which included the AFC, the New South Wales Film Corporation, the South Australian Film Corporation and the Victorian film corporations, and the support that was given to the independent production sector. In the eighties almost all features were funded using private investment. Largely, non-industry finance raised under 10BA tax incentive schemes top-up finance was provided by government agencies. Again, in the 1990s, government sources of finance were the major source of funding. Film industry funding, mainly from distributors from Australia and overseas, provided top-up funding. It is only with high levels of production, both in quality terms and over time, that the industry can be assured of success. Training is an important component of ongoing produc1244 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 13 March 2002 tion, as is the development and retention of the range of businesses already operating within the industry. It is good that the tax offset is additional funding and does not detract from allocations for local feature production or television production. This is why the remainder of the package is so important. It establishes funding for local television production, so important in the ongoing viability of the industry and in the continued development of Australian content. When the government announced the funding package for film and television, released in September 2001, the Screen Producers Association of Australia were fully supportive of the package, and they remain so, as indeed were the other bodies that I mentioned. The funding package is an important one because it acknowledges that government support is required across the whole of the film and television industry and that the industry cannot be dealt with in a piecemeal way. It supports the local industry, both film and television, and the incentive scheme will attract offshore production. Importantly, it is recognition of the importance of supporting content production. We can truly say that this legislation, with the broad support that it has attracted, emphasises that this government, a conservative government, has a great interest in the arts, in the talent of our people and in the success of projecting that in an international sense and attracting foreign business to this country where, they can see how well we do things. Laws Amendment (Film Incentives) Bill 2002, which creates a refundable tax offset for major film production in Australia. Essentially this bill will provide a 12.5 per cent rebate against qualifying Australian expenditure for productions that spend a minimum of $15 million here. For expenditure of up to $50 million, 70 per cent of the total budget needs to be spent here in Australia. For expenditure over that amount, the 70 per cent requirement does not apply. This rebate is only part of our government’s ongoing commitment to support the growing Australian film industry. In fact, it comes on top of a package of over $92 million in funding announced in September last year, which included additional funding for the Australian Film Commission; the Australian Film, Television and Radio School; SBS Independent; Ausfilm; and the Film Industry Broadband Resources Enterprise. Our package recognises that, as well as attracting investment from overseas, we need to continue to support and foster our unique and successful local film and television production. Australia is currently enjoying an unprecedented worldwide profile in the entertainment industry. The current individual success of stars such as Nicole Kidman, Russell Crowe, Hugh Jackman, Heath Ledger, Rachael Griffiths, Sarah Wynter, Eric Bana and Naomi Watts-I list only a few but the list goes on and on-builds on the collective Australian reputation for originality, talent, flair and vitality, a reputation built over many years through a variety of films and, of course, our highly successful directors, cinematographers, costume designers, composers, editors and animators. There is a palpable pride in the Australian community in the success our countrymen and women have enjoyed in this highly competitive field. Evenings such as the recent Golden Globe awards, when Australia won a swag of awards, were hardly dreamt of just over 10 years ago and were unimaginable 20 years ago. The community does have a right to have collective pride. They have a stake in this international success, because successive Australian governments have seen fit to support the local film industry. Their tax dollars have helped build its reputation and, through this bill and many other measures, their tax dollars still keep securing a growing share of the entertainment industry dollar. Of course, it is very much a two-way street. I am delighted to remind the House that in my own corner of south-east Queensland, home to the wonderful Movie World complex and the Warner Brothers studios as well as several other production companies, we have our own Hollywood in the Gold Coast-Brisbane corridor which, from the hinterland to the beaches, is also full of fabulous locations as well as first-class facilities and production venues. In fact, since 1991 film production has had more than a $2 billion economic impact on Queensland. In the last financial year, eight feature",144,Representatives Main Committee
311,Mrs Elson (Forde) (11.02 A.m.),"I am very pleased to rise in support of the TaxationWednesday, 13 March 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 1245 films, 22 documentaries, three short films, nine telemovies, six television series and one animation were produced in Queensland, with production expenditure totalling $156 million. Film production employs the equivalent of 4,500 people full time in Queensland alone. I want to recognise in this House today the ongoing support that the Queensland government provide for the film industry through their dedicated people at the Pacific Film and Television Commission as well as through a range of tax incentives and rebates. As we are all very well aware, there are many and varied demands on government resources and we must strike the right balance between a handout and a supportive hand-up. Like our tourist industry, the entertainment industry is relatively new, with huge growth potential. It is a capital rich industry of the future. It is certainly an industry that needs to be cultivated and encouraged, just as we support our traditional primary industries, in a variety of ways. The Howard government is ever mindful of our need to take responsible decisions in the national interest. It is the yardstick against which all of our decisions are made: is this good for Australia’s best interest? The criteria for this 12.5 per cent tax offset, particularly the minimum Australian expenditure of $15 million, have been designed to maximise the flow of benefits to local production industries through encouraging offshore producers to spend more in Australia on Australian casts, crew, post production facilities and other services. I note that the payment is restricted to feature films, miniseries and telemovies. It has been put to me that the production of overseas episodic series ought also to be considered for the tax offset. It is the case that series television sourced from offshore has been a very significant part of Queensland’s production industry. These series have an average production shoot of between eight and 10 months and therefore provide many jobs for a longer period than is the case for most feature films. Series television production has assisted the development of Australia’s film industry through long-term training for young people. In my own electorate the very successful Los Angeles based Coote/Hayes Productions set up their offices in 1998. They have produced two series of both Beastmaster and The Lost World fantasy television series, filmed and produced in Queensland, amongst other productions. Coote/Hayes Productions alone has had an estimated economic impact of $434 million for Queensland. I would certainly urge the minister to consider the value of offshore series production to our local industry and, once this tax offset is in place, to look at extending eligibility to include this sector of the industry. As I said, it is a balancing act and this government takes our responsibility to taxpayers very seriously. In this bill, as with our integrated film industry package announced last September, we want to strike the right balance to allow the wonderful qualities Australia has to offer the entertainment industry to be recognised and to grow and prosper. It must be remembered that for every hugely successful actor, director or production company there are hundreds of smaller ones, many struggling to perfect their craft in order not just to entertain but also to add to our nation’s culture and to better our understanding of ourselves. That is one of the truly special things about the Australian film industry and much of our television industry. It has not been founded on sticking to formula or churning out big budget box office successes. It has largely been founded on a celebration and understanding of what it is to be Australian-our own unique perspective on the world. The development of Australian film and television has undoubtedly fuelled and been fuelled by our growing confidence on the world stage. There is no doubt too that our film industry has helped and continues to help our tourist industry. For a nation so geographically isolated, our film industry has given the world a better understanding and appreciation of who we are and the values we hold dear. It is clear that people overseas like what they see. With that foot in the door we have a wonderful opportunity to sell to overseas companies the benefits of filming and producing in Australia. It is a unique and special export that directly brings dollars here in terms of not only the money that production generates but also, through the gorgeous locations that we have to offer, audiences around the world are being attracted to 1246 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 13 March 2002 visit, thus bolstering our growing tourist industry. It really is a win-win situation for us as a nation, and I believe the government’s support of film production is a sensible, practical approach to furthering our local industry and maximising the benefits as a nation. It is certainly an exciting time for the Australian film industry and many Australians employed in film and television production. I am very proud to have such a substantial part of our production industry located in my electorate, and I am proud to be part of a government that is committed to delivering practical support to help attract large overseas productions and to support local productions as well. I lend my support to this bill and look forward to discussing with the minister the potential for the further application of this 12.5 per cent tax offset to the production of offshore television series here in Australia. I would also like to take this opportunity to wish all the Aussies the very best for the Academy Awards this week. I am sure we can look forward to many years of Australian success in the film industry and to attracting more and more big budget overseas films to our production industry. industry is the purpose of the Taxation Laws Amendment (Film Incentives) Bill 2002. The bill proposes a 12 per cent tax rebate for film-makers who spend at least $15 million on a production here in Australia. The proposed rebate has already gained considerable attention from Hollywood film studios, which are showing more and more interest in shooting in Australia. This is because the rebate, coupled with our exchange rate and competitive labour costs, makes Australia one of the world’s most cost-effective countries in which to produce films, telemovies, miniseries and the like. I enthusiastically support this bill as it means more jobs and investment for south-east Queensland. I would just like to take a few minutes today to highlight the pluses for the film industry on the Gold Coast. We have certainly heard about a few of those pluses from the member for Forde. On the Gold Coast we have our very own movie studios, Warner Roadshow Movie World Studios. The studios offer world-class, state-of-the-art facilities, with one of the largest studio lots in the Southern Hemisphere. The studios to date have made 17 feature films, 22 TV series and a number of telemovies and miniseries. Many of these productions are made for the overseas market. Scooby Doo, produced last year, is the latest feature film to come out of the studios. Mission Impossible was one of the first TV series that the studio produced, way back in 1988. Based on last year’s productions, approximately 75 per cent of Queensland productions were shot on or around the Gold Coast. So my corner of Queensland and the member for Forde’s corner of Queensland are very active and have a lot to gain with the passage of this bill. The managing director of Warner Roadshow Movie World Studios mentioned that the incentive has already generated enormous interest from overseas. He is taking a large number of calls here from overseas and, when in Los Angeles, information on the rebate is sought eagerly. Before the legislation is passed, we are already seeing evidence of increased spending by film companies. One example given to me is that of a locally produced film. Initially, the film’s budget was below the $15 million. The producers are now looking for ways to increase their spending commitment to the $15 million so they can take advantage of the rebate. Another example is a local company involved in computer effects. The company has reported increased interest and has already picked up more overseas work. Gold Coast City, one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world-on the globe-can offer producers more than our competitive advantage. We can offer a whole lot more: fantastic weather, a 70kilometre stretch of white sand with some the best surf beaches in the world, 40 championship golf courses-some designed by the likes of Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player-magnificent subtropical rainforests, a wide choice of accommodation, a lively arts community and a freespirited, relaxed and friendly lifestyle.",146,Representatives Main Committee
312,Mrs May (Mcpherson) (11.10 A.m.),"Attracting overseas investment into Australia’s filmWednesday, 13 March 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 1247 Culturally diverse, Gold Coast City has a dynamic performing arts, visual arts and music community. Writers, potters, embroiderers and spinners all make up the estimated 20,000 people who are involved in art. The Gold Coast Arts Centre has a reputation for producing high quality live theatre, attracting its audience from as far away as Brisbane and south of the New South Wales border. The centre helps engender a love of the theatre by holding a summer school for our talented young artists. These young artists will be our future actors and actresses, who will be in the films we are going to make here in Australia. At the last summer school, 60 students aged 15 to 21 years gave up their school holidays to put on the musical Chess. The musical had never turned a profit anywhere in the world until it was staged on the Gold Coast. I think that is a credit to all those involved in that production. We have a number of community theatres that produce very good shows: the Spotlight Theatre, Tugun Theatre Company, Gold Coast Little Theatre and Javeenbah Theatre Company, to name a few. These theatres are all manned by volunteers and produce wonderful plays that really have world-class status. Gold Coast City Choir is one of the few community choirs in Australia to boast a professional music director. Its harmonies are spine tingling and its repertoire is considered broad for a community choir. It recently laid down a CD with 24 tracks. Every June we have the Winter in Paradise Choral Festival, which attracts choirs from northern New South Wales, south-east Queensland and overseas, and audiences in their hundreds. Our young excel in the arts. Performances by the Gold Coast Youth Orchestra are highly regarded and attract a strong and loyal following. John Cox, who is also a resident on the Gold Coast, won an Academy Award for animation in the film Babe. He is a fine example of one of our own sons who has done so well and excelled in the film industry overseas. More and more university degrees from both our universities on the Gold Coast-Griffith University and Bond University-are offering degrees in the film industry to capture opportunities for young people who want to enter the world of film. The above goes in some way to demonstrate the breadth of the Gold Coast city’s vibrant and diverse arts community. The proposed rebate will further boost this community and create more jobs, particularly for our young people in the film industry. Film is one of the fastest-growing industries in the world, and the Gold Coast has established a foothold in this fiercely competitive market. It is a foothold we are holding onto. Since 1991, approximately $863 million has been expended on film and television production in the state of Queensland, translating into a total economic impact of over $2.2 billion. The movie industry has already attracted a permanent work force, with considerable investment in infrastructure in such things as visual effects, props, postproduction, transport and the service industries. The bill will only go towards helping increase this infrastructure and stimulate the local economy. It will provide more opportunities for Australian casts and crews, enabling them to develop and expand their own skills. Australian talent will get far more exposure, and we are certainly seeing that in the world of film today. The industry has created many hundreds of jobs in the region, and we can look forward to many more being created with the passage of the bill. In closing, overseas producers, studios and movie stars can always be assured of a very warm welcome on the Gold Coast. I commend the bill to the House. Ms GAMBARO (Petrie) (11.18 a.m.)-I have great pleasure also in speaking to the Taxation Laws Amendment (Film Incentives) Bill 2002 today. Late last year part of my electorate of Petrie was chosen as a location for the up-and-coming film with Geoffrey Rush and Judy Davis. Geoffrey Rush is no stranger to the Petrie electorate-he grew up in the southern part of the electorate and he went to Everton Park State High. The film was Swimming Upstream, and it tells the story of the former Australian swimmer Tony Fingleton, who now works in New York as a scriptwriter and is the film’s executive director. It was filmed in part at the Redcliffe War Memorial Pool. More recently that pool has been home to Olympic swim stars and to film stars and their crews. The film was shot on location for a total of about five days over two separate weeks. The investment that was injected into the local area-not to mention 1248 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 13 March 2002 the curiosity value-was enormously significant. Actors and crew frequented local restaurants, and most of the catering and the food were produced locally. Mr Martin Ferguson-Plenty of seafood restaurants, I hope. peninsula’s seafood. Many budding stars from the local area had their shot at fame as well. They were used for film extras and they were sourced from the local area-along with the local seafood. With the growth in the Australian film industry and the heightened profile of many of the Australian actors, many local communities around Australia are benefiting from this burgeoning and progressive industry. No matter whether times are good or bad, let us face it: we all love to go to the movies. The bill before us today makes going to the movies beneficial not only to investors and actors but also to a bevy of local industries that flourish from those flow-on effects of the film industry. The measures to be implemented by this bill are part of the government’s integrated film package, which was announced on 4 September 2001. The bill creates a refundable tax offset for film production in Australia, and it is intended to increase the opportunities for Australian casts, crew, postproduction and other services. It is also designed to attract expenditure on large budget film productions to Australia and to showcase Australia’s talent, with flow-on benefits for employment opportunities and skill development. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, approximately 15,000 people were employed in the film and video production industry Australia wide in 1999-2000. The ABS notes that, in the same period, feature films contributed $149 million of a total value of $1.7 billion. The integrated film package as announced on 4 September last year includes many measures that have been welcomed by the film industry. The package offers a refundable tax offset at a rate of 12.5 per cent of qualifying Australian expenditure where a film’s expenditure is between $15 million and $50 million and at least 70 per cent of the total production budget is spent in Australia. If the film’s qualifying Australian expenditure is more than $50 million, the proportion of the total budget spent in Australia is disregarded. The incentive is expected to amount to around 10 per cent of the cost of producing a film. However, it will vary depending on the qualifying Australian expenditure of the total production expenditure. Later this month many of us will, as we have done before, sit back and watch our Australian actors, producers, designers, writers and technicians head for the Academy Award categories. The public profile and the increasing success of Australian films abroad highlight the importance of this bill as a generator of investment and employment opportunities. It is also a vehicle to broaden our arts base in the film and motion picture industries. It is estimated that, in 2002-03, the film industry package will increase spending by 18 per cent and that it will rise to 25 per cent in 2004-05. The taxation treatment of financial investments in the film industry is covered under divisions 10B and 10BA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. Acquisitions of industrial property, including intellectual property, of which films form a part, will be dealt with under division 10B. Division 10BA deals with deductions available for Australian films. The difference between the two divisions is that concessions under division 10B are available only once the film has been completed and the intellectual property in the film has come into existence. Division 10BA provides a deduction from the start of production if the film has been issued with a certificate under the guidelines of the division. The main provision in this bill is the insertion of new subdivision 376 in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, dealing with the tax offset. A company can claim an offset for a film if the film was completed in that income year and has been issued a certificate for the film by the Minister for the Arts and Sport. Another requirement is that the claim for the offset must be made during the year in question and the company is either resident in Australia or has a permanent establishment in Australia and has an Australian business number.",148,Representatives Main Committee

The last two conditions are required in order to qualify for the rebate of 12.5 per cent of qualifying Australian expenditure. In addition, the 70 per cent test may disregard remuneration paid to one person, including travel and associated costs. This may include the sum paid to an actor of great international stature. According to the bill, qualifying Australian production expenditure is generally defined as company expenditure on goods and services or the use of land or goods located in Australia or used in connection with the making of the film. The recent filming of parts of the film Swimming Upstream in my electorate late last year emphasised the significance this bill has in generating investment and employment opportunities as a direct result of the film industry. As I said earlier, Redcliffe was abuzz with the activities surrounding the local set. The local community felt a very strong sense of pride in being chosen as the location for the film. As a consequence of this brief experience with an international film, more people will also become aware of the prospective tourist facilities available on the Redcliffe Peninsula. The flow-on effects of this film will deliver long after the film has finished production. The benefit of this bill is to encourage and promote the Australian film industry. Australia has a very proud record of films, from our earliest beginnings in silent films in which we were leaders to representation in that international arena of five principal elements of the industry-acting, producing, writing, design and technical elements. According to the Australian Film Commission, while the industry has enjoyed substantial publicity in producing foreign films, the amounts spent on Australian features during 1994-95 and 2000-01 have hardly changed. As a consequence of this very brief experience with an international film, more people have become aware of the facilities available on the Redcliffe peninsula and they will use them. Hopefully this will encourage more investment. It highlights the need to progress this bill to encourage greater participation in the film industry. We have an attractive location in Australia for many film-makers, given our climate and stable economic and political environments. The diversity of our natural environment is also very attractive. Our tropical climate makes it a suitable location for many films. Following the government’s announcement that it would provide a refundable tax offset for film production in Australia as part of its film industry package, it sought consultation with the film industry. The Taxation Laws Amendment (Film Incentives) Bill 2002 will complement the measures announced in the film industry package and enable Australia to benefit greatly. This will include an increase in investment in film and associated industries. It will encourage job growth and diversity in a range of industries from tourism and hospitality right across to the arts. Therefore, I urge this House to support this bill. thank the member for Petrie for her considered and thoughtful contribution to this debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment (Film Incentives) Bill 2002 and her advocacy on behalf of the film industry, as I would thank the eight government members who supported the legislation and, thereby, the Australian film industry, including both international and domestic aspects of the sector.

I think the film industry, and the arts community in general, should take notice of the paucity of contribution by opposition members. What sort of contribution did they make? The member for Blaxland gave a very half-hearted and critical commentary on the legislation. That shows you he did not enthusiastically-let alone strongly-support the legislation, which is a little disappointing, at least for his predecessor, the former member for Blaxland and then Prime Minister, who played a very vital and important role in establishing the film studios in Sydney. This legislation complements, and indeed brings to fruition, much of the vision he had for foreign productions and all the consequent benefits, both cultural and economic, for the Sydney studios. Duncan Kerr, the member forMr Martin Ferguson-Denison. lasting benefits of this legislation but even he could not bring himself to properly give credit where it was due. I notice that in his speech, which took pot shots at the government but never quite substantiated his critical assertions, he had this to say: Labor went to the last election supporting the film industry package. The opposition did go to the last election supporting the government’s film industry package but only after it was dragged to the party by the film community itself. The opposition showed very begrudging support for the government’s innovative and generous plans for the film industry. I can well remember the then shadow minister, the member for Fraser, taking several days-if my recollection serves me correctly-before he could genuinely and sincerely support the package. It took him quite a while to indicate a formal support but it was a long time before he could share in the enthusiasm of the film industry itself. So they should not be patting themselves on the back for going to the election with a policy of supporting the film industry package, because they did so only under duress. But the member for Denison goes on to say: We thought it did not go far enough. Why didn’t that translate into further financial support for the film industry? If he says the opposition supported the film industry package but it did not go far enough, why wasn’t it part of their election commitments to actually up the ante on the government, if you like? That is merely hollow rhetoric on his part. He said: We thought that the damage that the Howard government had done to the Australian Film Commission and to the Film Finance Corporation needed urgent remedy. Where was their policy in that regard? You cannot just say the government is doing damage to a body or an institution or has a failure of policy, without concrete demonstrable and convincing policy alternatives. This is just grandstanding and I am afraid it is how the arts community regards the Labor Party in its present manifestation-so much rhetoric and no support in concrete terms. So that was a disappointing contribution by Duncan Kerr, the member forremember his seat, because he had given up on it. If he does not want to represent it it is very hard, therefore, to remember the seat itself. You cannot look at this legislation without taking into consideration the support the government announced simultaneously for the domestic or indigenous film industry. We had new funding initiatives across the board but specifically for the Australian Film, Television and Radio School, the Australian Film Commission, the Australian Film Finance Corporation and Film Australia, amongst others.

I note in that regard that Catriona Hughes, the long serving Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Film Finance Corporation, will be retiring in a few short months-in June, I think. I would like to pay tribute to Catriona Hughes. I worked with her for some three years. I found her to be an outstanding champion of and advocate for the film industry in all of its diversity and complexity. She is extremely knowledgable on the financial requirements to actually get work onto the screen, both the big and the small. Above all else, I found her a tough and smart representative of the film industry, in the very best sense of those words. I enjoyed working with her. I looked forward to our meetings, because I knew that I would get a run for my money and that Catriona was not interested in meetings for the sake of them or for pleasantries just to fulfil some social convention. Mind you, Catriona could be as charming as the best of them, but when dealing with government her overriding ambition was always to further the interests of the film industry. I am full of admiration for her. I wish herand I have no doubt that the parliament as a whole does-the very best for the future. The film industry, and television and documentary aspects of it, is very blessed with extremely talented and determined individuals heading up the major bodies. Rod Bishop at his work. Kim Dalton at the AFC is also an experienced and determined individual. I had a great deal to do with Kim, and I greatly respect the dedication and strength he brings to that position. Sharon Connolly at Film Australia-the quiet achiever, if you like-is also a relentless advocate on behalf of her constituency. All of those individuals and the organisations they represent had a great deal to do with forming the government’s film industry package. At the same time, they were backed by strong chairs and boards of directors. Having been the minister for arts during the last Howard government, it gives me the greatest personal and professional satisfaction to have worked with all of them, to have played a part in a number of their appointments, to see how they have worked so well for all of the different aspects of film, television, radio and documentary, and to see how collectively they can influence a government, a parliament and a community so very effectively. I will draw my comments to a conclusion, but the effects of this legislation and the associated initiatives with regard to the film industry will have a lasting and beneficial impact on not just the film industry but the community at large.

Second Reading Debate resumed from 20 February, on motion by Mr Tuckey: That this bill be now read a second time. Speaker Price, on your elevation to your current office. Who would ever have thought that a person such as you would have occupied this chair? I suppose we never know what comes and goes. We have a new whip; someone is prepared to take you seriously! I rise this morning to speak on the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Amendment Bill 2002, something, Mr Deputy Speaker, both you and I, as boys who have come from Western Sydney, know of. This bill relates to a bill that passed through the chamber last year, the International Maritime Conventions Legislation Amendment Bill 2001. As we know, that legislation amended the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983, but it also had an unintended effect with respect to the application of those new penalties and provisions to foreign ships. For that reason, this bill makes important corrective amendments to the pollution prevention act. The amendments extend the geographic coverage of the various pollution offences to apply to either Australian or foreign ships in the exclusive economic zone. I believe, as does the government, that this application must be unambiguous. For that reason the opposition fully supports the bill before the chamber. There must be no doubt about the coverage of these important pollution prevention provisions. In that context I want to refer to a letter I received from the office of the Deputy Prime Minister following a briefing I received from the department concerning this bill. The content of that letter is exceptionally important, because the issue of pollution of our seas is a joint Commonwealth and state responsibility. It is for that reason that complementary Commonwealth and state laws implement the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, better known as MARPOL, which is in force in over 100 countries around the world. As the law currently operates in Australia, any vessel discharging pollution illegally within Australia’s three-nautical-mile coastal waters is subject to the relevant law of the responsible state or the Northern Territory. A vessel outside coastal waters and within the 200-nauticalmile exclusive economic zone is subject to Commonwealth legislation; in this instance, the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983. It is interesting to note that, with respect to the legislation as it currently stands, the Commonwealth legislation provides a maximum fine of over $1 million for the owners of a ship, and more than $200,000 for the master of a ship, discharging pollution illegally. It does not-and maybe this is something that we have got to consider in the future-include penalties involving imprisonment. I regard the discharge of some of these pollutants as a serious offence. If we continue to be exposed to",153,Representatives Main Committee
320,Mr Martin Ferguson (Batman) (11.40 A.m.),"May I congratulate you, Mr DeputyWednesday, 13 March 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 1253 the failure of some of these ships and of their masters to accept their responsibilities when given the opportunity to trade in Australian waters, over time both sides of parliament might have to consider whether the law should be further stiffened with the provision of penalties involving imprisonment for the offenders. I want to refer by way of example to how complementary state and federal legislation operates. In Victoria, the applicable legislation is the Pollution of Waters by Oil and Noxious Substances Act 1986. When the Victorian act was originally put in place, it mirrored the Commonwealth act. However, amendments to both acts since the 1980s have seen some divergence in certain provisions such as penalties. As a result of the changes today, it is very important that the Commonwealth takes the lead in trying to ensure that the respective state and federal legislation is mirrored so as to guarantee that we have the best possible legislation in place; for example, some of the state legislation at this time may be inferior to the federal legislation. On the question of penalties it is interesting to note that, with respect to the operation of this legislation, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority’s records indicate that no jail term has been applied in Victoria. The largest penalty Australia wide was the $620,000 fine imposed following the oil spill of the Laura D’Amato in Sydney in August 1999. In 20 instances, the Flag State Administration has taken legal action against their ships involved in Australian waters. I place that on the record for the purpose of showing the importance of complementary state and federal legislation with respect to these matters and also to make sure that we continue to pursue the most rigorous possible legislative environment in Australia to try to protect our coastal waters. It is for that reason that the legislation must be unambiguous. It must be straightforward and known in detail by those who have the luxury of operating in Australian coastal seas. However, in supporting this bill, I also ask the government to consider its commencement date. If it can be avoided, we must ensure that there is no gap in the application of these provisions. The government should, therefore, consider if the retrospective commencement of this bill would ensure such a gap does not remain. This point has been raised, for example, in the Parliamentary Library’s Bills Digest, which also cites the attitude of the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee, that retrospectivity may not be opposed if the legislation is merely correcting drafting errors. I would ask the minister to address this point in his response this afternoon. I will continue to speak to the maritime bill. The opposition believe it would be remiss if we did not use this opportunity to also draw attention to the government’s anti-Australian shipping policies. The opposition believe that the Howard government’s approach to the maritime and shipping industry is ideologically driven. I would compare the different approach of the opposition to the government with respect to some major transport matters when it comes to issues of ideology. Some years ago we had a major waterfront dispute driven by Patricks, represented by Mr Corrigan. So far as the Labor Party are concerned, that dispute came and went. Yesterday we had a major announcement of change in the aviation industry with the merger of Virgin Blue persons intimately involved in the waterfront dispute some four years ago. The approach of the opposition yesterday was black and white; it was straightforward. We welcome the merger of Virgin Blue with the Patricks company for this very reason: it is about strengthening competition in the Australian aviation industry. Disputes come and go. The opposition are not driven by ideology and hatred. So far as we are concerned, if that merger strengthens competition in the aviation industry to the benefit of Australian consumers and in doing so creates jobs for Australian workers and their families, frankly it ought to be welcomed. I compare that approach to the approach of the Howard government when it comes to shipping policy in Australia. So far as I am concerned, it is ideologically driven. It is not policy",154,Representatives Main Committee
321,"And Patricks, Which Is Largely Seen In Terms Of The Figurehead Being Mr Corrigan","one of the1254 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 13 March 2002 that is motivated by Australia’s national or public interests, as the Labor Party has clearly taken, with respect to developments in the aviation industry over the last six to 12 months. We had to confront not only the collapse of Ansett but also September 11, which did major damage to the international and domestic aviation industries around the world. We have got to get to the point where it is about a policy which is in the best interests of the Australian maritime industry, Australia as a trading nation, Australian workers and their families. We should no longer have a shipping policy in Australia that is driven by an obsession by the current government for an all-out assault on the maritime unions, maritime workers, their families and Australian shippers. As I indicated, in 1998 we saw a huge dispute on the waterfront. The government was intimately involved in that dispute because it wanted to drive an ideological attack on maritime workers and their families. The government, as we all know from the record, was prepared to use any means to take away Australian maritime jobs, bludgeon their families and, in doing so, undermine the Australian coastal shipping services. Yes, the government might wax lyrical from time to time about crane improvements, but this change could have been achieved without recourse to violence. Just ask Mr Corrigan how change has been achieved, for example, with the operation of Virgin Blue and the wages and conditions that exist for that work force as a result of the willingness of people to sit down and work out what is in the best interests of the Australian community. But that was the docks. There is another prong to the Australian government’s ideological approach to waterfront and related shipping issues. That goes to the government’s assault on maritime workers, their jobs and their families by undermining the competitiveness of the Australian shipping industry. The maritime policy strategy of the government is to open the Australian coastline to subsidise foreign ship operators with foreign crews that work on lower conditions and pay no taxes to Australia. As far as I am concerned, the minister not only admits to this strategy, he is proud of this strategy. Just take the foreign crews. In many instances they work for lower conditions because they are receiving tax concessions in their home countries. Similarly, the ship operators can charge lower freight rates because they are receiving subsidies and benefits from their nation state. What have we to ask ourselves as Australians? Is that how we want to operate our interstate and intrastate transport systems and infrastructure? Would that be acceptable in our rail networks, our retail industry or our road systems, for example? I wonder how the Howard government would react, for example, if the rural producers in Australia were required to accept this type of access for foreign farmers and producers in countries beyond Australia. We know what they would do. They would scream the house down. They would regard that as uncompetitive behaviour that takes away Australian investment and Australian jobs. I take this approach as a person who formerly served on the Agrifood Council of Australia. That council led to the establishment of the supermarkets to Asia strategy of the current government. We were driven by trying to make sure that we got investment in the food processing industry in Australia to create jobs and look after rural and regional communities and, in doing so, to get the multiplier job impact on manufacturing in the food processing industry in Australia. We went out of our way to keep jobs in Australia by making sure that we looked after the best interests of Australia. I ask the Australian government today to actually review its position with respect to the operation of the shipping industry in Australia. You cannot have one policy approach when it comes to, for example, the needs and aspirations of rural producers and the food manufacturing industry and then have another ideological approach when it comes to the operation of the shipping industry in Australia. I think that is exceptionally important, because the time has come for the government to actually review potential assistance made available to this very important industry. The record will show the Australian government has continued to refuse any assistance to the Australian shipping industry or Australian seafarers. It has continued to Wednesday, 13 March 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 1255 turn a blind eye to the call for industry reform. In short, the Australian shipping industry is being hung out to dry and is getting close to the end of being the great industry it is unless something gives very soon. By way of reference, this comes as no surprise. I suggest to the House today that the writing was on the wall when the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, Mr Anderson, made his first shipping speech as the minister for transport. In that speech to the National Bulk Commodities Group in December 1999 and again to the same group in December last year, he declared his absolute contempt for the Australian shipping industry. He said Australia is a ‘user’ of shipping services, rather than a provider of shipping. That is, we are a shipper rather than a shipping nation. The minister’s attempts to argue in his speech that this statement does not indicate uninterest in the viability of the Australian shipping industry is dismal. It clearly spells out the ideological approach of the current government to what I regard as a very important part of Australia’s industrial infrastructure. He failed to make that case in the same way he would fail to defend a statement, for example, that Australia is an eating nation and a user of agricultural products, not a nation of food growers or food manufacturers. That is the comparison that the minister for transport and Leader of the National Party would have the maritime industry accept. I would like him to attempt to defend that by saying that it did not indicate uninterest in the viability of Australia’s agricultural industries. Clearly, my contention is that the minister is wrong. Australia is an island nation. It is a trading nation. It is a nation that needs its own shipping industry. As with other island nations that rely on shipping for trade and access, Australia’s shipping industry needs to be acknowledged for its contribution and role. We must also acknowledge the contribution and sacrifices that Australian seafarers make in relation to the best interests of Australia as a nation. It is not easy to be seafarers with the requirement to be away from home for lengthy periods, given the sacrifices that their families make in the best interests of Australia as a nation. Let us clearly say that we have had enough of this unfair, ideological approach by the current government to the shipping industry, which, as far as I am concerned, is about propping up unfair competition for Australian shipping industry interests because, clearly, some shipping companies operating beyond Australian shores are able to compete on more favourable terms compared to Australian shipping interests because of the concessions and benefits given by nations beyond Australia. In November 1998 the government commissioned a further report on the future directions of the industry, the Shipping Reform Working Group’s report. This report was handed to the minister in April 1999. Apart from an announcement in December 1999 that the government would not give fiscal support to the shipping industry, the report remains unanswered. The problem was that the report, as is well known in the industry, did not support the coalition policy to abolish cabotage, and that is why the report has not seen the light of day. The minister hides behind the view that the industry participants in the group do not want to release the report. I think the truth of the matter is that they would like to see the report out but it is the minister who chooses on a regular basis, because of his lack of interest in the transport portfolio, to actually leave tough questions sitting on his desk. There are also some other serious problems in the operation of the shipping industry. The lack of help for the Australian industry not only props up a competitive gap but also guarantees that we will continue to lose very valuable jobs for Australian workers and their families. I therefore go to, for example, the destructive and negative policy that is being pursued by the current government over the operation of continuous and single voyage permits. In the minister’s speech to the Bulk Commodities Group last year, which seems to be the only group that he addresses on shipping policy, the minister confirmed his department would be looking at these legislative changes and so-called ‘barriers’ later this year. In respect of some of these matters, I believe that we also have to seriously look at how some of these continuous and single voyage permit operations actually continue to undermine 1256 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 13 March 2002 the Australian shipping industry. Take for example the CSL Yarra. Last week I was on this vessel in Brisbane. I met the captain and crew-highly-skilled Australian workers and highlyskilled Australian seafarers, working on our interstate transport industry carting cement around the coast between Australian cities. These are Australian workers, and we should not forget this. They have kids going to our schools, they pay taxes in Australia like you and me, they buy all their milk and bread at the local shops, and they participate in their local church and sporting groups. I want to tell the House this afternoon what their greatest fear is. Their fear is that their ship will soon disappear, just as their sister ship and their jobs disappeared only a matter of a couple of years ago. The owners of the CSL Yarra want to do what they did with its sister ship the Torrens. That ship-and the government is proud of this-was sold to a separate company: a subsidiary, surprisingly, headquartered in Asia. It was renamed and reflagged under a flag of convenience. Where? In the Bahamas! So much for Australian workers in the Australian coastal shipping industry. The then named CSL Pacific was brought back onto the Australian coast under a continuing voyage permit as part of the Howard government’s shipping strategy to ‘liberalise’ the coast. The Ukrainian-not Australian, but Ukrainian-crew of this vessel do not pay taxes in Australia. Unlike under arrangements for Australian crews, a significant number of countries grant concessional tax treatment to their seafarers when they are working in other countries. Many countries do not require them to pay any tax at all. By way of comparison, Australia taxes our seafarers working overseas, and we do not tax foreign crews working on our coastal interstate trade. I want to go to the issue of immigration, which is also part of this debate. In respect of the immigration arrangements for the crew, crew members of ships entering Australia are deemed to have special purpose visas. We talk about border protection. We have had more bills presented to the House of Representatives today about so-called border protection and the difficulties with respect to the Pacific solution. I think we ought to have a look at the problems of so-called border protection in coastal shipping in Australia. I refer to the fact that these foreign crews are deemed to have special purpose visas. What do we find when we actually start investigating these so-called special purpose visas? We find one rule on border protection when it comes to the election campaign and another rule on border protection when it comes to a deliberate government policy aimed at exporting Australian jobs and giving overseas countries and overseas companies the perfect opportunity to exploit Australian workers, their families and the Australian community, not only with respect to the issue of tax concessions but also with respect to the important issue of border protection and migration. I will tell you what the record shows with respect to these visas. There is no rigorous scrutiny or identification checking of these crews, who can hold single voyage permits indefinitely if they stay on board the vessel. Who would know who is on the vessel? Are they terrorists or not? It is about time the Australian government actually told the Australian community what they are going to do to toughen up and tighten up on border protection when it comes to the operation of foreign crews in Australian waters, the end result of which is taking away Australian jobs and destroying the livelihood of Australian families. Then we get to the question of coming and going from ships. If crew members leave the ship, they must leave Australia within five days. I just wonder what you could do within five days. We had the Australian government suggesting in the middle of the last election campaign that any of the vessels bringing illegal migrants down to Australia could have a terrorist on board. Here we have a deliberate government policy from a government which prides itself on border protection but which takes no opportunity at all to do a proper investigation of character with respect to the people working on these foreign vessels plying Australian waters. There is one rule and one statement when it comes to the election campaign and border protection. There is another rule and another approach when it comes to undermining the Wednesday, 13 March 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 1257 Australian coastal shipping industry, destroying Australian workers, destroying Australian regional communities and, in essence, undermining our capacity as a nation, with respect to the payment of taxes, to gather enough revenue to ensure that we as a community can invest in our infrastructure and provide proper health and educational opportunities for our young in Australia. The time has come for the Australian community to stand up to this government and demand of it a uniform approach on border protection and also to make sure that we can trade as a nation and that we keep jobs and vessels in Australia. When we come to the shipping industry we should not forget that it is not just about seafarers on ships ploughing our waters; it is also about considering whether we should return to building ships in Australia. We have proven that we can do it on the naval front. We have countries beyond Australia reviewing their policy with respect to the construction of ships. Just go to Great Britain at the moment and have a look at what has occurred, with the election of the Blair government, with respect to support for the shipping industry there. I believe that we should be investigating not only how we keep coastal shipping jobs in Australia but also whether or not in the context of industry policy there are initiatives that we can take to attract investment to the Australian shipbuilding industry and in doing so rebuild industry policy in Australia. I raise these issues because they are very serious issues. We can no longer tolerate what has occurred, for example, with respect to the CSL ships that I have spoken about. We are on the verge of potentially losing another one of their ships and jobs overseas. SoI call upon the minister today to put ideology away. The Labor Party has proven it can do it when it comes to aviation policy in Australia, with the announced merger of Virgin Blue and Patrick yesterday-no ideology; what is in the best interests of Australia. Some of my friends in the union movement, I suppose, woke up this morning wondering, ‘What is Ferguson doing, as a former president of the ACTU, welcoming Mr Corrigan’s involvement in the aviation industry?’ Well, to me it is black and white. It is about what is in the best interests of Australia. It is about what is in the best interests of the aviation industry. It is about what is in the best interests of Australian consumers. Frankly, it is about why you are elected to this parliament: to act in the national interest, not to work on the basis of short-term sectarian political aspirations. I now come to our second reading amendment, to try and pull together the fact that this is a very serious issue. The issue of coastal shipping extends across a range of portfolios-not only the Minister for Transport and Regional Services’ portfolio but also the Treasurer’s portfolio, because the issue of tax concessions and what is applied to overseas crews goes to an issue of revenue and taxation. Coastal shipping also goes to the portfolio of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs with respect to border protection, access to visas and a failure to do proper checks of criminality. On that basis I move as an amendment to the motion for the second reading: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House: (1) condemns the Government for its sustained neglect of Australia’s interstate transport network, especially the coastal shipping industry; (2) notes that the Government has actively supported the use of foreign ships and crews on the coast with inadequate industrial and immigration controls in place and inadequate monitoring of ship safety standards; (3) notes further that the Government’s neglect is leading to the demise of the Australian shipping industry jeopardising our national security and defence and threatening our marine environment; and (4) calls on the Government to drop its ideologically driven opposition to the Australian shipping industry and its blind pursuit of lower shipping charges at the expense of Australia’s broader national interests”. The bill is obviously about the shipping industry and pollution, and we support the government’s intention on this front. But this debate is about more than just that bill. Do not forget 1258 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 13 March 2002 that ships of shame, foreign crews and the Australian government propping up overseas interests can also destroy our environment. I commend the second reading amendment to the House. (Time expired) Ms Jann McFarlane-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak. tion from Ships) Amendment Bill 2002 has a particular interest for my electorate of Paterson, which is truly one of the most diverse electorates represented here in Canberra. The electorate covers an area of approximately 9,600 square kilometres and includes the towns of Bulahdelah, Medowie, Dungog, Gloucester, Maitland, Morpeth, Paterson, Raymond Terrace and Stroud. It also includes one of the most magnificent coastal strips in Australia, stretching from the northern end of Forster-Tuncurry, coming through Pacific Palms, Seal Rocks, Nelson Bay, Port Stephens, Anna Bay, Fingal Bay to the Stockton Bight, which is the largest coastal sand dune in the Southern Hemisphere, and not forgetting the islands off Port Stephens: Broughton Island, Big Island, Cabbage Tree Island and Little Island. The reason I want to join the debate on this bill is that there are five key industries in Paterson that require our waterways to be clean and free of pollution. These are commercial fishing, recreational fishing, oyster production, aquaculture in the way of snapper farming, and tourism. Do not forget, though, that the ports of Forster-Tuncurry, Port Stephens and Newcastle house very active fishing co-ops that support very strong commercial fishing fleets. Unlike the farm paddock where we can go out and have a look at the number of animals on the paddock and the quality of the soil, see whether the fences are intact and look at what the weather conditions are doing to it, unfortunately with the ocean most things are hidden to us. These polluters threaten the very core industries that I have mentioned, and I welcome any amendment introduced by this bill that may deter polluters in the areas and enforce tough penalties. As a current ship’s master class V, I know that previously only owners and masters of ships could be prosecuted for discharges of pollutants such as oil and noxious substances, including ballast or garbage, from their ships. The government has made amendments to the International Maritime Conventions Legislation Amendment Act 2001 so that any person, not just the ship’s master or owner, whose negligent or reckless conduct causes an unlawful discharge of pollutants from a ship into the sea is guilty of an offence. Owners and masters of ships remain strictly liable for discharges of pollutants from their ships whether or not other persons have recklessly, negligently or wilfully discharged pollutants, although owners and masters, because they are held strictly liable, are therefore subject to lesser penalties. The bill that we are debating today provides that the offence provision in the pollution prevention act have an effect in the exclusive economic zone. This is the zone where many businesses in Paterson derive their income. Given the importance of fishing, oyster production, aquaculture and tourism to the local economies of Port Stephens and the Great Lakes, we must establish tougher penalties against people who can potentially devastate the livelihood of hundreds of people along the coastline. Heavy pollution could completely wipe out these industries, which have existed for generations and which have been the lifeblood of many families. Two weeks ago, Port Stephens hosted the annual New South Wales Game Fishing Association’s interclub competition off Port Stephens. It is estimated that, during the week of fishing competitions, around $5 million was injected into the local economy. People travelled as far as from the USA and from Broome on the western coast of West Australia just for the thrill of testing their skills against that big marlin on their line. Some were successful; some were not.",155,Representatives Main Committee

If there were a pollutant discharge of a serious nature in the waters off Port Stephens during this event, the effects would be devastating. It would mean the loss of income for local tourist operators and accommodation providers, but more importantly it would mean the area’s reputation as one of the most beautiful beach side havens would be crushed. It would mean that future investments and events would be tarnished. We can all remember the effect of the Sygna being blown ashore on Stockton Beach many years ago. Whilst this wreck is now a tourist icon in the Hunter, the pollutant effect was serious. This would be only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the potential of pollution in the area. The area is a gateway for imports and exports for so many industries in the electorate, as is the port of Newcastle. One of the famous exports of the area is the sand from Stockton Bight, which is now located on Waikiki beach, such is the quality of the sand in the local area. Millions of tonnes of goods go through the port every year and in turn have a direct effect on the livelihood of the people in the Hunter region. As many parliamentarians know, the port of Newcastle is one of Australia’s largest, with over 3,000 shipping movements per annum and cargo handling in excess of 77 million tonnes per annum. The port of Newcastle is also the world’s largest coal export port. A major pollution spill in the port or in or around the surrounding economic zone would have, again, a devastating effect on our local environment. It is not just spills but the intentional discharge of ballast tanks, with the foreign marine creatures that can be introduced into our marine environment, that are a major problem. We have viable aquaculture and oyster industries, and the introduction of foreign species that attack these can be devastating. Newcastle, which for many has been known as a steel city, has begun a metamorphosis into a city that is embracing a new lease of life. The foreshore is going ahead with commercial and residential buildings, the cafe culture is booming, the development of a marina has received unprecedented interest and the desire for a cleaner Hunter image has permeated the old guard. A pollution disaster would have an enormous impact on the port and the businesses that use the port to move their products. I remind the House that several years ago the Great Lakes, which is another vital part of the Paterson economy, was crushed by oyster contamination. I admit that it was not from a ship, but the effect of pollution is the same on the economy of an area. Hundreds of people who rely on oyster production were devastated by the contamination, and consumer confidence in the local seafood plummeted. Thankfully, the local industry has bounced back stronger than ever before and the delicacy of these industries has never been clearer or cleaner. We rely on the health of our waterways for the economic survival of the region. We are reliant on oysters, fishing and tourism for the livelihood of hundreds of families. I welcome these amendments to the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution From Ships) Act, which will mean that any person-rather than just the ship’s master or ownerwhose negligence, reckless or wilful conduct causes an unlawful discharge of pollutants from a ship into the sea is guilty of an offence. It is paramount that we protect our waterways, and I would welcome any amendments that make polluting our waterways an offence. This is about protecting the livelihoods and incomes of the thousands of people in Paterson. We welcome the support of the ALP on this amendment. Ms O’BYRNE (Bass) (12.18 p.m.)-I rise today, as have previous speakers, to address the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Amendment Bill 2002. I just want to briefly comment on the remarks made by the member for Paterson. Unfortunately, he has left. Mr Laurie Ferguson-He’s gone off to get another earner. Ms O’BYRNE-Perhaps. He spent some time talking about the environment in which he lives, the importance of shipping, the importance of a clean environment and doing everything that we can to make sure that we preserve this wonderful environment that he lives in. 1260 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 13 March 2002 That apparently does not go so far as to actually support the ALP in its amendments to ensure that we can actually restrict the type of vessels that are operating in that area. It is not enough just to be able to fine them if they do something wrong; we want to make sure that that something wrong does not actually happen. It concerns me that the member for Paterson cannot make that leap. Coming from Launceston, on the Tamar River, I am only too aware of the devastating impact on marine life and surrounds from ship pollution. Members present will remember the Iron Baron, which released 325 tonnes of oil into the Tamar River when it ran aground on Hebe Reef in 1995. It is a reef that has claimed a few ships, unfortunately. This, however, almost pales into insignificance when you set it against the perils that our marine environment continues to face. The bill before us today seeks to clarify an important application of ship pollution provisions, to amend the unintended effects of the International Maritime Convention Legislation Amendment Act 2001 which, with its introduction, amended the Prevention of Pollution from Ships Act. The unintended consequence of drafting errors created a situation whereby offences under the act were geographically restricted. Some of the offences relating to oil, noxious liquid substances and garbage could not be applied to the area that takes up the edge of the 12 nautical mile territorial sea to the limit of the 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone. In effect, a ship discharging a pollutant in this area could not be prosecuted under Australian law. The amendments today extend the geographic coverage of the various pollution offences to apply to either Australian or foreign ships in the exclusive economic zone. In itself, the bill is straightforward and, of course, is supported by the opposition, as its intent is entirely appropriate. The current situation has led us to difficult circumstances regarding waste oil that washed up on Phillip Island in Victoria last December. Whilst investigations are still continuing as to who may be responsible for that, if it turns out that the offence took place within this confined geographical region that is excluded, then the ship would not be deemed to have committed an offence under the act. This lack of ability to prosecute potential environmental disasters is not one that can be tolerated. The Commonwealth has an important role in implementing safeguards and in leading discussions with states on complementary legislation for protection of our coast and marine environments. This is an important bill. What is equally important is the maritime industry environment into which this bill is introduced-an environment fostered by a government so obsessed with its ideological obsession to destroy elements of the shipping industry that it is prepared to jeopardise Australian jobs, Australian ships, Australian defence and the Australian coastal environment. In light of the situation into which the government is obsessed with leading us, the honourable member for Batman moved the following amendment: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House: (1) condemns the Government for its sustained neglect of Australia’s interstate transport network, especially the coastal shipping industry; (2) notes that the Government has actively supported the use of foreign ships and crews on the coast with inadequate industrial and immigration controls in place and inadequate monitoring of ship safety standards; (3) notes further that the Government’s neglect is leading to the demise of the Australian shipping industry, jeopardising our national security and defence, and threatening our marine environment; and (4) calls on the Government to drop its ideologically driven opposition to the Australian shipping industry and its blind pursuit of lower shipping charges at the expense of Australia’s broader national interests”. Wednesday, 13 March 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 1261 This is an amendment worthy of the support of all members of the House. The Prime Minister often looks longingly at the US government when he seeks to plot his course and, thereby, the course of our nation. What a pity he is so selective in his attentions! During the last United States election campaigns, Mr Bush issued a statement declaring his support for the American merchant navy. The Bush-Cheney ticket stated that: ... the maritime industry has long played a vital role in our nation’s commerce and defence. Safe, reliable marine transportation of goods and passengers is essential to sustaining growth in the US economy and to our international trade. In time of war or emergency, the US military depends on shipping and seafarers drawn from the US flag commercial fleet ... The statement went on: As President, Governor Bush will seek to provide the conditions under which the American maritime industry can compete and grow in the 21st century. He will support a revitalised industry that creates jobs and is a competitive transportation option. What a vast and enlightened gulf away from this government’s transport policy in the maritime industry! Transport Minister John Anderson believes that we are nation which uses ships but which does not really have a role to play in shipping. Well, we do have a role and we have a role for a number of very important reasons, not least in the area already recognised so well by the US government, the role of defence. The government has made much of our commitment to defence, but not in the merchant navy area. It does not take a genius to recognise the importance of our transport capacity in times of war as a component of our overall defence plan. In fact, as recently as the events in East Timor, the merchant fleet provided valuable assistance and were applauded for doing so by General Cosgrove. But it is not just the US government which understands this better than our transport minister does but also the UK government and the UK shipping industry. When the British government announced significant support for its struggling shipping industry, the chairman of P&O, Lord Sterling, welcomed the decision and made much of the fact that they were conscious of the UK’s fleet as the ‘fourth arm of defence’. The way that this government is prepared to allow foreign ships with foreign crews to ply our waters with few restrictions or controls means that these ships may well instead provide the first arm of attack against us in a time of conflict. It is not just our defence in wartime that the government must pay attention to, but the defence of our maritime coastline. Protection of our marine environment, of our marine life and of our pristine coasts are primary obligations of any government, and they are ones that many countries take seriously. Take as a strong example the Greek shipping industry, which funds the Hellenic Marine Environment Protection Society. The industry does so, because it recognises that, as is quoted in the International Commission on Shipping Inquiry into Ship Safety, ships ‘are potential polluters if not properly built, professionally manned and managed, thoroughly maintained and carefully managed’. Many members who will speak on this bill are familiar with some of the names I am about to read out: the Kirke, the Erika and the Bunga Teratai Satu-how will we ever forget the image of that ship sitting up on the Barrier Reef? In the case of the Erika, the resulting pollution from the break-up of the ship 45 nautical miles off the French coast necessitated a clean-up of 400 kilometres of coastline, closed beaches, halted salt production and resulted in fishing bans. The Erika had been renamed 10 times, had been classed with four different classification societies, had had a variety of owners and managers during her working life and had changed flag four times. The Bunga Teratai Satu ran aground on the Great Barrier Reef, and we were faced with the very real risk of an oil spill in a world heritage listed area. Sections of the reef had to be blasted away to free the vessel, and the ship’s antifouling paint-which contained tributyl-tin-has, due to the grounding, damaged coral that it is estimated might take some five years to return. 1262 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 13 March 2002 I spent a little bit of time looking at the AMSA web site and, in particular, at some of the detained ships reports for the last six months. It does not take much imagination to think about the potential damage to our coasts and our marine life when you look at these detention lists. I want to read into Hansard a few of the things that have come out over the last six months in the ships reports: Hole in floor/tank top between slop tank and ballast tank causing contamination of ballast water Oily water separator inoperable Main engine sea water cooling pipe holed, excessive leakage into engine room Engine room oily water separator inoperable Vessels safety management does not ensure adequate maintenance of equipment critical to safety of vessel Maintenance of ship does not conform to ship safety Management system. Oily water separator defective ISM code deficiencies Oil contaminated ballast water discharged into harbour Bilge suctions defective. Along with these problems there are lots of problems regarding ballast tank air vents, there are numerous fire safety breaches and there are countless occasions either of communication faults or an inability to operate communication facilities on a ship. These are the ships that work our coasts. Marine accidents happen, but they happen more regularly with poorly maintained foreign flag vessels. The minister is not only increasing the number of these vessels on our coasts; he is out there, with a big grin and a wave, cheering in vessels that are not safe enough to work on our coasts, vessels that pose not only marine damage risks but also potential disease risks. You would think the minister might understand the risk of importation of disease. The foot-and-mouth epidemic in the UK was hardly kept a secret. Can you imagine the sort of devastation that would occur here? Without effective border controls, this is indeed a very real risk. The minister is actively engaging in a program of destroying Australian jobs and destroying Australian job opportunities. He is allowing a system of subsidised foreign ships and crews to take on our industries and to take on our jobs. He is cheering on a system where Australian workers are dumped and replaced, in the case of the CSL Yarra, by a Ukrainian crew-a Ukrainian crew who do not contribute to our tax revenue and who may not have the excellent standards of training and expertise that Australian trained crews have, many of whom were trained in my electorate. They do not even have to meet the normal visa requirements of anyone else wanting to work in Australia. This is where the matter of importing ships becomes crucial as the impact of the Migration Act is considered. If you are from another country and you want to get a job in Australia, you have to go through a strict process. From your country of residence you make an application with an employer sponsor, and it must be established that there is no Australian who can perform that task. But, if you are a foreign seafarer, the government does not really care who you are. I wonder if the minister for immigration actually knows this, because it seems a world away from the position he takes on other migration issues. Crew members of ships entering Australia that are not classified as imported are deemed to have special purpose visas. They have carte blanche; we do not care. We as a nation are tightening up every other form of access to this country. A nation quite rightly concerned about the growth of terrorism says, ‘Don’t care who you are or how long you want to stay as long as you spend most of the time on a ship.’ Between March 1996 and 30 April 1999, 263 deserters from foreign ships were reported by the Australian Customs Service. They were the ones who were reported. Some 148 were located. As the government Wednesday, 13 March 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 1263 grants unlimited access to the coastal trade, the management of a large number of foreign seafarers semi-permanently operating on the Australian coast will have to become a nightmare. This is a situation that the government is fostering. For proper migration treatment, a ship must be deemed to be imported. Historically, the test has been to determine whether the ship is on an international voyage starting and commencing overseas. We now have a situation in the circumstance of a continuous voyage permit being granted. Those ships are not being declared imported. They can then blatantly ply the coastal trade for months, undertaking work which in almost all cases could be undertaken by Australian ships with Australian crews. These practices are depriving Australians of jobs and Australian families of income and support. Customs seem to be using the fact that a CVP has been granted to come up with the conclusion that the ship’s international voyage has not been broken, regardless of how many times it discharges a cargo and takes on a new one, regardless of how long it has been on the coast. A department of transport permit is all you need, and the minister is happy to hand those out. By this means, the minister can allow foreign crews to work our coasts indefinitely, with insufficient crew monitoring and few, if any, visa restrictions, jeopardising not only our border security but also the livelihoods of Australian seafarers and the economic viability of Australian shipping companies. Australia is an island nation with the fifth largest maritime task in the world, a fact that the minister claims to understand. In a speech entitled ‘Shipping in the new millennium’ that the minister gave in Brisbane in 1999, he mentioned this, so we assume he understands it. He also referred to the fact that 99 per cent of imports and 96 per cent of exports by volume are transported by sea and that about 50 million tonnes of cargo are shipped annually. He said that this is a large industry, it is important to our economic development and it is vital for Australian jobs. The minister went on to say: In light of these figures, it is obvious why the government has taken such a high profile role in addressing maritime transport issues. Let us look at the record. The number of Australian ships has almost halved, training for Australian seafarers has plummeted, and we are still waiting not only for the 1997 shipping report but also for the 1999 shipping report. I can only hope that the minister does not continue to play such a high profile role, or we will not only be without ships but also be without any seafarers. The minister claims to recognise our world-class maritime training facilities, our ship management expertise and our high quality safety regime. In his speech to the National Bulk Commodities Group annual dinner, he made reference to a perceived lack of incentives for young people to choose a career at sea and that this was depleting the pool of maritime skills in Australia. They are skills which we need to sustain our port operations. It is not a perceived lack of incentives; it is the removal of carefully planned programs that ensured that Australia had some of the best trained seafarers in the world. It is the demise of a nation’s shipping fleet, which has supported training and opportunity. It is the minister failing to engage in the issues facing the shipping industry and providing the industry with an opportunity not only to grow but even to compete in the current market. It is a lack of understanding on the part of the minister that he actually has a job to do. Our reputation as a nation of quality seafarers and owners of safe ships did not just occur; it did not suddenly appear out of the blue. These things did not come due to this minister and his so-called high profile role. What will come of his betrayal of a high profile role is the loss of that shipping expertise, the diminution of our safety standards and our inability to support the port-related professions so necessary for port management. We need a viable shipping industry, and the minister needs to stop his so-called measured approach before he measures Australian coastal shipping out of existence. appointment.

324,Mr Sidebottom (Braddon) (12.34 P.m.),"Mr Deputy Speaker, congratulations on your1264 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 13 March 2002 Ships) Amendment Bill 2002. This is the second time today I have risen to help correct an oversight in government legislation. This morning I was speaking on the Coal Industry Repeal (Validation of Proclamation) Bill 2002, and I believe we have had some drafting problems with this bill. But, most importantly, it is absolutely essential that we get this legislation right. Anything which helps prevent pollution in our seas is absolutely vital and should receive our 100 per cent support. Like the honourable member for Bass, Michelle O’Byrne, I come from Tasmania, and I proudly represent the electorate of Braddon, which is essentially the north-west and west coast of Tasmania, including King Island. We proudly come from a great maritime island and are proudly part of the great maritime nation of Australia. Things maritime are very important to us and that of course involves shipping, which we rely on so much. Also, they are absolutely crucial to us for our security and defence and, importantly, for the protection of our environment. All of those issues are tied up with shipping. Anything which threatens shipping, threatens our nation and threatens, in particular, my island state. We should take great care to ensure that that which is most important to our security is indeed carefully observed and monitored. I am quite surprised by the lack of national interest in our shipping industry, particularly in this House. If we look at the time spent in minute reflection on our shipping industry and issues related to it with that spent on our general defencewhich until recently has not been that much, but certainly border security has taken up our time-if we look at them proportionately, our shipping industry would be sunk totally. It strikes me that an industry which is so important to our security is so ignored. I am not sure whether it is through a lack of diligence or-I would hate to think that this is true-an ideological desire to punish certain elements of that industry in order to bring about its demise. Because, statistically, that is what is happening, Statistically, the Australian shipping industry has declined and declined considerably. Australia is almost totally dependent upon sea transport for the carriage of its imports and exports-fact. In terms of tonnes/kilometres, Australia has the fifth largest maritime transport task in the world-fact. However less than one per cent of this trade generated by Australia is carried out in Australian flag shipping-fact. Virtually the whole of the task, necessitating some 60,000 to 70,000 ship visits per year, is carried out by foreign flagships whose crews are not Australian nationals. They are not our jobs; it is not our income; we do not own them. In 1990, the Australian fleet comprised 76 ships, of which 45 were involved in coastal shipping. In 1999, the fleet comprised 58 ships, of which only 35 were involved in coastal shipping. Ten per cent of our nation’s coastal trade is carried by foreign ships, which is a fourfold increase since the early 1990s. In the early 1990s, around 200 flag of convenience permits were granted per year, but by the mid-1990s this had risen to 450 and by 1998 some 700 permits were issued. The number is continuing to increase and many more single voyage permits have been granted, which has further exacerbated the situation. We have a shipping industry in relative decline. Foreign flag vessels, with either continuous voyage permits or single voyage permits, are plying our coast, doing our business. What has the government being doing while all this has been going on? To be polite and at best, it has a ‘do nothing’ policy. In 1996, the coalition government commissioned a report on the future directions of the Australian shipping industry-good on it. The report of the Shipping Reform Group was handed to the responsible minister in April 1997. By August 1998, the government had not responded to the report. In November 1998, the government commissioned a further report from the Shipping Reform Working Group on the future directions of the industry, which was handed to the minister in April 1999. In December 1999, the responsible minister announced that the government would not make fiscal measures available to the Australian shipping industry and the industry have still not received a response to the Shipping Reform Working Group report. And if the Wednesday, 13 March 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 1265 response is anything like it is to my letters to the current minister regarding the lack of security at regional airports, they will be lucky to hear anything for the next 10 years. The decimation of Australia’s shipping fleet and the emergence of foreign vessels operating on our interstate and intrastate routes is no coincidence. Foreign vessels are literally taking cargo off Australian ships by obtaining single voyage permits or continuing voyage permits, thus carrying interstate cargo without having to obtain a licence. Picture this if you will: Australian crews on Australian ships waiting at Australian ports, watching Australian cargo-that is, cargo that they should be transporting-being loaded onto foreign ships. Remember that the practice is being aided and abetted by this government’s shipping policy-or lack of it. According to a submission by the Australian Shipowners Association to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee, which was, at that time, looking at the Maritime Legislation Amendment Bill 2000, the proliferation of permits has resulted in an increasing volume of coastal cargo being carried in foreign ships. The shipowners’ submission noted: It is well known in the industry that cargo interests intending to seek a permit keep track of Australian vessels so as to ensure that an Australian vessel will not be available when they make their permit application. Watch and see and strike. Moreover, permits are usually sought and granted at such short notice that it can be readily contrived to avoid engaging an Australian ship. Cargo carried in vessels issuing SVPs and CVPs increased by 0.7 million tonnes, or 10.1 per cent, to eight million tonnes in 1999-2000, which represents growth of 507.5 per cent compared with figures for 1991-92. The cargo carried per permit issued continued to increase-from 9,778 tonnes in 1998-99 to 11,430 tonnes in 1999-2000. Vessels issued with SVPs and CVPs transported 15.1 per cent of the Australian interstate and intrastate transport industry task by sea in 1998-99. So what we have seen, effectively, is the demise of Australian shipping and the dramatic increase in the issuing of coastal permits to foreign-flagged ships of convenience. I was interested to read the transcript of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee’s consideration of additional estimates of Tuesday, 19 February 2002. I was very interested in the exchange between Senator O’Brien, the shadow minister for primary industries and resources, and Mr Greg Feeney from the Transport and Infrastructure Division. What concerned me most in reading the estimates transcript-which I must admit, if you suffer from insomnia, is a very nice tonic-were two things that came out of the exchange. Firstly, the actual visa status of foreign crews seem to be very lax at best. If we ran our normal immigration policy based on what appears to be fairly lax monitoring procedures we would have more than just trouble with border protection. It really did strike me that this whole area of foreign crews, given the tremendous increase in the frequency of flags of convenience ships visiting our ports, is very dicey. The monitoring of those crews, I suggest, is a matter for potential concern. Another interesting issue is what I believe is the rather lax issuing of permits for these foreign vessels and what appears to be little regulatory control by the relevant minister. I will return to that matter in a moment. I also found it interesting to note, as has been mentioned by previous speakers, that these foreign crews do not pay taxes to Australia; the tax relates to the operators of the ships. If you read the Ships of shame report and its sequels, you find that many crew members are working under very severe conditions and that we do not benefit from their presence here at all, apart from the fact that they take away jobs from Australian workers. The chamber may be aware that there is an issue currently before the courts relating to the CSL Yarra-the intention or otherwise of CSL Australia to divest itself of the Yarra, as occurred with its sister ship the Pacific, which was formerly the MV River Torrens. I believe there are actions taking place relating to a possible problem with members of the crew. What 1266 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 13 March 2002 was interesting with respect to this affair was the astounding admission, confirmed by the office of the minister for transport, that the minister has no power to immediately revoke a foreign shipper’s permit to operate along the coast. The shadow minister for transport called on the minister to immediately revoke the permit of the CSL Pacific if it was found to be in breach of its coastal permit conditions. One of the conditions to which the permit of the CSL Pacific is subject is-and I quote: That the vessel is not detained under Australia’s PSC program nor under investigation by the ATSB during the currency of this permit. On 26 February 2002, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau confirmed that they were investigating an incident on the CSL Pacific in which a Ukrainian crew member was seriously injured. I am led to believe that the minister’s office told AAP that the minister could not revoke the permit of the CSL Pacific as six months notice was required and that ‘the permit expires on 2 April anyway which is well before the six month period’. This is a major concession that the coastal permit provisions do not protect Australia’s interests and that the minister does not care what foreign ships do on the coast. The minister is quick to issue these permits, with limited scrutiny of conditions on board or proper security and immigration checks on the crews, but he is loath to revoke them when breaches are found. I think everyone would agree that the whole area of crewing, the regulations surrounding the issuing of permits and, most unfortunately, the continued demise of Australian shipping in light of the provision of more of these flags of convenience ships, is of real concern to the Australian community. The shadow minister has moved amendments to this bill, and I support those amendments. They say in part: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House: (1) condemns the Government for its sustained neglect of Australia’s interstate transport network, especially the coastal shipping industry; (2) notes that the Government has actively supported the use of foreign ships and crews on the coast with inadequate industrial and immigration controls in place and inadequate monitoring of ship safety standards; (3) notes further that the Government’s neglect is leading to the demise of the Australian shipping industry, jeopardising our national security and defence, and threatening our marine environment; and (4) calls on the Government to drop its ideologically driven opposition to the Australian shipping industry and its blind pursuit of lower shipping charges at the expense of Australia’s broader national interests”. Deputy Speaker, I take this opportunity to congratulate you on your promotion to an august position in the Westminster system. I would like to speak on behalf of the Minister for Transport and Regional Services regarding the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Amendment Bill 2002. I thank all the speakers who have participated in the debatesix from the opposition, and two government speakers, the member for Petrie and the member for Paterson. The principal aim of this bill is to amend the principal Commonwealth act intended to prevent pollution from ships. The principal legislation, the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act was amended last year to provide that any person-rather than just a ship’s master or owner-whose negligent or reckless conduct causes unlawful discharge of pollutants from a ship into the sea is guilty of an offence. This was a very important amendment to ensure that penalties are applied to individuals, not just to the ship’s master or owners. From my understanding, the current legislation has come about due to a technical drafting error. The bill provides for a penalty of $1 million for a ship owner or $200,000 for the master. Owners and masters of ships remain strictly liable for any unlawful discharge of pollutants",165,Representatives Main Committee
325,Mr Anthony (Richmond,"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs) (12.50 p.m.)MrWednesday, 13 March 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 1267 from their ships, whether or not a person engaged in reckless or negligent conduct that caused the discharge. An unintentional consequence of these recent amendments by the International Maritime Conventions Legislation Amendment Act 2002 was to exclude the offence provisions from taking effect in Australia’s 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone. This is quite important, because the states have responsibility for about three nautical miles, from my understanding; beyond 12 nautical miles, in our economic zone, we have not had this legislative power before. The bill extends the geographical coverage of the penalty provisions to include the exclusive economic zone. I want to make one other point. The member for Batman was a bit critical of the fact that the bill and the offences were not seen to be retrospective from 1 October 2001. I have been advised that, whilst the pollution prevention bill does correct a drafting error, it also has the effect of applying criminal provisions over the exclusive economic zone for pollution from ships. In drafting the bill, it was considered that the application of the criminal provisions is more than a minor technical amendment which corrects the drafting error for the purpose of the retrospective application. My advice is that this issue was raised in the Bills Digest. The Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee has stated that it will not comment adversely in relation to the retrospectivity of legislation if it does no more than correct a drafting error. It is considered that the retrospective application of the fault offence where the discharge was caused by reckless or negligent behaviour is more than a minor technical amendment to correct a drafting error. I commend the bill to the House. Question negatived. Original question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Rearrangement move: That order of the day No. 3, government business, be postponed until a later hour this day. Question agreed to. Second Reading Debate resumed from 14 February, on motion by Dr Nelson: That this bill be now read a second time. Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (12.56 p.m.)-I am pleased today to offer Labor’s support for the Student Assistance Amendment Bill 2002. The bill will permit social security, veterans and family assistance overpayments to be offset against benefits payable under the Assistance for Isolated Children scheme and the Abstudy scheme. It will also increase the notification period for students from seven to 14 days, another welcome change. I would like to make some brief remarks on how the proposed legislation will change debt recovery procedures and why Labor believes that the new arrangements will be beneficial to Abstudy and AIC clients. Approximately 20 per cent of the current 50,000 Abstudy and 12,000 AIC recipients have debts to Centrelink. That is a large number of students. Apparently the average level of debt for the broad Centrelink customer base is about $800. Centrelink has advised that there is no reason to suggest that this is any different for indigenous clients. Quite a large number of indigenous students-around 20 per cent of the Abstudy students-will have debts of about $800, we understand, so that is a significant amount.",168,Representatives Main Committee
326,Mr Anthony (Richmond,"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs) (12.56 p.m.)-I1268 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 13 March 2002 Under current debt recovery procedures, Centrelink sends the individual a letter advising of the reason for the debt and the amount of the debt. Clients then have 28 days to repay in full or to negotiate other repayment arrangements. Individuals often ring Centrelink and request that their debt be gradually reduced through deductions from their future entitlement, but unfortunately the current legislation precludes Centrelink from enabling debts to be reduced in this way. It is important to note that reductions from future entitlements are the standard procedure for recovering debts from other social security recipients. Abstudy and AIC clients are instead advised that they can repay through the Post Office, by cheque or money order, by telephone, by the internet or by setting up a direct debit arrangement with their bank, which then returns the money owed to Centrelink. Many of these procedures are very costly for clients who are already experiencing significant disadvantage. They may also be very difficult to organise for many of the Abstudy and AIC clients who live in rural and, in some cases, very remote areas. The withholding facility proposed in this bill would automate a repayment schedule based on a standard 14 per cent withholding rate, when an Abstudy or AIC client has a debt and once the client has been advised. Of particular concern to Labor was to make sure that the repayment of debt did not put at risk the payment to recipients of Abstudy or those receiving assistance under the AIC scheme. We do not want to see those people having insufficient income to live on in the future and, in particular, we do not want to jeopardise their participation in education programs. Recipients of both of these payments are from groups whose access to-and, I might say, successful completion of-education is shamefully low. We have been assured by the department that guidelines would allow the 14 per cent withholding rate to be negotiated to a lower level if the standard repayment rate placed clients under too much pressure. I certainly look forward to seeing those guidelines and making sure that that is the case so that people are not further disadvantaged. We are persuaded that the withholding facility that is already in place for youth allowance, Austudy payment and the Newstart allowance customers should also be available to AIC and Abstudy recipients. For those who live in remote and isolated areas, the withholding facility will offer a more efficient, less costly and more flexible means to reimburse Centrelink. I do, on this occasion, want to place on the record some of our very deep concerns about this government’s failure to improve educational outcomes for indigenous Australians. I am glad to see that the Minister for Education, Science and Training has come into the chamber. The record exposes the government’s commitment to ‘practical reconciliation’-the government’s term-for what we would consider to be the hollow rhetoric that it is. In the sitting week before this, the minister for education took a question from his own side in order to boast that his government had increased by 678 the number of indigenous students in higher education. Not only did he significantly overstate the increase; he failed to mention that between 1999 and 2000 the number of indigenous students enrolled in higher education actually fell by over eight per cent, or 685 students. He failed to mention that the number of indigenous students commencing higher education in the year 2000 was over 15 per cent lower than commencements in the previous year. He failed to mention that the percentage of indigenous students completing year 12 actually fell in 2001 and, at 36.3 per cent, is less than half the retention rate for non-indigenous students. Unfortunately we are seeing from this minister an intention to profess concern for indigenous disadvantage without acknowledging the extent of the problem. I would have to say that that sort of rhetoric will certainly not improve the life chances of indigenous Australians. It is only by improving access to education and making sure that we have improved completion rates-whether it is at school, TAFE or university-that we will see an improvement in opportunity for those students. Wednesday, 13 March 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 1269 tions on your new position. I rise today to discuss the merits of the Student Assistance Amendment Bill 2002. In essence, this bill comprises a list of amendments designed to bring certain aspects of the Student Assistance Act 1973 into line with other social security acts. This bill is vital to ensuring that the student assistance program already embarked upon over the last three decades continues to move with the times and provides both students and the government with a fair and equitable system. The proposed amendments will help to ensure consistency in arrangements between the Student Assistance Act and the Social Security Act in terms of permitting the recovery of overpayments and also the required notification period. The Student Assistance Amendment Bill 2002 sets out firstly to permit social security, veterans affairs and family assistance legislation overpayments to be offset against benefits payable under the Assistance for Isolated Children scheme and the Abstudy scheme. These overpayment offsets were permitted under the former act until amendments in 1998 took effect to reflect the introduction of the youth allowance under the Social Security Act. Not only will this amendment assist the government by enabling it to recover up to $4.4 million by offsetting; it will also improve efficiency and reduce administrative procedures for both the government and the clients. The amendments will give witholdings a legislative basis while at the same time provide clients with a right of appeal. We all know that welfare cheats cost the Australian taxpayer enormous amounts of money annually, and nearly everyone has a story about someone who is cheating the system. Welfare cheats steal money that could be used to help the more vulnerable in our community, and they take advantage of our generous welfare system, despite the fact that it was designed to assist the needy and not the greedy. Our government is extremely concerned about the cost of welfare cheats to Australian taxpayers and as such has been particularly careful to devise various detection methods to catch welfare cheats. It is expected to recover up to $4.4 million in overpayments, which is $4.4 million we can use to help those in need. The second amendment of the bill is simply designed to update the definitions in the Student Assistance Act 1973 to reflect that the Aboriginal Overseas Study Assistance scheme no longer exists. Provisions are now contained in the present Abstudy scheme and the government, through this amendment, has amended the definitions of the current special assistance scheme and the special educational assistance scheme to reflect this change. The third and final amendment increases the seven-day notification period in which students are obliged to notify certain proscribed events, in section 48 of the act, to a 14-day period. While this bill is not designed to pursue individuals with regard to overpayments, it is designed to assist students by automatically withholding payments when moneys are owed to the Commonwealth. This bill is of benefit to all concerned, and it goes a long way to improving the consistency of the Student Assistance Act 1973. I commend the bill to the House. Dr NELSON (Bradfield-Minister for Education, Science and Training) (1.07 p.m.)-in replyMr Deputy Speaker Baressi, I offer my congratulations on your appointment to serve as a deputy speaker on the Speaker’s Panel. I thank those who spoke to the bill. I strongly refute the remarks of the member for Jagajaga in relation to indigenous education and the government’s commitment to it. I will address those issues at another time. The Student Assistance Amendment Bill 2002 amends the Student Assistance Act 1973 and the Abstudy and Assistance for Isolated Children schemes, which are non-statutory executive schemes funded through the appropriation acts. The Student Assistance Act 1973 provides the statutory mechanism in relation to debt recovery and administrative appeals for these schemes. There is little point repeating what I said in my second reading speech or repeating the contributions made by honourable members, and the very good contribution from the member for Barker in particular.",169,Representatives Main Committee
327,Mr Secker (Barker) (1.03 P.m.),"Mr Deputy Speaker Barresi, I offer my congratula1270 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 13 March 2002 There are three points that should be made in conclusion. The Independent Review of Breaches and Penalties in the Social Security System is an independent review of the social security system conducted by Professor Dennis Pearce, who is a former Commonwealth Ombudsman and professor of law at the Australian National University. The report was released on 11 March, two days ago. I also, on behalf of the government, strongly refute the opposition’s claim that this report in some way shows that the government is more interested in, to use the opposition’s terms, ‘reducing costs,’ than helping people in need. Nothing could be further from the truth, and that impugns the reputation of Mr Pearce. This amendment bill aims to assist students receiving Abstudy and Assistance for Isolated Children benefits and who have a debt from other Commonwealth programs to have that debt offset against future entitlements. A withholding facility is a far more efficient way to go and easier for the repayment of debt, and as such I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House with an amendment. Sitting suspended from 1.10 p.m. to 4.36 p.m. (APPLICATION OF CRIMINAL CODE) BILL 2002 Second Reading Debate resumed from 20 February, on motion by Mr Tuckey: That this bill be now read a second time. Regional Services Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2002, I want to firstly congratulate you, Madam Deputy Speaker Corcoran, on your appointment as Deputy Speaker. I think this is your first occasion occupying the chair of the Main Committee, and I wish you well in your new endeavours. The purpose of this bill is to make consequential amendments to certain offence provisions in legislation, for which the Minister for Transport and Regional Services has ministerial responsibility, to reflect the application of the Criminal Code Act 1995. The amendments will ensure that the offence provisions operate in the manner they did prior to the application of the Criminal Code. The bill affects a small number of offence provisions that were not included in the Transport and Regional Services Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2001 and are therefore inconsistent with the Criminal Code principles. The amendments arise from the requirement to, firstly, specify that an offence or a physical element of an offence is not one of strict liability; secondly, clarify the physical elements of an offence; thirdly, clarify the fault elements of an offence, especially where the fault elements vary from those specified by the Criminal Code; and, fourthly and finally, separate defences from offences and identify the evidential burden in relation to a defence. The opposition supports the bill, and I am pleased it provides an opportunity to raise some other issues of concern to the opposition. I draw the House’s attention to the fact that the topic of the bill is the Criminal Code. When a member of the House thinks of the Criminal Code they are immediately drawn to what is specified as appropriate behaviour. The Criminal Code, as we all appreciate, sets out the law of the land to guide us in a daily life-the ground rules of what is expected as acceptable behaviour in the eyes of the judiciary and, more importantly, in the eyes of the Australian community. What the Criminal Code does not specify is the moral and ethical code, but there certainly are values and ethics that underpin the Criminal Code. I suppose it is about what we as a community expect as acceptable behaviour. With respect to the bill before us, I simply say that this is the culmination of an exercise that makes certain changes across all federal legislation with respect to fines, punishments and",171,Representatives Main Committee
328,Mr Martin Ferguson (Batman) (4.36 P.m.),"Before turning to the Transport andWednesday, 13 March 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 1271 liability. In short, the bill makes the portfolio legislation-and implicitly, therefore, the industry that is bound by it-comply with certain standards and therefore ethics and values. Today, I call into question the ethics of, and the degradation of office and responsibilities by, the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Transport and Regional Services, and Leader of the National Party, John Anderson. Yesterday at question time in the House of Representatives, Australia’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services accepted a dorothy dixer to reannounce some, as he described it, ‘major aviation reform processes’. I might point out as an aside with respect to this matter that everything in the minister’s dorothy dixer was announced a month ago. In fact, he made the same announcement on 15 February this year. I remind the House that he hid behind the Friday of a parliamentary sitting week-not any other day of a parliamentary sitting week or a prime time spot-and made his announcement after parliament had ceased sitting. I suggest that he had a whole week of sittings the following week and still did not do anything. Finally yesterday, the dorothy dixer came through. He had the hide to say that we had been completely silent about the announcement of the reform process. With the tag and glory of Deputy Prime Minister, Leader of the National Party and Minister for Transport and Regional Services, I believe that he could not have gone any further to hide from his own announcement in the manner in which he handled it prior to the dorothy dixer yesterday. I want to digress at this point. I do not propose this afternoon to go into the detail of the aviation reform announcement because it does not deserve it. We have been there before on a number of occasions since the change of government in 1996. For example, three years ago the minister announced a measured approach to so-called aviation reform. His approach has been so measured, it has not been on the screen-it has actually been invisible. The February announcement included the corporatisation of Airservices Australia. In fact, I recall an earlier deadline on this. IfI remember correctly, it may have been the end of 2000. It is two years overdue, yet we can measure that because that is what it is about. We can at least measure from when the original announcement was made to the deadline and nothing was done. This is the same minister who boasted with great fanfare in the House 12 months ago about his aviation reforms delivering aviation competition. We all appreciated-especially Ansett workers and their families, communities in the federal seat of Burke, in Hume, Sunbury and Mount Macedon-that, when it comes to his so-called commitment to aviation competition and the requirement to deliver on that, the collapse of Ansett says it all. He did not comprehend the need for sustainable competition which effectively meant that consumers benefited and which, more importantly, meant that we kept Australians employed in the aviation industry. It reminds me of his blind approach to shipping competition. I know that he wanted to talk about ideology in question time again today. His approach to ideology, competition policy and the needs and aspirations of Australian workers, seafarers and their families is to subsidise foreign shippers and hang the Australian shipping industry out to dry. As I said earlier in the debate on another transport bill, when he wants to subsidise overseas shipping companies, he does not stop at going out of his way to foster overseas companies coming into Australia with tax regimes propped up by other countries, he also goes out of his way to make sure that we do not crack down on border protection and visa arrangements with respect to people working on those continuous and single voyage permit vessels. But enough of that; I dealt with that at length in an earlier debate on a bill about the pollution of coastal waters. We often see the minister stand up and take dorothy dixers in the House, and I want to remind the House of another one today. We also saw the minister stand up in the House on 7 September 2000 and beat his chest, because he is a very important man, the Minister for Transport and Regional Services-just ask his backbench. However, he has returned to this parliament with fewer members of the National Party caucus than he had when he went to the 1272 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 13 March 2002 last election. I know that brings some smiles to this side of the House and to the other coalition partner, the Liberal Party. What did he beat his chest about on 7 September? I heard him say that CASA, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, and the Australian Transport Safety Bureau must-and he emphasised this by banging the table-sort out their differences on audible alarm systems as a matter of great urgency. It was of great urgency, because unfortunately we had an aviation accident which saw the loss of Australian lives. The record will show that in October 1999 this was first brought to the attention of CASA by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, after another fatality was narrowly avoided. This is a minister who is consumed with his portfolio responsibilities, a minister who would have the House and the Australian community believe that he gives great and proper attention to safety standards and pursues the need for reform in the aviation industry in Australia. Here we are, 29 months after the minister said to ‘fix it urgently’. They were his words. There was a responsibility on the aviation industry to fix the problems with respect to the issues of audible alarm systems. For those who understand the aviation industry, the requirement to actually make change with respect to the audible alarm system is a matter of life and death. But what do we have 29 months after the minister said to fix it urgently? Again, I refer the House to events of the last week. In the press this week, for example, in the West Australian, we are reading the horrific recollections of air traffic controllers at the coronial inquiry of the eight victims of the Super King Air that crashed at Burketown because it seems that they were not aware of the oxygen loss. Go to the report of that inquiry. You will find in that report a record of an air traffic controller-one of the very valuable people who work in the aviation industry that the minister had the hide to have a crack at in question time today because these people are prepared to stand up for their industrial rights-actually crying with powerlessness, recalling not being able to alert the pilot about the problem that was obvious to them but not to the pilot or to the passengers on that aircraft. Now, 20 months later, in spite of the minister’s so-called plea about urgency, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority-the agency for which he is responsible, the agency which we have been suggesting for a number of years now is not performing its duties adequately-has still not mandated the audible alarms. AllI can say is that, if that represents performance of this minister’s duties in an urgent fashion, I would hate to see what he would do if he were tardy in performing his duties. Frankly, his lack of attention to detail, his lack of attention to the fact that he is the responsible minister for aviation activities in Australia, his not acting on the audible alarm front-so far as I am concerned-through proper direction and accountability, has risked the lives of other ordinary Australians since he originally stood up in the House and said that this had to be attended to as a matter of urgency. What about the press release? It was rushed out with the release of the ATSB final report on the Burketown crash, with promises to fix it by the end of this year. AllI can say is that the opposition is going to be monitoring the performance of the minister, yet again, and all the associated aviation authorities to see whether they meet the so-called deadline on this occasion. That will be clearly related to how long this minister’s inaction further risks lives of people actually participating in the aviation industry-be it as workers or passengers-because of a lack of attention to his detailed responsibilities as the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. One wonders at the gall of the minister, standing up and criticising the opposition from time to time. How many more ATSB recommendations will this minister let CASA ignore? How many more lives is he prepared to sacrifice before he speaks up, opens his eyes and accepts his responsibilities? That is what he is paid for and that is what he sought-to be a minister in the current government. I do not mind if he is a minister, but it is about time he did the job he is paid for-to actually go out of his way to implement so-called promises to the AusWednesday, 13 March 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 1273 tralian community with respect to proper regulation of the Australian aviation industry and, in doing so, to protect the lives of Australian workers in the aviation industry and people who use the aviation services. Let us also go to some other examples of the minister’s so-called measured response to his duties. The minister’s measured approach also involves committee after committee and no action. What happened to the Aviation Safety Forum? What happened to CASA’s aviation regulatory reform processes that received extra funding in the last budget? The minister is instead trying to stretch his measure-stretch the elastic side of his boots in which he likes to march around rural and regional Australia. The measured approach to aviation reform, I also suggest to the House, is to cover off another debt-another agreement entered into in the leadup to the most recent federal election, another dirty little deal for another coalition mate. This takes me back to the all-important question of ethics. The Minister for Transport and Regional Services and Deputy Prime Minister-in association with his boss, the Prime Minister-has been involved in what I believe is a buy-off of Dick Smith for the federal election campaign. The record shows that on previous occasions Mr Smith has been a generous donor to the coalition. It is widely known in the industry that the Prime Minister was involved in a meeting with Dick Smith and the Deputy Prime Minister. If you want any evidence of that, just look at the tape of question time yet again yesterday and look at the reaction of the Prime Minister when the Deputy Prime Minister in glowing terms mentioned Dick Smith and, in doing so, confirmed the Prime Minister’s involvement and knowledge of the deal. Look at the Prime Minister’s smirks, the arm patting of the Deputy Prime Minister and the swinging around in the chair to show off to the team behind him. It is all on the record, all on the tape of question time yesterday. What you see is the Prime Minister taking credit for bailing out his Deputy Prime Minister, the Leader of the National Party, Minister for Transport and Regional Services and member for the seat of Gwydir. It is common knowledge, if you go back over the last couple of years, that Dick Smith did not care who won Gwydir, provided it was not the current minister. He said on a number of occasions that he was going to spend the whole election campaign on the stump in Gwydir, travelling around in his Commodore ute, staying in pubs and talking to the good voters, saying that their local member was, as he described, the ‘worse transport minister in history’. Before the end of the campaign, after the September 11 terrorist attack, the erstwhile entrepreneur and aviation amateur suddenly decided to pull out of the campaign and declare his support for the current government and the current minister. Mr Smith was reported as saying-and I should remind the House-that, when it comes to aviation reform, ‘Australia needs a dictator at times like this.’ Before the end of last year, the real deal had been done and it began to emerge. The deal between the Howard government and Dick Smith was the gagging of Dick Smith. The price the Howard government paid-or should I say, the price the Australian travelling public will eventually pay-as was clearly proven in question time yesterday, was giving Dick Smith a third go at his personal obsession of aviation reform. We should not forget that this is the third time that Dick Smith has been put in charge of aviation reform in this country. First, it was as the chair of the then Civil Aviation Authority; second, as chair of the regulator, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. I expect that on this occasion the government is hoping, if not praying, that perhaps it is third time lucky for Dick Smith. It will take luck because, for all his energy, knowledge and courage, he has messed it up on each of the two previous occasions. This is another, can I say to the House, Howard government gamble. Dick Smith accuses unions of excessive power. He should remember that he is an individual who happens to have money and influence. This has opened doors for him. I remind the House that not too many people, especially ordinary Australians, get an invitation to attend the Prime Minister’s Christmas function, eating Japanese food care of the Australian taxpay1274 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 13 March 2002 ers at Kirribilli House. The record shows who was in attendance. Mr Dick Smith was one of them. We will never know if Dick Smith’s campaign would have successfully unseated the minister for transport in Gwydir. We will never know if Dick Smith ever intended going ahead with his so-called announcements about campaigning in Gwydir. We will never know for sure the deal that the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister stitched up with Dick Smith, but we are starting to get a fair idea. What we will know over time is the cost that is to be paid for the influence of Dick Smith on this government. Over time we will see if Dick Smith can strike it lucky and succeed in airspace reform or at least succeed in bludgeoning his way. How beneficial it is to Australia may only become clear in the longer term. In looking to the Criminal Code, can I simply say when it comes to the Department of Transport and Regional Services it should also look to the code of ethics which the minister for transport applies to his portfolio duties. When the Deputy Prime Minister sits in quiet contemplation, as he does from time to time, I hope he reflects on the undue influence that he has succumbed to in order to try and guarantee his re-election as the member for Gwydir. In short, the opposition will remain vigilant and continue to hold this minister accountable and draw attention to his ongoing failings as the minister for transport. But I also want to deal with one other issue today. Again in question time we witnessed the blind ideology of the minister for transport today. Earlier in this place today, I illustrated this blind spot in relation to his absolute hatred of maritime unions and how that ideology is a barrier to reform. In question time today the minister criticised a union official in Queensland for criticising Chris Corrigan, the head of Patricks. I think that official was the only one the media could find because, as I have said and stand by, the labour movement has moved on. I refer the House therefore to a statement by the ACTU yesterday in response to the announcement of the proposed merger between Virgin Blue and Patricks, and I quote: The waterfront dispute of 1998 will not play any part in the approach of the ACTU or the unions in dealing with this issue. Our responsibility is to the staff of Ansett and also to the staff of Virgin. It goes on: Patrick Stevedoring is a fully unionised operation and notwithstanding the bitterness of the 1998 dispute, both the unions and the company have worked hard in recent years to rebuild relationships. I hope the Deputy Prime Minister actually has time to read the media release put out by the Secretary of the ACTU yesterday, part of which I have read into Hansard this afternoon, clearly supporting the merger of Virgin Blue and the Patricks group. The explanation is simple: it is about jobs and looking after Australian families. It is only the Deputy Prime Minister who likes to dwell on class hatred, as evidenced in his performance in question time today. I would also remind the House of what John Allan, the National Secretary of the Transport Workers Union-the same union that the so-called Queensland official who the Deputy Prime Minister quoted in the House this afternoon came from-said in today’s Australian Financial Review: Lang Corp (now Patrick) maintained existing pay and conditions after its purchases in the road transport industry and the union had a good working relationship with Mr Corrigan. I would also remind the House that that same union covers the staff of Virgin Blue. Then the minister took a slap at air traffic controllers, technical and engineering staff, administrative workers and firefighters who are taking action in Melbourne today. As part of my duties, I met with some of those people last week in Brisbane when I inspected one of the facilities operated in the aviation industry by those very same people at Brisbane airport. AllI can say is that they are highly professional people who are dedicated to their industry and committed to aviation safety. The attack by the government on them in question time today was unjustified. They are entitled to campaign for improvements in their standard of living in the same way in which I suppose Mr Wooldridge thought it was appropriate to dip into taxpayers’ money to look after his future with respect to the grant to doctors to build a property in Canberra. There is one rule for their mates and a different rule for ordinary workers. Wednesday, 13 March 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 1275 I point out to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services that these workers are taking action in accordance with what? They are taking action in accordance with his own government’s industrial laws. They are taking legitimate industrial action in pursuit of the improvements in their wages and conditions. The Industrial Relations Commission did recommend the workers not take the action but the employer’s claim for binding orders to stop the action was not accepted by the commission-something the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Transport and Regional Services forgot to mention in question time today. The minister and I are fortunate enough to get our wage increases automatically, through the legitimate activities of the Remuneration Tribunal. I have never seen the Deputy Prime Minister walk back and reject an increase in his own salary. In fact, we even had evidence that required some members of his own party-the National Party-in previous parliaments to resign because they had dipped into travel entitlements that they were not entitled to. He talks about workers’ standards! He ought to have a look at the performance of his own party, his own caucus. I remind the House that ordinary workers have to negotiate and fight for their increases under the government’s workplace relations laws-and this is what these workers are doing. They are operating within the parameters of this government’s industrial framework. Are they to be condemned for that? I simply suggest to the House, no. It is the government’s industrial framework, and they are operating within the parameters of that industrial framework. It is all right for politicians-we get the Remuneration Tribunal report and we put our hands up for increases. But as soon as it comes to ordinary workers saying, ‘We are entitled to some changes in our wages and conditions’, it is different, isn’t it? Yes, it is different. It reminds me a little bit of the announcement after the election: when it comes to taxpayers’ money, all of a sudden we are now entitled to spend $125,000 per annum on printed material in our electorate. These workers do not earn anywhere near that each year in terms of their gross salary let alone their take-home pay. Mr Cadman interjecting$125,000 a year for printed material in their own electorate. But when it comes to workers saying, ‘We’re entitled to a little bit more, even though we don’t get as much a year as they spend on printing,’ there is a different rule for ordinary workers and their families. As I have said in this debate, we have seen a minister who is becoming obsessed with blaming others for his inaction on transport reform. If the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, Mr Anderson, were honest, he and his friend Dick Smith would admit that the unions are not a barrier to transport reform in this country; the only real barrier to transport reform in this country is an ineffective minister, a minister not interested in his portfolio responsibilities, a minister who, I remind the House, said in the lead-up to the last election, ‘Poor me, poor me. I am overworked.’ Go and read the rural press. ‘I am overworked. Something will have to give if we win yet again. I will have to give up some of my portfolio responsibilities. I’ve got too much work to do.’ Well, for some strange reason I think the Prime Minister’s response to that was, ‘If you started doing a little bit of work in your transport portfolio then we would not have had the problems we have had in the portfolio over the last couple of years.’ The Prime Minister rejected his plea to walk away from his responsibilities and told him to get on with his job-the job for which he has collected a significant salary for the last six years-and to start to live up to what he is paid for, being responsible for the transport portfolio in this parliament. The opposition is supporting the bill because it is about the application of the Criminal Code that brings with it a very important responsibility. It is about the application of the Criminal Code to the transport portfolio. It is about the application of the Criminal Code to a portfolio where if you do not turn and apply your mind to the performance of your portfolio",172,Representatives Main Committee
329,Mr Martin Ferguson,"Yes, it hurts. They do not mind looking after themselves1276 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 13 March 2002 responsibilities it can lead to the death or injury of ordinary Australians. I call upon the minister today to start to face up to his responsibilities. The Criminal Code, as we know it in Australia, imposes certain behavioural standards-I suppose, in essence, a moral and ethical approach to life in general. Get on with your job: do not take money under false pretences for being the transport minister any longer. I have referred on a number of occasions today to the fact that the minister, I suggest to the House, has taken money under false pretences. He has failed to do his job as the minister for transport. Get off your backside; accept that you are the minister; do not try to suggest that you are overworked; do your job. (Time expired) man. It seems to me that Labor Party ministers will go out there and write the air navigation rules, and every time something goes wrong the minister will go and make the corrections himself. We are going to have a very proactive minister who will investigate everything and decide everything. The decisions will have to go through caucus, of course, but it is only the safety and lives of people! The arguments advanced by the Australian Labor Party today are for complete and absolute political involvement in all avenues of transport. I think the cries of protest that the workers should not go through the Industrial Relations Commission and should just be allowed to run free and make up their own minds in transport, particularly in aviation, are just beyond belief. On the one hand, when the shadow minister was spokesman for the labour movement, his great cry was: ‘We must have an umpire. The umpire must be involved. We accept the umpire’s rules.’ Today he is advancing the argument in aviation that we should ignore the umpire-we should be allowed to do whatever we like and, because they are workers who work in an important industry, they can ignore the plea to get back to work and can go on with the dispute. We have had a number of disputes in the aviation industry-for example, the air traffic controllers and maintenance workers in Qantas. I do not know whether those maintenance workers in Qantas were in some way in collusion with the workers at Ansett-trying to pull Qantas down in order to get Ansett up. I do not know whether that was what was happening, but it seemed coincidental to me that there were so many air maintenance workers’ strikes during the period that Ansett was having trouble. I was suspicious that there was a degree of collusion amongst workers in the aviation industry. I am really interested in the comments of the Australian Labor Party. It appears that they are policy free, but they will have a proactive minister-a minister who will go an investigate every crash, who will not rely on experts and will not depend on people whose sole role is to provide for safety amongst Australian travellers; the minister will make those decisions. The member made a big complaint about Dick Smith in his speech. Dick Smith is a visionary. He is a person who has created disruption in the industry; he has provided bright ideas as well. Both sides of politics have enjoyed Dick Smith’s involvement in the aviation industry. The Australian Labor Party appointed him. They wanted him to try to fix the industry upthat did not seem to work. We believe that we have got a process for careful reform of general aviation. The minister has got a plan in place, with the involvement of CASA and Airservices Australia, as to how we are going to move sensibly to have reform in general aviation. It will come. The shadow minister, if he had been aware of his portfolio responsibilities, should have been aware of that issue as well. In regard to the ACTU comments about support for the new Virgin-Patrick deal, I cannot gan. We know what he’s capable of doing’-and this was on the AM program yesterday. Minister Anderson quoted him and then added, ‘Like cleaning up the waterfront and growing our export industries and all the jobs in them.’ These warnings are unbelievable, when you look at the ACTU and the Labor movement claiming that ‘The Labor Party and the union",177,Representatives Main Committee

We know how that works. We see it every day. Martin Ferguson, the member for Melbourne Ports-or is it Melbourne?-today expressed the same thing. Mr Laurie Ferguson interjectingseats. He is the shadow minister for transport. He came in here as the member for Batman but he might as well still be the head of the ACTU, from the way in which he presented his aviation and transport policy here today. It was pretty sad to see, actually. Unions run rampant in the union movement: he basically said that today. I would like to put the Trade Practices Act over his speech, to see whether it was not misleading or inaccurate, because I think that the Trade Practices Act on that speech would demonstrate time and time again that it was full of both misleading statements and inaccuracies. If he had been out there as part of the private sector, he would have been up for a big fine or else in the slammer for making misleading statements. But that does not seem to worry him. He can, instead, have a go at the minister for transport, the Deputy Prime Minister, for not being hands-on in making all of these decisionsdecisions which it would be extremely dangerous for a minister for transport on his own to make. We have to rely on experts in all of these things. A minister cannot interfere and make the decisions. He has to rely on the advice of safety officials in all decisions on aviation and transport in general. So the long bow that the member for Batman tried to draw between the Crimes Act and what he spoke about today was inappropriate and improper, in my opinion. The bill that we are looking at today seeks to bring into a codified environment the transport and regional services provisions that the Commonwealth covers, and the application of the Criminal Code to that area is something that has been going on for some time. It is an initiative of the current Attorney-General. He has been careful to say that we need to have an effective crimes regime across all portfolios and all areas of government, and systematically he has applied that Criminal Code and its changes to all areas. It is coming into the transport and regional services area right now with this legislation. It is very sensible and thoughtful. But the provisions of the bill seem to be quite foreign to the previous speaker, who went on with a speech of vilification of the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, the Deputy Prime Minister, for taking careful decisions to advance policy in a sensible and understandable way. The previous speaker promoted the cause of the union movement, saying that they had a right to go on strike, no matter what the disruption was that they caused and despite the pleas of the umpire, who seems to be so important to the Australian Labor Party. He promoted the fact that they should go on carrying out their affairs as they wished, and then he tried to link his thoughts with some weird notion of moral and ethical conduct. Well, he could try that, but what he should be doing is looking at the contents of his own speech and seeing whether it would stand up not just to ethical things but to the Trade Practices Act on whether it was misleading and whether in fact there were false statements in it. I support this legislation. The government has moved to change the environment in transport and regional services by bringing it into the unified processes of the Criminal Code. Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay-Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (5.15 p.m.)-I commend the member for Mitchell for his contribution to the debate, as usual. He is a very informed member and has done a lot to contribute to government policy, not just over the last six years but during his entire time in parliament. Comparing that with the member for Batman’s speech, it did come out that the opposition would be supporting the Transport and Regional Services Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2002, but other than that we just had some highly personal sledging of a very capable, competent and hard working minister, and some other irrelevancies and specious arguments that just covered up for lack of policy and laziness on the opposition’s part.",178,Representatives Main Committee

The amendments proposed by the bill must be made as soon as possible to minimise the period during which the provisions remain unharmonised with the Criminal Code; that is, constructed in a manner that is inconsistent with the Criminal Code’s principles and may be interpreted and enforced in an unfamiliar manner. This bill does not create any new offences of strict liability and, where the existing penalty exceeds the Criminal Code policy for strict liability offences, it is limited to a serious offence provision that has safety implications for the aircraft and persons on board that aircraft. In the interests of time. I will leave it there. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Address-in-Reply Debate resumed from 12 March, on motion by Ms Ley: That the address be agreed to. to make a number of remarks about the federal election and, more particularly, the electorate of Reid. Part of the reason is the rather exotic coalition candidate who was supplied for my seat, Mr Irfan Yusuf. He did, of course, make a major contribution to public debate in this country when he conceded, in the Financial Review, that the coalition had used racism in the last general election. That was a very telling remark by the Liberal candidate in that very authoritative journal. However, I think that other characteristics of the campaign were somewhat disturbing. His last-minute enrolment at an Islamic owned prayer room in the last week before the election was such that the local council said that the purported address of the Liberal candidate was a property that could not be used for residential purposes. Fortunately for Mr Yusuf, as a lawyer, he must have some awareness of electoral laws and he would know that candidates’ addresses, no matter how dubious, cannot be challenged during the election period. So we had this candidate moving into the electorate, enrolling in the Islamic prayer centre in the last weeks of the campaign and subsequently bemoaning the ‘racist’ campaign of his own party during the campaign. But he really did not do much for multiculturalism and ethnic understanding in this country when he walked down the streets of Auburn inspecting the various food outlets and claiming which ones were more authoritative with regard to the halal meat issue. He was complaining in the Sydney Morning Herald that some of the local Turkish food outlets were not utilising halal meat. This was another spectacular part of the local Liberal campaign. I turn to the question of the actual result. Whereas in 1998 the seat of Reid had the largest state-wide swing to the Labor Party, in this election it had a worse than average situation. I want to raise the question of the informal vote and the continuing conflict between state and federal electoral laws in this country. The growth of the informal vote in Reid from 7.1 per cent to 11.1 per cent is statistically of interest. In the adjacent seat of Blaxland the vote went from 5.5 per cent to 9.8 per cent. In other words, in both of these seatsvoting in this debate. In both those seats the informal vote grew by four per cent. If you compare that with other seats in the adjacent areas, you will find that Prospect had 2.5 per cent growth, Lowe had 1.2 per cent and Parramatta had 1.4 per cent. The reason for that-and this is very informative for you, Alan-was the fact that just before election day a by-election occurred in the Auburn state seat, which is shared by Blaxland and Reid.

So we had a party out there-the Labor party in this case-campaigning that voters in the by-election only had to vote No. 1.

I think this is an indication of the need for some kind of sense in this country that people are being asked vote in two different electoral systems. quite clearly, was fundamentally fought around the question of New York, the Tampa and border protection. We have seen since the election a fairly extensive expose of the degree to which the government colluded in attempting to utilise immigration policy for racist purposes-or, more specifically, for religiously biased purposes. The coalition was attempting to utilise a fundamental hostility to Muslims in this country, to try to indicate to the Australian public that: ‘We, the current government, are not going to let these Muslims into the country.’ There was code language, there were subterranean kinds of messages, but clearly the government wanted to tell the Australian public that they were going to stop Muslim people coming to this country. area ofgoing the right wayof the coalition.

He went into the House condemning the government’s intention of getting rid of dual citizenship. I think that shows the kind of instinctive feel that he has on these issues of multiculturalism. The situation was that the government realised that-particularly amongst the Middle Eastern and eastern European communities, where the religious divide is quite hard-a message that might imply that the vast majority of the people coming to this country were of a particular faith would tell very strongly in certain electorates. We had the now retired minister Mr Reith saying on the public record that we should have some concerns that terrorists were comingMr Cadman interjectingsay that we should have some concern that terrorists might be coming into this country. That was clearly another message of fear in the electorate: ‘Be concerned that none of these people can be genuine claimants, be concerned that they are terrorists, be concerned that they are different,’ et cetera. We have seen since the election an indication that the then minister indicated to the Prime Minister well before the National Press Club and well before Lateline that he, the minister, had doubts-that the armed forces of this country had doubts-about the legitimacy of government claims with regard to those photographs.

391,Mr Laurie Ferguson,"Only from the point of view of stopping disruption, I with1282 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 13 March 2002 sume their seats while I take some advice. On a point of clarification: member for Reid, I understand you have already offered to withdraw those words? very briefly to the question of the refugee intake in this country. One thing that concerns me is that the government’s changes with regard to parent and spouse migration are forcing a significant number of my electors to attempt to bring in family within the refugee humanitarian intake. An example would be the question of spouses. Traditionally, only a small proportion of spouses were asked to provide assurance of support. But what is happening now-and even the member for Mitchell, I gather, has some knowledge of this-is that virtually all spouses are being asked to provide assurance of support. The impact of that is that a significant number of people from Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran et cetera-the main countries from where we accept refugees on a humanitarian basis-are now forced to bring in families within that category. This impacts very strongly on the waiting times at overseas posts such as Islamabad and New Delhi. We have more people trying to get in the refugee humanitarian intake for family reasons who otherwise would have been coming under other categories. Similarly, with regard to the government’s policy on aged parents, the waiting list-from recollection-is approximately 14,000. An intake of 500 per year would mean that, in theory-if they do not die off-they would be waiting for 28 years. Obviously, significant numbers-because they have to be over 60 and 65 respectively-are deceased by the time they might be processed. The government has attempted to negotiate with the opposition to bring in a program whereby people who pay $50,000 would get preferential admission; and the others would get access to more than 500 visas. What concerns me is the impact this is having on our refugee humanitarian program. Also, unfortunately, it is driving or encouraging significant numbers of people to try to come here by boat. If people are waiting, as they are in New Delhi, for 2¼ or 2½ years-and this includes people’s spouses and people’s parents-what is going to be the result? People are going to attempt to come here by boat, because they see no other options, and once again they will join the waiting list and be forced to seek alternative means. Also with regard to skills, the government is really facilitating a further deregulation of the labour market through immigration. It is attempting to play to one part of the market as being tough on refugees, ruthless and driving down the number of these claimants, but we are seeing left field an attempt to deregulate the labour market by increased use of twoand fouryear work permits. We have the most outrageous example down at the Hindu temple near Wollongong, where people were basically locked up permanently, paid piddling wages-and were basically under house arrest. That is the most extreme example of what is going on. But, in a wider sense, the government is facilitating wider access for significant numbers of people to come here for longer periods and to take Australian jobs. I also want to turn to the recent statement by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. He actually boasted that 90 per cent of claimants who had undertaken studies in this country and had launched post-graduation claims for residency were succeeding. I question whether, whilst we are attempting to gain people with skills, we should facilitate that easily every person who purports to come here to do studies being given such an easy access to permanent residence. For a government that professes to be hardline-both of these policies facilitate proliferation of temporary work visa entry and people being able to immediately launch residence claims after graduation-these are questionable policies, but that is essentially what the government are doing. They are attempting to purvey an image",183,Representatives Main Committee

396,Mr Laurie Ferguson,"But not my criticism of government policy. I want to turnWednesday, 13 March 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 1283 that they have no truck with poverty-stricken, refugee asylum claimants, that they are tough and ruthless in this regard, but at the same time they are playing to a very different market. That situation is of concern. Very briefly, another question we have had in the last week concerns the outrageous conduct of the previous Minister for Health and Aged Care. We have a situation where money is diverted from asthma and rural and regional health programs towards a building in Canberra. In representing the region that I do, I know that a number of documents have been written with regard to the connection between the socioeconomic situation, demography and health, and that asthma has been known to be particularly prevalent in Western Sydney. I feel, on behalf of my constituents, some concern that this kind of money is diverted by a man who subsequently, probably by accident, gained employment with that organisation-just coincidence, an accident et cetera. Regardless of whether it was a mistake, the electorate has some concern. Similarly, the government managed to roll over $10 million for one measure with regard to suicide and another $24 million. They managed to roll that over, but they could not do it in this case. In the United States, if this man were not in jail, he certainly would be under investigation, as would advisers. It is overdue for this country to have laws with regard to people getting out of this parliament, getting out of public administration, and soon after finding themselves in the employment of groups that they have previously dealt with as lobbyists in their portfolio. Obviously, the AMA has made some very worthwhile comments. I would, however, briefly refer to the member for Parramatta. Once again, he is caught missing. They sent him on to the Sunrise program. He said that he was calm and relaxed about the issue; he said it was a storm in a teacup; he said there were interesting suggestions that politicians who left office should be subject to a cooling-off period. Unfortunately, once again, a few moments later, he was repudiated by the government. The Prime Minister has come out and said the government might have to take the money away. It is not a storm in a teacup. (Time expired) Ms WORTH (Adelaide-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing) (5.37 p.m.)-I am pleased to be able to respond to the Governor General’s speech, in which he sets out the government’s priorities. They are priorities that are important to the people of my Adelaide electorate. Ensuring the reduction of salinity and improvement in water quality are issues of importance to all South Australians. As salinity attacks the water of the Murray River, the people of Adelaide are faced with newspaper reports that our drinking water may well be undrinkable in 20 years time. This government, together with other governments, is investing $1.4 billion towards the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality. The tens of thousands of students who pursue their studies within my electorate will benefit greatly from this government’s $3 billion innovation package, Backing Australia’s Ability. In his speech, the Governor General reported: There are few nations on earth which can enter the early years of this new century with the same sense of optimism, opportunity and quiet confidence that the Australian people are entitled to feel. This sort of sentiment is justified by positive government programs, like the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality and Backing Australia’s Ability, but it is founded on the bedrock of this government’s hard work to maintain a stronger economy. A stronger economy means that we are able to fund more hospital beds, provide better educational opportunities for our young and create an environment for business where there are a record number of Australians in paid employment. I would like to thank the people of Adelaide for returning me four times to this place. It is always a close thing in a seat like Adelaide. One of the problems in representing one of the most marginal seats in the country is that, no matter what headway one makes from election to election, redistributions invariably leave the margin smaller than it was. In the last redistribution, my margin was reduced to 0.65 per cent. A reduction of 0.26 per cent does not sound 1284 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 13 March 2002 like much but, when the margin is only 0.91 per cent, it can have a significant impact. AlthoughI received over 5,500 more primary votes than my opponent-and had a swing towards me on primary votes-I was 1,078 votes behind on election night once Democrat and other minor party preferences had been distributed. I was humbled to hear from so many people immediately after the election who were so keen for me to win. To win by 343 votes was partly the result of those people who went to great lengths to ensure that they were able to lodge their vote. A group contacted me from Jakarta to let me know that I could be sure that their votes were still to be counted. Another constituent of mine, who was in Italy, told me that he drove 400 kilometres to Rome so that he could vote. It was an extraordinary experience to receive so many emails from constituents overseas and in far-flung parts of Australia assuring me that their votes were on the way. I would also like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the role that my staff play in assisting my constituents and helping me do my job. A big thank you, also, to my campaign team; I would not be here without their help. There has been some discussion in recent times as to why we won, and various propositions have been put forward. Interestingly, I see in Monday’s press clips that my views are supported by Labor members. I believe that one reason for the Liberal win is our local candidates, and I note from the Daily Telegraph that the Leader of the Opposition, at a briefing at the Campbelltown Catholic Club, said: Labor’s factional system was rewarding mediocrity and promoting candidates with few life skills and little understanding of the community they sought to represent. … … … Theythe factionsare stifling debate, the free flow of ideas, and rewarding mediocrity. I have been able to work with local groups in Adelaide, and we have had quite a few successes. I was able to secure the funding for the lights at the Kilburn Football and Cricket Club and the upgrade of the Albert Bridge near the Adelaide Zoo. I worked with a group of Greek pensioners to find the money for a refrigerator for their meeting hall. We now proudly boast the newly named ‘Pathway of Honour’ that runs behind South Australia’s Government House. I was very pleased to be able to organise and secure funding for a monument to commemorate the contribution of ex-servicewomen in World War II. Over the last nine years, it has been gratifying getting to know many people from a broad cross-section of the electorate through working with sporting, ethnic and other community groups in Adelaide. Over an increasing number of elections, it has given me some satisfaction to know that many people whom the Labor Party would normally claim as their own have given me their support. A very strong reason that the Australian people have put their faith in this government for a third time is that they have experienced how the coalition manages the economy. According to Monday’s Advertiser, the member for Port Adelaide has a secret family formula that has picked every federal election since 1961. The theory is that a government will be re-elected if two out of three economic indicators fall. I quote from the Advertiser: While many cite the Tampa and September 11 for John Howard’s win last year, Mr Sawford’s formula shows interest rates and unemployment fell in the preceding three years ... That is why we won, and I agree with the member for Port Adelaide. People also remember how Labor mismanaged the economy. Glenn Milne, writing in the Australian, recently reported some comments made at a meeting of the Penrith Labor Party branch. Labor Party members were complaining: ... people remember Labor’s 17 per cent interest rates. Compare6 per cent and 17 per cent interest rates ... Wednesday, 13 March 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 1285 To put it simply, all those Australians who are paying off mortgages are now paying 11 per cent less interest than they were when Labor was in government. This government has worked hard to keep interest rates low, and it is paying off for the people of Australia. Australia has not been debt free since Gough Whitlam was elected Prime Minister. The Australian people remember that Labor ran budget deficits. Labor sold off assets, but budgets still remained in the red. The Australian people remember that the Labor Party left a legacy of debt and interest payments for our children to bear for years to come. However, we are now well on the way to securing a debt-free future for our children. Through sound economic management, this government has also paid off nearly $60 billion of Labor’s $80 billion debt. Now the government’s interest bill is $4 billion per year less than it was under Labor. That means $4 billion more each year to spend on important areas like health, education and the environment. For example, we can afford to provide the Commonwealth seniors health card to more senior Australians than ever before. We can afford to provide a further billion dollars to extend the Natural Heritage Trust for another four years. Australia’s economy, and therefore Australia, is in good shape. Careful guidance has seen us succeed, despite the Asian downturn and the US recession. There has also been recent discussion and political commentary by Labor and others about things that have been said in a campaign context and what impact they may have had on the result. So let us look at and consider what Labor has had to say in some recent campaigns. Anyone familiar with the north-western corner of the electorate of Adelaide would be aware of my long running campaign to clean up the old Islington rail yards. This is a win of which I am particularly proud as I was able to secure some $5.5 million in Commonwealth moneys for this clean-up and see the land use change from South Australia’s worse toxic waste dump to a park for community use. Nevertheless, during last year’s campaign a letter was distributed in the Kilburn area by a man claiming to be from something called the Kilburn Concerned Citizens Committee which made the accusation that I had had nothing to do with the clean-up. Fortunately local residents knew otherwise and took the trouble to contact me to say so-but it was a cheap shot. In two of Labor’s brochures distributed during the campaign, in which my opponent’s team even reproduced my photo from my own newsletter, it was claimed that I had been fighting to bring nuclear waste to South Australia. AllI have ever argued for was a good scientific plan to make Adelaide safer. Low and intermediate level nuclear waste is currently stored at 20 sites around South Australia, including some in the heart of the city of Adelaide such as the Royal Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide University and the University of South Australia. To suggest that my argument that we need good scientific advice, not mad political point scoring, amounts to a wish to see South Australia as some kind of dump state is utter deceit. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 5.47 p.m. to 6.02 p.m. remembers that, in 1995, the then federal Labor government dumped 35 cubic metres of intermediate waste at Woomera without any consultation. Would Labor prefer to put a dump in every state, or to really endanger public safety and the environment by taking no action at all? Meanwhile Labor’s union mates were funding and fighting Labor’s campaign. Propaganda appeared, wrongly accusing the government of cutting $60 million from public schools since coming to government in 1996, when funding to government schools had increased by 43 per cent. While the states have primary responsibility for government schools, the Commonwealth has been able to take a leading role in a number of educational areas, such as school drug education and the national literacy targets and standards for testing all year 3 and year 5 students to try to identify problems early and get them fixed. We are also spending $80 million over three years on developing teacher skills. It is fair to say that the Commonwealth government is now doing more for government schools than ever before.

A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 6.04 p.m. to 6.19 p.m. laide’s most exclusive and expensive schools. Personally, I think he has every right to do so, but parents with less family income than he has should also be able to send their children to non-government schools of their choice. But Labor has a long history of attempting to mislead people, both in my electorate and around the country. Think back to the 1996 election: Labor announced that the budget was in surplus. The reality was that there was a $10 billion budget black hole. Back in 1993, when I was first elected as the member for Adelaide, the Labor Party said that we would destroy Medicare. What does the record show? Not only have we maintained Medicare in full, but also we have introduced a wide range of measures that have strengthened Medicare, and strengthened the Australian health system. We have taken a more proactive stance than ever before in health promotion and disease prevention. We have overseen an increase in the rate of childhood immunisation-from 53 per cent in 1995 up to 97 per cent today. We have introduced the first national diabetes prevention plan, ahead of any other country. The rate of smoking amongst Australians over 18 has dropped to 20 per cent-the lowest of any country in the western world. On top of this, we have provided a record $32 billion to the state and territory governments for them to run their public hospitals. Of course, that did not stop Labor from putting out a pamphlet last October claiming that John Howard cut $800 million from our public health system when he first came to power and that he has held funding down ever since. The year 1993 was also the year of the supposed, and promised, l-a-w law tax cuts. The Labor Party pledged that not only would they not increase the indirect tax take, but they would also cut the rate of income tax. That was before the election. After the election, the Labor Party increased the rate of indirect tax in the form of wholesale sales taxes and reneged on the income tax cuts. It is hard to think of a more compelling example of plain untruths told to the electorate in an attempt to win votes. Labor said that they would not sell the majority government ownership in the Commonwealth Bank. On 24 September 1993, when Labor were selling the second lot of Commonwealth Bank shares, Labor’s Treasurer even wrote a letter to potential investors promising that the government had no intention whatsoever of further reducing its shareholding. Two years later, the Labor Party sold the rest. They said one thing and they did the very opposite, and they have been doing it for as long as I have been in this place. Despite Labor’s smears, hypocrisies and downright untruths, I am still here and I am pleased to be here. I want to continue to represent the people of my electorate to the best of my ability. I am also pleased to have been appointed parliamentary secretary with responsibilities within the health portfolio. Every person at some stage of their life is concerned about their health. Unfortunately, the state of our own personal health is often not uppermost in our minds unless, for some reason, we require attention for ill health. However, much can be achieved through good policy to ensure public health and safety. Having had previous experience with the Therapeutic Goods Administration, the Australia New Zealand Food Authority and the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency, I am pleased to again have responsibility for those areas. I am also pleased to have the added responsibility of the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator and the National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme, along with alcohol, tobacco and illicit drugs. These are all areas which impact on the public health and well-being of Australian men, women and children. They are areas in which I hope to make a difference for the common good.",187,Representatives Main Committee
398,Ms Worth,"I was speaking about my opponent sending his children to one of AdeWednesday, 13 March 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 1287 Significant publicity has recently been given to child sexual abuse. Dennis Shanahan, writing in the Australian on Friday, 1 March, referred to the Governor General’s most comprehensive statement of 20 February, and quoted from it in the following terms: I hope that an outcome of the focus on my handling of these cases will be a quickening of the pace of reform in this area. I hold that same hope. We are looking at a complex set of issues. However, there is just one very fundamental guiding principle: if adults do not stand up for and care for children, who else will? Those of us who find ourselves in a position of authority or influence carry an additional burden of responsibility to provide leadership and direction in dealing with child sexual abuse, and to work towards changing attitudes surrounding the areas of sexual assault and domestic violence. In July last year, when I was in my previous youth affairs portfolio, Dr David Kemp and I met with a young indigenous leadership group here in Canberra. Their messages to us were powerful and courageous. The group unanimously agreed to make the government aware that the issues of sexual and domestic assault within their own communities was a major concern for them. They particularly requested that Dr Kemp and I alert the public and agencies about their concerns. Community solutions for these problems must be found and action taken. In April 2000 I released a comprehensive survey and report on teenagers’ perceptions, beliefs and experiences of violence. While the survey contained some good news about young people being able to recognise a range of behaviour including threats as domestic violence, it also showed that young people themselves are exposed to, or experience, high levels of violence. Dating and sexual violence were also canvassed in the survey. It was alarming that a third of all young people who had been in a dating relationship had experienced some physical violence in one or more of those relationships. The survey found that 14 per cent of females and three per cent of males said that they had personally experienced rape or sexual assault. The government has taken important steps to deal with these issues through the wellfunded program Partnerships Against Domestic Violence. However, it is clear that all governments and those individuals who are in positions where they are able to bring about change must do their best to do so. Adele Horin, writing in the Sydney Morning Herald of 23 to 24 February argued a strong case for women and children who have been abused. She wrote: What you do is treat sex abuse allegations as if a child’s life might depend on your intervention. Two decades of research have shown us that sexual abuse can ruin lives. Prisons and psychiatric wards are full of people who were sexually abused as children, who were not believed, not taken seriously and not helped. She continued: We’ve known for a long time, thanks to feminist scholars and child abuse workers, that the issue at the heart of sex abuse is power. Sex abusers have no need to use violence or rape when they have power and authority over their victim. These are strong words but I think that we all need to look at these areas of great concern and take the most appropriate action possible. Just by chance today I met some very prominent, good indigenous health workers and Barbara Flick was one of them. I raised this very issue of concern with her and she told me that it was her priority for this year but that such sensitivity needed to be exercised so that, as she put it, aunties and grannies are not cut off from their children who they want to see because they report such abuse. She felt that communities needed to know that they were breaking the law of the country. I was impressed with her sincerity and sensitivity and I wish anyone working in these areas the very best. Although they are not quite specifically my responsibilities, these areas of mental health and alcohol and other substance abuse can contribute to these problems. Debate (on motion by Mr Jenkins) adjourned. Main Committee adjourned at 6.29 p.m. The following answers to questions were circulated: Australian Broadcasting Corporation: Radio (Question No. 1116) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 13 February 2002: (1) What consultation occurred between the Government and the ABC with respect to ABC Radio’s increase in regional program content. (2) What was the role of the ABC Board in determining how these new resources were allocated. (3) What was the rationale for installing new regional stations and centres at Ballarat, Narrogin or Katanning, and Katherine. (4) Were any other sites examined; if so, what sites. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) The ABC did not consult Government in determining which regional centres and programs were to be given increased resources. (2) The ABC has advised that the allocation of resources for regional program content for 2001/02 were agreed by the ABC Board as part of the 2001/02 ABC budget strategy. (3) The ABC has advised as follows: Ballarat, Victoria Ballarat was selected because it is one of the largest Victorian regional centres without a dedicated ABC station. More than 130,000 people live in the Ballarat broadcast region, and the population is expected to grow as transport links with Melbourne improve. Currently, the ABC transmitter in Ballarat broadcasts the output of ABC Bendigo. The ABC believes that it is not appropriate to cover Ballarat from Bendigo as the two cities have quite different communities of interest. This is reflected by the repeated requests the ABC has received from the Ballarat community asking for the establishment of a local service. Ballarat is an important regional hub for State government administration and transport. There is a growing education and arts community in the city centred in the Camp Street precinct which is currently being redeveloped. The ABC believes it can make an important contribution to the city and intends to build a state-of-the-art digital station. The establishment of a new station at Ballarat is an integral part of ABC Radio’s wider regionalisation plan for Victoria. Under this plan the State is divided into four regions with each region containing a major ABC broadcasting facility, or hub. The regions are Northwest Victoria served by ABC Bendigo; Northeast Victoria served by ABC Wodonga; Gippsland served by ABC Sale; and, South-west Victoria to be served by Ballarat. As well as strengthening the editorial content of existing programs, this plan fills serious gaps in the coverage of South-west Victoria, as well as the Goulburn Valley. Victorians in these areas will receive new local ABC Radio services and all regional Victorians will have potential access to up to-date audiovisual and interactive on-line services. Specifically, the Ballarat area will gain a dedicated Breakfast program and its new Drive program will cover the whole of South-west Victoria, including Warrnambool, Hamilton, Colac, Ararat and Portland. Currently, the Drive program serving these areas comes from Bendigo and is forced to cater for such differing areas as Ballarat and Mildura. Ultimately, the Regional Extension Plan also will move the Statewide regional Morning program currently produced from Melbourne, to Ballarat. The new station will also employ South-west Victoria’s first ABC Rural Reporter filing for both radio and online. Wagin, Western Australia ABC Local Radio in Western Australia has decided to locate the new Great Southern station at Wagin (instead of Narrogin or Katanning which was originally proposed).",188,Representatives Main Committee
399,Mr Mcgauran,"The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the ArtsWagin is the location of the ABC’s most powerful transmitter in regional WA and covers a population of some 38,000 people. It is also equidistant between Narrogin and Katanning, the two main population centres in the region. The Great Southern region of Western Australia has been identified as a distinct region for 15 years. It contains the ABC’s largest transmitter in Western Australia, broadcasting to a substantial portion of the State’s agricultural areas. Establishing a local studio has been a goal of ABC Western Australia for the past decade. Until recently a Breakfast program was provided separately to this region, from a location outside the region and a Morning program specific to the region, from Perth. A local studio will, for the first time, provide local programs produced and presented within the region. Of some 230 ABC staff in Western Australia, only five live and work away from the coastal regions. This will be the first permanent placement of staff within the State’s key agricultural areas. Establishing a local station will provide a boost to the local economy through additional people being employed, as well as the broadcasting benefits of localism. Katherine, Northern Territory In 1997 the ABC Northern Territory hired a part-time journalist to cover events in Katherine, which is situated some 300 km south of Darwin. The position was created for several reasons: Katherine is the third largest population centre in Northern Territory; it is a key service centre for local pastoralists, RAAF base Tindal, and a number of outlying Aboriginal communities. Katherine is also the focus of a rapidly growing horticultural industry with 70 growers already producing $61 million worth of produce annually. This is forecast to grow to $300 million in 10 years. In 1999, due mainly to budget restrictions, the ABC had to close the Katherine position. This was roundly criticised by Local and Territory Government politicians and the Katherine community. The move made it very difficult for the ABC to cover day-to-day issues in Katherine or react quickly to natural disasters or other emergencies. The Katherine community, which relies almost solely on the ABC for up to the minute news on local, national and international news and current affairs, lost the local component with the closure of the position. The local community has made repeated representations to the local ABC and the ABC’s Editor Rural Radio to reinstate an ABC presence in Katherine. The regional expansion project provided the opportunity for the ABC to better serve this important Top End community. (4) The ABC has advised as follows: Victoria Geelong was also considered as the site for the new dedicated station. However, there is no ABC transmitter in Geelong for a dedicated local signal and no Federal Government funding to build one. Geelong is also within the official Melbourne listening area for radio ratings purposes and 774 ABC Melbourne covers Geelong issues. Western Australia Other sites may be examined in the future but the Great Southern has been the most significant priority. Development of smaller outposts is a more likely scenario for future development. No other sites were considered for a station of the size proposed for the Great Southern. Northern Territory Other sites in the Northern Territory were considered for an outpost-style operation. However, only Nhulunbuy in the Top End and Tennant Creek in Central Australia have the population and story generation potential to consider such an operation. Currently, ABC Alice Springs Broadcasters and Reporters adequately cover Tennant Creek’s needs, while a new position based in Darwin will serve the needs of Top End communities outside Darwin including Nhulunbuy. Katherine was the logical choice for an outposted position to enable the ABC to properly service the audience needs of the Northern Territory. Immigration: Migrant Resource Centres (Question No. 117) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 13 February 2002: (1) Where, and in which electoral divisions, are Migrant Resource Centres located. (2) How many clients has each Centre assisted in each of the last 10 years. (3) When was each centre established and how is the ongoing need for a Centre in a particular location regularly assessed. (4) Is the Government considering the closure or opening of any Centre. (5) How many refugees were assisted by each Centre over each of the last 10 years. (1) A table providing the location and relevant electorate for Migrant Resource Centres (MRCs) and Migrant Service Agencies (MSAs) is at TableA below. This includes two outreach centres. Electorates have been provided on the basis of each organisation’s physical location. The service provision catchment area for each MRC/MSA may however, extend across electoral boundaries. The relevant electorate has been determined in accordance with information provided by the Australian Electoral Commission. (2) We are unable to provide all the information requested. The Department is currently undertaking a major overhaul of the way in which client data is collected. In relation to MRCs/MSAs, this process is expected to be completed within the next few weeks, at which time it would be possible to provide recent client statistics. To attempt to provide the information in advance of the data overhaul exercise being completed would involve labour intensive research of files and annual reports, resources for which are not available. The completion of the current overhaul is expected to result in more accurate statistics for 2000 onwards, depending on when each MRC/MSA began to use the Statistical Clients Information System (SCIS) to record client statistics. The collection of client statistics was not required of MRCs/MSAs until 1997, and at that stage data collection focussed on the number of services provided by the MRC rather than the number of clients assisted. While we will shortly be able to provide more comprehensive data than we can at present, we will not be able to do so for each of the last 10 years. (3) Establishment dates for MRCs/MSAs appear in TableA below. The Migrant Resource Centre program has undergone three major reviews since its establishment, either by the department or externally. They were: Evaluation of Post-Arrival Programs and Services by the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs in 1982; Review of Migrant and Multicultural Programs and Services in 1986; and Ethnic Services Delivery by DILGEA Funded Community Organisations in 1992. A review of MRC locations across Australia was conducted in 1983, and a review of locations in Melbourne and Sydney was conducted in 1997. In addition, the annual core funding budget process involves the assessment of: changing demographics in relevant catchment areas for each MRC/MSA; performance of the organisation; and identified settlement needs. (4) The Government is not considering the closure or opening of any MRC/MSA at present. However, the Department has been asked to consider the relocation of the South Metropolitan MRC in Fremantle to Gosnells in south-east Perth. The proposal will be considered in the context of the annual MRC/MSA funding process. (5) We are unable to provide the information requested. Most annual reports produced by MRCs/MSAs do not distinguish between various types of clients and provide overall figures only. However, following the completion of the SCIS overhaul, as outlined in Question2 above, statistics referring to humanitarian and refugee clients will be separately identified.

(2) How many TPV holders have subsequently applied for a permanent protection visa and of these how many claims have been granted or refused to date. (3) How many TPV holders are estimated to be ineligible for access to a permanent protection visa after 30 months as a result of changes to the law that commenced 27 September 2001. (4) Are TPV holders eligible to access (a) torture and trauma counselling, (b) AMEP English language tuition, (c) settlement assistance from Commonwealth-funded Migrant Resource Centres or (d) Community Settlement Service Scheme projects. (5) Has the Government commissioned any research into the settlement experience of TPV holders; if so, what are the details; if not, why not. (1) Since the introduction of the TPV system in October 1999, up to 8 February 2002, 7,627 unauthorised arrivals have been granted a TPV. (a) During the 1999-2000 program year 871 TPVs were granted. (b) During the 2000-2001 program year 4,456 TPVs were granted. (c) During the 2001-2002 program year up to 8 February 2002, 2,300 TPVs have been granted. (2) Between the introduction of the TPV system in October 1999 to 8 February 2002, 5,217 TPV holders have applied for a subsequent protection visa. The issue of whether TPV holders who are found to be in continuing need of protection will be granted permanent or temporary residence will be assessed at the time of decision on their subsequent application. To date, one application has been decided. That person was granted a protection visa and permanent residence status. (3) It is estimated that 3,673 TPV holders may be covered by the changed legislation. Only those who have not spent 7 days or more in a country en route to Australia where they could have sought and obtained effective protection will be eligible for grant of a protection visa with permanent residence status (provided they meet all other criteria for grant of the visa). Those persons who spent 7 days or more in a country en route to Australia where they could have sought and obtained effective protection are found to be refugees will be granted protection and temporary residence for 3 years. (4) TPV holders are eligible for the Early Health Assessment and Intervention Program which includes, if required, Torture and Trauma counselling. TPV holders are not eligible for the services specified at (b), (c) & (d). (5) TPV holders are temporary residents who are expected to leave Australia at the end of their visa unless they have an ongoing need for protection. The government has not therefore commissioned any research into the settlement experience of TPV holders, as they are not expected to settle permanently in Australia. Immigration: Maribyrnong Detention Centre (Question No. 140) Mr Danby asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 14 February 2002: (1) What is the current status of the inquest into the death of an asylum seeker in 2001 who allegedly jumped off a basketball pole whilst under detention at the Maribyrnong Detention Centre. (2) Were there any witnesses to the alleged incident. (3) Is the Government proposing a coronial inquiry into the death. (4) What measures have been taken at the Maribyrnong Detention Centre to ensure a similar incident does not happen again. (1) The Department is currently awaiting the outcome of the Coroner’s inquest into the death of the detainee who allegedly jumped off a basketball pole at Maribyrnong Immigration Detention Centre (IDC) on 22 December 2000. A hearing date is yet to be scheduled. (2) The incident was witnessed by some ACM personnel, as well as a number of detainees at the Centre.
