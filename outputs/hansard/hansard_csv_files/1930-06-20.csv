The departments have been acting on that instruction. Within the last few weeks'. I sent outa further circular to certain 'departments in .which the overtime still seemed to be excessive.

When was the present system of censorship of books inaugurated by his department? 2. Who are the officers responsible for this work in each of the States? 3. How long has each officer been carrying out this class of work? 4. How many books have been prohibited each year under section 52(C) of the Customs Act since the censorship was inaugurated, within the categories of indecent, obscene, or blasphemous works ? 5. How many books were automatically'rejected each year without the Minister being consulted ? 6. Were any instructions given by the Comptroller-General of Customs or any oue else since October, 1929, that a much stricter censorship should be pursued in view of the fact that at a deputation, in Sydney on the 16th instant, it was alleged that the censorship is much stricter now than -when the previous Government was in power? orable member's questions are as follow:1. The present system has been in force since the inception of federation. 2 and 3. The Collector of Customs in each State is responsible for detaining doubtful books and reporting them to the Minister. In New South Wales and Victoria the first reading of the books is in the hands of particular officers-on e in New South Wales and two in Victoria. These officers peruse the books and bring under notice particular passages deserving attention. This practice has been followed for several years, and there has been no recent change in regard to the officers concerned in the matter. 4. The number of publications which was ou the prohibited list at the end of 1926 was 44. The numbers added since are:In 1927 .. ..19 192S 12 "" 1929 to 22.10.29 .. 01 „ 1929 from 23.10.29 .. 16 „ 1930 . . .. ..17 125 5.

No instructions whatever have been given since October, 1929, that a stricter censorship than formerly was to be adopted. The figures already quoted show that fewer books have The information been prohibited since October than in a corresponding period before that time. Neither the Minister, the Comptroller-General, nor the collectors have issued any recent instructions upon the point whatever. honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr. Watkins) asked a question regarding a newspaper report that a ship inward bound had called at Fremantle about a fortnight previously with a f u l l complement of migrants, of whom only nine were stated to be Britishers. Assuming that the vessel to which the honourable member refers is the RMS. Orvieto, which reached Fremantle on the 27th May, it has been ascertained that this vessel arrived with 273 third-class passengers, including 147 aliens. The British passengers on board included eight assisted migrants for the eastern States, which fact may have given rise to the newspaper report. Altogether, there were 195 British passengers on board. The majority of the alien passengers were former residents returning after temporary absence abroad, and wives and minor children of persons already settled in Australia.

LA CITE UNIVERSITAIRE . Dr. notice1.

The records of my department show that a number of countries have erected national houses for the accommodation of students in the area referred to. A building for the accommodation of students from Great Britain has also been erected in the same area, largely, if not entirely, as the result of private subscriptions. The last Commonwealth Government was invited to participate in the British arrangements, the estimated cost of providing accommodation for Australian students being £17,000.

I move, as an amendmentto the motion before the HouseThat the words ""crude shale oil"" be omitted with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word ""petrol"". The honourable member cannot move an amendment of that character. The Governor General's message is quite definite that the bounty is to be paid on crude shale oil. The honourable member may speak against the motion, but it cannot be amended in the way he has proposed. your ruling, Mr Chairman, it seems to me that it would have been much better had the Government brought down a measure for the payment of a bounty on petrol produced, not only from shale, but from brown or black coal as well. Chairman, whether it is not in order to move an amendment limiting the scope of the motion before the committee. A message has been received from His Excellency the Governor General, and a motion has been moved based on that message in the following terms:That it is expedient that an appropriation of revenue be made for the purposes of a bill for an act to provide for the payment of a bounty on the production of crude shale oil. Would it not be in order to move as an amendment that it is expedient that The recently extended cotton an appropriation be made for the payment of a bounty on a particular product of shale oil, or on a particular species of shale oil if there are different kinds of it? I recognize that it would be out of order to move an amendment seeking motion before the Chair, because gold is something quite apart from the subject-matter of the Governor General's message.

Leader of the Opposition that the motion is based on a message from the Governor General recommending an appropriation for a specific purpose, and no amendment having for its object the substitution of some other purpose can be accepted. Imperial Cbemical Industries, a very large corporation with an enormous capital, proposes to establish an industry in Australia for the extraction of petrol and other fuels from brown coal. A l ready a shipment of about 200 tons of brown coal has been sent to Great Britain for experiment, and I understand that the results have been thought satisfactory. It is also proposed, I believe, to extract petrol from black coal in New South Wales, a proposition in which the same company is interested. No doubt the company would be encouraged to proceed with the enterprise if a bounty were payproposal, and I hope that the Government able on the petrol produced. want a bounty. whether that is so or not, but I am convinced that the payment of a bounty would encourage the establishment of this industry. tion with the company mentioned, and it does not want a bounty. that the company does want a bounty. to learn from the Minister particulars of bis negotiations with the company regarding the payment of a bounty. It seems almost incredible that there can be in Australia any group of persons, or any individual, who does not desire to benefit from a bounty. appeal to tbe Government not to proceed with still another measure designed to encourage the exploitation of an unprofitable industry. I believed at first that the Prime Minister was sincere when he expressed a desire to carry on the government of the country on sound, economic lines, but I am being disilV Et>. \ Bounty BiU. lusioned. Eighteen months ago the Joint Committee of Public Accounts inquired into the shale oil industry, and reported that while there were immense deposits of oil-bearing shale in Australia, it was not advisable to proceed with its extraction at the present time when petrol could be obtained more cheaply from overseas. It recommended that this oil should be allowed to remain unworked as a reserve for the future. If the importation of petrol were prohibited, the Government would suffer an immediate and considerable loss of revenue through the Customs Department, and it would also be called upon to pay large sums in the way of bounties on the production of the shale oil which would take the place of the oil previously imported. At Newnes there are large deposits of shale which are of the utmost value to Australia, and it would be wrong to exhaust them at present, for it would deprive the country of a valuable defence asset. The time is inopportune for the introduction of this will realize this. Bounties are being provided to assist this and other industries, as though such assistance was of real value to the country, which is not the case. I hope that the Minister will withdraw this ridiculous proposal,and turn his attention to the devising of some other way of helping the nation out of its present grave position. [11.32] I congratulate the Government I know upon having introduced this motion. One of the most serious features of our economic position is that we are sending huge sums of money to America in payment for motor cars and oils which we are importing from that country. We should be doing our utmost to develop our own oil resources and make this country self-contained. I disagree with the view of the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse) that the time is inopportune for us to encourage the extraction of oil from our shale deposits. We should be doing our utmost to develop all our natural resources. It would be a tragic thing for this country if , in the event of war occurring, her supplies of oil and petrol were cut off.

In these circumstances it will be wise for us to endeavour to produce oil from other resources which we have at our command. quantities of oil are .produced annually from coal and shale. I do not think it would be wise for us to draw to too great an extent upon our shale deposits at present. If our supplies of imported oil were cut off in war time, we should become entirely dependent upon oils extracted from our own shale and coal, and upon power alcohol manufactured from molasses; but our supplies from these sources would be quite insufficient for our needs. It would not be wise for us to simply allow our shale to remain in the earth; we should endeavour to perfect a process by which the oil could be extracted from it. We have failed hitherto to extract the oil successfully, because tbe shale has been too rich. In Scotland refineries have been in operation for many years extracting oil from shale; but the shale there is of a very low grade. In Australia, in the Wolgan Valley, at the back of Mount Victoria, in New South Wales, are the richest shale deposits in the world. Tasmania also has some very rich shale .deposits, though they are not quite so rich as those of New South Wales. Whenever an attempt has been made to extract the oil from these shales the retorts have clogged, and it has been impossible to get the oil through them. Although large sums of money have been spent in endeavouring to develop this enterprise every effort to do so up to date has failed. Mr John Fell, of New South Wales, must have spent hundreds of thousands of pounds in endeavouring to. extract oil from our shales, and. very large sums of foreign capital have also been invested here for the same purpose. I sincerely hope that the Minister will be able to tell us presently that a retort has at last been discovered which will be suitable for treating our rich shales. If that is so, it is the duty of the Government to recompense the inventor of the retort adeworld. That coal can be quarried, but quately and to; retain it for future use. Those shale deposits should be worked on a nucleus basis, to enable the men employed in the industry to become accustomed to the work, so that Australia will at all times have sufficient oil to Mr Bayley. carry its industries, and to assist, if necessary, in its defence. In Germany large hope that the House will agree to the granting of a bounty on shale oil. The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) has said that before this bounty is granted we should wait until it is asked for by companies which are experimenting in the extraction of oil from black and brown coal. Efforts have, been made for a number of years to extract oil from shale deposits, and I believe that the Latrobe Company has a new retort which will enable this process to be profitably carried out. It is not proposed to pay a bounty until the oil has been produced. It has been said that we should leave shale oil in the ground as a reserve, but that argument could be applied to everything else that is produced from the soil. No benefit would be obtained by leaving shale oil in the ground. We might just as well leave our timber on the ground. Of course, if we found liquid oil in Australia the shale oil could remain as a reserve. In the meantime we should encourage the production of shale oil, because many people have put their money into this'industry. I hope that the House will agree to the proposed bounty. [11.48] I cannot understand why the Government, instead of proposing to assist the production of oil from shale deposits has not reviewed the whole question of oil production. It is unreasonable to assist one source of production, and to give no consideration to other sources. Oil from coal is just as valuable to Australia as is oil from shale, and if one process is to be assisted, others should also be assisted. In Australia we have some of the largest coal deposits in the world. In addition to the brown coal-fields of Victoria, we have in Queensland, at Blair Athol, coal deposits which are not exceeded in quantity and quality elsewhere in the unfortunately its production is unprofitable because of the distance of the coalfieldfrom a port. We have also, in the Burrum coal-fields, large deposits which, with adequate government assistance, would provide considerable employment,",18,Irefkesentati

It is unwise for the Government to discriminate between the various processes for producing oil, and this bounty should be extended to the production of oil as a whole. 1 support this proposed bounty, because i i is a step in .the right direction. -The proposed bounty on shale oil cannot be said to be premature; if anything, it is rather late in the day. years ago on the production of shale oil. that. America has more oil reserved today than would fill the Burrinjuck Reservoir. brought about because of the supply actually exceeding the enormous demand for oil. We should exploit at the earliest moment every avenue of oil production, because the time is not far distant when oil will not be required. All our motor vehicles will be propelled by electric power, and they will need only to pull up to one of the posts which support the transmission line carrying electricity, to re-charge their batteries. The possibility of using electricity would be a great boon to aviation, because the great drawback to air traffic now is the weight and bulk of the fuel that has to be carried on each flight. If power can be stored in batteries, aviation will make tremendous strides. When the various proposed hydro-electric schemes are completed, there will be many posts at which electric current may be obtained. Instead of stopping at a bowser a vehicle will need only to stop at a post. I hope that the House will agree to the bounty, so as to give some encouragement to an Australian industry. able members have referred to the extraction of oil from shale and coal, but not from straw, and it would be easy to make a lengthy speech on the need of the utilization of straw for the manufacture of petrol and oils. If there is to be a bounty on shale oil, and perhaps a bounty on oil extracted from coal, I certainly claim that a bounty should also be extended to the production of oil from straw, and, if necessary, from potatoes. There is, at Mangalore, a factory in which petrol is being produced in large quantities from straw. I understand that a ton of straw produces about 70 gallons of petrol. As the production of wheat to-day is anything but profitable, I suggest to the Government .that, if .a bounty were given on the production of petrol from wheat and oaten straw, it would go a long way towards keeping the farmer on the land. If it is proposed to pay a bounty, not. only on, shale. ..oil,, a bounty but also on oil extracted from coal, I . shall, in committee, move in the direction of extending the bounty to oil produced, from straw. That position has been In connection' with the extraction of oil from coal, reference has been made to coal deposits at Blair Athol. Honourable members who represent coal-mining constituencies have for some tjme past been urging the Government to ascertain whether it is not possible for the coal owners to use some of their .profits, in experimenting in the extraction of by-products from coal. Little has been done in Australia in the direction of utilizing the coal industry to the fullest extent. Immediately after the war Germany found herself in a position somewhat similar to that of -Australia to-d'ay. Many people were unemployed, and the coal industry was languishing. The Ger7 man coal-owners began to exploit the. possibilities of extracting by-products, from coal, and so successful were their efforts that in 1925 they were able to reduce the working hours .of the miners and to increase their wages. In addition, Germany was practically able to hunt British coal off its market. At Blair Athol, in Queensland, there are, I suppose, the largest coal deposits in Australia. Coal can. be mined more cheaply there than elsewhere in Australia, but because of the distance of the field from a port, it is impossible for it to compete with that mined at Newcastle. During the Newcastle coal strike Blair Athol came into its own.

The Bruce-Page Administration, in 1923, passed a similar act, which was re-enacted in 1926, and expired in August, 1929. More than 50 years ago, work was commenced on New South Wales shale deposits, and some thousands of tons were mined; but, with the advent of well oil, or petrol, early this century, the production of shale oil became unpayable, and the industry has not been able to establish itself profitably.

Owing tonow obsolete, these companies were unable to continue operations, but with the advent of more efficient retorts and machinery, the industry is said to be in a more favorable position. The granting of assistance to the industry was closely investigated in 1915 by the Interstate Commission, which recommended that assistance by way of bounty be given. It was not, however, until 1917 that a bounty was again provided. It was paid on crude shale oil produced from mined kerosene shale, and the rates payable were 2^d. a gallonup to 3,500,000 gallons; 2d. a gallon over 3,500,000 gallons, and not exceeding 5,000,000 gallons; l f d . a gallon over 5,000,000 gallons, and not exceeding 8.000,000 gallons; and l£d. a gallon on each additional gallon. This act operated for a term of four years from 1917, but it was extended from time to time, up to the 31st August, 1929, when it expired. Although, in 1922, the rate of 2£d. a gallon on production up to 3,500,000 gallons was increased to 3|d. a gallon, the amount of bounty claimed after 1924 was negligible, and, finally, the production of shale oil ceased. Since then a great deal of investigation has been made as to the possibility of providing more efficient retorts and other plant to deal with the shale. . Oil-bearing shale deposits are known to exist in all the States of Australia except Victoria. The deposits in New South Wales and Tasmania have already been worked to a certain extent at different times. The best deposits in New South Wales are regarded as the largest and richest in the world. Australia is fortunate, therefore, in having the best available material to work upon. I have discussed this matter with the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Chifley), who represents the district of Newnes,' near Lithgow, where there is to be found one of the richest shale deposits known. He has been much interested in the continuance of the bounty that was provided by previous governments. Of course, honourable members from Tasmania are greatly interested in the deposits at Latrobe. taken to form companies to work the shale deposits in New South Wales, and another company has already erected a Mr Forde. preliminary plant in Tasmania, where it is producing shale in small quantities. A company at Newnes once employed up to 700 men, and, at a period when there are thousands of unemployed in Australia, the re-enactment of this bounty would provide work for a considerable number of men throughout the Commonwealth. to become permanent? three years only, and then the matter can be reviewed. The interests controlling mining for shale for oil production have asked that the bounty given by the last Administration be re-enacted. promise that work will be recommenced on a larger scale than before? tage of the latest retorting plants and refining processes, which are a great advance on past methods, it is considered that there is every reason to conclude that the industry can now be successfully established on a large commercial scale. The areas proposed to be worked are estimated by the companies to contain over 30,000,000 tons of shale, which will produce approximately 80 gallons of crude oil per ton. The companies now interested -are-Widdin-Baerami Shale Oil& Coal Limited, Adelaide, holders of leases in New South Wales, having at Baerami Creek, New South Wales, an area of 5,210 acres reputed to contain approximately 30,000,000 tons of shale averaging 84 gallons of crude oil per ton; The Australian Oil Producing and' Refining Company Limited-capital £250,000-which will develop concessions at Reedy Creek, New South Wales; a company about to be formed to take over the works at Newnes, New South Wales, operated some years ago by' Mr John Fell; and Mineral Oil Extraction Limited, of Latrobe, Tasmania.

On the 21st August, 1925, the Parliamentary Joint Committee of Public Accounts reported to Parliament, inter alia, that "" evidence heard by the Accounts Committee was unanimous that, the continuance of the Commonwealth bounty was essential to the conduct of the industry."" Tho honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse) would have us believe that, the Public Accounts Committee recommended that the bounty should not be re-enacted. As a matter of fact, the evidence heard by the committee, of which I believe the honourable gentleman was a member, was unanimously in favour of the continuance of the bounty. The Government has recently investigated the present position and prospects of the industry, and it believes that to create more employment and further wealth production, and to establish an alternative source of supply of oil, it is desirable to re-enact previous shale oil legislation for a further experimental period of three years, after which, the whole matter can be reconsidered. the experiment? and other equipment are now available than when the industry previously failed. be made to carry on the industry'without assistance? for a period of three years to assist in meeting the initial expense of installing the latest machinery. After that, the industry hopes to be able to continue The cost of the bounty for the last six without the bounty. The Government has been impressed with the fact that the present higher prices of petrol have altered the position considerably. This opportunity for successfully establishing the shale oil industry in Australia should be much more likely to succeed than any previous attempt, for the reasons I have stated. Another important factor is that many valuable products are obtainable from ing oils, waxes, phenol, pyridine, and several others. It is also desirable to give consideration to the enormous importations of petroleum spirit.

118,Mr Forde,"S o far as I am aware working margin against which interestbill are the same as in the Wine Export Bounty Bill and the Cotton Industries Bounty Bill recently dealt with by the House. I expected that some 'honourable members representing coal areas would ask why the Government was not proposing a bounty for the extraction of oil from coal. This matter has already received a good deal of consideration, because of the strong representations made to the Government by the honourable members for Macquarie, Hunter, Werriwa, Flinders, Newcastle, and Kennedy. I accompanied the honourable member for Hunter to Cessnock, where he introduced a deputation which urged the payment of a bounty on oil extracted from coal. made out a strong case, and I promised them that the Government would give careful consideration to all representations on the subject. Experiments have been conducted with many processes in an endeavour to make the manufacture of oil . from coal commercially payable. has been carried out in various parts of the world, chiefly in the United Kingdom by Imperial Chemical Industries, and in Germany by the German Dye Trust-Interesse n Gemanschaft Fareinindustrie, known as the I.G. Company. Broadly this research work can be separated into two classes-(1) . low temperature carbonization, and (2) hydrogenation. The latter is the more recent development in the manufacture of oil from coal, and I mperial Chemical Industries has already done a lot of experimental work in this process. This company has a capital of £95,000,000 and has £2,500,000 invested in Australia; that of the German company is between £45,000,000 and £50,000,000. Samples of Australian coals have been sent to England and tested. Coal from the Hunter district has yielded more favorable results under tests than coal from any other part of the world. Samples of brown coal also have been sent from Victoria to England, and tests of them too have been satisfactory. Imperial Chemical Industries has also had experts in Australia on several occasions to examine sites for the erection of plants for the production of oil from coal. At present the company has an experimental plant operating, and the Chairman, Lord Melchett, stated in a recent reportWe have made great progress in tlie important field of the conversion of coal into petrol and fuel oil by hydrogenation. A semitechnical plant is in operation, and is to-day producing first-class petrol from British coal. We are dping intensive work on the subject, studying it particularly in this country and in other parts of the Empire, and we have every reason to hope that under favorable conditions we shall be able to produce higli class petroleum products on a commercial basis. We have recently had discussions with representatives of an important group of oil companies and the Standard-I.O. Company of America, with a view to arranging mutual co-operation a n d ' the pooling of knowledge The deputies and for exploitation of the process on mines which would encourage mutual progress. Representatives of Imperial Chemical Industries have interviewed me, and explained what the company is doing in Australia; they said that it hoped to invest £1,000,000 in Australia as soon as Research work further experiments proved that oil could be extracted from coal on a commercial basis. The company is confident that its process will prove successful, and revolutionize the coal industry in Australia, but does not want to take the risk of investing its money on the promise of a bounty which in three or four years might be discontinued. As the company made no request for a bounty on oil produced from coal, obviously it would be premature for the Government to provide such assistance. The company appears to be confident that the industry can be established in Australia without it, and if the process proves a commercial success, ample capital will be available for its development. The Government will, however, watch with interest and anxiety the result of the company's experiments. If its sanguine expectations are realized, the new methods of utilizing our coal resources will revolutionize the industry, and solve the problem of overproduction. adjourned.

119,Debate (On Motion By Mr Gullett),"AND ARBITRATION BILL . Debate resumed from 19th June (vide That the bill be now read a second time. I have listened with great interest to the speeches which have been delivered during the course of this debate, and I am bound to confess that since hearing them. I am more than ever convinced that our whole arbitration system needs to be abolished rather than amended. It was, I think, the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) who said in his speech that hitherto arbitration in Australia had operated on a rising market, which accounted for what success the system has been able to achieve. Some years before federal arbitration was considered to be within the scope of practical politics, I heard a speaker in the Queensland Parliament, while opposing the principle of arbitration, say that he had no fear of the system when conditions were good and no industrial depression prevailed, but that he did fear what might happen if arbitration were in operation when the reverse conditions applied. That fear has been amply justified in the years that have intervened. Practically right uj> to the present time prices and wages have been increasing, but now we are faced with industrial depression, and with the need of readjusting costs of proarbitration, but by direct negotiation duction. Every honest critic of the system must admit that arbitration has broken down when confronted with a period of economic depression. orable member's imagination. definite conclusion that I have come to as a result of my observations. I approach this subject in the belief that the system of industrial arbitration has definitely broken down; that it has crashed beyond hope of recovery, and that the system should be buried-wit h decent sepulture if necessary-but , anyhow, buried. ber is the only one who said that before the last election, and got away with it. ment during the electiou campaign, and I have no apology to offer for making it with increased emphasis in this House. After hearing it, my constituents returned mo with a majority of 6,000. We frequently hear the comment to-day that industry is being conducted in Australia upon an unsound basis, a contention which will, I think, be endorsed by every thinking student of political economy. Nothing else contributes to this all-prevailing unsoundness so much as does the present system of compulsory industrial arbitration. So unsound is the arbitration system with which the country is tied, knee-haltered and hobbled, that even some supporters of the system on the other side of the House have indicated quite clearly that they do not expect much from this measure, but are prepared to give it a run in the hope that some good may ensue. If arbitration w'ere the sound proposi : tion its supporters claim it to be, it would not be possible to produce against it such an overwhelming mass of facts as arc available in the figures prepared by the Commonwealth Statistician. Those controversialists who assert that compulsory arbitration has been such a tremendous factor in preserving peace in industry, forget that even at the present time the great majority of industrial .disputes are settled, not by recourse to compulsory between employers and employees. successful because the court is in the background. or not, the statement. I have made is incontrovertible. I propose to quote statistics which will prove that for the years 1928-29, out of 435 industrial disputes, over 75 per cent, were settled without reference to State industrial acts, or the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Of 200,000 work-people involved, over 150,000 contrived to settle their differences, either by conference, or by the intervention of a distinctive third party, not under Commonwealth or State industrial legislation.

It emphasizes beyond auy question that direct negotiation gives infinitely more satisfactory results in the settlement of iii.iustrial disputes than compulsory arbitration, and that it is the system which we must ultimately adopt for the solution of our industrial problems. It should be apparent to everybody that the bringing together of the representatives of employers and employees in particular industries at a round-table conference is much more likely to yield satisfactory results than the forcing of the parties into the legal atmosphere of a court. 1 am sure that the adoption of this procedure generally would prevent the occurrence of many strikes, whereas the pursuit of the policy outlined in the bill must necessarily involve us in additional trouble. "" Direct negotiation "" is. the conspicuous finger-post that points us to industrial peace. The further amendment of our Conciliation and Arbitration Act will get us nowhere. Surely no one can be blind to the fundamental fact that the persons actually engaged in industry are more competent than any others to settle their own problems. Yet we are proposing to make tician, Mr Wickens, and published in the Commonwealth Year-Booh for 1929:1928. 1924. 11)25. 1920. 1927. 1928. 264 209 166 229 138 20 24 16 18 8 ' 11 12 8 13 10 7 2 10 19 S 12 13 13 19 6 5 4 8 5 10 2 1 10 3 179 226 135 122 99 .. 500 491 356 435 282 radical alterations in our methods of endeavouring to settle industrial disputes which must make it more difficult than ever for the parties to negotiate directly. Industrial arbitration stands condemned in the eyes of Australia, and we are wasting our time in increasing the entanglements of an already complex and difficult situation. Of the 2.064 industrial disputes which occurred in this country in the five years ending 192S, 1,006 were settled by direct negotiation between the employers and employees or their representatives, without the interference of any tribunal or legal authority, 86 were settled by the intervention of third parties or legal tribunals; 63, or about 3 per cent., by the intervention of the Commonwealth court; 100 by State tribunals, and the remainder by other means. This forces me to the conclusion that Australia needs more direct negotiation and less legal interference in her industrial problems. We should completely abolish our arbitration system. I have formed this conclusion after the careful study of a mass of information which I have been able to obtain, and I feel it to be my duty to submit this view to the House. If it could be truthfully argued that industrial arbitration had even diminished industrial disturbances there might be some justification, for retaining it ; but such a contention could not be supported by facts. In the last five years there has been an enormous increase in the number of industrial disputes in Queensland and New South Wales and the other States. According to the Year Book the number of workers involved in disputes in Queensland increased from 3.064 in 1923, to 30,234 in 1927. The increase in New South Wales was from' 60,199 in 1923, to 148,541 in 1927. Similar figures for the whole of Australia are 76,321 in 1923 and 200,757 in 1927. Thesefiguresdo not show that arbitration has reduced industrial disagreement, but rather that it has increased it. I listened with interest to the remarks of the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Chifley) and the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr .Keane) about the industrial position of America and I have since been at some pains to ascertain whether their contentions were sound, and if so, the bearing that they had upon Australian industry. It will be remembered that a few years ago an Australian industrial mission visited America. It was accompanied by a corps of journalists and independent inquirers. One of these persons, Mr Hugh Grant Adam, recorded the result of his inquiries and observations in a book entitled An Australian looks at America, from which I make the following extract:The relation between employers and employees in the industries where the workers are well organized are, at present, most harmonious. The unions accept the position that the worker must be efficient and must. maintain a high speed of production if he is to receive high wages. The go-slow doctrine has no support outside of the crazy minds of discredited extremists. The unions offer no opposition to the introduction of the most modern labour-saving machinery, and they recognize and accept the system of piece-work, with the stipulation that the representatives of the workers must be consulted in determining the schedule of rates. That statement is almost diametrically cluding automatic machines, and does not opposed to the view put forward by the believe that these create unemployment.

It claims, and is American Federation of Labour, and Mr prepared to prove, that workers who are Victor Orlander, the secretary of the organized in trade unions give better work and Mr Morgan. Illinois branch of the Federation. Referring to his conversation with Mr Green, Mr Adam saysWith GreenI discussed the wide difference . between the attitudes of the labour movements in America and in Australia towards the system of compulsory arbitration in industrial disputes. Voluntary arbitration is becoming increasingly common in America and is encouraged by the Federation of Labour. ""But we cannot approve of compulsory arbitration laws"" said Green, "" because we hold that a man's labour is his personal possession, which no law should be allowed to take from him against his will."" utterance! utterance, but still it is f u l l of sound common sense and logic. ber would not say that in his constituency. Downs precisely what I am saying now, and I am prepared to do so again. The writer continuesI mentioned that in Australia we sometimes had strikes, even after arbitration. That, Green honestly could not understand. He said, "" If we agreed to a law making arbitration compulsory, we would surrender absolutely our right to strike. Because we dare not give up that right we cannot accept your arbitration laws. Whatever you may expect, we would not expect to have it both ways."" That is just where the trouble in Australia arises, because too often things are wanted both ways and by both parties. that? that it is the statement of Mr William Green, the president of the American Federation of Labour. This is the creed of American unionism as interpreted to Mr Adam by Mr Victor Orlander, the secretary of the American Federation of LabourUnionism stands for efficiency in production. It encourages the worker to gain skill. It approves of the introduction of new tools, in the worker, and believes that America can have a high standard of living with low costs principle of collective bargaining, but opposes",27,Second Reading

That is a right that should not be enjoyed by any section of the community. In other words, it is intended to exercise a new tyranny on peace-loving, loyal and law-abiding members of the community. That is an inescapable conclusion if the bill is read free from party considerations. further object of the bill is to grant a charter to organized unionism to paralyse industry at will, in the certain knowledge that it will have tbe approval of constituted authority. That is what, in been able to claim. this legislation will give to unionism a ;> fresh charter for lawlessness, of which it will not be slow to avail itself. Another proposal made by the bill is to abolish the secret ballot. Some of the soundest remarks that have been made with respect to that particular matter fell from the lips of the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) yesterday. [Quorum formed.'] I contrast those remarks with others made by the Attorney-General( Mr Brennan) when he introduced the bill, in which he referred to the secret ballot as "" an inexcusable interference with the self government of organizations"". weaker, more illogical, or more unconvincing argument could be advanced in favour of this obnoxious proposal to eliminate the secret ballot provisions of the act. Its use is a revelation of the lamentable position into which the honourable gentleman has been forced. If he could not find a better argument to support the withdrawal of those provisions, he ought not to have commented upon the matter. If there are to be no penalties for defiance of awards, and if the rank and file of the trade unions are to be denied the free and unfettered expression of their views, a highly dangerous and an odious power will be placed in the hands of unscrupulous union leaders. The only assurance and insurance that the community now have against that position arising is the presence of the secret ballot provisions in the act as. it stands. There is neither justice nor common sense in the proposal to .remove them for the specious and unconvincing reasons given by the Attorney General. Another feature of the bill to which exception has been taken is the proposal to appoint conciliation commissioners. Broadly, I rather favour the idea of having conciliation commissioners. Our whole system of compulsory arbitration will have to be amended along the lines A of conciliation rather than in any other direction; and this proposal of the Government is, in principle, an endorsement of that idea. Buti f the appointments are to be based on political prejudices and party predilections, this portion of the the past, unionism has not act will have in it a potential power to The passage of drive a further nail into the coffin of compulsory arbitration as we now know it. with regard to the judges. judges may be with respect to their knowledge of.the conditions that govern industry, they are strong in their sense of justice and their knowledge of conditions generally. ""What, to me, is another objectionable feature in the bill is the proposal to give absolute preference to unionists. The fundamental idea underlying preference to-unionists when it was first conceded in No New Zealand was that it . should form part of a bargain entered into between trade unionists and the public, the unionists on their part undertaking to refrain from striking if the public, on its side, would give them preference. That is the principle which has been followed in season and out of season. But nobody who is familiar with the industrial life of Australia will contend that that undertaking has been honoured by trade unionists in this country. I object to this legislation, also, on the ground that it is being foisted on the industrial affairs of Australia without the concurrence of all the parties concerned; it was not conceived in industry after conferences and debates between those primarily interested, but has been brought forward at the instigation of only one",30,Industrial Disputes Method S Of Settlement Australia 1924to

151,Mr Morgan,"Howeve r weak the party. Moreover, there is no assurance that it is likely to secure the co-operation which is absolutely vital to the economic and financial rehabilitation of the Commonwealth. A'case to the contrary, however, can be made out. I share unreservedly the misgivings both implied and stated by the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Chifley), and the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Holloway). The dominant note of their contributions to the debate was one of misgiving. I fear that the bill will not achieve the object that is sought, and that they have given it their blessing merely in the hope that it may do so. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), applauded the Australian system of arbitration. Listening to the right honourable member's declamations, one might think that it was he who had made arbitration what it is. But we know very well that if there is one mau in Australia who, more than another, has deliberately torpedoed the system, it is that right honourable member, because he subverted the court and its judges by the appointment of independent tribunals, with the result that ultimately the late Mr Justice Higgins was driven off tbe Arbitration Court bench. It has been contended that the principle of arbitration can be best served by its administration by the central Government. I do not share that view; I believe that it is a wrong one. If the principle of arbitration must be maintainedand in my opinion it will not serve the best interests of Australia to maintain it-it can be best secured by a complete withdrawal of the central Government from the field, so that the State Governments, which have complete power, and are able to operate it without the limitations that are imposed upon the central Government, will be unhampered in their administration. In support of that argument I read the following extract from the majority report of the Royal Commission on the Constitution, on the question of industrial powersWe do not recommend that the Commonwealth Parliament be empowered to legislate with respect to industrial matters generally. In our opinion, the reasons which may be urged against the abolition of the federal and the establishment of a unitary system of government in Australia may be urged against the transfer of this power to the Commonwealth. In our opinion, industrial legislation should be regarded as a function of the States. In many matters industrial legislation is experimental, and each State should decide for itself whether it is prepared to test the value of proposed legislation of this character and to accept the responsibility for its consequences. We also think that industrial legislation peculiarly requires local supervision, and should be in the hands of the authority which is responsible for the maintenance of law and for the good order of the community. We think, further, that the general power to legislate with respect to industrial matters should be in the hands of the legislature which has the general power to deal with health, trade and commerce, mines, lands, public works, and the development of a State. We do not think that it would be for the good of Australia that the Commonwealth Parliament should be occupied with industrial questions or that federal elections should turn on industrial issues. In our opinion paragraph (xxxv) of section 51 of the Constitution, which relates to conciliation and arbitration, should be deleted. We think that the Parliament which -deals with industrial arbitration and conciliation should be the Parliament which has control of industrial matters generally. For the reasons given above we think that this control should be in the hands of the Parliament of each State. We think that the history of the decisions on this paragraph shows (1) that the arbitration power, however exercised, should not be dissociated from the power to legislate on industrial matters; and (2) that there would be great difficulty in framing a definition of dispute which would ensure that only real disputes, in the sense in which that term was used in the earlier judgments of the High Court, were brought before the Commonwealth Court. We are of the opinion that the arbitration power should not be exercisable by two authorities, and that it should be in the hands of the States and not of the Commonwealth. I believe that that is a reasonable view of the situation, and, until it is acted upon, we shall have the confusion and overlapping that obtains in industrial affairs to-day. The opinion is growing, in my mind, that Australia will have no surcease from industrial embroilments until the whole system is discarded. Until Australia is prepared to abandon the present system to which she has committed herself, and adopt one formed on the basis of direct negotiation between employer and employee, there will be no final settlement of industrial strife as Ave know it in Australia to-day. If there were anything favorable to or in vindication of the present system, would it not have been copied or applied in some form by those countries where problems similar to those of Australia have to be considered? No greater condemnation of it is to be found than lies in the fact Britishers to strive to obtain its rights. that in no other country in the wide world has the Australian system been adopted in any considerable degree. Are we prepared to go on tinkering with our arbitration system, when other great industrial nations have devised different methods, which give them comparative relief from industrial strife? -On e would have thought that the honourable member for Darling Downs( Mr realizes that, if the Arbitration Act is Morgan) would have mentioned the fact that the matter he was discussing at the conclusion of his speech was decided at the last federal election, when the great majority of the people decided that this Parliament should legislate with regard to industrial arbitration. Notwithstanding the majority recommendation of the Royal Commission on the Constitutionthere was a majority of only one votethe people decided in favour of federal arbitration in order to secure uniformity in industrial regulation. If each State fixed its own hours of employment and rates of wages, there would inevitably be chaos in industry. In one State there might be no regulation, and that would have an injurious effect on another State that was endeavouring. to provide fair conditions in the interests of the workers. compulsory arbitration. Probably no The mere fact that the States of Australia have federated as a commonwealth is an indication that uniform laws are desired by the people. I challenge the remark of the honourable member for Darling Downs that federal arbitration has completely broken down. Would he contend that ourcriminal and civil courts are a failure, merely because some members of the community disregard the laws of the land? We have passed statutes to regulate marriage and divorce, but there is a continual stream of litigants through the divorce courts. There are laws to prevent robbery and fraud, yet to continue. crime is committed. We do not contend that because laws are disobeyed by a certain percentage of the people, they should be repealed. Federal arbitration laws have been passed for the protection of the workers, and, merely because they have not been observed in their entirety, it cannot be logically argued that they should be abolished. Any section that feels that it is suffering under an injustice has the inherent right of The remarkable progress that we have made as a nation is due to the fight that the workers have put up to secure fair conditions of employment. Trivial industrial disputes should not be regarded as strikes. There have been fewer strikes in Australia than in any other country. The whole object of compulsory arbitration is to prevent their recurrence. The honourable member for Darling Downs amended as proposed under this bill, the rural workers in Queensland may make an application for the restoration of the award that has been taken from them. Those workers liave as much right to protection as those employed in the cities, and the absence of an award enables employers to take advantage of their conditions when employment is scarce. My experience of arbitration, as a member of the early New South Wales court, led me to appreciate the benefits of the system. It has raised the level of the workers by eliminating sweating and other bad conditions of employment. Under free competition the unscrupulous employers drag the respectable ones down to their own level. Australia has made great progress since the introduction of country has enjoyed greater prosperity than Australia has in the last twenty years. for the late war, Australia would have been prosperous still.
