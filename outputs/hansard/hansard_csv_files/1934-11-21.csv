As no permits for the importation of Belgian glass were issued, Australian meat exports to Belgium ceased shortly after this agreement ""was signed. Our meat exports to Belgium in the first half of the year 1933-34 were valued at £33,410, compared with only £750 for the second half of the year. When the temporary agreement concluded by Mr Bruce was terminated by the Belgian Government in August last negotiations for a new agreement commenced, but they were subsequently interrupted by the dissolution of Parliament. After the Government was reconstituted in September it resumed negotiations with Belgium, and this agreement is the outcome. International obligations prevent the Commonwealth from granting an import quota exclusively to Belgium, and in order to meet this situation the Government has followed its policy of .allotting import quotas among the different overseas supplying countries in proportion to the imports from those countries in previous years, except that in the case of the United Kingdom the quota has been allotted on a preferential basis. British Government, recognizing the extraordinary circumstances surrounding the establishment of the sheet glass industry in Australia, the imposition of the deferred duties, and subsequently, the import embargo, has generously agreed to the application of the quota arrangements to imports from the United Kingdom. When the initial negotiations with Belgium were commenced it was estimated that the Australian consumption of glass was 7,500,000 square feet per annum, and consequently this figure was adopted as a basis. In accordance with the percentages already mentioned the 7,500,000 iquare feet will be allotted as underSquare Feet.

White. Owing to the revival in the building industry it is estimated that the Australian demand is now at least 8,500,000 square feet of glass per annum. The allocation to Australian manufacturers will, therefore, be approximately 5,000,000 square feet, with corresponding increases to overseas supplying countries in accordance with the percentages for the excess demand previously referred to. All the sheet glass permitted to be imported under the quota arrangements will carry the present revenue duties of 2s. per 100 square feet, British preferential tariff, and 4s. per 100 square feet, general tariff, plus primage duty not to exceed. 10 per cent, ad valorem. Protection will be given to the local manufacturer by the limitation on the quantities which may be imported. The local manufacturers should be able to carry on with an assured market for 5,000,000 square feet of glass, and a proportion of any additional demand which may result from a continuation of the building trade activities. The Government has also agreed that, should it be necessary at any time to increase the import quota owing to the temporary inability of local manufacturers to supply the full quota allotted to them, the addiThe tional imports will be allocated among overseas supplying countries on the same basis as the excess demand quota.

I remain dear sir, Your obedient Bervant, Consul-General of Belgium. The Honourable the Minister for Trade and Customs of the Commonwealth of Australia, Canberra, F.C.T. In order to give honourable members an opportunity to discuss the subject, I move That the paper be printed. not possible for honourable members to debate the merits or demerits of this subject on the motion "" That the paper be printed""; but I shall take this opportunity to make one or t » observations. I asked the Minister whether the House would be given an opportunity to discuss this treaty and he replied "" Yes."" I then asked him whether the House would be given an opportunity to discuss the subject before action was taken in connection with the treaty, and he ref lied that action was being taken at once, make an emphatic protest against this procedure. It is taking action behind the back of Parliament. ""We are concerned at the moment not with the merits or demerits of this treaty, but with the fact that the treaty is probably the forerunner of many others which apparently will be put into operation before Parliament is asked to ratify them. The honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) was given an offensive answer when he asked the simple question whether the House would be given an opportunity to discuss the subject. With all due respect, I submit that the honourable member was perfectly in order in asking that question across the table. member is fully aware that any interjection k disorderly. when very few members are in order. I contend that before action is taken in connection with any treaty this House should be given an opportunity to decide whether the treaty should or should not be ratified. We have before us a trade treaty which will affect an important industry in this country. I am not proposing to dtart . a debate on the treaty, but I assure the Prime Minister and the Minister for Trade and Customs that if we are not given an opportunity to discuss the treaty now, before action is taken in connection with it, we shall, in another way, make an early opportunity to discuss it. I suggest to the Prime Minister that he give instructions to tbe impetuous Minister for Trade and Customs that no action shall be taken to give effect to this treaty until Parliament has been given an opportunity to consider it. The mere recital of the facts without an opportunity to consider them in all their bearings and the mere adoption of a motion "" That the paper be printed"" are not sufficient. I venture to say that honourable gentlemen who have cheered the introduction of this treaty have been influenced by their prejudice in certain directions. They do not know and appreciate the full effect of the treaty. The arrangement that has been made amounts to more than a 40 per cent, restriction of our production. As progress is made-and one would expect progress to be made-in the production of window and sheet glass the 40 per cent, of this trade that will go away from Australia will represent more glass than is at present being produced here. For the last two years this industry has been able to supply all the glass required in Australia, .and has been employing Australian labour to manufacture it. ber who so glibly interjected is apparently ignorant of comparative prices, or he would know that the price of glass has come down since the establishment of the industry in Australia. We are obtaining our supplies at a lower price than formerly and providing employment for our own people. The fact of the interjection having been made warrants me, as Leader of the Opposition, in saying that before action is taken to give",14,Trade Agreement With Belgium Paper

We have been told that this Parliament is supreme, but that statement has not been borne out by our recent experience. Parliament has had no say whatever in respect of the treaty laid on the table this afternoon ; yet the effect of the treaty will be that the livelihood of certain people of this country will be taken away from them. Apparently two or three persons can exercise a kind of dictatorship without any reference of the matter to Parliament, and take a course that will rob many people of their livelihood. This treaty has been made behind the backs of the people's representatives. The Prime Minister( Mr Lyons), and also the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr ment giving effect to an agreement White), said that there would be no interference with our tariff arrangements by the new Governanent; but almost the first thing that happens after its assumption of office is that a quota system of imports is arranged with Belgium without any reference of the subject to the representatives of the people in Parliament. This treaty provides, in effect, that if there is any increased prosperity which results in more building being done in Australia, Belgium shall have the advantage of practically the whole of it insofar matter, the Government has departed as sheet glass is concerned. Leader of the Opposition has said, if we are not given an opportunity to discuss this subject now, we shall take early action to make one, for we realize the necessity to protect the interests of the workers of this country. It is quite true that certain provisions have been made regarding particular primary products. We are just as deeply interested in this connection as honourable gentleman who claim that they represent the farmers. I am sure that if any proposal were introduced which, in the opinion of those honourable gentlemen, adversely affected the farmers, they would insist on an opportunity being provided for them to discuss the subject in Parliament, and if no such opportunity were provided they would be on their feet at once. Honourable who represent, not only tlie workers, but also every section of the community, will avail themselves of every possible opportunity to protest against the action of the Government in entering into a trade agreement without consulting Parliament. ployment. The Attorney-General( Mr Menzies) and other Ministers have said from time to time that it is the desire of certain persons in the community to assume authority; that is to say, to set up a dictatorship; but, by entering into an agreement with Belgium without consulting Parliament, this Government has introduced a form of dictatorship.

Even the High Commissioner in London, Mr chamber, such as we have heard this Bruce, when Resident Minister there, agreed that it was the only course that could have been adopted. It is strange to find Ministers seeking to draw comparisons between the circumstances at that period and those with which we are faced to-day. Those honourable members opposite who snigger to-day must realize that the then Labour Government had no option but to do what it then did. We are dealing with more than the matter of a tariff decision; it is a trade treaty in which many interests are involved, and all honourable members are entitled at least to an opportunity to discuss the Government's policy. Otherwise, by a form of intimidation, as it is in this case, any foreign power could set out on a course which suited its interests, and force the Government to agree to a trade treaty behind the back of this Parliament. If we surrender to Belgium, we are merely offering an invitation to other powers to take similar action with regard to Australia, and the Parliament will be rubbed of its right to discuss these matters from all angles. Honourable members from different States may hold varying views about this treaty. Some may be interested very deeply in the barley industry, and may applaud the Government's action, because it gives promise of some relief in districts where these primary producers are ih a sore plight. I concede all that; but let us remember that this treaty involves the interests of, not only the barley-growers in South Australia and other States, but also the glassand possibly earlier, honourable members workers in the electorate of Cook and elsewill be afforded an opportunity for a where. Honourable members who come from working class electorates should at least be permitted to make their contributions to the debate, even though their suggestions may not prove acceptable to the Government.

Honourable members on the ministerial bench should realize that t they are not possessed of all the brain if r . Iteasley. capacity of the House.

I realize that honourable members would be at a disadvantage in discussing the treaty immediately, so I suggest that the printing of the document should be now agreed to formally. I give the House an undertaking that as soon as possible, having regard to other business requiring prompt attention, an opportunity will be afforded for the discussion of this treaty. I shall not now argue the merits of the Government's action; we accept responsibility for it. This action has been taken under powers that are inherent in the Minister for Trade and Customs, who, without consulting Parliament, could impose an embargo to-morrow, or could ration imports. At various times in the past, and for many months, action of this kind has been taken without Parliament being given an opportunity even to discuss the matter.

OF ARMS. leave-On the 15th November, the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr In addition to these inquiries made by Hawker) referred to the publication of statements in the press regarding the alleged possession by unauthorized organizations in the Commonwealth of rifles, machine guns, &c, and asked if there were any grounds for these statements. I replied to the honourable member to tbe effect that the Investigation Branch in Queensland was inquiring into the matter, and that I would later inform the House of the result. I have now received the following report from the Director of Investigation:Immediately the statement of Senator Collings was made in the Senate on the 14th instant, inquiries were instituted with a view to ascertaining whether there was any evidence available in support of the allegation. Theso inquiries are being continued, but up to the present no reliable evidence has been obtained. It is known, however, that a body exists styled tlie Australian Legion, or the Australian Legion of ex-Service Clubs. This body is non-political and non-sectarian, and is supported by returned soldiers. started in Syduey in 1923 as a break-off from the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia, and the executive officers arc all men of high standing in the community also means that men like the honourable gentleman would not be admitted to it. It is known also that a branch or similar organization was formed in Queensland, but its membership is reported to be small. W it h regard to the swastika badges referred to in the statement, this matter was investigated by our branch some months ago, when it was found that 1,000 badges had been manufactured by Messrs. Bishop& Son, of Brisbane, and ultimately delivered to a man named King at Townsville. King, who runs a "" Bingo"" table in Mackay, sells the badges to the public as lucky stars for 2s. eachHe still has about 8S0 badges left. Sales of surplus military arms and ammunition were made by the Defence Department to various people throughout the Commonwealth after inquiry, and these are used mostly for sporting purposes. The Ordnance Department will have a complete list of all recent sales. It is submitted that in cases such as the one under notice alleging the existence of anticonstitutional bodies in the Commonwealth, every possible help should be made available by the informant to enable the responsible officers of the Government to clear the matter up. Informants can be sure that they w ill not be compromised in any way, and it is urged that in the interests of the Commonwealth it is not unreasonable to expect assistance from any citizen imbued with the ideals of national responsibility. the Director of Investigation, I also caused the matter to be investigated so far as the Defence Department was concerned, and I have ascertained that the statements contained in the press report relative to arms is very similar to rumours which have been current, especially in New South Wales, during the last three years. There is no doubt that individual members of organizations, such as the New Guard and similar bodies, and also communist bodies, such as the Workers Defence Corps, have weapons of various kinds. So long as the weapons are not concealable, i.e., revolvers and pistols, there is no law forbidding their possession by private persons. Frequent investigation, however, has shown that the proportion of persons possessing weapons is comparatively small. The manufacture of small quantities of shirts of various hues has been brought to It was originally notice from time to time. The smallness of the quantities and the variety have not indicated anything of any moment.

These conditions are designed to ensure that the purchasers are reputable persons. Firms who purchase for re-sale are required to keep a record of every sale for inspection by the department, whenever desired. I might point out that service rifles and ammunition are extensively used in kangaroo and buffalo hunting, and in killing, crocodiles. For the year ended the 30th June, 1934, the department sold throughout Australia 637 rifles and 1,040,758 rounds of small arms ammunition (exclusive of rifle clubs). These quantities incidentally are much below those imported into Australia before importation was stopped. The .310 rifles referred to are old stock for which there is no ammunition, a fact that makes their disposal very difficult. The story of the machine gun in a building in Sydney has been told frequently in the last three years. It has always been found to be completely without foundation. Owing to the precautions which have been taken for the safe custody of Vickers machine guns and other weapons, there have been none lost by the Defence Department.

Leader of the House stated that, provided it could be shown that oil was being successfully produced from coal overseas or in Australia, consideration would be given to establishing and assisting a production unit in Australia. In view of the fact that the Lyon Brothers, of Wallsend, New South Wales, have demonstrated to the satisfaction of the State Government that they can, by a low carbonization process, extract oil from coal, aud have received assistance from that Government in their work, will the Commonwealth Government afford them financial assistance to enable them to carry on with a large-scale plant? matter, the demonstration given by Lyon Brothers was successful to the extent that they actually produced fuel but it has yet to be demonstrated that they can produce it on a commercial basis. enough. cesses by which oil oan be successfully extracted, and large sums are now being spent in Great Britain in order to demonministering the War Service Homes Destrate which process is commercially the best.

In recent years there have been three inquiries-the Piddington commission, which concerned itself entirely with the technical side of price fixation; the inquiry of the Public Accounts Committee in 1922; and the 1930 committee, of inquiry appointed by the then Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Forde).

107,Mr Beasley (West Sydney) [4.15].,"The majority of the coinmitttee refused to make any report, but Messrs. J. E. Penton, J. M. Fowler, J. G. Bayley, the late John West, and the present honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr with no fanfare of trumpets, it has been able Makin), tabled' a sensational report upon the affairs of the Sugar Control Board. The committee reported that, in October, 1915, the then Prime Minister, Mr W. M . Hughes, appointed Colonel Oldershaw as sugar dictator of Australia. He acted until October, 1920, dealing directly with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. As soon as the Public Accounts Committee commenced to probe the affairs of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, Mr Hughes gave Colonel Oldershaw six months' leave on full pay. He hurried away to London. Subsequently the Hughes Government f ave Colonel Oldershaw an extension, 'he committee was unable to examine him on many sensational allegations. Commenting in the Melbourne Herald of the 9th August, 1930, on the experience of the Public Accounts Committee in handling the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, the chairman, Mr J. M . Fowler, made the following sensational statement In the course of a lengthy inquisition into the tangled mazes of the subject, I came to certain definite conclusions. One of these waB that the political influence of the wealthy sugar interests was so vast that relief was practically impossible; another, that the key to the whole situation was the extraordinarily rich company, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which was able to throw a. smoke'' screen around all its dealings with such effect that the committee was not able to get at any facts on which to base a recommendation; the third waa that this difficulty was deliberately engineered, because the company dared not let its huge profits become known. Those very specific allegations were made by a man who, I understand, had the respect of all parties in this House, and who had observed the demeanour of the representatives of the sugar interests in the witness-box. Continuing, Mr Fowler statedAs a result of the arrangement' entered into in respect of bonus shares in the case by the Commonwealth Government, with interested parties and the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, Australia has paid, over and above a fair price for its sugar, tbe enormous tribute of £50,000,000. Consideration of the embargo oh cheaper foreign sugar is not complete unless the position of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Mr Beasley. is taken into account. It dominates the planters, the millers, the workers-eve n the Parliaments of Queensland and the Commonwealth. Every household in Australia payB its tithes to it. Through its influence, wielded to have its monopoly renewed without giving the people's representatives any opportunity of protesting against conscienceless exactions. The sugar interests certainly operate silently and their power, not only politically, but also in finance and in determining the policy of the Sydney Morning Herald, the Government's principal party organ in New South Wales, will be shown later. The recent proposal's that shocked the sugar consumers of Australia were, briefly, that the entire assets of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company should be re-valued, and that bonus shares, amounting to £7,000,000, should be distributed to shareholders. Thus; in one operation, concealed assets amounting to £7,000,000, built up at the expense of the Australian sugar consumers, are disclosed, and. arc to be parcelled out. It is the duty of the Government to determine what proportion of that £7,000,000 should rightly have gone to the Federal Taxation Department, as the Colonial Sugar Refining Company admits that it pays taxation at the rate of 4s. 6d. in the £1 on all disclosed profits. It must also be left to the Government to determine what proportion of the £7,000,000 should have been paid to revenue as excess wartime profits. The entire transaction reeks of financial gerrymandering. On the nth July, 1934, the Assistant Treasurer ( Mr Casey) introduced a bill to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act to deal with the federal system of taxation with regard to the method' of taxing distributions of profits by companies. But when the bill was being considered in committee on the 27th July, the honourable gentleman moved an important amendment to his original bill, providing for the continuance of the present law of those distributed by a company up to the 31st December, 1934. As the Assistant Treasurer said at the time, this meant that, instead of the new law coming into operation against bonus share distributions out of profits immediately the new provision was enacted, companies would have until the end of the present year to make such distributions. I refer honourable members to Hansard, No. 9, of 1934, page 849. As the AssistantTreasurer himself admitted, this was one of the principal representations made to the Government since the amending bill had. been introduced. In view of the proposed distribution of £7,000,000 by the Colonial Sugar Befining Company, it is not hard to guess the source of the representations mentioned by the Assistant Treasurer. It is very evident that the Colonial Sugar Befining Company managed to secure exemption until the 31st December, and therefore if the proposed distribution is authorized at next Wednesday's meeting of the company, it will be ""within the law "" by just a few days over a month. Apart from the loss of revenue, it is another glaring instance of the pressure the Colonial Sugar Eefining Company is able to exert on governments. Had the amending bill become law without the alteration made at the behest of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, the £7,000,000 proposed to be distributed by that company would have been subject to a much higher rate of taxation than will now be the case. This is not the first occasion that the Refining Company:Colonial Sugar -Refining Company has treated its shareholders to distributions of concerning which there are many debatable bonus shares.

So anxious have speculators been to buy into the Colonial Sugar Refining Company that £20 shares have soared to new record height's in recent weeks. In 1932, when the shares were quoted at £53 each, they were considered good investments; but following the announcement that £7,000,000 worth of bonus shares were to be distributed, the value of £20 shares climbed to £80. Time after time, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company has watered its capital, and has been able to iucrease its profits in order to provide the customary 12^ per cent, dividend. Is the latest move temporarily to lower the dividend rate until public indignation dies down, and then to pay the old rate on the new inflated capital to prove successful? The sugar interests will probably issue the usual barrage of propaganda and call upon its defenders to prove that they have never been found out in their exploitation of the public. Buti f honourable members will refer to the report of the Auditor-General, tabled in this House on 19th February, 1932, they will find the following scathing comments on the monopoly exercised by the Colonial Sugar In regard to the sugar industry in Australia, made for financing it imposes on the community an enormous additional cost, addabout £30 a ton.

During many years, large dividends have been paid, besides a return to the shareholders of £3,000,000 in cash out of capital provided by bonuses. Although profits have slightly declined, those disclosed are still ample to pay a dividend of 124 per cent, on the existing paidup capital, even in this time of depression, and when special arrangements have been made to raise the price of sugar artificially. There can be no doubt that this company haa attained its present prosperous and monopolistic position as the result of the high price which the consumers of Australia have paid, and are continuing to pay for sugar.

The interest charged by the company for financing the purchase of raw sugar amounted to 7s. 5d. a ton, while it received, in addition, £1 a ton to cover depreciation and interest on plant, together with management costs. If figures presented under these headings represented the actual position and costs of the company, the balance-sheet should reflect the actual position of the oompany. Considerable stress was placed by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company on the fact that it did. Yet it is now proposed to capitalize £7,000,000 of hidden profits at one operation. At the same time the company admits that there are still ample reserves to assure the holders of the inflated capital of every security. Not since the Hughes Goverument, in 1922, brushed aside the recommendation of the royal commission of £22 a ton and fixed the price of raw sugar at £30 6s. 8d. and that of refined sugar at £49 a tonor 6d. a lb. to the consumers-ha s there been such an outcry as at this issue of £7,000,000 bonus shares. When the Public Accounts Committee conducted its inquiry in 1922 it found that among the charges debited by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company to the Sugar Board was £248,076 as interest on tbe overdraft. Yet the management charge of £1 a ton was supposed to include those interest charges. The committee's report statedThe committee has not discovered any sufficient reason why the Colonial Sugar Refining Company was released from this responsibility without having to offset it accordingly. The only explanation offered by the company in evidence was that it was unable to finance the heavy purchases which have to be made. Whatever the reason, the fact remains that the Oommonwealth Bank was enabled to make £248,070 interest on the overdraft account, and the amount was debited against the retail consumers of sugar to be worked off at the price of Od. A lb. Commenting on the Colonial Sugar Refining Company's accounts, the Public Accounts Committee stated that neither the royal commission nor the committee had been allowed to see the actual costs. The report BtatedTt is only reasonable to infer that if these costs, taken in relation to charges, showed only a fair profit, there would not be any difficulty In revealing them. In addition to issuing this Christmas gift of £7,000,000 to its shareholders, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company proposes to increase its dividend next year to cover the extra amount of taxation to be paid on the bonus distribution. The meeting to confirm the distribution has been fixed for next Wednesday, 28th November. In the interests of the sugar consumers of Australia, who will be called on to pay tribute to this monopoly to enable it to maintain its dividends on its inflated capital,. I ask that the Government take appropriate steps to prevent the company from proceeding any further with its plans, and that legislation be introduced to prevent the company from further exploiting the people of Australia. I support the motion but do not expect the Government to take the action indicated by the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley), because members of the Ministry, if not directly interested in such forms of high finance, are, at all events, indirectly interested as the representatives of that section of the people which is so closely identified with private concerns of this nature. In this plot, for such it may be described, to -increase fictitiously the capital of the company, the directors of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company have, in the interests of their shareholders, conspired to defraud the Australian public of many millions of pounds. The 292,500 shares in the company have a book value of £20, but an actual market value of approximately £77. Those who have endeavoured to secure information concerning the operations of this company must have been astounded at movements of the shares during the last few months. People possessing inside information have, by steady buying pressure, created a demand for the shares until, as I have Btated, they have reached as high as £77. The honourable member for West Sydney has examined closely the history of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company and has shown that the amount actually invested in the undertaking was £2,425,000. As he has reminded the House, this is not the first occasion on which the Colonial Sugar Refining Company has handed to its shareholders considerable sums of money.

Buti t is possible for Labour memhers to expose the activities of this company. It has been said that three inquiries have been held into its operations. Much of the evidence taken at the last inquiry was given in camera, the representatives of the company being unwilling to disclose to the public the exact amount of profits it was making. This attitude is adopted not only by the sugar monopoly, but also by other activities. By glossing over their profits and placing them in reserves, by writing down their assets to a ridiculously low figure compared with market.valuea, they are able to hide from the public their fabulous earnings. The Labour party should state definitely that, if given the opportunity to do so, it will tackle this matter. These and other people who control private enterprise have been unduly exploiting the workers, and action should be taken to prevent them from continuing to do so. glad that this matter has been raised by the honourable member for West -Sydney( Mr Beasley), and that I am able, more or less, to co-operate with him. The sugar monopoly is responsible for the gravest exploitation of the public that has ever existed iu Australia. That exploitation is the mora serious in that it has gone on under the eyes, and with the approval of, Parliament-no t of one party alone, but of whatever government happened to be in power for the time being-durin g a number of years. The facts adduced to-day by the honourable member for West Sydney are not wholly new. Much of the same material was disclosed at the several inquiries that have been held into the sugar industry. Por years enormous profits have been made, totalling in round figures £1,000,000 a year, including reserves. The facts are well known to the people of Australia, and have been cleady placed before Parliament; yet. this is the first occasion on which definite best interests of their people when they action has been taken not only to limit tbe profits that are made by the company, consumers of sugar in Australia. The only point upon which I differ from my friends opposite is that I should like some practical step to be taken. It is useless to request the Government to introduce legislation immediately to prevent the public from being exploited. can do.. were to take practical action I believe that it would receive from this side of the House sufficient support to have that action put into effect. It is of no use simply to attack this company. It has made its profits within the law. I believe that the law is wrong. If the company has improperly evaded taxation the Commissioner is sufficiently astute to see that it pays what it should. ""Robbery"" is not the proper term to apply to what it has done. Its profits have been earned in accordance with legislation passed by this Parliament, and what we want is an alteration of the law. I should be very pleased to support a motion for the review of the agreement under which sugar ia sold retail to the people of Australia at 4d. per Ib. The profits disclosed are so large as to prove that the people of Australia are paying much more than a fair price for their sugar. That, in other words, is ^exploitation, the continuance of which it is the duty of Parliament to prevent. Hitherto, the Labour party, in common with the party of which I am a member, has supported the sugar monopoly. The establishment of that monopoly enabled good wages to be paid, with the result that the cooperation of unions of employees was secured, and with it the support of the Labour party as the representative of those unions. Combination along these lines is not confined to the sugar industry, but exists also in connection with iron and steel, and practically every industry in Australia which en joys monopolistic conditions and is able to maintain excessive profits. I am glad that the members of the Labour party, representing as they do the consumers of Sydney and other large cities, are at last realizing that they are not advancing the",29,Australian Cruiser Deliberate Fraud Perpetrated At The Ex

111,Mr Nairn,"If the Labour partymaintain these monopolies. that some workers in Queensland and some very prosperous people, who live mostly in Sydney, derive great advantages from the sugar industry. The consumers of Australia generally, however, contribute to the building up of the huge profits derived from the industry. Two methods may be adopted to deal with the position that confronts us. One is the temporary cancellation and the review of the agreement. There is a duty on sugar of £9 6s. 8d. a ton. That, together with primage and exchange, should afford ample protection to the industry-pro tection amounting to more than 100 per cent. Surely that is adequate for a commodity which is used by the whole of the community. importation of sugar into Australia were removed, the industry would be obliged to conduct its operations on a fair basis. There would still be ample margin for tbe payment of good wages and the making of fair profits. If the Labour party will make a practical suggestion for the review of the agreement, I feel sure that I can promise it sufficient support from this side of the House to have it carried into effect. port the purpose of the motion-that some action be taken by the Government with respect to this monopoly-bu t for a reason different from that given by the honourable member for Perth( Mr price to be paid by Australian consumers Nairn). The honourable member advanced arguments which have been submitted before, in favour of the reduction of the protection given to an Australian industry against the black labour which is engaged in the sugar industry in other countries. support. The sugar industry in Australia employs 25,000 men, and an additional 100,000 persons are indirectly dependent upon it. Australia is the only country in which cane is grown in the tropics under white-labour conditions. Labour party stands for the maintenance of those conditions, and the industrial workers of this country are prepared to maintain them at the price which is asked. Therefore, I am not in favour of the suggestion that the embargo against the importation of sugar into Australia should be removed, nor even of the It is true measure of protection suggested, because the result would be the importation of a large percentage of black-grown sugar. Nor do I think that that was the purpose of the mover of the motion. Again, I say that this is a great monopoly. It has exploited the people of various countries, but, so far as the consumption of sugar in Australia is concerned, it has been well tied up for many years under various governments. Before the sugar agreement was entered into and the embargo imposed, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which has a monopoly of the refining of sugar in Australia, exploited, not only the consumers of sngar, but also the growers of cane in Australia and the workers in every If the embargo upon the branch of the industry.. It brought into and refined in this country black-grown sugar. It built up reserves totalling millions of pounds, which it invested in different parts of the world, where it is now making its profit of £1,000,000 a year. All honourable members are, I am sure, deeply interested in the subject-matter of the motion submitted by the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) because of the wide-spread ramifications of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. Some of the activities of that concern are beyond the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Parliament. This company has always resisted attempts to fix the for its product, and being largely interested in F i j i , where sugar is produced under black-labour conditions, it has desired complete freedom to dump its product from black-labour countries on the Australian market. Such a proposal I will not There are two aspects of the subject to which I think attention should be directed. One was touched upon by the honourable member for West Sydney, namely, the issue of bonus shares and the effect of this course upon revenue. The The initial blunder was made by this Parliament when it enacted that bonus shares should be free from taxation. Although it may be true that bonus shares, representing undistributed profits, have already paid the company income tax, it should be borne in mind that the rate of taxation -on companies is lower than that payable by wealthy shareholders. During the",31,Australian Cruiser Deliberate Fraud Perpetrated At The Ex
112,Mr Scullin (Yarra) [4.52],"I supwar period, the rate was increased substantially, but in recent years, it has not by State or Commonwealth legislabeen more than Is. or Is. 4d. in the £1, whereas the rate of income tax on individual shareholders may be as much as 4s. or even 63. in the £1. No honourable member will deny that wealthy share-holders of the Colonial -Sugar Befining Company receiving the bonus shares which are about to be issued, will have escaped a substantial amount of taxation by being required to pay only the company rate of tax. No portion of the £7,000,000 represented by bonus shares would be taxable after the 3lst December next, if it represented the accretion of capital. But a large proportion of the amount to be distributed by this company represents accumulated profits, and the company is taking advantage of the .extenthe net profit which it makes from the sion of time provided for in the amendment of the Income Tax Assessment Act last year. That amendment was approved by this Parliament because it was thought to be reasonable to allow companies an extension of time within which to distribute reserve profits in the normal way. I am, however, fully convinced that no member of this Parliament, not excepting members of the Ministry, contemplated that any company would take advantage of this provision in the act to issue bonus shares to the amount of £7,000,000, and thus escape such considerable liability under the income tax law. MrJ MAXWELL -Ho w many sharev holders are tliere in the Colonial Sugar Refining Company? I do know that some very wealthy people control its operations, and that a not inconsiderable proportion of the company's profits comes from subsidiary concerns outside Australia. action taken by the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), when Prime Minister some years ago, the company's activities in Australia have been fairly well controlled, and if complaint is made about the price which Australian consumers have to pay for sugar, we should remember that the article is produced under conditions ensuring fair wages to Australian workers and a reasonable return to growers. That is not where the trouble lies. It goes back to the time when the company, untrammelled tion, paid low wages and made enormous profits not only in Australia, but also in F i j i , from sugar grown by black labour. Having in mind what this company has done, the Government should review its income tax legislation in order to safeguard the revenue. The immense profits which this company is making are derived from the sale, to other parts of the world, of sugar grown under black-labour conditions, and also by its investments in Australia and abroad of the accumulated profits of past years. Under the sugar agreement, rigid control is exercised over the company, and allowance provided for in the agreement does not exceed l/12th of a penny per lb., which is, of course, apart from the interest upon money loaned to growers and millers to finance the crop, for which the company receives $ per cent, less than the bank rate of interest. An important aspect of the subject to which. I would direct the attention of the Government is the disparity in the preference granted by Great Britain to sugar produced by black labour in F i j i , as compared with the preference given to sugar produced in Australia. The company produces in F i j i 140,000 tons a year, upon which it enjoys a preference in the British market of £6 15s. a ton, whereas the British preference to Australian sugar produced by white labour is only £3 15s. a ton. Bepresentati'ons should be made in the right quarter to have this anomaly rectified. The Australian sugar industry has to compete with those conditions and its surplus which is sold in the world's Following markets is approximately one-half of its total Australian production. Honourable members who speak of the profits made by sugar-growers and millers, who obtain £23 a ton for raw sugar, forget that the average price is only £15 a ton, because on the surplus sold overseas they incur a loss. The Australian sugar industry has not been spoon-fed, and the figures quoted by the Auditor-General are a monstrous travesty of the facts. I earnestly ask the Government to direct attention to the matter of bonus shares in order to see",32,Australian Cruiser Deliberate Fraud Perpetrated At The Ex

We hear ad nauseam of the exploitation of the people, but those who say these things evidently are unaware that the policy in operation today is substantially that which was launched under the auspices of Labour nineteen years ago. conditions under which the Australian sugar industry is operating to-day are those which were formulated in 1915. The justification for the policy of successive governments in relation to the sugar industry is to be found not in any political or economic circumstances, although it may be defended from either angle, but in the national and geographical circumstances of Australia. But for the Australian sugar industry the position in Queensland would be untenable. There would be thrown upon the Australian people the responsibility-quit e beyond its power-of defending a littoral of some 1,500 miles almost entirely unsettled, and which by its fertility and vulnerability in1931, and of every other agreement vited attack. The prosperity of the sugar industry is essential to the safety of Ausoperating since 1915. I say to the honortralia. The honourable member for Perth( Mr pany to-dayI am the last to act as its Nairn) said that the Australian sugar champion, as I have lead the cohort consumers are exploited. What are the against it-coul d have been said at any facts ? The Australian consumer pays 4d. time during the last nineteen years. per lb. for sugar. In England to-day it is 2^d. per lb. which, when expressed in not make them out of its business in terms of Australian currency, is 3id. per Australia. We have clipped its wings lb. Sugar is cheaper in London to-day very thoroughly and the amount the than it is in any part of Europe, and I company is paid for its services leaves venture to say that upon a fair comno room for criticism. In any case, whatparison the price of Australian sugar, ever they are to-day they were in 1931, produced by white labour, will compare yet the honourable member for West Sydfavorably with that in any part of the ney remained silent, when, by raising his world. The price in the United States of voice, he could have saved the people America is about the same as it is in from what he now calls exploitation. London, and, expressed in terms of When he and his followers joined forces Australian currency, is about 3^d. per lb. It is sold at that price because black-grown sugar from Hawaii and the Philippines is admitted free of duty. We cannot afford the luxury of permitting black-grown sugar from P i j i or elsewhere to come into -Australia. The sugar industry is an integral part of our national life. The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) states that there is "" nee'd for immediate legislation to prevent the further exploitation of the people of Australia by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company"". I direct the attention of honourable members to the fact that the honourable member for West Sydney was himself a member of the Government which in 1931 was responsible for the appointment of a committee to inquire into the Substantially the sugar industry. It is true that he resigned from the Ministry on the 4th March, before the agreement approved by that committee was tabled, but he was still a member of the House. He knew the terms of that agreement, which were substantially the same as in the present agreement, but he did not raise his voice against it. As the honourable member is uot easily deterred from expressing hiB opinions, we can assume that he heartily endorsed the agreement. In fact the agreement passed on the voices and evoked no criticism; only three just men in the House raised their voices against it.

But as I have pointed out they have not made excessive profits out of their Australian business since the first BUgar agreement in 1915. What is the position of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company under the agreement? The refining charge is £2 3s. 9<L a ton, which covers the cost of packages, time and refinery workers' wages. Ten years ago the charge was £3 a ton, but each ypar, according to the actual output of sugar, local and export, no less costs certified by the Auditor-General for Queensland, that charge has been reviewed. received more than 20s. a ton which nets it 15s. 9d. a ton. After providing for depreciation, which is set down at 4s 3d., the company is left with an annual allowance of 15s. 9d. a ton and that is all it gets. amounts to l-12d. per lb on refined sugar sold in Australia. Does the honourable member say that that is exploitation of the people? If the company were paid nothing the price of sugar would be l-12d. per lb. less! The honourable member spoke of monopolies. Insofar as raw sugar is concerned, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company iB not a monopoly. It has only eight' raw-sugar mills out of a total of 37 in New South Wales and Queensland. Insofar as its refining business is concerned, although it is by far the greatest operator, it has not a complete monopoly. In any case, however, its profits in Australia are limited to 15s. 9d. a ton. It is quite true, as the Leader of the Opposition pointed out, that it makes great profits, but it does not make them in Australia. We have not jurisdiction over the profits it makes outside Australia. It has been stated to me that at least half the profits of the company are made outside Australia altogether. As the Leader of the Opposition pointed out, these profits have been swollen in recent years, because of the £3 preference given by Great Britain on colonial sugar grown by black labour over dominion sugar grown by white labour. I have pointed out that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company gets 20s. a ton for refining which, after allowing for depreciation, leaves it worth 15a. 9d. net. The company makes a charge of 7s. 5d. a ton for interest on the funds provided by it to finance the purchase of the raw sugar crop of Australia. The position in 1931 was that the export surplus which then was 40 per cent, of the whole-thoug h it is now nearer 50 per cent -amounte d to 350,000 tons. The company financed the whole of that, advancing the capital necessary to carry on the business. This involved the use of capital amounting to £1,500,000, while for the whole of the than £7,000,000 capital is involved. On this the company received, in 1931, 4£ The company has never per cent, for the use of its money. The charge of 7s. 5d. a ton covers the interest on the capital provided by the company to finance the purchase of the crop. If the company did not finance the crop in this way, we That should have to finance it through the banks, and while the rate of interest paid to the company in 1931 was 4 j per cent., the arrangement is that the rate of interest shall fall with the bank rates pari passu. The interest paid to the company is always i per cent, less than the rate at which the money could be obtained from the banks. The industry is thus financed at lower rates than would otherwise be possible, the company's profit is strictly limited, and the consumer gets sugar at a reasonable rate.

120,Mr Hughes,"The conditions in the only one in Australia which is completely stabilized; arrangements have been made to cover every phase of its operations. It ensures to the workers decent wages and conditions, and to the cane-growers reasonable prices for their cane, while the community is protected from exploitation. the workers every time a claim goes before the court. ber does not know what he is talking about. He seems to assume that until he came upon the scene the interests of the workers were grossly neglected. May I remind him that there have been Labour governments in the past which have been at least as earnest and sincere on behalf of the workers as the honourable member is himself. One such Government pioneered this agreement and laid it on the solid and enduring foundaAustralia, and the honourable member's tions of decent wages and working conditions for white employees. The present agreement repeats substantially the terms of the 1915 agreement which laid down that the workers were to receive a wage fixed by the Arbitration Court, which wage was to remain constant during the period of the agreement. We have here a great primary industry which has been so encouraged that, whereas when the agreement was first entered into, Australia imported at least half of the sugar teen years ago, and has been receiving consumed here, we now produce all the sugar for our own requirements and export an almost similar quantity. The industry has flourished under the agreement. Now it is suggested that we should put the axe to the root of it, because of something the Colonial Sugar Refining Company has been doing. Whatever the company is doing now, it has been doing for very nearly as long as the honourable member for West Sydney has been alive, yet this is the first time he has raised his voice against it. an agreement, which was substantially a replica of the present one, was laid on the table of the House by the Labour Government. We must assume that he approved of it, and the company was doing then precisely as it is doing now. Evidently the honourable member now finds himself haunted by the ghost of his own past misdeeds, and so he comes along and reads to us a document of interminable length which emanated probably from a discharged employee of the company or which was obtained surreptitiously from some other source. The fact is, however, that this is a great industry; and the Colonial Sugar Refining Company does not exploit the people of Australia. If it makes excessive profits it does not make them out of the Australian people. The people of Australia obtain their sugar at a reasonable price, and have the satisfaction of knowing that they are not living on the products of sweated labour as some people in this country and even in this House would like to see them doing. The sugar which we eat in Australia is a product of good honest white labour, and I am surprised that the honourable member should take the stand that he has taken. It is certain that the company is not exploiting the people of arguments therefore fall to the ground. I shall leave to my colleague the task of dealing with the point raised by the Leader of the Opposition as to what reforms may be necessary in the way of taxation, but as far as exploiting the people of Australia is concerned, I wish to make it clear that the company is receiving nothing more how in the way of remuneration than it received nineever since. Minister for Health( Mr Hughes) has not answered any of the points brought forward by the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley). He has side-tracked the whole issue. He said that the honourable member for West Sydney had failed to raise any objection to the renewal of the agreement in 1931, but the honourable member had no knowledge at that time that the company was accumulating £7,000,000 of unrevealed He sat silent when reserves. As was pointed out by the honourable member for Perth( Mr Nairn), what the company is doing amounts to legalized robbery, and the practice has been legalized by successive governments for years. We have nothing to say against the sugar-farmers, because we believe that the company is exploiting the farmers of Queensland and northern New South",35,Australian Cruiser Deliberate Fraud Perpetrated At The Ex

123,Mr Garden (Cook) [5.20],"TheWales, just as it is exploiting the public as a whole. The fact remains, that a sum of £7,000,000 is to be distributed in the form of bonus shares, and yet the Minister says that there has been no exploitation. I can remember when the Minister would have been loud in condemnation of the company for such practices, but to-day it is a different story. He has been converted by the other side. We believe in the white labour policy, but the white labour employed on the sugar-fields in Australia has been robbed to enable the company to amass this sum of £7,000,000, aud we raise our voices in protest against it. In 1913, the Minister for Health spoke in the strongest terms against the exploitation practised by the coal vend and the sugar monopoly, and said that something would have to be done about it . We on this side of the House desire to protect white labour, but we have also a duty to protect the people from exploitation. ""We believe that the process of refining sugar should be nationalized, because sugar is an important staple food, and the industry is one which lends itself to nationalization. Let us consider who are some of the shareholders in this company. First there is the Knox family, which holds 40,000 shares of a nominal value of £800,000, but of a market value of £3,204,000. Then there is the Faithfull family, owning 11,000 shares of an initial value of £229,000, and of the market value of £889,000. The Stephen family group owns 3,500 shares, of which the issue price was £70,000, but of which the present market value is £280,000. The Fairfax family has 3,341 shares of a nominal value of £66,000, but the present market value is £267,000. Is it any wonder that the Fairfax family can, through ministerial process, get legislation passed that will protect such a company, by means of the amendment introduced by the Assistant Treasurer ( Mr Casey) ?

Minister must accept what the honourable member for Cook declares he said. His remarks are not unparliamentary. the Fairfaxes, who have a newspaper and publishing company, do not fail to use the influence and might of their journal to induce the legislative forces of this country to support the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, seeing that it is in their own interests to do so? Having such a deep interest in tha company, this family will do all in its power to enable this legalized robbery to continue. The Kater family group has about 3,000 shares, the value of which has been increased in similar proportion. The five families to which I have referred have a majority holding in shares of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and dominate its affairs. The total number of shares held between them is 60,000, the value of which was formerly £1,216,000, but now is £4,867,000. Is it any wonder that these families, with such power arrayed on their side, are able to got their mouthpieces on the other side of the chamber to put forward the policy that suits them? The honourable member for West Sydney asked the Government to take legislative action to prevent the Colonial Sugar Refining Company from giving bonus shares to such an enormous amount as £7,000,000.

Yet the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, in the midst of depression, when we have hundreds of thousands of men idle, but willing to work, is found to have £7,000,000 hidden in reserves, of which nobody had any knowledge even when the sugar agreement of 1931 was made. As the right honourable member for North Sydney remarked, nobody knew it. But to get out of it the company has made a magnificent gift to its shareholders, who are mainly composed of five families in New South Wales. The money with which that has been done was filched from the people of this country. The agreement has been beneficial, in a measure, to the growers, but we desire the Government to come to the aid of the people. The public of Western Australia, South Australia and Victoria are complaining of the toll which this company is taking from them. surer) [S.30] -It is neither my purpose nor my duty to defend or attack this company. I propose to confine my remarks to that portion of the speech of the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) which concerns principally myself, or, at any rate, refers to the share became law bonus shares should be subI had in introducing the amending In rome Tax Assessment Bill towards the end of the last Parliament. The honourable member asked what proportion of the £7,000,000 now being capitalized has gone to the Federal Taxation Department, and whether any portion of it should have been taken by the department as excess war-time profits. He went on to refer to an amendment which I introduced after the introduction of the original amending bill, and he quoted some remarks of mine correctly. PerhapsI might be allowed to remind honourable members of the circumstances prevailing at that time. Before the amending bill was introduced, certain privileges were attachable to bonus shares, in that a company rould make issues of such shares and have some concessions in respect of those issues that were different and over and above concessions granted respecting dividends. Before the amending act was passed, these concessions provided that bonus shares issued out of funds arising from capital profits, non-assessable income from property, pre-1922 income and what is known as Section 21 profits should be free of taxation to shareholders. The Royal Commission on Taxation sat for over eighteen months and produced three very valuable reports. Tbe recommendations contained in the first two of these were largely implemented by the amending bill brought down towards the end of tlie last Parliament to simplify federal income tax assessments. The commission recommended that, in order to achieve simplification and consistency, bonus shares should be treated in all respects in the same manner as dividends. Further, the commission suggested that consideration might be given to the fixing of a time limit after which dividends paid from the sources spoken of might be taxable in the hands of the shareholders. When the royal commission submitted this recommendation it thought that it would be implemented in the form of an amending act before the end of 1933. But, owing to the pressure of more urgent government business, that was not possible, and the bill was not introduced until six months ago. Under the original bill it was set out that from the time when the measure ject io the diminished privileges. After the second-reading speech and before the committee stage the Government allowed about three weeks to pass during which the measure remained on the table in the hands of honourable members and the public. During that period, I remind honourable members, the Government, and I in particular, received an enormous number of representations on almost every clause in the bill from all sections of the community and from all parts of Australia. All those requests were carefully considered with the help of the royal commission itself, and particularly Mr E. V. Nixon, a member of the commission, to whom I now tender my thanks. He was the Government's principal adviser in the matter, and his assistance was most valuable. All the representations submitted to the Government were rejected, except one or two. On the 27th July, when speaking in committee, I made reference to the amendment which was accepted in respect of bonus shares.",37,Australian Cruiser Deliberate Fraud Perpetrated At The Ex

I am not attributing any personal responsibility to him in this for North Sydney spoke of this "" poor "" matter, but no matter how he may quote from the royal commission's report in support of his case, the fact remains that years ago during the hearing of cases in after legislation was framed to make the tax on bonus shares applicable as from June, 1934, by an amendment moved by the honourable gentleman this period was extended to the 31st December, and during that extended period the shareholders of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company were allowed to make themselves a present of £7,000,000, free of taxation. No quotation by the honourable gentleman can alter that fact. I notice that the Assistant Treasurer did not read to the House the thousands of requests which he said were ""made to the Government askI contend that in its operations in Ausing that the proposed taxation on bonus shares be modified. It would have been very interesting to hear those representalic, but also the sugar-growers and the tions. Possibly the honourable gentleman's reference to these matters is in line with his talk about the banks having vaults bursting with money. Representations on this matter, he said, came from interests all over the Commonwealth. He did not say that among these requests was one from the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. But as it is the only company we know of to have received any advantage as a result of the postponeoperated, one naturally comes to the conclusion that the major representation and influence exercised on the Government in this matter came from the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, possibly in the shape of a threat, by the Sydney Morning Herald, that if the company's request was not granted the usual support for the Government would not be forthcoming in the elections then approaching-ther e might be a falling off in the contributions to party funds. On the other hand, the company might have exercised direct influence with the Government as happened in connection with the Coal Vend Case, in which the honourable gentleman, who was then member for West Sydney, figured as a stalwart advocate of the rights of the people, and in which the family most interested was the Knox family, so prominently associated with the Colonial Sugar Refining company. To-day the right honourable member company. This reminds ns of the plea that other big companies put up some which they were interested in the Arbitration Court. They claimed that their profits were so small that they could not afford to pay higher wages. When they were compelled to produce their books in Court the President of the Court told every one of their representatives that they had committed perjury. No doubt the same judgment could be applied to the plea of poverty now being made on behalf of this company.

In each instance, they have been buoyed up by the thought that something would be done for them by this Government, so that they would be able, at least, to purchase many little things that are usually provided round about Christmas time. Within the last few days, these men, in some instances, have reached what one might describe as a stage of desperation. Eor a long time, they have been associated with State schemes providing for one week in three weeks, or two in five. The Government must admit that this is a very paltry contribution to those who are dependent upon works of this kind to secure the necessities of life. One hundred and seventy-six thousand pounds, to be spread over the whole of Australia, is all the relief that the Commonwealth Government is prepared to give to those in need of assistance prior to Christmas. I do not like to say it, but it is an insult to the men, having regard to the circumstances in which they are placed. Every honourable member outside the Cabinet itself expected something more than this from the Government. The Prime Minister( Mr Lyons), in his policy speech, clearly said that he was satisfied that the responsibility of meeting unemployment could no longer be left to the States. He said that the Commonwealth would have to shoulder it, and that his Government had definite schemes to put into operation. Honourable members supporting the Government, many of whom secured a large parcel of votes because of that undertaking on the part of the Prime Minister, must be as disappointed as we are with this bill. I am trying to be as impartial as possible, and I cannot adequately express my feelings. Like many others, I represent an electorate where unemployment is so rife, and the position of the men so bad, that the requests made to us are, to say the least of it, very touching. I was under the impression that I should be able, at the end of the week, to go back to these men and say ""Report immediately to the Works Director at the Customs House, and you will find something real provided for you by the Commonwealth"". When interviewed by men out of work, during the last two and a half or three Ur. Beasley. ' years, we have had to say that the responsibility of finding employment was that of the States. We have had to dismiss our own constituents with a wave of a hand, so to speak, saying that nothing could be done for them by the Commonwealth, because the responsibility, it was said by the Government, did not belong to the Commonwealth. And now, after the declaration of the Prime Minister that the responsibility could no longer be left to the States, we have submitted to us a bill providing merely for the expenditure oi £176,000, which is to cover the whole Commonwealth. There is no need for me to go into details. Every honourable member knows just how far that amount will go. Passing on to the works set out in the schedule, I am anxious to know just how the labour that will be required is to be recruited. I had a little knowledge of the handling of moneys in this connection when I was associated with another Government. ferring to an incident which probably has provoked the honourable member's "" hear, near"". That, for the moment, may be dismissed. The point I am dealing with is very important. I should like to be informed how the department is going to discriminate so that those who have had no work will actually get the employment for which this bill provides, and what form of registration is going to be set up. Sitting suspended from 6.1 B to 8 p.m. ing speech the Assistant Treasurer, referring to the distribution of this money, said that it is proposed to expend £12,000 in the Federal Capital Territory, £4,000 in the Northern Territory and £6,000 in the northern parts of New South Wales for the provision of dips in connection with the control of cattle tick. Honourable members are most anxious to know what other allocations of funds are to be made.

The next points upon which I desire to be reassured are the methods of recruiting labour and the conditions of employment of those who will benefit. Honourable members on this side are anxious that the conditions attaching to relief work shall not apply but that award rates and conditions shall prevail in respect of the employed in Tasmania and also the hundreds ployment to be given. I should also like to know from the Minister whether the work is to be controlled by the Department of the Interior or by the department for which the work is to be performed. Undoubtedly there will be some work done for the Postal Department, or for the Health Department-for instance, the improvement of quarantine stations -and honourable members should be informed as to which department will control tbe expenditure. In the past it has been customary for the Works Department to undertake work of this nature with labour recruited by the Works Directors in the capital cities. My colleagues representing country constituencies are anxious to ascertain if it is of the people of TasmaniaI enter an emproposed to absorb the unemployed from outside the city areas.

Only recently I received a letter from the residents of Bunbury, a very large town in Western Australia, stating that clearing had been commenced on the landing ground tbere, but owing to shortage of funds tbe work had not been proceeded with and the ground was reverting to its original condition. Much grubbing and clearing of trees is necessary to be done in order to make the landing ground safe. Is it proposed to include such work in the schedule of works to be undertaken under this measure? am not bursting with enthusiasm for the supervision of the works to the State plans which have been put forward by Government.

But the amount provided under this bill is so infinitesimal that it would be necessary to use a microscope to see what Tasmania is to get out of it. If the Minister expects to assist the unemof thousands of persons who are out of work in other parts of Australia by the provision of only £170,000 for works, he does not know his job. The evil is of such magnitude that only the expenditure of millions of pounds could appreciably mitigate it. In Hobart alone, 900 men are on the dole. How much will be given to each of these unfortunates who have been promised a measure of Christmas relief? At most this miserable sum will provide only a week's work. It is just as well that the unemployed cannot come to Canberra; if they were to do so they would quickly compel Ministers to display a little more enthusiasm and earnestness in tackling this great problem. On behalf phatic protest against the shoddy policy of the Commonwealth Government. If the Government submitted a reasonable scheme of relief the unemployed would appreciate that it was doing its best, but if this miserable pittance that is now offered is the best the Government can do, the sooner it makes way for an administration more capable, the better it will be for the unemployed and the community generally. The Minister speaks about looking after the ticks. intended. done for the unemployed of Tasmania? Is it intended to give them tick ?

179,South Wales Labour Party ( Mr Beas,"suggest that the Commonwealth should shoulder all responsibility. the Premier of Tasmania acknowledges his and his Government's obligations to do something for the unemployed in that State prior to Christmas. State governments are spending progressively increasing amounts on works. This should be taken into consideration by honourable members when discussing proposals brought forward by this Government. Commonwealth has already appropriated £4,273,000 for works expenditure for 1934-35. Of that amount £2,419,000 will be provided out of revenue, and £1,854,000 out of loan. Last week a loan bill for £5,000,000 was brought down by the Assistant Treasurer ( Mr Casey). Some part of that amount undoubtedly will be utilized to provide employment iii some shape or form. The leader of the New South Wales Labour party asked if the works to be put in hand under this bill would be carried out by contract or day labour. Obviously, in the limited time available, it is impossible for tenders to be prepared for much of the contemplated work. Therefore, although the policy of the Government is to have work done by contract, much of this work will necessarily have to be done by day labour, which will be supervised by officers of tbe works branch, with the exception that work in connection with war service homes will be carried out by the War Service Homes Commission. The Commonwealth Works Director will, at his discretion, utilize State labour bureaux for recruiting labour required. The Government is adopting this course because the various State governments have efficient machinery for this work and in most cases the bureaux are linked up with organizations dealing with unemployment relief and food relief. thei'e are thousands of unemployed who are not registered with the State Labour Bureau. Works Director will not be restricted to that avenue in obtaining the labour required. There is no doubt that the State machinery is thoroughly efficient. Surely nothing about the State Labour Bureau in New South Wales. deal about the labour bureaux in some of the other States. They are quite efficient and provide adequate safeguards against imposition. If more money had been provided it would have been impossible to utilize the whole of it in the limited time available between now and I remind them that the Christmas. While a substantial proportion of the amount to be expended will be used for painting public buildings, a considerable sum will be set aside for work which will give employment to unskilled labourers, who are suffering more acutely than skilled artisans. For example, of the £12,000 to be expended in the Federal Capital Territory £10,000 will be for road construction, which requires mainly unskilled labour. Reference was made by the leader of the New South Wales Labour party to the rates of pay. I remind him that the practice is to pay award rates prevailing at the time in the respective States. the amounts to be expended in the various States? ture contemplated in the various States is as follows:-Ne w South Wales, £65,185; Victoria, £42,432; Queensland, £22,852; South Australia, £12,878; Western Australia, £10,702; Tasmania, £5,951; Federal Capital Territory, £12,000; Northern Territory, £4,000. to discriminate between labour provided by State labour exchanges in view of the fact that the amount to be made available is not sufficient to provide employment for anything like the number of men who will be offering? leave that matter to the Works Director to decide in the various States. It is impossible to do as the honourable member suggests-to set up Commonwealth machinery to recruit labour in the States.

I doubt whether the Assistant Treasurer would use such miraculous powers if he had them. At any rate, he would think twice before doing so. The actions of the Government reflect discredit, if not disgrace, upon it in view of the boasting of government candidates during the election campaign about the extensive unemployment policy that had been prepared. Actually, government representatives have shown that they sought the suffrages of the people under false pretences. A former member for Warringah, Sir Granville Ryrie, frequently UBed the expression ""sold a pup."" The people of Australia, through the return of thia Government, have been sold a whole litter of pups. The Assistant Treasurer said that £4,000.000 had been provided for public works this nnancial year, but a former Parliament, of which I was a member, provided more than £20,000,000 in one year for unemployment relief. As a matter of fact, this Government is not providing £10 for every million pounds that it promised to make available. It received a mandate from the people to put into operation a comprehensive programme for the relief of unemployment, and, as it has failed to do so, it is definitely holding the Senate will not meet until Wednesoffice under false pretences. The honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) has referred to the Minister for the Interior as a Santa Claus and a very Scotch one; but I do not know whether he is entitled to even that questionable compliment, for the money that is being provided will do practically nothing to bring cheer to the unemployed before Christmas.

Minister for the Interior stands by the statement of his colleague the Assistant Treasurer. viding this work will be that many the honourable of the men who accept it will lose their right to the relief work provided by the State Governments. That will certainly be the. case in Queensland where a married man with five children who is now entitled to four days work a week for £3 will be entitled to a similar period of work again before Christmas. When we were dealing with the loan bill last week,, the Assistant Treasurer said that it was only the forerunner of other measures to provide money for the relief of unemployment before Christmas. The Deputy Leader of the Government (Dr. Earle Page) and the Assistant Treasurer both stated in Sydney a few days ago that the Government was making provision to absorb a large number of unemployed men for several weeks before Christmas, but even at the time that statement was made we were only four and a half weeks from Christmas. The introduction of this bill bears out the statements made last week by honourable members of the Opposition. We have been asked to expedite the passage of the measure, and we know that the Government is anxious to complete the business of the House early this week so that honourable members may attend certain functions in Sydney connected with the visit of His Royal Highness the Duke of Gloucester; but even if we passed the bill immediately it could not become law before next week because day next. What care the members of that chamber for the unemployed? In view of the promises made by the members of the Government during the election campaign that a comprehensive scheme for the relief of unemployment would be submitted to Parliament without delay we may fairly accuse the Government of only tinkering with the problem. Some of the State governments have attempted to provide relief work for the unemployed but there are States in which single men are not considered in any degree. Within the last few days 143,000 children have sat for the leaving examination in New South Wales. Fifty thousand sat in Sydney alone. What is to happen to these young people when they leave school?

The primary producers are unable to dispose of their products at a profit because the reduced purchasing power of the people has restricted markets.

It is a shameful effort on the part of a government which has relieved the wealthy of £10,000,000 of taxation to provide only one week's work to those who have experienced real want for four or five years. This Government, which prates about prosperity and of saving our national honour, has little regard for the needs of over 300,000 starving people.

No less than £6,000 is to be spent on cattle dips in northern New South Wales, practically all in the electorate of Cowper. As much is to be spent by the Government in that direction as is to be provided for the unemployed in the whole of Tasmania. Yet we are told that a fair and equitable distribution of the money is proposed. The Assistant Treasurer ( Mr Casey) said that plans for this work are now in hand. I trust that the Government will show more expedition in the spending of this money than was displayed in November, 1931, when £69,600 or £4,000 more than on the present occasion, was allocated to the Works Department in New South Wales; of that amount only £48,000 had been expended by February, 1932. I am concerned as to the manner in which the present vote is to be distributed. The Minister for the Interior( Mr provided the labour for the job, could Paterson) said that the work would be given out through the Labour Bureau in each State. As was pointed out by the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr( Mr Parkhill), who was then Minister Lazzarini), if that happens most of the money will be spent in metropolitan districts. It is of no use for the Government to pretend that it will be in a position to decide how the money is to be distributed. made in the past, the money was spent in accordance with the directions of the State authorities. works. ties will lay down the conditions under which the wojk shall be done, but this Parliament has a right to say whether the slave-driving conditions imposed by the New South Wales Government should be permitted. There are thousands of unemployed in New South Wales, who, under the unemployment regulations, cannot register at the State Labour Bureau, and those who are not registered cannot receive food relief or work for the dole and will, therefore, be excluded from this appropriation. oan register. sands of men in New South Wales who will be unable to participate in this work. The Commonwealth authorities provided £24,000 for the building of the repatriation cottages at Callan Park, and the Works Department of the State erected the buildings. When the Minister for Repatriation sought to impose certain labour conditions, he was politely informed by the State Minister for Works that if the State department was to do the job, it would have to lay down the labour conditions. Although the Commonwealth Government provided the money, the State Government carried out the job under relief work conditions. With the money voted to the Works Department in New South Wales on the last occasion, certain work was done at the Mascot aerodrome, where some thousands of pounds were spent in levelling the grounds. I discovered that the Commonwealth Works Department, which give no indication as to the possibility of men securing work there. On questioning the honourable member for Warringah for the Interior, I found that all the labour had been drawn from the old South Sydney electorate, which was represented by a supporter of the Government. The next undertaking, that at Oallan Park, When similar votes were happened to be in the Dalley electorate, and the Minister for Repatriation assured me that the same conditions regarding the call-up would apply to that job as to the work at Mascot. The first call-up was for bricklayers, from Burwood and Strathfield, which are at the extreme end of the electorate of the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Marr), and 10 miles away from the job. The second and third call-ups were in the same electorate, and not until all the men offering at the labour bureau in that electorate had been called up could the unemployed in other electorates receive work on that job. This gives an idea of the way work has been distributed by the Government in the last two years. Now we find that £6,000 will be spent on cattle dips, and the vast majority, if not all of it, is to go to the electorate of tbe right honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page).

218,Mr Rosevear,"There are thoupatronage, I should like to know what is. 1 hope that honourable members opposite, who sheltered behind the promises of the Prime Minister at the elections, will show on this occasion that they consider the present vote inadequate as a contribution towards the £10,000,000 which was promised for the relief of unemployment. According to the latest figures available from the Statistician's Department, there are Australia; but the Statistician admits that those figures represent only 53 per cent, of the trade unions. It would be safe to double that figure, and say that 184,000 trade unionists alone are unemployed in Australia to-day. to that number the thousands of unorganized workers who are out of work, it may be said that at least 250,000 persons have no jobs. Any person who has two days' work, or more, in any week is regarded by the Statistician as fully employed. Among those 250,000 men the Government will spend £176,000. It proposes an unfair distribution of the miserable sum that it is offering, and it has not given an adequate explanation as to the class of works, the localities in which they are to be done and the manner in which the men are to be called up. Unless a more definite and workable scheme is provided, much of this money may be filched from the unemployed by the Stevens Government in New South Wales. Whilsti t is a matter for regret that Ausfact is demonstrated by a study of factralia has so many unemployed, I am afraid that a great deal of what has been said in this debate has been prompted, by a desire for political rather than by a genuine desire to help the workless. Glancing at the Estimates introduced this year, I notice that the federal authorities are spending on works £2,40.0,000 from revenue, and £1,650,000 from loan money. A further loan of £200,000 was launched a few days ago, and, in addition to those sums, we have this further vote of £176,000, which means that a total of £4,400,000 is to be provided by the Government for public works. go to the unemployed. be greatly benefited. I suppose no country has less evidence of poverty than has Australia, and in no part of the world has more been done by governmental authorities to relieve unemployment. I fully sympathize with those who are out of work'; I understand the hardships they suffer. But undoubtedly the Government has done admirable work in relieving the position. Questions have 92,000 unemployed in been asked to-night a3 to how the money is to be expended. I hope, at any rate, that this Government will not resort to a policy similar to that adopted by the Western Australian Labour Government which insisted that before a man could Adding draw sustenance relief he must become a member of a recognized trade union; by their payment of fees to trade unions the unemployed were compelled to help in the political work of the Labour party. New South Wales would not give any work to an unemployed man unless he joined a union. respect became so pronounced in Western Australia that the sustenance workers formed a union of their own. Even then, however, they were refused employment, unless they joined a recognized union, principally the Australian Workers Union. Australia is confronted with great economic difficulties, but when we consider the causes of unemployment we must recognize that the conditions from which we are suffering to-day have resulted from our own actions. This tory employment in Australia. In 1929 there were 450,482 persons employed in factories, whereas in 1932, in spite of all propaganda the promises of increased employment, and the assistance that was given to industry, that figure had dropped to 336,658, which represents a decrease of nearly 114,000. is taking figures for years to suit himself.

The honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan) referred to the reduction of the protection given to the banana industry. I remind the honourable member that if we do not trade with other countries they will not trade with us; and if the sales of our primary produce decline, there is less demand in Australia for the output of our factories. A mistaken tariff policy is one of the main reasons for our unemployment position to-day. It is all very well to suggest the expenditure of £10,000,000 or £100,000,000 for the purpose of relieving unemployment; a similar scheme was tried in Germany and it failed. Unless we can trade with other peoples, and bring into the country wealth from abroad we cannot create employment. During the period I referred to immense duties were imposed, and when they failed, absolute embargoes were proclaimed. Can any honourable member advance any other reason why the number of unemployed in our factories decreased by nearly 114,000 during the period for which I have quoted figures? There can be only one reason: with a decrease in the value of our exports less credit is created in this country, with the result that our people have less purchasing power to keep the factories going. It is a pity that we have followed that policy vested interests economic truths. opposite are very critical of this bill, but T am of the opinion that the Government has made a very generous effort by providing a total of about £4,440,000 for direct unemployment relief, and public works which will absorb a large number of the unemployed. No honourable member desires to see extensive unemployment in this country. Of course, there will always be a certain percentage of unemployed no matter what the circumstances are. We know, however, that at the present time the percentage of unemployed is very great indeed; and I feel sure that it is the desire of all honourable members that something should be done to bring back to Mr Gregory. this country some of the prosperity it enjoyed in the old days. In the last three years the Government has made a big advance in dealing with this problem, and it should be given credit for its efforts in that direction. I am not slow to criticize the Government for its actions in other directions, but I have not the slightest doubt that since it assumed office there has been a decided change for the better, due to the restoration of confidence. Honourable members opposite may laugh, but the men engaged in the building trade appreciate the fact that increased work is available for them at good wages. One cannot fail to notice the increased activity in the building trade in Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth, and other places. In all my experience in connection with unemployment, I have never been so disappointed as I have been to-night with the proposals put forward by the Government. This bill is to grant from the Consolidated Revenue the sum of £176,000 for expenditure on certain works and services. The intention behind tbe grant is good, but it is clear that neither this Government nor this House is prepared to face tbe problem of unemployment as Australia faced the cataclysm of war. War is murder, and the greatest curse of mankind. The second greatest curse is unemployment, but no government has yet faced the problem as it should be faced, namely, by recognizing the right of every in recent years, but man to work, and abolishing unemployare stronger than ment-a n objective which could be Honourable members achieved if we faced this problem as we would face the problem of war. I do not wish it to be said that I do nothing but criticize the Government, because I do not blame it entirely for our present difficulties; I blame the whole of Parliament. There is a stTong body of opinion in this House, the larger portion of which, perhaps, is on this side of the chamber, that we should be prepared to go to any extreme to remove this curse of humanity. It is all very well to provide two days' work a week, or three days' work a week. Good heavens, this world was not created for the workers to have two days' employment a week. It was created that men and women might multiply, and enjoy the fruits of the soil. I",55,Second Reading
226,Dr. Maloney (Melbourne) [9.38],"defy any honourable mtmber to show me that in Australia to-day there is not enough food produced for every, person in Australia to have a sufficient portion; yet willing to work. Let us ration Australia we know that, at the present time, there are men, women, and little children in this country who are suffering from lack of food. The various medical departments of the States and the Commonwealth will confirm my statement that if & of silver currency. In England to-day, child is not properly fed in its earlier years it will never grow into a strong adult. I have two suggestions to make to the Government in this matter. First, why should we not ration the food of this country, following the example of England, which, during the war, provided every one of its citizens with food? Its people in that period certainly did not nave luxuries, but every citizen was guaranteed sufficient food insofar as it was within the power of the Government to provide it. Sufficient food is produced in this country for the satisfaction of every man, woman, and child of our people, and even if that were not so we could produce more and more until that demand could be met. Have honourable gentlemen forgotten tbe appeal that was made throughout the length and breadth of Australia some years ago, "" Grow more wheat"". responded to that appeal and produced more wheat, but what was the result? Many of them have since lost their farms because they have been unable to pay interest to the banks. Let us ration our food so that it will be made available to every human in this country in sufficient quantities. As a medical man, I know that it is essential that food should be supplied in adequate quantities, and at a fair value to every citizen. That is not being done to-day. Throughout my life, I have tried to cultivate happiness, but latterly my life has been rendered miserable by tbe many appeals which I have received, mostly from women, to help them secure employment for their children as they leave school. Similarly, I have received appeals from men whose hands are getting soft because such a long time has elapsed since they last worked. Theso men should have the right to work. Naturally, I have no time for the man who is able to work, and will not. I agree with the passage in tbe Bible, "" If any would not work, neither should he eat"". I am speaking for men who are with the abundance of food that God, through nature, yields to us. My second proposition to the Government is that it should take full advantage silver currency has been reduced more than at any time in the history of silver, except in the 37th year of the reign of Henry VIII . of anything but glorious memory. In the reign of King Edward, the half-crowns in circulation were almost of pure silver, the ratio of silver in those coins being 920 in every 1,000 parts. Our Australian silver to-day is minted practically in the same proportion-92 5 parts out of 1,000. In England during the war, a fiduciary issue of £300,000,000 was circulated without any backing whatever. In that period the silver content of the coins was in the proportion of 500 parts in every 1,000. If we issued our silver on that basis this sum of £176,000 would make in absolute silver currency over £968,000. These figures are based on information supplied in this House in answer to questions and have been checked by officials in The farmers nobly the Treasury and the statistical branch. Silver to the value of £176,000 will, if coined into florins, shillings, sixpences, &c, make £968,000. No working man or woman will refuse wages paid in silver. I appeal to the Government to issue an order to the Mint to go ahead with the minting of silver as fast as it can, and the banks should be compelled to advance silver for the payment of wages, &c. Of all the Premiers in Australia, only two were prepared to acknowledge the benefit of this proposal. One was Sir James Mitchell, Premier of Western Australia, who said to me that it was a very good idea, and that I should ask the Government to adopt the proposal at once. The other was Mr John Lang, of Sydney, who said that if he had had the power he would commence minting silver immediately. England had shown us an example in this regard, and we should follow it. The members of this Parliament seem to be growing more and more lethargic as time goes on, but if they continue merely to tax the people out of their homes, and allow thousands to go hungry in the midst that the men were working harder than of plenty, they will be definitely failing they had any right to do in view of the in their duty, and I hope that some other conditions prevailing. party with more lofty ideals will arise, and sweep us into oblivion. disappointed that this grant is not larger. bill 13 under discussion.

232,Mr Makin,"And probably have theirI f tbe Government really wishes to make a gesture of goodwill to these unfortunate people, let it arrange that the grant be made directly to the women and children of the unemployed in order to provide clothing and other necessaries. Perhaps some honourable members have not mixed with the unemployed as I have. They do not know the deplorable conditions under which the unemployed live, or the pitiful efforts they make to help one another. It is always a case of the poor helping the poor. I have known of workers on intermittent employment imposing a levy on themselves in order to provide soup for little children attending the State schools. In some districts, there are committees, .the members of which go around begging the ingredients with which to make the soup, and also begging for left-off clothing. The conditions under which many of the unemployed are existing are a disgrace to civilization. On the Federal Government's own property at the Adamstown rifle range families are living in miserable camps constructed of bags and pieces of tin. Children are born there, and mothers have to wash their babies in basins out in the open in the middle of winter. Yet the Government has the effrontery to ask the unemployed to vote for it, promising them good jobs at steady wages. Now it is proposed to make a grant of money, which is to be spent by a State administration that has never shown any consideration for tbe unemployed, but which, on the contrary, has stood over them like a slave driver, forcing them, when on relief work, to work the harder. pointed out to the honourable member that he is not in order in criticizing tbe State administration. hand this money over to the State Labour Bureau to spend. Interior( Mr Paterson) said so. misunderstood the Minister. When speaking in reply, I shall explain how the money is to be spent. understood the honourable gentleman. I desire to know whether the works for which the bill makes provision are to be carried out directly by the Commonwealth through the works directors of the several States, as was done by the Scullin Government, and also whether several works that I have often advocated are to be undertaken? From time to time. I have asked for a grant to assist in clearing a civil aviation landing-ground at Cessnock. Many international aviators have recommended it and have declared that a splendid emergency landing-ground would in that way be provided. Such a work could be directly undertaken by the Commonwealth Government. Then again why should not the Commonwealth itself build shelters for the unemployed on some of its own properties? There is an area at The Nobbies which is controlled by the Federal Government and on which at present what are little better than kennels are being occupied by the unemployed. As a matter of fact they are such wretched hovels that some people would not allow even their dogs to occupy them. Yet they are considered to be good enough for the unfortunate unemployed. The Government might also build shelters for them at the Rutherford military camp. In my electorate there are 7,000 unemployed miners alone; approximately 20,000 men of various callings in the north are out of work. What help will £65,000 afford these people, let alone the whole of the State of New South Wales? It will give no real relief to them. It is time the Government, which is ready to give consideration to other sections of the community, did something to carry out its election promises to those without work. Why should it not honour its promise to deal effectively with the unemployment problem? The position of the wheat-farmerB undoubtedly is deplorable, but it is not so bad as that of the men who are out of work. Yet we find the Government prepared to raise millions for the relief of the wheat-farmer by means of a tax on the bread of the workless. A sum of £4,000,000 is to be raised in that way for the relief of the wheat-farmers, and supporters of the present Government also boast that taxation to the amount of £9,500,000 has been remitted.

239,Mr James,"I am sorry if I mispeople who paid that taxation as badly off as the unemployed! They were not. During the general election the Prime Minister said that unemployment was no longer a matter for the States alone but was the definite concern of the Commonwealth, and that his Government would co-operate with the States to relieve the situation. It was promised that committees would be set up in the several States and that a fully-fledged Commonwealth Minister would be placed in control of unemployment. It is time that the Government made a move in that direction. It promised that £20,000,000 would be raised for the relief of the unemployed. When is that promise to be redeemed? So far nothing has been done. Every effort should be made by the Government to fulfil these election promises. I, like many other honourable members, have had to contend against a steady agitation of the unemployed by men who claim that nothing can be accomplished by parliamentary action. Many people are beginning to believe that governments are powerless to do anything and that there is no hope of relief except by way of a short cut to revolution. Are the Government and their supporters going to close their eyes to the growth of communism, which is due to the fact that politicians, including Labour members in the past, have fooled the people from time to time, making promises they have never attempted to redeem? The day has past when that sort of thing can be done. If we are going to save the institution of parliamentary government, we must carry out our election promises. are to be made the football of politicsif promises given to them are not to be fulfilled-then revolution in this country. I make this statement in all sincerity, because I believe that many people are becoming desperate, and that unless effective relief of warships. Experts were brought measures are taken they will try to take out the law into their own hands in the very near future. campaign I challenged Communists to show how they could accomplish by revolutionary methods the objective they have in view. I pointed out again and again that nothing was to be gained by leading the workers, with nothing more Mr Jmmoan. than their bare fists, into combat against the armed forces of the State. They would be shot down and slaughtered. Order! in this way, because I know that the minds of the people are being agitated to such an extent that they are beginning to think that parliamentary action is nothing more than a farce, a fraud, and a sham. It is time that the Government took into consideration the seriousness of the situation. Why make such a miserable grant as that for which this bill provides? It is not even sufficient to provide for a pair of boots and a pair of socks for the whole of the unemployed. Why not make a direct grant to the women and children? The men can fend for themselves a little better than can the unfortunate women and children, for whom I am pleading, whose breadwinners, through no fault of their own, are unemployed. They are anxious and able to work, and work should be found for them. If a direct grant such as I have suggested were made, it would show on the part of this Government a genuine desire that these men should not be sweated, as they bave been under the unemployment relief system which is operating in New South Wales and other States. Let us give them a goodwill grants-somethin g that will provide Christmas cheer for the women and children of the unemployed of Australia. If the unemployed In adding my protest to the many that have been made against the inadequacy of this grant, I desire to strike a new note. we may expect a bloody The Government in the last Parliament and again in this has sent more work outside Australia than any of its predecessors did.

In that State a man cannot register for sustenance if one member of the family is earning 15s. a week, and a married man with a child earning £1 a week is not entitled to receive which nothing can stop, unless it be the sustenance or to be employed on relief work. Order! The honourable member must disous8 the question before the Chair. stated thai the work could be apportioned through the labour bureaux of the various States, and I am pointing out the osition of many men registered at the ureau in New South Wales. Such people cannot obtain work or sustenance because some member of the family is employed and earns a certain amount. But thousands of persons are registered with the Commonwealth works branch in New South Wales and in other States and I suggest to the Minister for the Interior that, instead of this work being apportioned through the employment bureaux in the States, the Commonwealth department should allocate it. The Minister has suggested the possibility of "" double banking "" but "" double banking "" is impossible because a man can only work in one job at a time. Last wees, when urging* the Government to honour its promise to provide £10,000,000 for the unemployed, we were told to keep quiet, because the Government intended to do something for the workless. But certain things have happened recently which honourable have placed Government supporters in an awkward position. A coalition government has been formed, dominated by the weaker party, and members of the United Australia party are now protesting because of the inclusion in the Ministry of certain persons who exercise a controlling power. It has been stated that the sum of £4,000,000 is to be provided to assist the wheat industry. We do not protest against anything being done for the farmers,but it is a standing disgrace to this Government and to this Parliament that the paltry sum of £176,000 is provided for the unemployed. The situation is becoming so desperate that I am very much afraid that at any time there may be a revolt against the Government, and its supporters will then realize that the danger point has been reached. The unemployed to-day are in a quandary. They look to the Government for relief, and if nothing is done for them there will arise within their ranks a spirit of ferment, loss of human life. It has been said that a great number of the unemployed are. unskilled workers, but among their number are thousands of skilled workers and professional men, including barristers and accountants, who are eager and willing to do anything. I am sure that every honourable member of the House is brought into contact with them. At the Commonwealth Bank buildings in Sydney hun-^ dreds of these men keep honourable members busy from 9 a.m. until 6 p.m. We grant them interviews and endeavour to do what is possible for them. The Government, however, can only provide what it terms this first instalment of £176,000 for their relief. I ask it to go further. The Minister said that there were indications that the loan of £10,000,000 recently floated would be fully subscribed. I ask the Government to make available before Christmas the £20,0,000 which it is proposed to expend on postal works out of the £10,000,000 loan.

Evidently this Government has the power of miracle-' working for it expects to feed hundreds and thousands of unemployed by an expenditure of £176,000. Last week, when honourable members sought to compel the Government to fulfil its promises to the unemployed, they were told to wait-that the Government bad something up its sleeve. But the dissensions within the Government itself have been clearly demonstrated by the fact that a former Minister, who was prepared to put into practice a policy designed to relieve the unemployed, ''has been relegated to a back bench because he objected to the unemployed being cast aside. Members of the Country party supporting the Government said, "" As the price of our support we must have £4,000,000 for the wheat-growers,"" and the only member of the Cabinet who demonstrated any interest in the unenv ployed, and had any policy for their betterment, was dropped from the Ministry, and is now so disgusted at this treatthe Old Country. able member must confine his remarks to the bill. make gifts of Australian lambs to the English people for their enjoyment at Christmas; next year we shall be sending them a gift of Lyons and Hughes!

The more I listen to honourable members opposite expounding the Government's policy for the relief of unemployment, the more I realize how farcical are its proposals. I repeat that to expect this Government to do anything for the unemployed is to anticipate a miracle. No difficulty is experienced by the Government in remitting taxes to wealthy people, but it finds extreme difficulty indeed in doing anything for the unemployed who, apparently, must be satisfied with the crumbs that fall from the rich man's table. I hope, however, that Government supporters will insist upon more adequate provision being made for the workless. If any honourable members opposite submit a proposal that the amount for Christmas relief be increased to £500,000, it will be heartily supported by this side of the House.",61,Second Reading

266,Mr Drakepord (Maribyrnong) By Honourable Members Who Sit On This,"means of practically nothing but propaganda. It made all sorts of promises, which the unemployed must now find were a delusion and a snare. If the help that the Government proposes to give is to be administered in homeopathic doses'it will do no good. Every honourable member would welcome proposals that would afford real relief. This Government has an obligation to the unemployed of Australia which cannot be ignored. It may be following the example set by the British Government, when it met its indebtedness abroad by a token payment. The proposed appropriation is nothing more than a token payment to the unemployed. I wish to emphasize that the £42,000 that it is proposed to spend in Victoria could be absorbed in my own electorate without giving anything like adequate relief. I do not know the character of the electorate of the honourable member for Swan, one of the few defenders of the Government. He could hardly have come into contact with the want and misery that exist in the majority of the electorates. Wherever one goes in the metropolitan areas, one cannot avoid coming into close contact with the privations of the people. I feel sure that the honourable member for Swan would not have uttered tbe sentiments that he expressed to-night had he first-hand knowledge of those conditions. realized that the patience that is being displayed can be tried too far. But the people will refuse to remain silent much longer, and may break the law in order to direct attention to their plight. I sincerely hope that that will not occur. On the hustings I , and honourable members sitting behind the Government, expressed the belief that all difficulties could be overcome by parliamentary action. The Government is doing nothing to justify the contentions, not only of its own supporters, but also of honourable members on this side of the House. Its lack of appreciation of the real position is fostering a disbelief in the parliamentary system of government. The measure of relief that it is offering is merely an insult to those who require assistance. It is exhibiting a callous disregard for the sufferings of the people, and retribution is bound to overtake it unless it makes much greater provision in the hear future. Like my colleagues, I protest against the inadequacy of this provision for the relief of unemployment. I was interested in the statement of the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) that the conditions in Australia are very much better than in any other part of the world. If the inference to be drawn from his remark that £4,000,000 is being made available by the Government for public works, is that that sum is to be devoted to the relief of unemployment, he has grossly misrepresented the facts. As other honourable members have pointed out, the expenditure of £176,000 will not provide one day's work for half of those who are unemployed to-day. Last week I listened with interest to the contribution which was made to the debate by several honourable members opposite. How can the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Stacey) lend his support to this proposal in view of his statement that it was necessary for the Government to make adequate provision for the unemployed? Even if the honourable member is satisfied with what the Government is doing, I am quite certain that his constituents will not be. The honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr John Lawson) said on Friday last that there was no greater danger to the United AusThe Government cannot have tralia party than the attitude which the Government is adopting in regard to unemployment.

It is apparent, therefore, that even honourable gentlemen opposite are not satisfied with what the Government is doing, and I also enter my emphatic protest against the inadequacy of these proposals. As an alderman of the City of SydneyI had some experience of unemployment relief work. For several years the Sydney City Council provided £3,000 annually for Christmas relief work.

276,Mr Curtin,"I do not. If thisexpended upon our own Commonwealth works. true that the work to be provided is in respect of Commonwealth buildings and services, but the purpose of the expenditure is to provide some measure of relief to the unemployed, all of whom for the past three years have had to look solely to the States for employment of this nature, and who are registered under the State schemes. The Government proposes to spend £176,000 throughout the Commonwealth, £10,000 of which is to be spent in Western Australia, and in such a way that it will involve a dislocation of the rotation of employment in that State. grunt if he so desires, but I submit with great respect, and a desire to be helpful, that at one period there were about 90,000 in receipt of sustenance in Western Australia. steadily reduced by using loan funds, and in pursuance of the State's policy of shifting persons out of employment from sustenance to some kind of work. The domestio responsibilities of the unemployed vary. A man who has a wife and five children to provide for is given a longer period of employment than a man who has a wife and three children, or one who has only a wife to maintain. In that way a very definite relationship between tbe obligations of the breadwinner and the resources of the State has been organized. Government now proposes to employ certain persons for a limited period between now and Christmas upon certain Commonwealth works and services. The total amount proposed to be spent in Western Australia is £10,700, and I ask the Minister seriously to calculate how much will be left for distribution in the form of wages after materials have been purchased mainly from stocks. Tn the absence of any statement to the contrary, one is safe in assuming that, although the unemployed of Western Australia are distributed throughout the whole of the State, the bulk of tbe money will be spent in the City of Perth. It has been the policy of the State Government not to attract the unemployed to is to be the metropolis, but to endeavour to provide them with work in country districts. In these circumstances, it would have been sensible and legitimate not to have used money in the way the Government proposes, but to have enabled the State governments to use it to supplement the assistance which they normally render at Christmas time. Not having been given detailed specifications of the works proposed to be undertaken in the various States one is justified in assuming that the money is not being provided for specific work, but that the deputy directors of works in each of the States will be authorized to spend the amounts set out in the schedule to the bill. I venture to say, with great respect, that the greater portion of this money will be wasted. evidence of that. to the contrary. The Minister cannot tell me on what works in Western Australia an expenditure of £10,702 is That number has been required. We ought to know how the money is to be spent. clearing an aerodrome at Bunbury. involve the expenditure of more than £10,000. ground there. the Public Works Committee which inquired into ithe establishment of an aerodrome at WesternJ unction in Tasmania, the estimated cost of which was conThe siderably over £10,000. Does it not appear preposterous that this money is to be spent on giving some additional relief to those who are at present depending upon the'States for employment? It should be expended on lengthening the period of employment of men whose work is at present intermittent. To-day, men are employed for five, six, or seven weeks out of every nine, according to their circumstances. The best way to render further aid to the unemployed would be to hand the money over to the States so that they could give each man an extra Week's continuous employment, and thus reduce his period of enforced idleness. That would have been a sensible contribution, and would have minimized the difficulties which have been mentioned during",66,Second Reading

286,Mr Curtin,"I was a member of the debate. A more comprehensive and detailed plan of public works, including the renovation of Commonwealth buildings, could later have been undertaken. The whole scheme is a hotchpotch. Last week, we authorized the raising of loan funds to the amount of £5,000,000, £200,000 of which was for the Commonwealth Postal Department, and we now propose to appropriate £176,000 from revenue, making a total of £376,000. neglecting about 99 per cent, of the facts. the Council for Defence met, and when was Assistant Treasurer say that in the schedule of the Loan Bill passed last week provision was made for the expenditure of more than £200,000 of the total amount to be raised ? last week. excitement during this debate it will not end to-morrow. The problem of unemployment is a continuing one. The Government has made a mistake in not recognizing that the States have done magnificently by the unemployed during the past three years. It would have been a generous gesture at this juncture to give this money for Christmas relief to the States for the purpose of supplementing the assistance which they are now giving. The general character of the proposal for the Commonwealth authorities to take a larger share in the relief of unemployment might be left until the composite Government has had time to develop a composite mind regarding the matter. journed.
