Sir WILLI AM LYNE -The information published in the Age was not supplied by me, and I was as much surprised as the honourable member could have been to read it this morning.

If so, will the honourable gentleman state whether the allegations are correct? paragraph is rather long, and I will hand it to the Treasurer. In the course of conversation yesterday, Mr speech of the honourable member for Hugh Sinclair, M.H.R., touched on the question of State rights. of the States to Federal finance require the most serious consideration,"" he remarked. "" The protection of the Braddon clause will expire in 1910, and, judging from the Estimates now before the Federal Parliament, large encroachments will be made on the three-fourths of Customs and Excise revenue hitherto returned to the States. In fact, we have no guarantee that for the next three years the whole of the three-fourths will be returned. Court decision on the Surplus RevenueB i ll permits the Federal Treasurer to take retrospective action. honourable member to read the whole of the article from which he is quoting. vevs a good idea of it. to which the honourable member has referred was brought under my notice this morning. The statement that he hasquoted, namely, thatThe protection of the Braddon clause w i ll expire in 1910is of course true. But the statement proceedsJudging from the Estimates now before the Federal Parliament, large encroachments w i ll be made on the three-fourths of Customs and Excise revenue hitherto returned to the States; in fact, we have no guarantee that for the next.' two years the whole of the three-fourths willadopted by the be returned. I cannot understand any member of Parliament making such a. statement as that.. It is not correct. I said in my Budget speech, and I think that I have stated at other times, that until 1910 the Constitution will be carried out, and the three-fourths Customs and Excise revenue returned to the States. has not received her three-fourths. the aggregate have received three-fourths of the total.

It is administered by the Department of Trade and Customs. Some States officers, The may act for us, but, as a matter of fact, the Act is administered by our own Department.

Natives accused of crimes are tried in the Courts of Fiji. business is called on, it may be as well to inform the House that the protracted litigation-o r rather the preliminary proceedings to what promised to the Commonwealth Government against the late tenderers for the European mail contract, have been brought to a conclusion.",13,Defence Department Distribution Of Rifles And Morris Tubes In Victoria Militar Y Board

Government have accepted a sum of £1:7,500, and the payment of all our costs. In Committee of Debate resumed from 30th October (vide page 1822) on motion by Sir WILLIAM LYNEThat the item, ""The President, ^1,100,"" be agreed to. Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [3.19] -When progress was reported on Friday afternoon, I had commenced my reply to some of the statements which had been made during the debate in regard to the Budget and the policy of the Government. I had proceeded as far as to quote figures relating to Commonwealth investments in London, and in Australia, showing the satisfactory results. I had shown that we had lost no time, but had invested long before Parliament met a very large sum of money, which amounts now to between £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 and £ 6 0 0 , 0 0 0 , at a fair rate of interest. So that .all the money that was available in trust funds has been invested, and has not been allowed to lie idle. of England guarantee the investments? Sir WILLIAM LYNE ferring to money invested in Australia. I have already stated the arrangements made with the Bank of England. of England guarantee the investments upon which it charges commission? Sir stated the position clearly in my Budget speech. With regard to the criticism of the Budget by the leader of the Opposition, one feature of his speech which struck me very forcibly whilst he was speaking was his statement that there was no surplus. The right honourable member was evidently calculating finances are kept according to the same method as is adopted in regard to the States finances. But he overlooked the fact that under our present conditions the Federal Treasurer can have no surplus under any circumstances. If there is more.money than is required for purposes for which appropriations have been made, that money, which would otherwise be a surplus, must go into the trust funds either for old-age pensions or for defence purposes. Treasurer misunderstood the leader of the Under the circumstances the Opposition. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I took the rjght honourable member's statement down . -in writing, and my secretary also made a nor^e of it.. / the leader of the Opposition was that if the Treasurer expended anything beyond his expectations he would have a deficiency. Sir WILLIAM LYNE He did not say that. What the honourable member states may have been in the mind of the leader of the Opposition, but that was not what he said. Any money that is available must go either to the trust funds for the two purposes to which I have referred, or it must be paid back to the States. WhatI have said in connection with the matter is . that under the Constitution the Federal Treasurer has to see that the States obtain tbeir three-fourths until 1910, or until some other arrangement is made. I hold -and I am going to take this coursethat until 1910, considering the necessities of the Commonwealth, tlie States must not look forward to receiving anything more than their three-fourths. If that position had been taken up some time ago, it would have been very much better than, waiting until now to adopt such a policy, -. I am now reshould have been adopted vears-ago... Sir WTLLIAMLYNE I question very much whether we could have done it effectively years ago, except by actually spending the money on works, and. in a vari&ty of other ways. We could notjiave adopted f this line of policy until the, termination of 1 years ago. Sir WILLIAM LYNE It expired last year-som e time in October. A great deal of obloquy was hurled at me because I teak the course I did last June. Unfortunately, I could not last June deal with any revenue that the Commonwealth received before that month, even, if we could have saved or used for the Commonwealth £ 3 3 3 , 0 0 0 more than we. obtained in June last. I was unable to take the action that I took before introducing the Surplus RevenueB ill . It is gratifying to me now to know that the action which we took has been ratified by the High Court unanimously, with costs in favour of the Commonwealth.

107,Sir William Lyne,"We shall doable member, from his statement and actions, wishes to impoverish the Commonwealth-that has been the game of the Opposition right through. There are several other matters in the speeches of honourable members to which I had intended to refer, but I do not think that it is necessary for me to do so. The deputy leader of the Opposition referred at length to the financial question; but, after having heard him, and having read the Hansard report, I cannot see that he touches in any way the proposals of the Government, which are simplicity itself. The honourable member for Parramatta tried to make us believe that the Government proposed to pay £4,101,000 as a sinking fund, in order to meet the whole of the indebtedness of the States-which , I think, amounts to £247,000,000-in thirty-five years. is hopeless, because I said the very opposite-that the Commonwealth has no such intention. Sir WILLIA M LYNE -The honourable member for North Sydney took me to task the other night because I said the Federal Government had no such intention. Sir WILLIA M LYNE -And a similar view was taken by the leader and deputy leader of the Opposition. The words I used wereTo place themselves in the position which the Commonwealth Treasurer offers to place them in-that is, of being relieved of their debts, now totalling ^'247,974,624, in thirty-five yearsan annual payment to Sinking Fund, accumulating at 3 per cent, interest, would be necessary of proposed such a thing. Sir WILLIA M LYNE -But the deputy leader, and the leader of the Opposition both say that is what I proposed. Sir WILLIA M LYNE I went on to say that neither had there been any proposal by the Commonwealth to pay off all the debt. States. Sir WILLIA M LYNE -We propose to take over the debts, and ask the States to pay £2,890,000 for tlie first five years, and afterwards a gradually reduced amount which disappears at the end of thirty-five years. The Commonwealth takes over the whole of the debts, and the responsibility for the interest; and it is for the Commonwealth to decide how, and under what conditions, and in what length of time, it will pay the £247,000,000. It has never been proposed that the Commonwealth should pay off the indebtedness at any particular time; but it will take sixty or seventy years, and require £1*074,556 to be paid each year, if paid off in seventy years. been provided for. Sir WILLIA M LYNE -Quite so; I am merely pointing out what will be required each year; and I take it that probably something of the kind will be proposed. lation is wrong? Sir WILLIA M LYNE -It is a calculation by the Treasury. It must not be forgotten that a sinking fund at a small percentage will pay off a large indebtedness very easily over such a long period of time. I remember that in New South WalesI was instrumental in passing the Water Supply to Country Towns Act; and a sinking fund of one-half per cent, was sufficient to pay off the whole in 100 years. fths per cent., it ought not to take more than seventy-five years at compound interest. to think of paying off £247,000,000 at the rate and in the time named. age necessary for a sinking fund is found to be amazingly small when extended ovei a long period; and the whole result ^4,101,000. is owing to the compound interest. As to old-age pensions, I was asked to-day whether I had given any information to the press, and I replied that I was as much astonished as any one to see what had appeared, and that where the news had been obtained I did not know. But I do say that, so far as my investigation goes, there seems to be an extraordinary state of affairs in New South Wales. I do not say that Victoria is paying as much as ought the to be paid in this connection; but the difference between the payments in the two States is, in many respects, so marked that I cannot help thinking that there is a great mistake somewhere. Mr J. H . CATTS -There may be a difference in the Acts. Sir WILLIA M LYNE -There is some difference, but not much.

117,Sir William Lyne,"The percentold-age pensions-wha t the pensions are to be; and I have in my mind, especially, invalid pensions. I am informed that in New South Wales the departmental arrangemaits are rather peculiar, in that the Central Board has no power over the District Board. There are one or two District Boards in every police district, and each Board has full power to decide who shall have pensions, and what the amount shall be up to the limit prescribed by the Act; and the Central Board, or the Minister, has no power to alter any decision of a District Board. The usual course is for an applicant to obtain a doctor's certificate, which he preWalesis, I think, just as healthy as is sents to the District Board, that he has premonitory symptoms of some disease; and, although at the time he may not be incapacitated from working, he is granted a pension, and goes on with hiis occupation. something like £690,000 will be expended upon old-age pensions in New South Wales, as against an expenditure of about £590,000 last year. Mr J. H . CATTS -Does the honourable; member say that there are at the present time in New South Wales persons drawing invalid pensions, and yet working? Sir WILLIA M LVNE I am told that there are. I am simply giving honourable members reports made to me by officers I have interviewed. I questioned one officer very closely as to why such a system was allowed, and was told that a person having, say, a tendency to consumption, could obtain a certificate to that effect, and on presenting it to a District Board might obtain a pension. The pension could not' be denied him if the District Board considered that he ought to receive it. I am informed that there are! many cases of the kind. I wish to disabuse the minds of honourable members of any idea that I should be disposed to deal illiberally with decrepit or aged persons who ought to receive pensions. I think I may take to myself some little credit for having initiated the old-age pensions system in New South Wales, and I hope that I am not so hard hearted as not to be prepared to deal more liberally with deserving persons than some would do. In the interests of the public, however, the system must be cautiously and carefully guarded, more especially when we find that 40 per cent, of the 46,000 people over sixty-five years of age in New South Wales are receiving old-age pensions, whereas only 16 per cent. of some 66,000 persons over sixty-five years of age in Victoria are drawing them. would not quote what is being done under the Victorian Act as an example that we should follow? Sir WILLIA M LYNE I am simply giving the figures. The Victorian Act may be too stringent. I cannot express a definite opinion on the point as I have yet to make further inquiries; but the difference between the number of persons over sixty-five years of age drawing old age pensions in Victoria and in New South Wales is certainly remarkable^ New South Victoria. prosperous. the fact that in Victoria the relatives of It is anticipated that this year a pensioner have in many cases to contribute to his pension. vouring to get at the root of the matter, but do not wish honourable members to imagine for one moment that I would refuse a pension to any one who was deserving of it. My desire is to protect the public against any abuse of the system. If the provisions of the New South Wales Act were applicable all over Australia every bread-winner in the Commonwealth would have to contribute .£2 10s. per annum towards the cost of the system. It seems to me impossible that the cost of the Commonwealth system could be so great if the Act were properly administered. I have given much thought to the subject, and having made maniy calculations of the probable cost, have come to the conclusion that, with proper management, the expenditure is not likely to exceed that for which I have made provision on the Estimates. According to some calculations that have been made, it will be considerably less. Assuming that the cost of the Victorian system is only one-half of what it should be, and that the cost of that in New South Wales is one-half in excess of what it ought to be, the expenditure on the Commonwealth system, taking it all through, will be less than that for which I have provided .

If wedone under the Commonwealth, and not by themselves, we can take over all the Mints, and the new one could be built in such a way as to afford every facility for the coinage of silver. the honourable gentleman knows that the Commonwealth would lose money on the gold coinage? not know what the percentage of loss is, but it is not very much. The report which I hold in my hand, and which was ordered to be printed on the 15th December, 1904, is altogether against the minting of silver here. It is only because it seems to me that it will be a good thing to do if we possibly can do it, that I am holding my hand for a few days, until I find out what can be done. was that the Commonwealth will not derive the profit which the honourable gentleman pointed out if it does the gold coinage too. Sir WILLIA M LYNE -That is quite true, and I have asked for information in order to judge whether the loss would be great. I have also been written to with regard to decimal coinage, and as to why the Commonwealth cannot follow the example of Canada. There are two reasons why it cannot be done here. It is essential to Canada to have the same sort of coinage as obtains in the United States, but in Australia that is not necessary. It seems to me that we had better pause until we can make some arrangement, or until the Imperial Government desire to do the same thing. The coinage which we use is Imperial coinage, and we do not know what trouble might be created if we were to proceed without knowing exactly what the result was likely to be, unless the Imperial Government did likewise, or led the way for us. cussed that question here. it has been discussed many times. I am stating what appeals to me as a good reason for not rushing into the matter at once.

I do not know what may be done if I remain in the Treasury until next year. But at the present time. I think that it might be premature to take up the question in the sense in which some honurable members desire. In his speech, the honourable member for North Sydney discussed what would happen if the balance of the Customs and Excise revenue were distributed per capita. He quoted one table which it was rather troublesome to follow, but honourable members will find that the figures are set out on page 89 of the Budget Papers. Take, for instance, the actual distribution in 1907-8. New South Wales received £3,566,371, but if the balance had been distributed per capita, she would have received only .£3,311,903, making a difference of £254,468. would make a difference of £300,000. member said that he was prepared to advocate this policy on any platform in New' South Wales. I have no doubt that he would be courageous enough to take that step, but I do not think that at the present moment the Government of that State would agree to the proposal. I am not considering now whether it would be right or not. But I may tell the honoraSle member that when I raised this very question at the Convention in South' Australia. I was met with the objection that some States were on a different basis from others, and that some would lose while others would gain.

157,Mr Mathews,"The Treasurer will£11,692 for 1907. this matter, I desire to say that I have taken the trouble to procure a copy of a legal opinion which was given to the Premier of Tasmania some time ago concerning the validity of the Surplus Revenue Act, which was questioned by the States. I intend to lay that opinion upon the table of the House, and I wish to have it embodied in Hansard, because it shows the extremes to which some Governments will go in order to fight the Commonwealth. This opinion was prepared, I believe, at the instance of the Premier of Tasmania by the Crown Law officers on the 25th April last. shall not trouble honourable members by reading it, but I should like to have it embodied in Hansard, because it declares that the action taken by the Treasurer of the Commonwealth was absolutely constitutional, and because it advises tlie Government of Tasmania that it would not be wise to proceed to litigation in respect of the validity of the Surplus Revenue Act. It readsSection S9 of the Constitution only continued in force until the imposition of the uniform duties of Customs, but while it wns in force it was incumbent upon the Commonwealth to pay to each State, month by month, the balance of revenue in favour of the State. Section 93 is also of a temporary character. Under its provisions the Commonwealth was bound, during the first five years after the imposition of uniform duties of Customs, and thereafter until Parliament made other provision, to credit revenue, debit expenditure, and pay balances to the several States, in the same way as in the period previously referred to. Under section 94 the Parliament may provide, on such basis as it deems fair, for the monthly payments to the several States of all surplus revenue of the Commonwealth. This section did not come into operation until the period of five years from the imposition of uniform duties of Customs had elapsed; but this period has now lapsed, and section 94 has, therefore, become operative. The Surplus RevenueB ill is a proposed exercise of the power conferred upon Parliament by section 94. Shortly, the elfect of it is to do away with the necessity that now exists under section 93 of paying over month by month to the States the balances of revenue which have not been actually expended by the CommonweaUh, and to enable the Commonwealth to withdraw from the consolidated revenue, and pay to trust account, moneys which have been appropriated by the Parliament to any special purpose. I think it is within the competency of Parliament to pass this Bill, and, in my opinion, the Bill' is not in conflict with any provision in the Constitution. appropriate moneys out of the consolidated revenue fund is contained in section 81, and it seems to me plain that moneys appropriated by law are no longer surplus revenue of the Commonwealth. Sir William Lyne. Passing away from force, protects the States to this extent, thats the Commonwealth cannot appropriate more than one-fourth of its net revenue from Customs and Excise annually towards its expenditure. That opinion was given months before theaction in the High Court was commenced, by the States. Yet, in spite of that opinion, which was only laid before theTasmanian Parliament on Tuesday last, the Treasurer of that State entered intothe fight which was initiated by the Treasurer of New South Wales against the Commonwealth. That circumstance points to a. I vicious determination to create trouble and. to fight the Commonwealth at all hazards. The same sort of conduct has. recently been manifested in connection with the report of the Auditor-General of New South Wales. If the statements made by the press are trustworthy, that officer hasexperienced a rather bad time. I maintainthat it is about time that litigation instituted by the States against the Commonwealth was prompted by common sense and) not by viciousness. My desire is that this Parliament should act within the limits of the Constitution-that it should not knowingly exceed its functions. But nothing should prevent the Commonwealth frompursuing the even tenor of its way, and. faithfully discharging its duty by"" safeguarding its own interests, whilst at the same time conserving the interests of the States, as far as it possibly can. But it must be remembered that whilst Commonwealth finances are drooping we cannot give up everything to the States. I trust that we shall have no more legal actionsinstituted against the Commonwealth, seeing that the last two or three have ended* so disastrously to the States. It is not wise for the States to be constantly fighting the Commonwealth, especially when \verecollect that-irrespectiv e of whether th'eexpenditure incurred in litigation be takenfrom the pockets of State or Federal electors-it has to be contributed by die sametaxpayer. We should endeavour to work in harmony with tlie States as much as possible, and it will be the consistent objectof this Government to do so. Sydney) [4.15] -Some statements have been made by tlie Treasurer which, I think, The general power to call for a reply. They are so different from what I conceive to be the facts of thecase that I have determined to answer them briefly. For instance, the Treasurer stated' Section S7, while it remains in that the leader of the Opposition, when-",23,Thomson Th E British £>85 38o
158,Mr Dugald Thomson (North,"he accused him of not having any surplus to draw upon in case of financial necessity, seemed to be ignorant of the fact that under the Constitution the Treasurer can have no surplus. I need scarcely say that the right honourable member for East Sydney is perfectly aware of the provisions of the Constitution and that his speech does not indicate that ignorance which the Treasurer sought to make it imply. saidThe Treasurer, with the assistance of his officers, says, "" We shall have £6,514,000 to spend this vear,"" and he proposes, on these Estimates, to spend every penny of it. There is no provision, even on paper, for a surplus of one penny to meet the vicissitudes of finance which are not unfamiliar to Australian Parliaments. That is a perfectly accurate criticism, and it is not usual for Treasurers-whe n they expect to have a certain amount of revenue -to provide for the spending of every pennv of it. The Treasurer, however, has provided for the spending of every penny and he has no surplus revenue out of which to meet any unexpected expenditure. He intends to return to the States only their actual three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue. He has no reserve fund to meet emergencies, and yet he proposes to spend every penny of his revenue. The leader of the Opposition was perfectly justified in pointing out that fact, and the Treasurer was absolutely wrong in declaring that the statement of the right honourable member for East Sydney exhibited ignorance of the fact that the Commonwealth could not retain a surplus. The Treasurer also affirmed that although he had looked through Hansard he was absolutely unable to understand what I was driving at. I will not enter into a discussion of whether that result was owing to a lack of clearness on my part or to a lack of clearness on the part of the Treasurer's understanding. I merely wish to point out that his declaration that the States by adopting his proposal to take over the whole of their existing debts would effect an annual saving of £4,000,000. in addition to the interest, shows that he does not at all appreciate the position. The Treasurer arrives at that sum of £4,000,000 by assuming that if the States paid 3 per cent, to a sinking fund so as to wipe off their debt in thirty years they would be better off to the extent of £4,000,000 by handing their debt over to the Commonwealth.and not having to provide that sinking fund. But does he assume that the Commonwealth pays 3 per cent, to a sinking fund ? No, the Commonwealth, according to him, is to pay nothing, specific. He might as well say that if the States established a sinking fund that would wipe out the debt in ten years they would save £20,000,000 or £25,000,000per annum by handing the debt over to the Commonwealth. The thing is absurd. Neither the Treasurer nor the States ever The leader of the Opposition proposed to have a 3 per cent, sinking fund"" or to wipe out the debt in thirty years. utterly impossible. and nobody proposes to do it. When the Commonwealth takes over the debt from the States the taxpayer does not escape it. It will still be on his shoulders. It will' be simply .transferred to the Commonwealth. Yet the Treasurer says that when the Commonwealth takes the debt over he will by his scheme save the States £4,000,000 a year-the sum. which would have obliterated the debt in thirty years. surer addressed that argument only to those who try to differentiate between'State and Federal people. absurd for the Treasurer to say that he saves the States what they never proposed to expend? that wav. right for the Treasurer 'to calculate in that way, he might as well sav that he could save the States the annual payment that it would cost them to pay off the debt in ten years. The States have never proposed, nor could they accomplish, such arc obliteration of the debt. We have never proposed, nor can we accomplish it ; yet the Minister takes it into calculation and says that it is a saving to the States. In that instance, at any rate, however complex or not understandable my remarks may have been, I think the Treasurer has shownthat he does not understand the comparison which he himself made. He has not said a w^ordI do not know whether it was an accidental or an intentional omission on his part-abou t the unequal relief of State debts. I spoke to him privately about the matter some weeks ago, and intimated that I intended to bring it up in the House, as I did not wish to take him by surprise.

164,Mr Dugald Thomson,"If it ispopulation of the Commonwealth at £58 per head, he will relieve some States of the payment of £78 or £79 a head, and relieve Victoria of only £""43 a head. One of the peculiarities of that transaction is that some of the States have borrowed for municipal and water and sewerage purposes through their Governments, whereas the borrowings of Victoria, for instance, for those objects have been conducted through certain Boards or municipalities. The extraordinary result, under the Treasurer's scheme, is that Victoria will be relieved to the extent of only £43 per head, whilst still retaining her liability of £12 or £13 per head for debts incurred by municipalities, water trusts, harbour trusts, and sewercertain national burdens better than age Boards, while other States will be relieved of £78 or £79 per head, including borrowings similar to those which Victoria has conducted through those local governing bodies. There is no particular need for me to protect the finances of Victoria. CerAny Treasurer is worthy of censure who tainly New South Wales will lose a little, although not very much, because her debt is £55 per head, and the average, if all the State debts were pooled, would be ,£58 per head. Still, I always try to look at these things from the stand-point ot what is fair under a proper system of accounts. I do not consider such a proposal either fair or proper, and I cannot conceive that it will be accepted. giving the Treasurer that intimation some weeks ago, I raised the question when I spoke. If there was any. proposal on the part of the Government to meet the difficulty, I wanted to hear it, but the Treasurer has not alluded to it, and is silent either accidentally or intentionally. It is an important and serious matter, which the House will have to consider, and the Treasurer, in his reply, should have dealt with it. He referred to the inequality that would be caused by adopting the per capita system, but that would be very slight in comparison with the revenues dealt with. Yet the Treasurer says he fears that the States will not accept it, while, at the same time, he proposes a gigantic inequality to the extent of £35 or £36 per head of population. He jumps at that with the greatest readiness, and expects the States to accept it, but the comparatively trifling inequality of £200,000 or £300,000 per year on revenues of £3,000,000, is to his mind too alarming to touch, although one of the definite purposes of Federation was that the bookkeeping system, which was adopted only Mr Dugald Thomson. for an emergency, should not be continued, and that we should get into the per capita allotment, not merely of revenue, but also of expenditure, as soon as possible. I do not understand how any Minister can propose to face the financial situation so unequally as he does by the pooling of the debts, and yet fear to face that other comparatively minor inequality-fear , in fact, to reach the destiny which it was intended we should reach by Federation-fea r to adopt one of the leading principles of Federation, which was to get away from separate accounts, and the separate bearing of burdens, to unite our accounts, except as to debts, and to bear together we could do singly. That was one object of Federation, yet the Government's financial proposals disclose no real intention of dealing with that important aspect of the Federal finances. would fear objection by some States which happen to gain a little by the present system. I am not speaking of Western Australia. We must treat her. specially, because she returns so much larger an amount of revenue per head than does any other State. We must give that State an allowance, which will decrease on a sliding scale until it ultimately disappears. But the difference After in the case of the other States is comparatively slight. This year one or two of them may benefit, but ten years hence others may be benefiting. The present abominable system of bookkeeping is worse than the old system of Customs entry, and, while we continue it, we disregard the intentions of the people who voted for the Union, and can come to no complete financial arrangement with the States. In regard to decimal coinage, the old answer is repeated: That we must wait until Great Britain adopts it. There might be reason for that answer were it proposed to alter our system of measures. Difficulties would be created if Australia adopted the metric system of measurements; but Great Britain is beginning to find that, if she is to hold her own in the markets of the world, she must be prepared to adopt the system of measures used by France and other countries, and some of her engineering manufacturers are now prepared to supply orders in accordance with either the metric or the British standard. There will be no difficulty, however, in adopting a decimal system of weights here. As to the inconvenience which the adoption of a decimal system of coinage would create, it will not decrease by delay, nor will it be made greater if Great Britain does not alter her standard. Although Committees and Commissions in the Old Country 'have reported almost unanimously in favour of a decimal system of coinage for Great Britain, and the florin was adopted as a step towards the decimalization of the British coinage, the reform has been delayed, partly because of the conservatism of thought there, partly from fear of prejudice, many of her people not being as well educated as ours, ancl partly because of the greatness of her trade. We have no such reason for hesitating. Those who were not members of the first Parliament may not be aware that a Select Committee of this House went very carefully into this matter, and approved of the decimal system of coinage. It was estimated by some that the adoption of such a system would save at least two years in the education of children, and I think that it is within the mark to say that it would save one year. Furthermore, it would make calculation very much easier, and simplify the keeping of accounts. The coinage proposed would have followed as closely as possible the present British currency, and, on a former occasion, I offered, while on my feet, to calculate without the aid of pencil and paper, the transposition to the proposed decimal coinage of any sum that might be named in the present currency. proposed currency, the sovereign, the halfsovereign, the florin, the shilling, and the sixpence would be retained. crown could be used as a matter of convenience, but would not be part of the system. The florin would be the unit, ten florins making J £ I , and five a half-sovereign, while the shilling would be the half florin, and the sixpence the quarter-florin. If threepenny pieces and pennies were retained, there would be an alteration in value, the number of pennies in £ 1 being increased from 240 to 250, which would give an advantage of 4 per cent, to those who buy penny articles. Those who sell such articles-the newspaper proprietors for example-coul d make up the loss by reducing the quantity sold for the price, or in some other way. Are we for ever to follow what we know to be the worse of two systems? It is our duty not to stand still in this matter. Ministers will go out of their way to push forward proposals in regard to which our constitutional right of legislation is doubtful, but pay not the least attention to the substantial advantages which may be gained in directions like these by the exercise of powers which undoubtedly have been conferred upon us. As it is now proposed to make arrangements for the coinage of silver by or on behalf of the Commonwealth, we have a favorable opportunity to change the system of coinage. member propose changing the system of coinage without proposing the adoption of the metric system of measurement? that we should coin our own silver, or have it coined for us by Great Britain. The Prime Minister is aware that, when that is done, a distinguishing mark must be placed on Commonwealth coins to enable our liability for the replacement of wear and tear to be ascertained. There is, therefore, an opportunity to adopt the decimal system, which has been recommended by Committees and Commissions in Great Britain, supported by some of the ablest men in the Empire. The Mother Country has hesitated to adopt the decimal system only because of the difficulty there would be in moving an older and larger population than this, the ramifications of her commerce, and the immense volume of In the her transactions. As we grow older the difficulties will increase. if we adopted a coinage different from that of the Mother Country. would be no difficulty. Transactions between the two countries are conducted on paper, and at 'the present time similar calculations have to be made in all dealings between the United States, Canada,, or the Continent of Europe. there will be difficulties. retained. case, the transposition could be done very rapidly, and would take but little time, even where the value of a whole shipment was concerned. It would not have to be made in regard to the coins which pass from hand to hand. Besides, nearly all the existing coins would be retained.

Now that we are about to deal with our coinage, I think there is every -reason for adopting the decimal system. Canada has adopted it. I know that there are special reasons in that case, due to tlie ,proximity of Canada to the United States. But still the Dominion is a dependency of the Empire, just as is the Commonwealth, and there is not the slightest difficulty in carrying on business between Canada and Great Britain. There are two reforms which we ought to adopt independently of -action on the part of Great Britain. One is the decimalization of the coinage, and ;the other the decimalization of weights. ally I am quite prepared for that change -.to be made also. -decimalize measures as weights and coinage.

What is proposed is not a serious alteration. We could still have our sixpences and shillings tearing the same relation to the sovereign as they do now. The relation of the threepenny piece would be altered; but the penny would only be affected to the extent of 4 per cent. I wish to allude to one other matter to which reference was made by the Treasurer, in his Budget speech, namely, fhe desirableness of separating the post and telegraph accounts so that we may ascertain the results in respect of each branch. master-General knows that I submitted a motion in regard to the matter some time was carried I set to work and we are now It is quite as easy to framing our accounts upon a new basis. matter himself.

As regards those causes of action between the States and the Commonwealth, to which the Treasurer has alluded, I quite agree with what he has said to the effect that there ought to be consideration on both sides. It will be remembered that any want of consideration has not been all on one side. The Commonwealth has always been ready to risk whether any interference with what had previously ""been considered State matters would be justified by the Court. Time after time we have pointed out that a certain course was probably unconstitutional ; but that had no effect on the Government. passed the Surplus Revenue Bill had we listened to such objections. Attorney-General will look up the debates, he will find that I expressed the bewould be in the interests, not only of the lief that that measure was constitutional. jection has been raised to almost every proposal of the Government. all; whenever I have thought the Government were right, I have said so, and so in the case of the Surplus Revenue Act did the honourable member for Flinders. for Parkes, the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, and several others, have taken the contrary attitude. doubt there is difference of opinion; but where Ministers have been believed to be acting constitutionally, honourable members have shown no reluctance to support them. because there was a majority behind the Government that the latter were prepared to take any risks. I should be reflecting on the constitutional knowledge of the Government were I to say that they never had any anticipation of their being proved to be wrong; but, right or wrong, they have on several occasions proceeded with measures. States had reason to resist the legislation of the Commonwealth, and, in a majority of cases, the States have been successful absolutely true-the Commonwealth takes in the Court. larger constitutional questions which have point is afforded in steel rails, on which been decided by the Court, I think, speaking from recollection, that the Commonwealth has been shown to be wrong in the majority of cases. say that it absolutely is so, because that would necessitate looking up the matter. However, I agree with the Treasurer that there ought to be consideration on both sides, because it is absurd to have the Commonwealth and the States rushing at each other's throats on the slightest provocation. On the financial question, where agreement does not seem very near, the Treasurer ought to go further than he proposes-thi s would not injure the States, but assist them rather-and adopt the per ca-bita system in regard to both expenditure and revenue. He ought not to continue the bookkeeping system when we are supposed to be making a financial settlement, and such a suggestion as I have made Commonwealth and State Legislatures, but of the people generally. desire to make a few remarks with reference principally to the financial position of Western Australia. The honourable member for Mernda stated the other day that Western Australia, in her share of the three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue, was receiving more than enough to pay the interest on the State debt. That may be so, but we should remember that Western Australia is probably carrying out more public works, in the shape of railways, and so forth, than any other State of the Union. At the same time, this Parliament, in its wisdom, has heavily taxed steel rails, so that what we are supposed to be receiving from the revenue is really and truly only part of what the State has borrowed. There can be no doubt that, considering the hundreds of miles of railway now being laid down, Western Australia is contributing a large amount in duty on the rails; and, while the Commonwealth declares that it is wrong to borrow, it does not mind taking the money which has been borrowed by My contention is that the Western Australia. from the States money which they have borrowed, and returns it to them",28,Thomson Th E British £>85 38o

I thought that it would be very awkward for one accustomed to the British system to become acquainted with the deciturn out such excellent work. mal and metric systems, but I found that it was possible within a week or two to understand them, and on my return to EnglandI found it much more difficult to use again the British system. I am satisfied that if we adopted decimal coinage, and tlie metric system, we should save nearly half of the time at present devoted to teaching the British system of coinage and weights and measures in our schools. available for other subjects. the decimal and metric systems is that .1 knowledge of their application in one esse is applicable to all. Under the English system we have 12 inches to 1 foot, 36 inches to 1 yard, so many links to a chain, and so on. is far more perplexing. has a knowledge of the decimal system he can readily understand the metric system, and those who have been accustomed to the decimal and metric systems find it difrefer. I was informed this year that some ficult to follow the British system. I believe we should do one of the best things ever done for Australia if we established the decimal system, and 1 should be prepared to support its establishment, no matmotives in Western Australia could get emter what the expense might be. In dealing with the same question the Treasurer mentioned that a new Mint was likely to be established at Sydney. If so, I think something must be wrong with the New South Wales Government. If we are to establish a new Mint for our coinage in Australia, it should be established as near as possible to the Federal Capital. This phase of the subject was suggested to me by the honourable member for Perth. In Western Australia we have the most up-todate Mint in the Commonwealth, and one of the best in .the world. The Premier of that State offered to put in the necessary machinery for the coinage of all the silver required for Australia. This, it is estimated, would cost about £5,000, and he offered to equip the Western Australian Mint with that machinery without any cost to the Commonwealth. As its Mint is not fully employed, it would have suited the State Government to do that. Let me say that the work done at the Perth Mint has been so good that, I understand, some inquiries were made from England, with a view to find out how it could I believe it is due to the fact thai it is equipped with the most modern machinery. When the Perth Mint can turn out such work, I should like to know why we should continue to have our silver coined in England. During the discussion of the Tariff, thi support of local industries and the employment of our own labour were strongly advocated, and surely it is not too much to ask that we should make use of mints already established in the Commonwealth that are not at present fully employed in preference to having our coinage done in England? I think that some Federal action should be taken to permit people engaged in different professions and trades to carry them on in any State. I do not know whether we have' the power to take such action, and I should like the advice of the Attorney-General on the subject. sent. The honourable member refers to the question of reciprocity in the case of doctors, mining engineers, and so on. case to indicate the difficulty to which I locomotives were being sent from Western Australia to Queensland, and a correspondent wrote to me to ask whether men who had been employed in driving those locoployment in the same work on the Chiilagoe line in the Etheridge district in North Queensland, to whicb the locomotives were being sent. I found that a man might hold a Government certificate, and be the driver of a locomotive in Western Australia, and yet would not be allowed to drive that locomotive in Queensland. I think that is a disgraceful state of affairs. Queensland standard? would be expected to start cleaning and firing, and go through the whole business again in Queensland, although he might have been driving a locomotive in Western Australia for ten or twenty years. contends that there should be Inter-State reciprocity in such cases ? has once learned to drive an engine, he should be able to drive it over the border",30,Thomson Th E British £>85 38o

There might be some -difficulty if the work on which the men were to be employed was Government work, but in the case to which I have referred, the locomotives were to be used in the construction of a private railway line, and I claim that qualified men holding Government certifi-cates as engine-drivers in Western Australia should have been entitled to drive engines in Queensland. The matter is one which requires some consideration. I propose now to submit some figures to show which of the States has gained by Federation, and to what extent. I find that in 1901 New South Wales had a deficit of -£12,749. That was the position when the State entered the Federation. Let us see what the position has become since then. In 1903, the deficjt hacl increased by £ 1 7 1 , 1 6 6 , to a total of £ 1 8 3 , 9 1 5 . In 1905, New South Wales hacl a surplus of £ 1 4 1 , 8 4 3 . T905-6 her revenue was £12,283,082, and her expenditure £11,386,864, a surplus of revenue over expenditure for that year of £ 8 9 6 , 2 1 8 , so that her position had improved from a deficit in 1901 of £ 1 2 , 7 4 9 , to a surplus in 1905-6 of nearly £T,000,000. 'South Wales has been too heavily taxed under Federation. -of New South Wales was £13,392,435, and the expenditure £11,881,746, showing n. surplus of £1,510,689. This shows an improvement in the position of the State from a deficit in 1901 to a surplus of over £""1,500,000 in 1906-7.' In 1901-2, the revenue of £11,007,356, and in 1906-7 the revenue bad increased to £ 1 3 , 3 9 2 , 4 3 5 . was too heavily taxed if it shows anything at all. an increase of revenue since the establishment of Federation between 1901 and 1907 of no less than £ 2 , 3 8 5 , 0 7 9 . Dealing with the expenditure in the same way, I find that in 1906-7 the expenditure of New South Wales was £11,881,746 , whilst the expenditure in 1901-2 was ,£11,020,105.

In 1901-2 Victoria had a deficit of £ 4 0 1 , 0 4 0 , and in 1905-6 a surplus of £ 5 2 6 , 9 8 4 , so that her total gain in the five years was £ 9 2 8 , 0 2 4 . In 19056 her revenue was £ 7 , 8 1 1 , 4 7 5 , and her expenditure £ 7 , 2 6 1 , 4 7 5 , or £ 5 5 0 , 0 0 0 less. In 1906-7 her revenue was In £8,345,535, and her expenditure £ 7 , 6 7 9 , 1 4 3, or £ 6 6 6 , 3 9 2 less. But while her revenue had increased from £ 8 , 3 4 5 . 5 3 4 over that of 1901-2, which was £ 6 , 9 9 7 , 7 9 2 , an increase of £1,347,742, her expenditure in 1906-7 was £ 7 , 6 7 9 , 1 4 3 , while in 1901-2 it was only £7,398,832, or £ 2 8 1 , 3 1 1 less. Her revenue, therefore, increased much more than her expenditure. Queensland in 1901-2 had a deficit of £ 4 3 1 , 9 4 ° , while in 1905-6 she had a surplus of £ 1 3 , 9 9 5 , a total gain of £445,935I "" i 9 ° 5 fi n e r In 1906-7, the revenue revenue was £ 3 , 8 5 3 , 5 2 3 , and her expenditure £ 3 , 7 5 , 7 i 2 , or £ 1 2 7 , 8 1 1 less.

But while II: her revenue increased in 1906-7 to New South Wales was £ 4 , 3 0 7 , 9 1 2 , as compared with that of 1901-2, which was £ 3 , 5 3 5 , 0 6 2 , an increase of £ 7 7 2 , 8 5 0 , her expenditure in 1906-7 was only £3,9 >797> or £""55> 4 I1; 20 less than in 1901-2, when it was £ 3 , 9 6 7 , 0 0 1 . These figures are very creditable to those concerned in the administration of the affairs of that State. Tasmania in 1901-2 had a deficit of £ 4 4 , 3 ° 7 , and in 1903-4 a deficit of £ 1 1 6 , 0 2 1 , but in 1905-6 she had a surplus of £ 1 2 , 4 9 6 , making a total gain of £ 1 2 8 , 5 1 7 .

Just outside Perth there is a place which, no doubt, the honourable member has never heard of, as it is not so large instead of bringing it.

Not only the postal business, but also the electoral business, is now being carried on in a little vices. This policy of trying to do withwooden room measuring 10 feet by 10 feet. Since Federation Victoria Park has gone so much ahead that now it is traversed by an electric tramway, and not only the town but the surrounding district which is served by the tramway is lighted by electricity. At the instance of the Mayor and Councillors and a committee which was formed there, I took the trouble to bring the matter before the Postmaster-General, and submitted to him photographs showing the main streets in the municipality, but nothing has been done, nor has anything been promised. When the Commonwealth is collecting 5s. per capita more in Western Australia than in the other States, surely it should give to the people of Victoria Park reasonable postal facilities ! At Cottesloe we find that just the same thing is taking place. The first complaints I heard there emanated from the Government employees, who are working in a little place which probablv would be condemned by any sanitary inspector. The Department promised that the matter would be attended to. I suppose that the population of the place has increased tenfold since the Post Office was erected. is treated no worse than I am. I cannot get a Post Office. honourable members in the other corner to say that the Commonwealth must not borrow. Adjoining Cottlesloe we have a place called Buckland Hill. whether the Department has lost the run of the place, but when I represented its requirements a little while ago the authorities said that something would be done, and I believe that it is going to be done. I found that the only facility given there was a public telephone in the shop of a chemist, who said that while it was in use his customers would not buy the articles which they required, lest their orders should be overheard. He wjshed that the telephone was removed, as it took away custom about 20 miles of made road, a revenue of £3,000 a year from rates, and a population of 3,000 persons. It was left without even a contract Post Office until a little while ago, when, the Department promised me that one would be established. I only want to bring out these matters to show that the Department is not going ahead with the times. If it is necessary, money must be obtained to provide for these serout! money and without development is ridiculous. We must anticipate the amounts required by the telephone, telegraph and postal services. Mr J. H . CATTS -Wher e shall we get the money ? populated by such persons as the honourable member we would not know where to get the money, but I believe that I could raise, in some way, enough money to provide such services as I have indicated. Although it has been laid down that the Commonweath must not borrow, still there should be no harm in anticipating our requirements. It might be much cheaper to spend £1,000,000 straight off, and anticipate our revenue for a year or two than to continue muddling on, doing a bit of repairing here, and a bit there, and really throwing away the money. It is virtually the same as a farmer starting to mend old fences instead of erecting new ones. If he mended the old ones he would not have any fence at the end of five years. But if he obtained money and erected new fences at once he would be) better off at the end of the time named. The Commonwealth must have money in order to go ahead. That is much the cheaper plan. No doubt we should now have been in a very poor position if the Customs duties had not been raised. I understand now why the Treasurer was anxious to see such high rates imposed. If the increased I do not know revenue had not been provided by the Tariff he would have been placed in a very awkward position. ' Eveni f the old Tariff had been continued there would not have been a very nice position for the Commonwealth to face. On the Estimates a certain sum is set down for naval defence.

That system is preferable to the settlement of disputes by an Arbitration Court such as obtains in Western Australia, where it is composed of a representative of the employers, a representative of the employees, and a Supreme Court Judge who acts as referee. presents the employers. Crown. The system adopted in Western Australia is unsatisfactory, because it is not possible for any two men representing the employers and employees to be familiar with all the ramifications of every trade and business. Mr J. H . CATTS -But they decide upon the evidence submitted to them. sentatives of employers and employees are competent to decide these questions on evidence. How can they be expected to deal with disputes relating to the clothing industry, the boot industry, the saddlery industry, and the mining industry ? It is impossible for wages by means of a Judge, we could only them to possess the requisite expert knowledge. The intricacies of some trade disputes are such that it is puzzling even to read the evidence. tions by Wages Boards partake more of the character of mutual agreements between persons who have expert knowledge of the particular industries in which the disputes arise. Most of the troubles which we have experienced in the Commonwealth have been due to decisions arrived at by persons who do not possess that knowledge. The working of our Arbitration Courts has not been satisfactory chiefly because we cannot find any means of compelling the employees to abide by their awards. Mr J. H . CATTS -Would that trouble be cured if each dispute were dealt with by a Wages Board? of a decision by a Wages Board being repudiated. state of affairs is practically impossible. Buti f the employees in any industry refused to abide by an award made by the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court, what would happen? We should either have to yield to them or.enforce the award, and the latter course would? be impossible. Mr J. H. CATTS -The honourable member believes in voluntary as opposed to compulsory arbitration ? disputes being settled by Wages Boards. Mr J. H . CATTS -Ho w would the honourable member enforce the new protection, by means of voluntary agreements? constituting certain boards to deal with certain industries. The determinations of these bodies would, I think, generally be in favour of the workmen. Of course, it isconceivable that a Judge of the Arbitration Court might suddenly be called upon toleave a temperate climate like that of Victoria to hear a dispute in the interior where similar climatic conditions obtain. But hemight happen to strike a very hot day, and 1 his decision might be influenced by theconsideration that such days were the rule, ancl not the exception in that particular locality. On the other hand, his visit to a. tropical region might be made on a cool day ancl he might be induced to think that men working there experienced no morediscomfort than is experienced elsewhere. With regard to the proposal that the Commonwealth should control tKe scale of deal with industries which were protected by Customs duties. That would often put us in a peculiar position. Take, for inI consider that the determinastance, a firm like Foy and Gibson's, whosell all kinds of things, and also manufacture.

260,"Indeed, Such A Mr Hedges","I am certain that therearise. The Wages Boards, as constituted in Victoria, should be allowed to deal with the whole question of wages and conditions of labour. 1 desire to say a few words on the question of land settlement. If the Federal Government did the very opposite to what they are doing, some good would result for Australia. Federal legislation has the tendency to draw the people to the towns, whereas the State Legislatures are trying to scatter them over the Commonwealth by building railways and opening up the country so that they may go out back and build up new towns. The tendency of Federal legislation is to centralize the people. If we intend to try to make Australia a manufacturing country, the effect must be to bring the people into the cities. Mr J. H . CATTS -Does the honourable member object, to protection? that we cannot overproduce such commodities as wool, wheat, copper, gold, and silver, which Australia can produce and sell in the markets of the world; but that we can overproduce for our own requirements. If we lay down a scale of wages such as we know that Australians get-and no other part of the world pays such high wages-w e shall not be able to sell our manufactures in the markets of the world if we produce more than we can consume ourselves. What are we to do then? We shall have a lot of men here whom it will be cruelty to have to ask afterwards to go on the land. If , instead of that policy, we induce people to go on to the land, we shall have men that can defend Australia, used to handling the rifle, the hoe, and the plough-me n of physique that .can face any enemy. If , however, we bring them up to factory work and other town occupations, while they will have all the pluck of the Britisher, they will not have tine strength and the stamina to go out and rough it . The Prime Minister said at Castlemaine a few weeks ago that the policy of the Federal Government was to help the producer, and to induce the people to settle on the land. of a summary of a fairlv lengthy speech. Minister was not sincere when he made that speech. Federal Government have been in exactly the opposite direction. [69] duties on steel rails and wire netting, and did their best to carry them. I fought against them, but the duty on steel rails, at any rate, was carried. If I wished to put an effectual stop to the settlement of the people on the land, and"" the opening up of new country, I should 'prohibit the importation of a single steel rail into Australia, and if the country were infested with rabbits I should prohibit the use of wire netting. Yet that is the tendency of Federal legislation. We have 15,000 miles of rails laid in the Commonwealth, but if we had them in proportion to the length laid in A^ictoria, we should have 100,000 miles throughout Australia. We can do nothing to develop the riches of the continent without railways. We can bring nothing to the coast without them. If a man in the interior found enough gold to live on for the rest of his life, he could I do not, but I believe not carry it any distance without a railway. Nothing but railways will open up or benefit Australia, and to tax steel rails is a cruel thing to the country. It will hamper the development of the States, and prevent men who have, perhaps, little money, but the right sort of pluck, from succeeding. If we wish to open up Australia, and make it prosperous, we must afford every facility for the building of railways, and for preventing vermin from over-running the land. There is on the business-paper the Manufactures Encouragement B ill , generally known as the Iron BonusB ill , the consideration of which in this House came to a dead stop on the item for the payment of a bonus on the manufacture of wire netting. After we had prevented the Government from imposing a duty on wire netting, they sought to insert a provision for paying a. bonus equal to £ 2 8s. per ton on netting made from imported wire, and twisted in an imported machine. We had evidence that it cost only about 12s. for the man who watched the machine do the work. Yet the Government propose a large bonus in a Bill which they pretend is introduced for the encouragement of Australian industry. I told the Attorney-General that if the Government wished to get that Bill through the House they had better wipe out that I ani afraid the Prime proposal. If the Prime Minister was sincere in his statement at Castlemaine that he wished to help the producers, the Government are going a very curious w i y about it , because the taxation of steel rails', and other such articles, will never help They proposed them.

When Admiral Sperry, on the Flagship Nebraska, entered the harbour, he was saluted by a roar of guns from the secret foundations. Immediately the people let free thousands of native races."" eagles. The booming of the guns drove the birds seawards, covering the remainder of the Fleet, which was hailed with uproarious cheers from the seamen of the Yankee Fleet. Sydney was beautifully illuminated at night. The cost of the electric decorations alone is estimated at ten thousand pounds sterling. The vast colleries at Newcastle were laid up, as the men demanded a holiday. They had to make the journey to Sydney by sea as the trains were not able to handle the enormous traffic.

A warm sun shone, and the scene was one of such real and moving enthusiasm as has never before been witnessed in Sydney. Fifteen excursion steamers packed with passengers left Sydney Harbor as soon as the notification of the sighting of the American Fleet was given. They met the men-of-war two miles outside Sydney Heads. Two thousand citizens attended the banquet. It was strikingly demonstrated that the entire population of Australia regard the arrival of the Fleet as the presage of a future distinct understanding with the United States of America, respecting the yellow peril to fhe white races in Australia. A special Sydney cable to the China Gazelle of August 19 says :"" The American Fleet is sighted off Port jackson. There is considerable jealousy between the State capitals as to which shall be accorded the palm for exuberance of welcome. The Lord Mayor of Sydney declares that Admiral Sperry, officers and men, must endure ' a sirocco of a time.' Excursion trains are being run from all parts, and the seaport is absolutely packed with sightseers and holidaymakers. Mounted police patrols are everywhere in evidence. The Government has declared a two days' holiday. "" A deputation of clergymen waited upon the Premier, asking for the closing of all hotel bar during the stay of the Fleet. Mr Wades replied that ' battles were won on beef and beer,' and refused the request. "" An extra 100 members of the mounted police nave arrived from the country districts. Naval and military men of the local regulars are to be confined to barracks during the visit. "" The intensity of excitement and enthusiasm of the people exceeds that evinced at the departure of the volunteer troops for the Boer war. "" It being impossible to house the enormous throng of country visitors, the Government have thrown open the Centennial Park, two miles from Sydney, for camping, and the big reserve presents every appearance of a mining camp in the early days. "" The efforts of an agency, notoriously proJapanese, to minimise this epoch-making tour, by meagre or distorted accounts, are ridiculed, as every newspaper of world-wide repute is specially represented. "" A large section of the public of New Zealand insists that an Anglo-American alliance should be established, to protect the interests of the whites on the Pacific against the yellow The Premier of New Zealand, in replying to the objections raised against the entertainment of the American Fleet, at a Liberal Labour demonstration, made a spirited defence of the Government's action.

With respect to the Post and Telegraph Department, I do not think that the Government has made adequate provision for the increased postal facilities demanded, or for the necessary extension of telephonic and telegraphic communication. I notice that the Queensland estimates have been reduced from £ 4 5 8 , 3 8 6 to , £ 4 5 , 9 3 92 I have a remedy, but The Estimates provide for an increased expenditure of only £ 1 , 7 5 8 in respect of development of such States as Queensland and Western Australia depends very I am not afraid of largely upon the extension of postal facilities. Those who have to travel long distances to reach their markets should at least have an adequate postal service. I find that a sum of only £ 3 , 5 0 0 has been provided in respect of telephones and telegraph instruments for the State of which I am a representative, although last year £ 6 , 4 0 9 was expended under that heading. The proposed vote is not much more than half of that passed I should be quite last year, although quite a number of exchanges and telegraphic and telephonic works have been hung up for want of funds. Numerous applications that have been made for exchanges and private telephones cannot be granted owing to want It did not occur to of funds, yet provision for expenditure under this heading has been practically cut down by half.

We find, however, that the sum of only £ 2 , 0 0 0 is proposed to be voted towards the erection of postal buildings in all the I wish to say towns I have mentioned. That amount will be just about sufficient to cover the cost of plans and specifications, and unless the Treasurer comes to the rescue, The Prime Minwe cannot hope to see a start made with the erection of these post-offices for another twelve months.

It is ridiculous to say that no intermediate service can be provided. question of defence, I think that Australia is prepared to pay for a reasonable scheme, but I am not one of those who fear an attack from some oversea power, .more particularly whilst we are under the protection of the British flag. If the Government, instead of spending large sums, .as they propose to do, upon the establishment of an Australian Navy, were to extend the coastal railways, so that in time of war or threatened danger troops might be readily moved from one point to another, they would do far more to develop the country, and also to protect it, than they could hope to accomplish by spending millions upon the construction of battle-ships. be careful lest we place upon the people -of Australia a burden in respect of defence that will prove rather too heavy to 'bear. penditure or. the Army and Navy, a certain writer states thatDuring the last fourteen years the cost of governing England has increased ^51,500,000.

There is a danger that we in Australia will also place upon the people a burden that they are unable to bear. -should not have intervened in this debate hut for certain statements' made by the Treasurer, in reference to postal matters, which I think should not pass without some -comment. From the statement made this afternoon by the honourable gentleman, that the Postmaster-General was endeavouring to obtain votes for works that would not pay, it might be inferred that provision had been made for all necessary works. The whole Committee will be with the Treasurer in keeping a watchful eye over the expenditure of the Department. If a service will not return interest upon its outlay, it ought not, in the present state of the finances of the Commonwealth, to be considered. But the gravamen of the charge made against the Department is that services which would not only return interest upon outlay, but would pay for themselves within a very few years, are either not considered, or. if they are, are not As to the granted, because the Treasurer says that he cannot provide for them. What we desire the Treasurer to do is to take care that the great Departments of the Commonwealth are properly administered, and if he cannot provide money for necessary works from one source, it is for him to tell us how it may be obtained. The imputation made by him this afternoon that extensions of services are refused only because they would not pay is, in many cases, absolutely contrary to fact. Every honourable member has complained again and again that works that would return a handsome interest upon their cost' are either not considered by the Treasurer, or, It is well that we should if they are considered and passed by the Department, are laid aside by the honourable gentleman in his usual arbitrary and dictatorial manner. Our desire is that the Referring to Great Britain's "" exPost and Telegraph Department shall be made satisfactory to the people who use it. We are constantly met with complaints from all parts of the Commonwealth as to its improper administration. Only this afternoon I received from a constituent a complaint that under the regulations of the Department a telephone line has to be paid for from the moment that the con' nexion with the exchange is made, regardless of whether or not the subscriber is informed of the connection, or of whether or not he has had an opportunity to use it. If one of the officers of the Department reports that on such and such a day he did such and such a work, and made the line fit for use, the subscriber must pay for it from that date. I contend that a subscriber should not be asked to pay for a telephone which the Department says he shall not use, though it may be connected with the exchange, until he has been informed that it is ready to accept payment in respect of the first year's service. In regard not only to matters of this kind, but to almost every other kind",44,William Lyne Th E Honourable Postal Requirements In Queensland The
344,Mr Bowden (Nepean) [8.39],"Tof service, the administration of the Department is absolutely unsound and rotten. The Treasurer practically admits that, according to Mr Hesketh's figures, instead of hundreds of thousands of pounds, some millions will be wanted to put the Department in a proper condition. But he * comes down with a muddling policy. He says, "" I know that £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 will not meet anything like the demands upon the Department; but we shall put that sum on the Estimates "" and so he would shelve the question until next year or the year after. If it is acknowledged, as I believe it is, that the amount I mentioned is wanted for the Department, he ought to find it. If it cannot be found in any other way, and the works would be remunerative, I see no objection to our borrowing the money in order to put the Department on a sound basis. If we could borrow £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 on a short future, it rests with the honourable gentledated loan and repay the money by instalments with a sinking fund of a couple of hundred thousand pounds a year, which is less than the Treasurer proposes to spend if we could do that, and put the Department in thorough working order, I think that the Commonwealth would be better served, and the public would be very much better served too. In this House we are apt sometimes to make a fetish of a nonborrowing policy. any one that the Commonwealth should not borrow except under special circumstances, and should not spend borrowed money except on remunerative works. But when it is shown that a work would yield a return of not s, but 10 or 15 or 20 per cent., as some of these lines would, it is a short sighted and suicidal policy not to find the money for the work. able member any evidence that they would far as I know, consented to that being' pay 20 per cent, on the capital cost?

While the equally as much on the outlay, and which finances remain in their present position I the Department admit would pay, but they intend to look very seriously at the prosimply declare that the necessary money is posals of the Government with reference not available at the present time. approved lines which, owing to want of taken over and administered by the Commoney, the Department is not able to carry monwealth. eut. of lines which the Postmaster-General has recommended, and which his officers have assured him would pay handsomely. But the Treasurer says that he cannot find the money. That is not satisfactory-a t any rate to me. The money ought to be found'. If a business concern had been run in the same way as the Department is, it would have been brought to a state of bankruptcy long ago. The Treasurer complained that he ought not to be asked to outline his expenditure for years ahead. He said that all he had to do was to bring down hisfinancial proposals for one year, and so long as he could see his way clear to tlie end of that year,, he was doing all that was necessary. In ordinary circumstances that would be so, but when the Governmentoutlines a large expenditure in the near man to show us where the money is to come from. I am as much in sympathy with the movement to institute a system of old-agepensions as is any man in the House, and I believe that it could be administered tetter by the Commonwealth, and with more fairness to the people interested, than it could be by the individual States. But even on his own showing the Treasurer willnot have enough money when he begins to> I hold as strongly as pay the old-age pensions, and he does not know where the shortage is to come from .

If South Australia is relieved of an annual loss on the Northern Territory, it ought to think itself very lucky and not lay down onerous conditions necessitating the expenditure of millions of money in order that it may get rid of a white elephant. I hope that the House will not ratify the agreement which has been drawn up and signed by the Prime Minister. The Treasurer interjected that the telephone services are too cheap. Ever since I have been here, honourable members on this side have been urging the Postmaster-General to try to establish a separate account for that branch of his Department. I think that we ought to be able to see at a glance the cost, the revenue and the profit or the loss, as the case may be; but at the present time we cannot. Treasurer to say that if we raise the rates we shall derive a larger revenue. 1 doubt if we would, because the use of the telephone would be curtailed. The Treasurer might get out of a temporary difficulty by cancelling a number of applications which have been made for connexions. But what we want is some means by which we can ascertain at a glance whether the telephones are paying or not. If we are losing money, the rates ought to be raised. Buti f we are making a large profit, our course is not to raise the rates, but to find money for erecting new lines. I said just now that, if necessary, I would approve of a temporary loan with a sinking fund. able member borrow the money in order to give cheaper rates to people ? the money for carrying out reproductive works.

If I have not the ready cash, I shall try to borrow money at 5 per cent., where it is shown that I can make 15 per cent. That is only a business proposition. the money, could we trust the Government to spend it properly. They do not spend their income properly. spend any monev until the Works Estimates have been passed? Every speech on the Budget is delaying their consideration. the Postmaster-General some questions with reference to the promotion of the junior fitters in the telegraph workshops.

In answer to my questions, the Postmaster General said that certain qualifications were necessary and certain examinations had to be passed. He said, for instance, that lathe work and turning were necessary. I remind the honourable gentleman that in Sydney not a particle of lathe work and turning is done in the telephone workshop. It is all very well for the It is all done in the machine shop of the telegraph branch.

Then there are matters which are not included in the Government programme to-day, but which they will shortly be bound to make some attempt to provide for, and these also would increase the expenditure. stances it seems to me that the Commonwealth is getting into really serious financial something like £191,000 out of surplus difficulties. I have no doubt at all that at the next Federal elections the electors will require to know how candidates stand in relation to financial questions, and quite rightly too. Dealing with what I believe to be the Treasurer's under-estimates of expenditure, I direct attention first to his estimate of the expenditure required for the payment of the old-age pensions. He says that he will be able to meet this expenditure with £1,200,000. give the honourable gentleman the benefit of the odd -^25,000; but I say that that estimate will not satisfy any one who knows anything about the matter. The honourable gentleman will require at least £400,000 more than his estimate to pay Commonwealth old-age pensions. Then in the matter of defence, the honourable gentleman has £1,102,000. Although that amount might be sufficient to cover the expenditure for this year, if the new scheme which the Government have promulgated is to be put in force, the Prime Minister himself estimated that for the first year it will involve an expenditure of £1,714,000. That means an increase on the Treasurer's estimate of about £600,000. probable that even the Prime Minister's estimate will be found to be very much under the mark, because even though the compulsory system proposed is enacted, it is probable that a demand will be made for some payment to the men for working time put in at drill and training.

As a matter of fact, they are unanimous only upon a certain platform which is in Provision will unblack and white. But there is much less dissension amongst them than there is amongst members of the Opposition corner. that corner are divided against themselves. According to the statement of the Treasurer, during each of the two years immediately preceding Federation New South Wales had to borrow £ 1 1 3 , 0 0 0 odd for the purpose of carrying on the affairs of its Post and Telegraph Department. In the three years prior to Federation the whole of the States borrowed £ 5 7 8 , 3 1 6 in this connection. That the Post and Telegraph Department has since been conducted without the aid of borrowed money is a credit to the Commonwealth. In spite of the reflections which have been cast upon this institution, I doubt very much Seeing that every whether any administration of it could have been more successful. That it requires review I quite believe. It is now being subjected to that review, and I hope that the result will be a considerable improvement. It stands to reason that a huge Dethe honourable partment like the Post Office should periodically require a thorough overhaul. It is the biggest business in Australia, and possesses more ramifications than any other owing to the vast area which it covers. Defence is a national question, and will involve a larger expenditure than will any other matter at present under review. If we are going to maintain our standard as a nation we must expend considerable sums in establishing a military as well as a naval force. The sooner we do that the better. With the question of defence I bracket that of immigration. It appears to me that the Government are too indifferent to this question. Too much licence is being permitted the States regarding the manner in which immigration is being conducted.

The fact that we have them in the cities is the result of the bad administration of the country. The Government and this House are largely responsible for the congestion which now exists in the cities, and for the slums and squalid areas to be found already in this young country. We have done nothing to get the people out on to the wider arable areas, where the fresh winds blow, and where they might develop, as people should, under an open sky, and with every opportunity of growing up with some stamina, instead of being herded together as they now are in the towns. To bring out 4,000 farm labourers will only be to accentuate the trouble. Many of them will be required only temporarily, if required at all, and then only at a very low wage, which will force men who have been in the habit of going to the country for work to remain in the cities. They will only suffer themselves, and aggravate the present social sore. responsible for that advertisement. sponsible in this way, that they, are allowing too much licence to the States in regard to immigration, the right to control which is vested entirely in us. We have permitted the States so much licence that they are going beyond the bounds of discretion in seeking to bring out impecunious workmen to compete with our own workers, and add to the already large; number of unemployed. A few may be absorbed, but at such a ridiculous wage that it is not worth mentioning. I know from my own experience that a number of these raw hands are engaged up country at 2s. 6d. a week, and so are keeping out of employment men who have been in the habit of earning from ios. to £ 1 a week. I know that any other Government, except our own, which, of course, would not be allowed much time on the Treasury bench to accomplish anything practical, would probably not do as much as the present one has done. YetI am not satisfied; with what it is doing, particularly in regard to immigration. This is a vitalquestion, and involved as it is with the question of defence, it becomes involved also with the question of raising freshrevenue. The land tax that we propose It would not only compel the use of the land, but would make room for immigrants who would come here without any special advertisements, so Jong -as they knew that there was land available. There is no necessity to boom a place if peopleknow that when they go there with a littlemoney they can get ""hold of country which will make them independent almost immediately. There is any quantity of country in Australia capable of making millions independent if we only compelits use. I am averse to the scheme of the State buying land. We should force the land into use by land taxation, which is fair and just, because we then only tax values which the people themselveshave created, while, by forcing the hand' of the monopolist in opening up the country, we make room for the people that we , so badly need for our own defence. Otherwise, we and our children, and our children's children, will remain practically at the mercy of any stronger power which may be able to break or weaken the might of Great Britain. I wish to touch on the question of the cable service. A loss of some,£20,000 has been incurred in the last year on the Pacific Cable. Here,, again, the Government have been weakkneed. It would have been possible for them to take a firm stand with regard 1 to the cable business. By some arrangement which it is very hard to get to the bottom of, and which, in justice to the Government, it should be stated was entered into by the States prior to Federation, our sphere of action is limited to the Pacific, and we are bound not toenter into any effective competition with the cable companies that now control the world's communications. Although the Pacific Cable Company is subsidized, we are not in a position to get any advantage out of the subsidy, because we do not cut the rates. We do not do the work at prices that would pay, but keep prices up in order that it may not hurt the large combines which control the Atlantic cables, and the world's communicationsgenerally. There are thirteen cables",59,William Lyne Th E Honourable Privileges I F We Furnish That Proof We Are

514,Mr Carr,"The Government are reacross the Atlantic, eleven of which are lying idle, in order that the business of those controlling the cables may be conserved. They do not want cut rates to increase the business, because they make handsome dividends out of the present rates. ""Unless some co-operative movement is established with regard to the cable service, which will cover the Atlantic as well as the Pacific connexions, we cannot hope for a cheapened cable service, which would be a boon to the Empire. Means of communication and transit, particularly within the Empire, should be made as cheap as possible. When one considers that it is quite possible fo send a whole book-full of news across the Atlantic or the Pacific for about a shilling's worth of chemicals, one wonders why we are taxed to the present extent for our over-sea communications. Empire unity or settlement in this country, provided that we had a land tax that would compel the opening up of the country for settlers, quicker than would cheapened cable communication. penny a word cable system is well within the range of possibility, and would have a material effect in cementing the Empire and developing Australia, because it would promote the transmission of that reliable information from Australia to the old world which would result in a considerable influx of desirable immigrants, as well as foster trade. The cable company is composed of excellent men in many cases, just as the shareholders in the Suez Canal are honourable men, whose right to levy toll on the Empire's commerce is legalized, ancl, therefore, beyond reproach on that ground, although the moral effect on the Empire is absolutely disastrous. The relationship of the cable companies to the Empire is on the same footing as the relationship of the Suez Canal Company to the Empire. charges are an embargo on the communications of the Empire, just as the Suez Canal dues are an embargo on the trade of the Empire. These honourable and excellent men, who are allowed to sit upon the Empire's chest, should be given notice to quit. strong enough, with sufficient moral courage and statesmanlike foresight to see the importance of these movements, to undertake the task and carry it out. I believe the public of Australia would rally round them to a man in cheapening the cable service with a view to fostering the [7i] spread of Empire intelligence and facilitating the Empire's business, and particularly in promoting immigration to Australia. They would rally round any Government that imposed a land tax which would pave the way for the reception of immigrants, and would provide the sinews of war for the heavy tasks we have before us, such as the establishment of a Commonwealth old age pensions fund, the taking over of the Northern Territory, defence, and the creation of the nucleus of a navy. The people would also heartily support the Government in any action taken with a view to lifting the embargo on traffic passing through the Suez Canal. to know from the Ministeri f he will consent to the reporting of progress, seeing Nothing could facilitate that the hour is late.

517,Mr Crouch (Corio) [10.58],"I deto speak on the Budget, and that the Treasurer has shown so little consideration for the time of the Committee that he has made no fewer than four speeches. It is unfortunate that I am not to be allowed to criticise the Budget. I think that if the House had had a chance to divide upon the Budget, and the financial proposals of the Government, without the added responsibility of supporting the motion of the right honourable member for East Sydney as one of want of confidence, there would have been a majority on the other side. I do not consider that the financial proposals are at all satisfactory. I think that they are very unsatisfactory, and I repeat that had not the motion of the right honourable member for East Sydney carried with it the responsibility of expressing a want of confidence, I should have been satisfied to support it. I object to this Budget altogether. I think that it is an extravagant and an outrageous Budget. There are three points of objection to it. It was bad, first, because it was reaid; secondly, because it was read badly; and, thirdly, because it was not worth reading. Budget, and see what it means. porter ! a "" loyal supporter"" of extravagance, and, it seems to me, of threatened deficits; because either it means that, or it means increased taxation at the end of twelve months, or a loan, unless the Government are prepared to abandon a large part of their financial proposals. sponsibility upon the Treasurer. member vote against the motion of censure if he holds these views? involved a change of Government. Except for that, I believe that the whole House would have denounced these financial proposals. ber for Illawarra object to the honourable member for Corio criticising the Government ? vote for a general motion of censure. 1 did not want the Prime Minister, and some of his colleagues, to be removed from office. 1 think that the Prime Minister is the only leader whom this House would accept, and that it would be impossible to form a Government that would be at all stable from any other party or combination of parties in the House. Consequently, I think that the Government should continue in office. I wish to deal with one or two items in the Budget. Is there any doubt in the mind of any honourable member that it is an extravagant Budget, and that the expenditure has risen enormously ? When the items are dealt with in detail, I shall vote for large decreases where I think that extravagant advances have been made by the Treasurer. It is just as well that we should recognise at once the alternatives that we have to face. It appears to me that the Treasurer is deliberately working either for a land tax or for a loan. I do not desire to see either alternative realized. 1 will vote for decreases in every direction, if I can get other honourable members to vote with me. I will vote to restore many items on these Estimates to the same figure as that at which they stood last year. would tell the honourable member what I thought of him. It is just as well to examine the Sir WILLIAM LYNE I can control myself a little better than that. for Illawarra had better not loose the TreaI am net going to be surer's tongue. he would afterwards be sorry for.

If honourable members will look at the Estimates for 1902, as submitted to this House, they will find that we started very moderately, and that permanent heads were paid salaries of £ 6 0 0 . Shortly afterwards the amount rose to £ 6 5 0 . Now, nearly every one of the permanent heads receives £ 8 0 0 , and it is proposed to increase the amount to £ 0 0 0 . I do at this stage. These increases have gone up by £ 5 0 and I had no desire to £ 1 0 0 ; and, of course, if the permanent head of a Department secures an increase in his salary we cannot expect that subordinates will be satisfied unless they receive increases also. will be proposed next year.",61,William Lyne Th E Honourable Privileges I F We Furnish That Proof We Are

530,Mr Tudor,"We wonder what increasesthree transferred Departments, the permanent heads of which received large salaries, the permanent heads of the other Departments desire to be paid equally large amounts. The three transferred Departments are those of Trade and Customs, Post and Telegraph, and Defence. The other Departments, the permanent heads of which are now to have their salaries increased, are those of the Attorney-General, Home Affairs, External Affairs, and the Treasury. They will all creep up if they can to some maximum; I do not know what it will be. I do not intend to refer to the permanent heads individually; they are all men of great ability. an important principle at stake, especially in view of the fact that we are trying to save money for the purposes of old-age pensions and that public works are being delayed throughout the country for lack of funds. There is another point to which I draw attention in connection with the financial proposals of the Treasurer. It seems to me to be a most serious one. The Treasurer, in order to laud his own administration, stated that although the ex-Treasurer, the right honourable member for Swan, had cut down estimates, he, the present Treasurer, took it as a matter for which he was entitled to honour, appreciation, and credit, that he had increased expenditure by hundreds of thousands of pounds for the Post and Telegraph Department alone. Every one of us knows, however, what a strong Treasurer is wanted for. He is expected to cut down estimates and to see that economy is exercised. It is his business to see that departmental demands instead of being supported, are decreased. He is there to sit on the Treasury chest and to defend the interests of the taxpayers as far as he can. But what do we find with this Treasurer? We actually find him taking credit to himself in this Budget speech for having increased expenditure. I regret that I have not all my papers available. I thought that I should have had fair play after listening to four speeches from the Treasurer, and should, at least have had a reasonable opportunity of expressing my own views. But I have to proceed without the notes which I have made. takes credit to himself for having increased estimates by hundreds of thousands of pounds, and attacks his old colleague, the ex-Treasurer, because he cut down estimates. I think, however, that the attitude [ 7 1 ] -* taken up by the right honourable member for Swan was the proper one for a Treasurer to assume. I regretted to hear the Committee generally cheering the Treasurer's statement. It seemed to me to be a very unsatisfactory state of things indeed. came from the honourable member's side of the chamber. ber who interjects absolves himself from approval of the Treasurer's attitude, and says that he shares my view, I am glad to have him with me; though it seemed to me that the cheers came from all round the There is chamber. It is true that there have been demands for increased expenditure from the Post and Telegraph Department. But. we want a strong Treasurer who will resist such demands, and will take the proper responsibility for doing so. It is only by having such a Treasurer in charge of the finances that economical government can be satisfactorily carried on. I have marked down a few of the items on account of which expenditure will have to be met within the near future. There are defence, old-age pensions, bounties, lighthouses, immigration-involvin g £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 per annum a new naval scheme, iron bounties, transcontinental railways, the Northern Territory, the Federal Capital, and the Agricultural Bureau. It is estimated that the Northern Territory will involve an expenditure of £3,000.000 , although we may not have to pay it all at once, and the Agricultural Bureau cannot be established without large expenditure. I saw the present situation coming. I saw that the Commonwealth was undoubtedly drifting towards a tight financial position, to meet which we should have to increase taxation or borrow. country that a year ago. honourable member say so ? this corner said so a year ago. ber for Indi had been a member of this Parliament three years ago he would have known that I said it then.

I replied as far as my memory served me; but up to the present, as I have said, no return has come to hand.

If so, it is certainly very unfortunate. The honourable gentleman may be saying that he is able to bring about such a position of affairs as will render the imposition of a land tax a necessity in 1909. so, that is unfair to me and to other supporters of the Prime Minister. I am reminded by the situation of a story told me by the honourable member for Bourke, who will excuse my mention of his name, in view of the aptness of the story. The honourable gentleman told me of a friend of his who was a member of a lodge. This man's father had been sick for a very long time, and was drawing sick pay from the lodge funds. There were some signs that he was getting well again, and he overheard the wife say to the son, "" We shall have a real good holiday at Mount Macedoni f father is only lucky enough to be sick for a little longer."" plication of the story is this, that it would appear that the Treasurer is thinking that if the Commonwealth will only be sick for a little longer lie will have a glorious opportunity for the imposition of a land tax. Such a consequence may follow from the course he is pursuing. I should not object to a land tax if it were absolutely necessary to enable us to pay our debts. I should, of course, favour any taxation rather than that the Commonwealth should not meet its obligations. Our public debts must be paid, and we would be face to face with the necessity of imposing a land tax or of floating a loan. I wish to avoid resort being had to either of those expedients by so reducing the Estimates that we may have something like reasonable economy. I certainly wish to put a stop to the extravagant increases in salaries for which the Treasurer has provided. that they would resign if an item were reduced, what attitude would the honourable member take up? threatened to resign, I should vote for the Estimates being passed as they stood, considering that that would be the less of two evils. state of the Committee. reported. call attention to the state of the Committee. able member has spirited away honourable members of his own party.
