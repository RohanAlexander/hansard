Is he prepared to do so .now ? Minister of Defence) [10.37] I intend to make a statement regarding proposed expenditure on material when we come to the division dealing with it. There were no complaints about the administration of the Department in New South Wales, but I promised to supply information about several items as we come to them. Before the division is passed, we should have an explanation from the Minister of Defence or the Minister of Home Affairs why the revotes are so many and so large. Parliament is constantly being asked to reyote money for works which it has authorized, and which should have been carried out. The failure to. expend money within the year in which it is voted is a matter requiring the serious attention of Ministers. to throw the responsibility on some one chair at 10.30 else ? do? office last -year. blame the Minister, but the policy which has been pursued in the past is certainly at a shame that those who are desirous of getting practice in the use of weapons of warfare should be prevented from doing so because the necessary facilities are not givenwith sufficient expedition. Rifle ranges, post-offices, and other public requirements should be provided where they are needed with the greatest possible despatch. I hope that the Minister will impart some energy to his officers, and that, next year, the revotes will be fewer and smaller. [10.41] -The complaint of . the honourable member for Kalgoorlie is well grounded. What is really needed is an arrangement which will prevent the unnecessary duplication of work by ofiicers of the Defence and Home Affairs Departments. A better arrangement than the present would be to al.low the Defence Department to control the expenditure necessary for defence works. The present dual system is most unsatisfactory. In quite a number of instances, expense and waste of time have occurred because, after one set of officers .has recommended expenditure, another set has declared it to be unnecessary.

12,Mr Hutchison (Hindmarsh),"of the Defence Department have often recommended works as necessary and urgent, and the Minister has approved of them, but, on the papers being referred to the Department of Home Affairs, its officers have gone into the matters again, and declared the expenditure to be unnecessary. The Defence Department should know better than the Department of Home Affairs what works are required for the proper carrying out of its business, and should be absolute in regard to its own expenditure. agree with the honourable member for Hindmarsh that the time has arrived when an alteration of policy should be made. At present *we are largely dependent on the services of State officials, and until we can get our public works constructed under the direction of Commonwealth officials, there will be a constant carrying over of unexpended balances from year to year. In these Estimates the proposed revotes total ,£52,000. There is something wrong in administration when, although the public is constantly urging the construction of new works for necessary services, there is no proper provision for expending the inoney voted for them. I regret to find such a small sum allocated for the construction of rifle ranges. I am sorry the Minister of Defence has not made the expansion of the rifle club system throughout Australia an important feature of his land defence policy. I do not know what provisions the Defence Bill will contain respecting rifle ranges, and the establishment and extension of rifle clubs, but I can see in the rifle club system the germ of a possible future extension of our Defence Forces,, which would be of very great additional value in building up a permanent land defence. I know that at present the permanent forces do not look with a kindly eye upon the rifle clubs, but regard them as outside the regular forces. that the Minister has not seen fit to break down that prejudice, and to take independent action to give considerable encouragement to the development of this very inexpensive method of building up the Defence Forces of the Commonwealth. I recognise that that would require the introduction of quite a new policy. does not make for the efficiency which the amount of money allocated for the purpose would warrant, but, if some system of compulsory training in shooting could be introduced into the organization of the rifle clubs, it would go far to supply the lack of compulsory training of those who have reached manhood, and do not belong to any regular force, as distinguished from those who as youths will receive compulsory training in the cadets, under what I understand will be the Government proposal. Although the Minister has so far neglected to give proper encouragement to rifle clubs, which are really the only effective means of ' building up the Defence Forces in country districts, I hope the discussion on the Estimates in this Chamber will induce him to give special attention to that phase of the question when he introduces the Defence Bill. It would be possible, by establishing centres of competition among rifle clubs, to introduce an efficient compulsory system of shooting. That would be a most inexpensive way of establishing a compulsory training for adults, who would not be reached by the compulsory training for youths, while it would carry on and complete the training of the senior cadets after they reached manhood. Every important town throughout the Commonwealth, at reasonable distances apart, could be made a centre for rifle practice, and clubs could be established in each district, with reasonable assistance given by the Government to the building up of rifle ranges. By that means there could be competitions so many times a year, with a system of compulsory service for a certain number of hours or halfdays per year for every adult, unless he could furnish reasonable excuse, with instruction at the hands of competent officers', who would visit the various centres for the purpose. That would help to build up an efficient defence force without causing the serious inconvenience or the dislocation of business which a complete system of compulsory military training for adults would necessitate, and it could be done at a miniI regret mum of expense. The South African war showed that if, even on the eve of a war, you can mobilize men who are efficient in the use of the rifle, the work of training them can very soon be accomplished, more especially if they have already served their term as senior cadets. We know that Australia, with' its large distances and the The present system peculiar formation of its country, would, in the event of invasion, have to conduct a war in much the same way and under the same conditions as the Boers fought in South Africa, and the question of efficiency in shooting must be the most important phase of the land defence",14,Department Of Home Affairs
13,Mr Sampson (Wimmera) [10.43],"!policy of the future. I hope this discussion will move the Minister of Defence arid the Government to make an extended policy in connection with rifle clubs, and compulsory training and shooting, important features of the Defence Bill which we hope will soon be introduced. wish to call the attention of the Minister of Defence to the fact that in many parts of New South Wales application has been made to his Department, times without number, for facilities for rifle clubs to pracI have tried to assist the honourable member tise shooting, in order that they might become thoroughly efficient, and I am amazed to find, on looking through these Estimates, that in only one case in New South Wales is provision made for a rifle range, and that is at Baulkham Hills, which is practically a suburb of Sydney. I put a question to the Minister recently in regard to the repeated applications that have been made from the large centre of Junee, where there is one of the best rifle clubs in New South Wales. that the cost was too great, as it would take from £1,300 to £1,500 to provide a range. On the last occasion that I put the question I understood the Minister's reply to be that ranges were only provided for military units, and that, where there was no military unit in existence, even if the great body of the settlers in a district desired to make themselves efficient shots, it was not the policy of the Department to provide a. range for them to fire over. is the regulation. tary unit at Baulkham Hills? tary unit at Junee. member want anything, more ?

Eveni f it does, my experience, without desiring to decry those who form themselves into volunteer corps cr military units, is that they are not as enthusiastic in regard to rifle shooting as are the members of rifle clubs. The first thing which should be remembered by any Government that desires to build up an effective defence force, is that it is of no use to put a rifle into the hands of a man unless he understands how to use it. for Wimmera to obtain a rifle range in New South Wales which would also serve residents of Victoria, and I think that in matters of this kind we should not take into consideration any question of State boundaries. More than two years have elapsed since residents of Swan Hill applied for the establishment of a rifle range on what is practically unoccupied country, which would en-, able them, as well as their neighbours on the other side of the river to obtain good I was met first with the reply practice. Those who own the land, however, have raised various objections to its occupation, one of their principal objections being as to the direction of the proposed firing line. I do not think that the Department should hesitate to say what should he the firing zone. The Minister has power to resume any land for this purpose, and he ought not to allow land-owners to block the Department, as many of them have done. The riflemen at Junee have proved themselves effective shots, having quite recently won a district competition, in which clubs from Cootamundra and Albury took part, and an enthusiast outside the local club is .also bringing on the cadets remarkably well in the use of the rifle. The difficulty in the way of the establishment of a range will not surrender it. Recently, with the honourable member for Grey, I visited Junee, and we inspected the suggested site. not be found.

WhatI desire is a statement showing Parliament and the people exactly the state of our organization-wher e it is deficient in equipment, and what is necessary to perfect it-and then, having had the matter placed before us, we should proceed to put the defences on a sound footing in a comprehensive way. One matter referred to is the shortage of the first line equipment; and I do not care in the least in this connection where the money comes from so long as it is provided. I think that the proper time for such a statement as I have suggested would be on the consideration of the first item of the Defence Estimates. Minister of Defence) [11.18] I desire to say a word or two in regard to rifle ranges, but, before doing so, I must point to the Does he fact that, for the last three days, questions have been perseveringly addressed to me as to why money voted has not been spent. Is that for me to say, seeing that I have only just succeeded to the Department?

Honourable members may question me until The Minister of Defence is Doomsday, but I am not going into the musty and shady past. I prefer to assume that my predecessors did what was right in the administration of the Department, and that is all I wish to say about the matter. I suppose there are good reasons why the money voted has not been spent in many of the Departments, the money to spend. pie ssion is that the idea was that those in aut horitv could not spend the money and a t t h e j a m e t i m e s a v e it for 0 ld-age pensions-the previous Government no more than any other could do impossibilities.

It is not the for a site? rule of the Department, so far, at any rate, to purchase rifle ranges merely for rifle clubs. Where there is a range for military purposes, rifle clubs are formed, and, indeed, where there are no ranges, clubs are given £75 to enable them to provide for themselves. That is the principle on which the Department has proceeded throughout the Federal regime. for the rental of ranges? but, of course, special cases are provided for. The rule of the Department is not to find ranges for rifle clubs solely, but to get the latter, as far as possible, to utilize the military ranges. where there are no ranges? I think we ought to help the rifle clubs in some special way, as, in fact, we do help them-. The theory of the Department, in granting the £ 7 5 , is to help clubs to furnish their own ranges: and, though I admit that does not go far, other help is given in addition.

The matter referred to by the honourable member for Wimmera is causing the Department a great deal of anxiety; and, though I have said nothing about it so far, I am anxiously cogitating as to what I can do for the rifle clubs of Australia. The present position is in every way unsatisfactory and unfair, from the point of view of both the clubs and the Department. The cost aggregates a huge sum annually; and the result is that only about 40 per cent, of the riflemen are efficient. Just where the trouble lies, is a matter I must investigate. It is of no use setting up expensive ranges, and providing facilities for shooting, if only 40 per cent, to make honourable members fully acare efficient. On the other hand, if the reason is that more encouragement is required, we are faced with a problem to be grappled with, and solved in some way. mit that men cannot be made effective without practice. that. efficiency ? dard laid down in the regulations. The whole question is a very difficult one.

I think that more will have to be spent on rifle clubs, and that we must insist on a larger return from them, from the military -point of view. How best to make them of value for a second line of defence is a problem which I am now engaged in considering. I hope to put them on a better military footing, giving them more encouragement, and obtaining more valuable military service from them. The compulsory training of the cadets will in the future create different material for the formation of rifle clubs from that which at present exists, making them much more efficient for military purposes_than they are. clu'b members have been drilled. more have not been.

I resent that, and tell him that he cannot get information from me in that way. I withdraw anything I said that is contrary to the rules of debate. my remark. In order to assist the Minister, I took only about two minutes to give him the benefit of what I had discovered while in the Fisher Ministry. I pointed out why a great deal of the money that should have been spent was not spent, and showed how the Defence Department was hampered. Works urgently required by the Department, favourably reported on by officers of the Department, and approved by the Minister, are sent on to the Department of Home Affairs, and the whole process is gone through again. I put it that, as the Minister knew how he was hampered, and what our experience was-and I am sure I could not have put it more respectfully orable member in reply that I would do my best to remedy the existing state of things. CouldI say more? whether the Prime Minister proposed to take steps to put an end to that unsatisfactory state of things. I believe the officers of the Home Affairs Department are just as conscientious as are the officers of the Defence Department, but surely the latter are better judges of what the Defence Department urgently requires than are the officers of any other Department which is not in touch with the work. The present duplication of work not only prevents the money being spent, but prevents works that are urgently required from being undertaken. Matters in regard to the rifle ranges are in a most unsatisfactory position. The Minister first wants a cheap rifle range, and that cannot-be got. When I interject that he will not take anything that is cheap when it is offered to him, he says it might be nasty. The Government cannot get rifle ranges unless they are prepared to pay for them. The Minister will not take a cheap one because it is nasty, and he will not take a dear.one because it costs too much. What sort of a Department is it to be if it is run on those principles,? If rifle ranges are necessary, the Government have the power to resume the land on reasonable terms. I hope they will use that power. Home Affairs) [12.0] -Tw o criticisms of a general character have been levelled at the Department of Home Affairs in addition to that which has been answered by the Minister of Defence in legard to the question of rifle ranges. Reference has been made to the large number of re-votes which, as honourable members are aware, represent liabilities incurred during the last financial year. There must always be a certain number of such re-votes; but, as I .have already assured the Committee, plans and specifications are in readiness to enable many works to be proceeded with as soon as these Estimates are passed. I am sure that honourable members are not attaching any blame to the present Administration, since we have been in office for only a short time; but I shall endeavour, with the assistance of my officers, to have these works expedited so that the re-votes in next year's Estimates may be as small as possible. The honourable member for Hindmarsh has referred to the duplication of work by the Department of Defence and the Department of Home Affairs. My honourable colleague, the Minister of Defence, has promised to do what he can to get rid of that difficulty, and I assure the Committee that I shall join with him in pushing on with necessary works. The sooner these Estimates are passed the less will be the possibility of any big re-votes being sought next year. Proposed vote agreed to. Subdivision 3 (Queensland), £23,526. withstanding that I may provoke the wrath of the Minister, I desire to make a few remarks regarding this subdivision and to congratulate the honourable gentleman upon the alteration that has taken place in the attitude which he used to take up when in Opposition as fo the supply of information regarding the Estimates. I wish to know whether it would not be possible to give fuller details in the Estimates regarding the proposed expenditure on rifle ranges.

In the matter of rifle clubs Queensland is the only live State in the Commonwealth. I bring uncler the notice of the Minister the fact that an amount approximating to £ 7 0 was spent by the members of the Stannary Hills Rifle Club in preparing a range, and urge him to reimburse the club either the whole of that amount, or that part of it which in the opinion of the State Commandant should be refunded. The honourable member for Wimmera suggested that rifle shooting should be made compulsory. I do not know that it would not be a good system to inaugurate, but it would be unreasonable to compel men not only to practise rifle shooting but to buy their own rifles and purchase their own ammunition, and, on top of that, to supply their own ranges. I wrote to the Department asking that a refund be made to the Stannary Hills Rifle Club, and in reply received a letter pointing out that an inspecMinister is prepared now to say who they tion of the range had been made and that a certain amount was to be expended, but really ignoring my request. ter. honourable member for Richmond, who was then Minister of Defence, informed me unofficially that the Department contemplated fortifying Magnetic Island, which is in Cleveland Bay, Townsville.

Proposed vote agreed to. Subdivision 4 (South Australia), £3,350. The request made by the honourable member who has just resumed his seat for more money for rifle ranges in Queensland is most entertaining, when we compare what has been done in that direction, and what is proposed to be done this year, with what has been done in South Australia, where we have been pleading for years for a little expenditure to keep up the enthusiasm of rifle club members. Still, 1 shall cheerfully assist him, and shall not complain of the treatment extended to South Australia. I desire to bring under the notice of the Minister the proposed site for buildings for military head-quarters in Adelaide. When I put to the Minister a question on the subject a few weeks ago I received a vague reply to the effect that the site had been selected by "" responsible officers."" I do not know whether the are. I have heard of no officer in the Military Forces having taken upon himself the responsibility of selecting the site in question. It may be that some officer in ths Department of Home Affairs has made the selection.

I am glad that orders have been given that no action is to be taken until further inquiries have been made. [12.12] A little time ago, accompanied by Senator Pearce, I inspected this site, with which I had been familiar for years, and I know that in the opinion of several members of the staff it is most unsuitable. It is too small and its shape too irregular. Shortly before he died, the late Premier of .South Australia expressed his willingness to grant for the purposes of the military head-quarters building the site of the present police barracks. That would have been a most desirable one to acquire; but subsequently he withdrew it from selection. Later on, in the course of an interview I had with him, I suggested that the site of the Destitute Asylum, which is not far away from the present building, would be in every way suitable. Mr over in the near future and have a look at Price did not say whether or not he was agreeable to part with it, but he asked what would become of the inmates of the asylum if it were"" handed over to the Commonwealth. I pointed out that there would be no difficulty in that regard because the State Parliament had been talking for years of the desirableness of removing the old people from the asylum, which is entirely unsuitable for their accommodation. I believe that if the matter were pressed upon the State Government we should be able to secure that site, which is one of the most suitable to be obtained in Adelaide. -As the Minister has stated that he intends to have the fullest investigation made regarding the site for military headquarters' buildings in Adelaide, and, if possible, visit the place himself, there is no necessity to say more than a word or two. I endorse the remarks of the two previous speakers as to the unsuitableness of the present site on the river, flats. When the Minister is looking into the matter I should like him to consider the advisableness of removing the parade ground and military barracks from their present position. The parade ground is an utter absurdity, being no larger than an ordinary school ground. instructors squads of the troops are hopelessly intermingled in their drill. it is intended to very largely .augment the forces, more room will be necessary. But there is no possibility at the present site for extension in any direction, and the erection of further buildings will only render an ultimate removal more difficult. This (Hindmarsh) is State Government land, which, no doubt, will be handed over to the Commonwealth; but I suggest that there are much more suitable sites to be found in the park lands near Adelaide, in regard to which an exchange might easily be arranged Minister of Defence) [12.18] I desire to do the best I can for the Military Forces, and the very moment it was represented to me that this site was unsuitable I gave orders for proceedings to be stopped, and further investigation made.

Sub-division 5 (Western Australia), £12,801. sire to refer very briefly to a matter I have previously brought under the notice of the Department, namely, the desirableness of removing the present rifle range from the site at Karakatta. This range, while quite suitable years ago, is gradually being surrounded by settlement, and for some time back has been getting exceedingly dangerous. There have ,been some narrow escapes; indeed, I am not sure that there has not been an actual casualty from a stray bullet. The site is unsuitable, both by reason of the settlement and of the inefficient service it affords for the rifle. It is too small, and it is no uncommon thing for men to be unable to get to the targets during a whole afternoon. The Department has promised to consider the matter of removal, but I notice an item of expenditure here for the erection of a storeroom, which does not indicate the likelihood of a change.

It is two years since that, on the application of the local municipal council, the Department determined that these alterations were necessary, but, although money was voted for them last year, nothing has yet been done. I visited the place at Christmas time, twelve months ago, and found that the men employed there were working under disgraceful conditions. As honourable members are aware, the Christmas holiday season is a very busy time in the post-offices, and at St. Peter's sorting had to be done anywhere, mail matter being even taken ouside to be sorted. Since then the business of the office has increased by reason of the growth of population.

That the council thought an improvement, on the first plan, but the Department has since put forward a third proposal, whereby the postmaster, instead of being accommodated above the present building, will have quarters in a new building covering the existing yard. It is very rarely that a house in South Australia is without a decent piece of ground, and I hope, therefore, that the Department will, if possible, avoid taking this yard. It may be that the departmental officers now fear that the walls of the post-office are not strong enough to bear a second story, though, if so, they might have been expected to find that out sooner. The second design would certainly give the best looking building and the most convenient accommodation. In any case the work should be .pushed on with.

The proposed vote is to provide quarters for the postmaster, those which he now uses being required for the convenience of the public. The work will certainly be pushed forward. In regard to the Adelaide telephone exchange, it has been reported to me, as the result of a special inquiry, that the ventilation, which was very bad, has been improved. The honourable member for Adelaide will be glad to learn that lavatories and other accommodation have been provided for the. female attendants; the lighting of the building has been bettered, and, altogether, the office is much more convenient and healthy.

I do not know how many exchanges have been established, but the honourable member for Hume, to whom the complete lists have been handed, may perhaps act as vox populi vox Dei in the matter, and let us know all about it later. No doubt they are all enshrined in blue in those documents, but I feel sure that literally not half of the money required to put this Department on a proper footing is to be spent this year. It is the Department which of all those under our control comes nearest to the daily lives of the people. I would point out that the Budget and the expenditure foreshadowed in it was based entirely upon the conditions that existed prior to the late Premiers' Conference, and there ought now to be such a re-adjustment of these Estimates as will enable this great Department to be put upon a sound healthy business footing, and not to be starved any longer. We may have arguments as to whether we should spend £1,000,000 or £2,000,000 on defence, but there can be no two opinions I shall hand about the necessity of putting the Postmaster-General's Department in a proper condition.

In order tq obtain proper advice as to what items should be submitted to Parliament, I convened a Conference of the electrical engineers of the Department in the various States, with instructions that they should report to me on the new works required to place the telephone and telegraph services in a thorough state of efficiency, including those which could be executed during the current year, if money were provided, and those which must necessarily be deferred until the two following years.

They reported that the amount required in the several States for new works should be divided between extensions ancl reconstructions of existing serto have investigated, I shall see that invices.

They also submitted schedules showing the estimated expenditure on the various works, prepared on the assumption that it would be spread over three years, and that the funds would be available at any time during that period. In accordance with my instructions, they 'reported that they had prepared schedules of expenditure based on the requirements necessary to bring about a state of thorough efficiency in the telephone and telegraph services of the Commonwealth, as far as it was possible to do so within the three years' period, and that their estimates were for the requirements as known at that time. They pointed out that new demands are dailv being made upon the Department, and they made o'ut the schedule which is now in the hands of honourable members. have had nothing to do with its preparation. The Conference merely obeyed the instructions given to them to prepare a schedule containing all the most important items necessary for this year, and arranging them in their order of importance.' They recommended that, for the year 1909-10, upwards of £600,000 should be expended; for 1910-11, £910,600; and for 1911-12, £525,000. pending this year in excess of the amount expended last year? £300,000. penditure is something like £300,000 of what the Conference proposed? posing to expend £663,000, less £89,000, which it is estimated cannot be expended during the current financial year, leaving a balance of £564,000, as indicated by the Treasurer, or nearly twice as much as was expended last year. All these works have been reported on, and recommended for exeI have had nothing to do with the preparation of the list. One or two complaints of omissions have been made to me, but having had them investigated, I do not think that I can interfere. If anyhonorable member brings forward an omission from the list of works proposed to be carried out this year which he would like quiries are made, but I did not feel called upon to investigate the multitudinous items in this schedule. I shall be pleased to take a note of any criticisms which honourable members may have to offer, and to do what I can to rectify omissions. wish to take advantage of the statement just made by the Postmaster-General to reiterate my strong objection to the financial policy which has characterized the administration of his Department since the inception of Federation, and which is in evidence in the Estimates now before us. At page 76 of the Budget papers, there-is the statement that the proposals of the Government for the ensuing year involve a payment out of current revenue of £136,000 for buildings and sites in connection with the Department, and £564,000 out of revenue' from the current year under the heading of "" Telegraphs, telephones, and special cables."" These two sums give I us a total of £700,000. That amount is to be paid out of the revenue for the present year for reproductive works which will produce revenue for a long course of years. I am glad that events in connection with the recent Conference of Premiers have made it likely that the Government will not submit a proposal for issuing Treasury bills in connection with these Estimates, because the project of raising money in that way, on the ground of a deficiency in the revenue for the current year at a time when that revenue has to bear the burden of an expenditure of £700,000, on works of utility, which will be used for at least thirty years, is to my mind a system of finance which cannot be justified J either on the part of a political assembly or a body of business men. If the affairs of the commercial community of Australia were conducted upon such principles, the business of the Commonwealth would be reduced to universal confusion and ruin.

In this way we are absolutely destroying the efficiency of the Department in some cases. Since the establishment of Federation, a committee of experts was appointed to determine the amount that would be required to place the Post and Telegraph Department in a position to carry out its work efficiently. That committee reported that such efficiency could not be secured unless there was an expenditure on the Department of something like £2,000,000. report, this pernicious system 'of starving and crippling the Department in the attempt to pay out of current res'enue burdens which should be distributed over a number of years has been persisted in, and has reduced the convenience of the public to a minimum, has been a source of widespread disgust and irritation, and is absolutely without justification. It is a kind of finance that would disgrace an establishment of juveniles, and I am sorry that it has been perpetuated and intensified in these Estimates. Millions of money in excess of the three-fourths of Customs and Excise revenue to which they were entitled have teen returned to the States, and surely those who do not believe in borrowing might well have applied some of that surplus revenue to placing our Federal services on a satisfactory footing. We must all take our share of responsibility for having allowed the Department to become a by-word throughout the length and breadth of Australia. Its officers have been exposed to all sorts of criticism. And for what reason ? Because they have not had a chance to do their work honestly and fairly. It would be just as ridiculous to ask an expert to do his work without the requisite machinery as it is to expect the officials of the Post and Telegraph Department, and especially those of the Telephone Branch of the service, to carry on their arduous duties under present conditions. Those engaged in the Telephone Branch of the service throughout Australia have most arduous duties to perform, and they are held up to universal odium, not because they are inefficient or unfaithful, but because they have never had a chance to transact public business in a proper way. The first reason for this is that the appliances necessary for effectively carrying on the telephone service have never yet been supplied. We must take the responsibility for that, and it is our duty to put an end to They cannot so discreditable a state of affairs. The justified on any principle of position is the same in regard to our military service. I cannot dwell on that subject at present, but it is sad to think that the two great administrative Departments which were handed over to the Federal Parliament have been so miserably muddled during the last eight years. interests of the States. unjustifiable. Our rotten system of finance has come to a head when we find on the l n the face of that official one hand a proposal to take out of current revenue this year £700,000 to build works which will last for from thirty to fifty, years, and simultaneously to issue Treasury bills to cover a deficiency in the public revenue. This £700,000 is to be 'charged to the revenue of this year. One of the worse features of finance is the manufacture of deficiencies, and it is for that reason I have expressed my opinion in such strong terms. Sir WILLIA M LYNE (Hume) {2.30] tf we follow the example of the right honourable member for East Sydney, we shall really have another Budget debate, and that is not my desire, although, as yet, I have not spoken on the financial proposals of the Government. However, I may say that I differ entirely from the right honourable member, because I think that this money should be found out of current revenue. We are told that, in consequence of the action of previous Treasurers, the Post and Telegraph Department is in a state of inefficiency j but I ask the right honourable member what was his attitude when I endeavoured to obtain money in order to put matters right ?

Indeed, they are putrid; but he has done nothing to help me to establish a national postal banking system which would place them on a sound basis. A vast amount of credit must be raised to operate our potential activities. The Postmaster-General and the Treasurer hardly know where to look for it. We sit helpless; although we have the power to create it, we have not the brains to concentrate, solidify, combine, and utilize it for the benefit of the people. This year £5,132,000 will have to be expended for which there is no provision in the Estimates, and next year £17,000,000 more. For the Dreadnought £2,000,000 will be needed. member not to discuss that matter now. reserve for the Budget discussion the statement which I have prepared. If .we had our financial institutions operated by the Commonwealth and the States, we could say to the Postmaster-General, "" You shall have a credit on the ledger of £2,000,000 to carry out these great public works which Australia requires."" There is a vast difference between doing that and floating Treasury bonds, or raising a loan. The same rate of interest must be chargeable3J or 4 per cent -bu t under my proposal it would be payable only on balances. The receipts from the Departments would be continually going into the Government banking institution, and the money taken out on Saturday to pay the working men would filter through tradespeople back to the bank before 3 o'clock on Monday afternoon, ready to be loaned out again next day. member is not in order in discussing these matters now. sire to give the Committee information regardingfinancewhich it very much needs. wish to know from the Postmaster-General whether provision has been made for a telepartment exhausting its energies in caterphone from Allvnbrook to Lostock.

I hoped that the Labour party would ha.ve constructed it. not long enough in office. very weak Government if it could not construct a few miles of telephone in six months, especially where the local residents are so public spirited that they are prepared to meet nearly the whole cost. Apparently Ministers are overridden by their officers. The line would serve a large dairying district, which, is rapidly growing in importance. The people there are now at great inconvenience when sickness or accidents occur, because they cannot easily communicate with medical men. tricts are in the same position. certainly entitled to the communication asked for. I hope that the Postmaster General will give attention to its request. The cost of the work would not be much, because, as I have pointed out, the local residents are prepared to bear their share of it, though I do not think that they should be' called upon to do so.

241,Mr Mahon (Coolgardie) [3.1],"W egiving scanty attention, if any at all, to the .needs of pioneer settlements in the remote parts of Australia. That policy must be reversed if justice is to be done. Now, I wish to refer to an argument used by the right honourable member for East Sydney just now, and previously by the honourable member for Parkes, that all these works, costing about £1,050,000, should be constructed out of loan moneys. While it may be desirable to separate capital and revenue accounts in business, and in the commercial departments of government, it must be remembered that in many of the items which we are now considering the works are merely being renewed. Many of the undertakings are not new works. The argument might be sound and valid, if all the works in this schedule were being undertaken where nothing existed before. j£S7>53° for the construction and extension of telegraph lines, instruments, and materials. Here the only new work is the extension of an existing line; so that a great part of the vote is merely for the purpose uf restoring machinery and gear which is no longer serviceable. It is an absolutely unsound principle to borrow money to restore works of that kind. They should be renewed from current revenue. A homely parallel will enforce this truth. Take the case of a man who borrows £100 to purchase a waggon and pair of horses. At the end of ten years the horses have gone to the knacker and the waggon is worn out. If he proposed to borrow a second £ 1 0 0 to acquire a new team, without having repaid the original loan, no money lender would listen to him. He would be told that he should hare put aside a part of his earnings to purchase a new team. And this is what we should do to meet the outlay required to replace obsolete and wornout appliances. We have, perhaps, gone rather far in the past in paying for new works that will last many years out of one year's earnings. But that, at any rate, -was an error on the right side We must ; not allow the pendulum to swing entirely in the other direction under the pressure of fallacious reasoning or an inexact understanding of the facts. The principle that should guide us is clear. New works, of a permanent character, should be debited to the future, but all repairs ancl renewals of existing works should be paid for out of current revenue. -Last year, out of £21,290 appropriated for "" construction and extension of telegraph lines, instruments and materials,"" only £14,786 was spent, leaving a balance unspent of £6,504. That is most singular, in view of the fact that nearly every district in New South Wales has asked for the extension and improvement of telegraph lines and instruments within its' borders. For the last three years I have been agitating for additional telegraph lines, in the shape of duplications of old lines, repairs, or extensions, and have been met on each occasion with the stereotyped reply that no funds were available. I accepted that as correct, but now, to my surprise, I find that no less than £6,504 voted last year for the purpose was not spent. Why was that? It may be that the Department, although they asked for the money, did not know where' they were goTake, for instance, the item of ing to spend it, or they may not have had sufficient men to carry out the work. In either case, the matter calls for serious consideration by the Committee. We are asked now to increase the vote from ,£21,290 to £37,530, but if the Department could not spend within £6,000 of the amount they had last year, how are they going to spend the increased sum this year? I am disposed to think that, even if the amount were much larger, it could be spent, and the work carried out with the greatest advantage to the people and the Department; but there seems to be a great lack of efficiency somewhere, if the sum of £6,000 could not be spent in one of the most important branches of the service. The Department has not been as energetic as it ought to have been, not only in pushing on new lines, but in the linking up of existing lines. The people are charged excessive amounts for telephone messages sent over existing telegraph lines by the condenser system, owing to the circuitous way in which the Department does its work. The Department has no proper plan or system, and no definite goal at which it is aiming. Wherever it proposes to construct a new telegraph line, the officers' ought to have in view the probable development of the districts, and make their plans accordingly; but they do not know where their own lines are, how close their duplicate lines are to each other, or where alternate circuits might be made. I find that the Department nas no map of a later date than IQOO to show where the telegraph and telephone lines of the State of New South Wales are, and consequently it is working largely in the dark.",34,Postmaster General S Department
242,Mr John Thomson (Cowper) [3.6].,"My experience of the Department is that it loses sight of the importance of keeping its instruments up-to-date. It is using the same type of instruments as it used thirty years ago. It follows the expensive method of putting up a duplicate line where it might put in a. duplex instrument. It spends hundreds of pounds in. the one case, where £40 Or £50 spent on a duplex instrument would give better results. The whole Department, and particularly the mechanical branch, is a long way from being up to date. It is the duty of thechief electrical engineer, and the electrical engineers of the States, to keep all their instruments up-to-date. At many of the important telegraph offices in New South Wales the officers do not know what a duplex instrument is. Their telegraph poles are loaded up with lines, whereas they could do the work better on a few lines by the introduction of. duplex or quadruplex instruments instead of the old Morse instrument. The Department is also absolutely out of date in its material, lt does everything in the old-fashioned way that was in vogue when telegraphy was first introduced, whereas the introduction of instruments of a later date would not only save cost in construction, but would expedite the business of the country, and enable the work .to be done more efficiently. ing the absolute absurdity of some of the It is proposed to increase the amount for the construction and extension of telegraph lines, instruments, and materials this year by only £22,744 over the amount spent last year. That is an absurdly small increase, for there is nothing like the length if you want to telephone 4^ miles of telegraph lines in New South Wales that there ought to he, and that sum will not nearly meet the requirements. If the amount voted cannot be spent, it is quite time the Postmaster-General inquired whether the.person in charge of the spending branch of the Department could not be replaced by a man who would do th« work more efficiently and bring the services the direct course. The same state of up to date. It is proposed to spend this year £38,361 more than was spent last year in New South Wales, on the construction and extension of telephone lines, instruments, and materials, but in face of the number of applications for extensions of the telephone system in that State, that amount is only a bagatelle, for the Postmaster-General and his Deputy in Sydneyknow that necessary works of that kind have been hung up for years. They have accumulated till they have gone almost beyond counting, and I am sure that every Mr John honourable member can produce instances to bear out what 1 say. I fail to see how the arrears are going to be overtaken this year by a paltry increase of £39,000 in the vote. It is not as if they were works which ought not to be undertaken. Most, if not all of them, have been reported on as being payable. If any of them are not payable, the public are always asked to give a guarantee, and their guarantees are now ready and can be utilized to make the undertakings financially sound. The increased vote for all these purposes for New South Wales this year will not give any* thing like the adequate service to which the public are entitled, and, judging by last year's experience, even that amount will not be spent. The question of whether the money cannot be spent on more up-todate instruments, instead of following obsolete methods, deserves the serious consideration, not only of the Postmaster-General, but of this Committee. -The one Department, which above all others needs a thorough investigation into the whole of its system, is the Postmaster General's Department. It is impossible to ^o through the country districts in any of the States without seemethods now followed. The telephone rates between district and district furnish a striking instance. At one place in Tasmania, vou can telephone about 12 miles to Hobart for a penny; but in the other direction, it costs 9d. That is due to the absurd way in which the line is looped. There is a direct line in the one case, but in the other the line follows a most circuitous course, and the Department charge on the mileage rate instead of having regard to the distance by affairs no doubt exists in many parts of the Commonwealth. Year after year we are invited to pass certain items which are said to be of the greatest urgency, and when the Estimates of the succeeding year are presented we find that a very considerable proportion of the amounts so voted have not been expended. Either the votes are unnecessary or the Ministry have no intention of carrying out the works to which they relate, and the Department is not prepared to deal with them. Whatever the reason, the Committee is placed in a most Thomson. unfortunate position, and I trust that the",35,Postmaster General S Department
243,Mr Mcwilliams (Franklin) [3.15].,"Government will see that in future works for which provision is made on the Estimates are carried out during the year, so that it will be unnecessary to ask for a number of re-votes. I trust that the Postmaster-General will give his special attention to this matter, and' obtain from his officers a definite explanation as to why works which were declared in some cases last year and in others the year before to be urgent, and for which provision was accordingly made, have not yet been carried out. Proposed vote agreed to. Subdivision 2 (yictoria), £219,476. [3.18] I hope that there is on the part of the Postmaster-General an earnest desire that the appropriations to which we are now agreeing shall be expended during the current year. Owing to the want of funds many men have been dismissed from the Department, although there are urgent works to toe carried out; and I trust that it is the intention of the Government to push on with these various undertakings. A great deal has been said as to the mismanagement of the service, and laymen certainly cannot fail to have noticed that the engineers of the Department are very fond of seeing their works in the air. In other words, they insist upon overhead wires, although it has been recognised by practical men in the Commonwealth and in other countries that the undergrounding of wires is the more effective and economical method. I am aware that the conduit system is necessary in our cities, but a cheaper method might be adopted in the suburbs. I am told that the undergrounding of the cables could be carried out at a cost of about 10s. 6d. per wire. Any number of wires may be carried in the redgum or pottery cases that are laid down, ancl it is strange that the engineers have not adopted that system, which is cheaper and less dangerous than the overhead system so largely resorted to. The wires in the suburbs of Melbourne have been cabled in many cases, but that work is not so general as is desirable from the stand-poinf of efficiency and economy. I recognise that the political head of the Department must be guided by the advice of his officers. We employ practical men, and if the Ministerial head is not to accept their advice, it is not worth received that if was found absolutely neceswhile retaining their services. Nevertheless, the honourable gentleman should exercise the knowledge that he acquit es in the Department, and see that the system of undergrounding wires is more generally adopted. The tendency nowadays is to do away as much as possible with the overhead system. It is a peculiar fact that, although timber for boxes is plentiful in Western Australia, pottery cases imported from Victoria are used there in connection with the underground system, whereas cases made of timber, largely imported from another State, are used in Victoria. now being made in Western Australia.. the fact that this has been done suggests that the responsible officers are not carrying out the work on common-sense principles. They may say that what is good in Victoria is useless in Western Australia, but surely if the pottery-ware system is found more economical in Western Australia, where there is a plentiful supply of jarrah and redgum, it must be cheaper than the wood-box system in Victoria. I have had to complain more than once of the extravagance of the Department in using copper wire for telephone lines, although iron wire is just as suitable for the purpose. The difference between the cost of copper and iron wire is as i j d . to iod., and yet we find that copper wire is almost universally used in our short services. The theorist may argue that the conductivity of copper wire is greater than is that of iron wire; but I would remind the Committee that the telephone line to Bacchus Marsh, which is some twenty-five miles long, is of iron wire, and that it is one of the best in or about Melbourne. Many people urge that it would be unnecessary to resort to the policy of borrowing to make the service effective if greater economy were observed, and I have no doubt that a number of the complaints made in regard to the telephone system are due to the fact that, instead of having a complete circuit, only' single wires are used. The honourable member for Maribyrnong, and also the honourable member for Eden Monaro, when holding office as Postmaster General, endeavoured to secure the general introduction of the circuit system in order to obtain greater efficiency in the telephone service, but so many applications to lie connected with the various exchanges were sary to use only single wires and to earth them at the subscribers' residences, instead of returning their, and earthing them",36,Postmaster General S Department

245,Mr Mathews (Melbourne Ports),,37,Postmaster General S Department
246,Mr Fowlee,The pottery cases are,37,Postmaster General S Department
247,Mr Mathews,"That may be so, butat the exchanges. I hope that now that sufficient funds have been made available, the circuit system will be adopted. The Department at the present time does not place on the one line two subscribers engaged in the same business. stance, the subscriber who shares my wire is a produce dealer on a large scale, and I can often hear him talking more distinctly about orders for onions than I can hear the man who is endeavouring to speak to me at the other end of the wire. A stop should he put to that system, and the remedy is to provide every subscriber with ""a double wire which will be earthed at the exchanges. We may not be able to convince the theorists of the Department that this is the best system, but I think the suggestion is worthy the attention of the Postmaster-General, who I am sure is anxious to make the service as perfect as possible. Several efforts have been made to-day to induce the Government to resort to a policy of borrowing, but if those who are opposed to that policy can show that the demand for more funds is due to inability on the part of some officials to prohowever, that the fault lies, not with the perly discharge their duties, and the waste that goes on, they cannot be expected to give even sympathetic consideration to the proposal. I am opposed to borrowing, believing it to be unnecessary if proper precautions are taken to secure economy in the administration of the Departments. There is also an absence of economy in erecting the wires on poles, instead of havber. ing them laid in cables underground I should like the officials to take notice of the facts I have mentioned, because they have been subject to great condemnation, and, unless they improve in the near future, I am afraid there may be more serious results, especially if their action arises from sheer perverseness, and a mistaken idea that all their work is perfect. It has been proved that the conductivity of iron wire for short distances is all that is necessary, and that the life of such wire is of great length. For instance, a galvanized-iron wire was laid down ih connection with the Age office twenty-six or twenty-seven years ago, and, so far as I know, it is in use now. Further, we know that the atmosphere has a certain effect on wires, and that the sag varies according to the material used A traveller who was here for some time expressed surprise that between two poles could be observed different wires, varying from 500 lbs. to .66 lbs., which meant, of course, varying Mr Mathews. degrees of sagging. As a layman, I have no desire to condemn the officials, but I do claim to have ordinary common sense, and I think that when the facts are made known they will take some lessons from For in the experience of the past. that the honourable member is wrong ! I cannot complain. No doubt they will say that I have had no practical experience, but my retort is that they are theorists, pure and simple, and rely on what is done in other countries, without paying due regard to the different 'effects on the wires of the atmosphere of this part of the world. As a matter of fact, I suppose it is quite possible that there is a difference in the effects of the atmosphere as between Queensland and Victoria; and this should be taken into account. Without charging the officials with any want of ability, we may assume that they either have too much to do, or that those who are under them do not furnish the necessary reports. I am inclined to think, under-foremen and others, who do the practical work, but with the heads of the Department. the Postal Commission that he and his officers were continually making tests on the lines suggested by the honourable mempractical man ought to do. In Melbourne, there seems to be an absence, not of a desire to do the work, but of an organizing head to devise proper methods of securing efficiency and economy. In any case, it is evident there is something wrong. I ask the Postmaster-General, as soon as these Estimates are passed, to put the works in hand, so that employment may be provided. The Postmaster-General is to be commended for his attempts to grapple with the great problem of the re-organization of the Department, more particularly when he is without the report of the Postal Commission. But the vote appears to me to be altogether inadequate to bring the Department to a proper state of efficiency, only £180,000 more than was voted last year appearing on the Estimates. The Postmaster-General has, I ""think, taken the right course in calling his officers, together; and I understand that those gentlemen",37,Postmaster General S Department

253,Mr Sampson (Wimmera) [3.35],"have reported that about £600,000 will be required each year, for three years, in order to raise the Department to the proper standard. The officers have drawn attention to what they call the most important work; but there is only one means by which this great business concern can be -made efficient, and that is by voting the necessary money to carry out the necessary, though, it may be, not the most important services. Even since the Estimates have been before us I have received a communication to the effect that a very necessary work, which has been approved by the Department as one likely to prove profitable, cannot be proceeded with until next year, because no provision has been made for it this year, although it has been in contemplation for two years. Serious consideration should be given to the suggestion by the right honourable member for East Sydney, that the Department ought to be conducted on purely business lines, and, as in Great Britain, dissociated altogether from the calculations of the ordinary revenue and expenditure in the Budget. tricts fare under such a system? in Australia, the authorities in England, when important and reproductive works are required in country districts, provide for them in a business way with borrowed money. If that were done here, I am convinced that 90 per cent, of the requirements of Australia could be met, though I am quite willing to admit that there are sparsely even in principle; and, as a Ministerial settled portions of the country where i * would not be reasonable to expect services to pay from the outset. In my opinion, the great financial strength of the Department should be brought to bear, in order to develop the remoter districts; and some of the large profits earned in the metropolitan area might be used in this way with benefit to the country industries, which build up the national wealth and make the city profitable. would be no need to borrow. to borrow in order to carry out reproductive works, which are interest bearing, and would be immediately profitable. Instances have been brought under my notice of services of the kind that would pay as soon as constructed, but, up to the present, the Department has failed to take the proper business view and grip of the position. I hope that the Postmaster-General, in the light of this discussion, may find it advisable to bring down Supplementary Estimates, in order that this great Department, with -the difficulties of which he is so heroically grappling, may be brought to a state of efficiency. member favour Treasury bills? works. Department can be run on heroics. The correct thing to do is to tell the people what is necessary, and to make provision for it, though I have heard nothing from any Minister during the discussion to indicate that more money is needed. I desire to facilitate the passing of these Estimates as expeditiously as possible; but it is most inadvisable, if we desire to discuss the financial business of the Commonwealth, to endeavour to rush them through on the plea that there are people out of work. honourable 'member that a general discussion was allowed on the first item, and that he must now confine himself to the subdivision immediately before us. marks with the question by referring to the plea that, until the Estimates are passed, some persons who are dependent on the Department will lack work, and urging that such a plea is not sufficient. No opportunity is presented to discuss matters in detail, or supporter has suggested, if the Government are not in a position to go on with the works, these Estimates ought to be withdrawn, with a view to submitting others. In my opinion, the whole of the Estimates should have been withdrawn until the Government had brought in the new financial proposals which, I understand, are to be submitted. sirous that the Works Estimates shall be passed early, so that, next year, we may not have so many re-votes. There should have been available more than one copy of the schedule prepared by the Minister showing what works are covered by. the items in these subdivisions.

Subdivision 7 (Wireless Telegraphy), £10,000, agreed to. Division7 (Government Printing Office), £ 8 0 0 ; division 8 (Stamp Printing), £3,400; division 9 (Rifle Clubs and Ranges), £18,272; division 10 (Special De-fence Material), £78,150; and division 11 (New Special Defence Provision), £121,000, agreed to. Division 12 (Expenses in connection with acquisition of site for offices of the Comwhy the item should be struck out. 'monwealth in London), £5,000. This item is apparently included for no specific purpose, and no explanation of it has been given. surer) [4.11] I shall be glad to explain the item. Last year £5,000 was appropriated for this purpose, and only £635 was spent. That was in connection with arrangements that afterwards fell through. At present, so far as I know, the Government have no proposal in hand in regard to the matter, but a sum of £5,000 has been included in these Estimates so as not to abandon altogether the project of securing in London a site for Commonwealth officesa proposal that found a good deal of acceptance among honourable members last year. Of course, nothing can be done to bind the Government and the country to the acquisition of a site without the approval of Parliament, nor have the Government any idea of doing so. At the same time we might well keep this sum on the Estimates, because it is possible that -offers that would of course be placed before Parliament may be made. The position now is not very different from what it was last year when a similar sum was voted. I assure honourable members that the Government do not desire to enter into any binding arrangement with anybody without such arrangement being subject to the full concurrence of Parliament, and we may fairly ask the Committee to trust us in this matter. Anything we do will be subject to the full concurrence of Parliament. The existence of this vote will not lead us to do anything that we should not do if it were not passed. Preliminary arrangements are always entered into by Governments in regard to any matter which they consider to be in the interests of the country. I have no information that will justify me in saying that the Government have anything in view in this regard at the present moment, but we do not know what may happen, and if anything does happen there is no reason why we should not have this vote. Provision is often made for things that may happen without any present intention of spending the money. I am prepared to give an assurance on behalf of the Government that we have no intention of taking any binding action in this matter except subject to the full concurrence of Parliament, and in those circumstances there is no reason After the Treasurer's explanation nothing short of striking out the item will meet the case. The right honourable gentleman said the Government did not intend to do anything, and why then in a time of financial stress, should they want to put £5,000 aside for no purpose. We could make better, use of the money"". . If it does happen that a site is offered, and it becomes necessary to make investigations and prepare specifications, the Treasurer has an advance of £200,000 which can be used for the purpose. I do not question the Treasurer's word, but the item was brought under the attention of the Prime Minister and the Government earlier in the afternoon. The Treasurer now says in effect: "" We have nothing in our minds; we do not contemplate doing anything, but we ask the Committee to permit this sum of £5,000 to remain idle for twelve months."" Treasurer had to seriously consider how the Commonwealth was to meet its obligations, and had decided to ask the Parliament to agree to the issue of Treasury, bonds, he placed this item on the Estimates, although he did not know what it was for. At all events, he has not told the Committee what is the object of the item.
