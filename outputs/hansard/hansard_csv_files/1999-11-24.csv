My electorate of Chisholm is home to two CSIRO sites and two leading educational institutions-Monash and Deakin universities. Therefore, I was most disturbed upon hearing about the resignation of Professor Davies, the Dean of Science at Monash University. It has been alleged that Professor Davies was pressured to resign due to his opposition to budget cuts that have seen at least 70 full-time academic and general staff lose their jobs. One of the faculty employees is so outraged that they asked me to raise this matter in parliament. These allegations of intimidation are very concerning and demand further investigation, as they are undoubtedly affecting staff morale. A recent article in the Monash Campus Review states: The faculty has thus lost over one-third of its staff in under five years. ""Funding for the faculty of science has been drastically and disproportionately reduced,"" Davies said. ""Further cuts will mean that science is no longer viable at Monash. We will not be able to offer the full range of courses and some departments will go to the wall."" This is also an illustration of the enonnous pressures placed on universities struggling to cope with increased demands with fewer resources. The way ahead must lie in new ideas, more research and the marketing of Australian made inventions and products. As Labor leader, Kim Beazley, says, we need to develop ourselves as the 'knowledge nation'. However, there is one key ingredient for achieving this which, as a country, we do not currently have: a federal government that is committed to resourcing and supporting research institutions in our quest to develop new industries. This government showed its hand very early by cutting a massive $800 million from higher education in the 1996 budget, slashing R&D incentives for business and, more recently, suggesting a new income stream for universities-a loans scheme that disadvantages students who can least afford it. In his infamous cabinet submission, even Dr Kemp has admitted: Universities are facing higher studentstaffratios, less frequent lecture and tutorial contact, the persistence of outdated technology and gaps in key areas of professional preparation. In my electorate of Chisholm, Monash University has suffered a range of cuts which staff say are threatening students' choice of subjects and undergraduate programs and will lead to a long-tenn decline in the quality of both teaching and graduates. This is most disturbing. It comes on top of cuts to the ruts faculty and also recent cuts to CSIRO, most particularly in the division of forestry. Where are we going with our research in this country? If we do not put money into these areas, we will suffer. As the government said in its recent green paper, this will just lead to a continued brain drain, and our best and brightest will continue to go overseas. It is about time the government viewed targeted spending in education as an investment in our future rather than a negotiable item to enhance the budget bottom line.",136,Pairs
228,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Nehl) Took The Chair At 9.40 A.m.,"Wednesday, 24 November 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 12591 Our future prosperity is tied to Australia reaching out to new industries and capitalising on our wealth of people and knowledge. Until the federal government reassesses its ideologically driven desire to cut government services such as universities, Australia risks falling behind in the race to invent, innovate and stake out our place in the world as a 'knowledge nation'. (Time expired) Drugs: How to Drug Proof your Kids Program Program. Two programs of this type have taken place in Mitchell. The program involves parents who really can make a huge difference in the protection of children against drugs, gives the whole concept of the fight against drugs broader ownership, equips and assists parents with information and provides techniques and confidence. Parents have the compassion and the will; what they lack is understanding and confidence in many instances. The first meeting on How.to Drug Proof your Kids was attended by 400 parents in Castle Hill. The purpose of that meeting was to train or identify facilitators. Six hundred facilitators· have been trained throughout Australia. Their purpose is to get together with smaller groups of parents-about 20 parents-and work through a six-week program which is fully researched, fully Australian and a very positive program. The purpose of the program is to equip and empower parents with practical skills. Parents' roles have often been underestimated. Where parents are involved in the process of drug prevention, the risk factors for teenage drug use have been reduced. Parents are part of the solution but have been neglected by most programs to date. I have discussed these matters with the state Minister for Education and Training, Mr John Aquilina, and I will be looking forward to his response to having all schools in New South Wales offering How to Drug Proof your Kids as an option for parent programs in schools. The success in the Castle Hill area has been magnificent. A recent study of six schools examining the drug prevention lessons for children to complete at home with their parents showed the best outcome. The children reported significantly less perceived peer use of alcohol, tobacco and marijuana as well as significantly less susceptibility to peer pressure to experiment with cigarettes. Fathers, interestingly enough, also reported significantly greater motivation to help their children avoid drug use. The program, as I have said, is a six-week program for parents. There are notes, exercises and discussion points. Broadly, the program runs through the topics of why kids take drugs, how to educate kids to make good choices, prevention tools for parents, learning to intervene and where to get help, and a parents guide to handling relapses back into the drug scene. It is an excellent program. I recommend it to all members. The program is available for members to get behind, to promote and to run in their electorates. I thank Barry Denton and the team at Castle Hill for their interest in this important topic. (Time expired) Rural Doctor Retention Payment Scheme Retention Payment Scheme. Like the Central West Gippsland Division of General Practice, I want to indicate that I have serious misgivings about the scheme and how the government proposes to apply it..

I think in this case it is simply",140,Representatives Main Committee

230,Mr Zahra (Mcmillan),"TodayI want to raise serious concerns about the Rural Doctor12592 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 24 November 1999 that the government does not care enough to know, because in the application of this scheme it seems that it has made a number of significant blunders. From the original advice received, it was understood that the payments would be available and of benefit to all GPs who practised in any rural area in Australia, in accordance with their practice town category. This now turns out to not be the case, and the people in my electorate stand to miss out significantly as a result of this. Amongst the most serious concerns I have about the application of this scheme is the fact that it would appear that the government has based its decision not to include significant areas in my electorate in the program on incorrect statistics. I would like to point out some of them to the chamber in the time allotted today. The basis for its decision was that Moe's hospital existed. Moe's hospital was closed by the Kennett government about 18 months ago. So that is not true. It also assumed that there was a population centre in my electorate called Thomson and that there was a 40-bed hospital there. That does not exist either. There has not been a popUlation centre named Thomson in the history of the Gippsland region. It also assumed that Traralgon had two hospitals, one for acute illness and one for mental illness. They both closed due to the privatisation process that the Kennett government initiated and were replaced by a hospital in Traralgon West. Traralgon West, it should be pointed out, is outside Traralgon. So there are not benefits associated with the Traralgon community being able to access it. I also understand that the Latrobe Valley, which consists of the main townships of Moe, MorweII, Churchill and Traralgon as well as a number of smaIIer towns and villages, has been lumped together and considered as a major regional centre similar to Ballarat, Bendigo or Geelong. This is clearly incorrect, as there are distances of several kilometres between each of these towns. There are numerous other anomalies and inconsistencies which I do not have time to deal with today. I also point out that the GP ARIA Index is not complete and that it is not a satisfactory index for identifying which areas are in need of this type of support, because it does not take into .consideration socioeconomic status. In the Latrobe Valley and West Gippsland, we do need this program to work for us. We have just as many concerns as other regions right across Australia, yet because of the rigid administration of the Rural Doctor Retention Payment Scheme we will miss out. This is clearly inequitable. (Time expired) Second Sydney Airport: Badgerys Creek Daily Telegraph earlier this week, subtitled 'Pressure builds on Badgerys', about Sydney aircraft noise problems. I would like to make a couple of points. An airport at Badgerys Creek will not solve -ydney's airport noise problems; it will merely duplicate those problems. It is a fallacy to think that by building an airport at Badgerys Creek we will relieve the aircraft noise problems of Sydney. In fact, the EIS itself has said an airport at Badgerys Creek will not reduce aircraft noise; it may just briefly cap them. The problem of noise duplication is in addition to the obvious problems of air quality in Western Sydney. Ozone levels and fine particulates would increase dramatically as a result of an airport in Western Sydney-not to mention the problems of the cost of $6 billion to build an airport and the impossibility of trying to create adequate infrastructure to link an airport at Badgerys Creek with Sydney. The answer to Sydney's aircraft needs is not to duplicate the problems in Western Sydney; it is to better use KSA until we can provide longer term solutions. Kingsford Smith airport is not being used efficiently. Over 30 per cent of the flights in and out of Mascot airport are",141,Representatives Main Committee
231,Mr Bartlett (Macquarie},"I would like to take this time to respond to an article in theWednesday, 24 November 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 12593 planes with a capacity of 30 passengers or less. The average number of passengers in a flight in and out of Sydney is less than 70. World best practice is well over 100 and, in fact, it is approaching 200. Until we use Kingsford Smith airport more effectively for international flights, it is ridiculous to think of building another international airport in the Sydney basin. Sydney is the gateway to Australia. Tourists visiting Australia want to land in Sydney; they do not want to land at Badgerys Creek-l Y2 hours west of Sydney. We need to work on more effectively using the resources that we have got-using Kingsford Smith more effectively. A solution to this is to move a lot of the lighter aircraft out pf Kingsford Smith, thus allowing maximum capacity and landing rights for the larger aircraft. Moving some of the regional and lighter planes out to Bankstown is a feasible solution. It is not penalising the bush; it gives another option with cheaper landing rights. Therefore, with discounted fares we can actually give greater choice to people from the bush wanting to fly to Sydney. Those wanting to pay existing premium fares can continue to have the option of landing at KSA; those who want cheaper, discounted fares can, in fact, choose to land at Bankstown which, with more effective infrastructure connections, could be only 20 minutes out of the CBD. The answer is to use Kingsford Smith more effectively so that we can buy time-perhaps 15 or 20 years-to more effectively develop long-term solutions, instead of rushing into a hasty, unpractical, unviable, costly and environmentally destructive airport at Badgerys Creek, which people do not want and which will not solve our problems. (Time expired) Channel9 is tourism. How sad it is to see the local member from that area arguing for tourist operators to be denied access to international and domestic tourists through the second airport in Sydney. He wants to hurt tourist operators in his own electorate-a shameful thing for a local member of parliament. On another matter, the 60 Minutes program has once more shown itself to be unfit to broadcast current affairs in this country. It is unable to separate its editorial policy from the commercial interests of its owner. Its segment three Sundays ago concerning digital TV was a disgrace to the notion of journalistic independence. 60 Minutes failed to report the [mdings of the Productivity Commission, which are adverse of course to the Packer media group. It failed to show the very small difference in quality between high definition and standard definition TV. It failed to explain the prohibitive cost of high definition and the way in which it would deny Australian households fair access to other TV options, datacasting and the Internet. The Packers hate competition and, mark my words, high definition is a closed shop in TV. Channel9 is a shameless mouthpiece for the pecuniary views of the Packer organisation and, in particular, for its vendetta against Mr Paul Keating. This was evident once again early last month. On4 October, James Packer said that Mr Keating should either sue the Packer family or put their feud aside. The next night on a loaded segment on the Nightline program, Paul Lyneham, as is his style, parroted the Packer view, arguing that Keating has not sued. It is absurd for Channel9 to argue that Mr Keating needs to take the civil remedy of defamation to prove his point in this matter. This has never been a standard of proof the Packer family has applied to itself. The next time James Packer and his parrot, Paul Lyneham, engage in such an argument, they might like to think of this: if defamation proceedings are needed to prove one's innocence,",142,Representatives Main Committee

He has had more tax schemes than I have had hot lunches. But, then again, the Packers have never been keen on paying their fair share of tax, anymore than they have been keen on facing up to their fair share of market competition in the TV industry. Brisbane: Soorley Administration representing people-if you smack of arrogance, they sort you out. We saw it at the end of the Keating era; objective commentators would say that that was what was the end of Jeff Kennett. The referendum yes case died because those who were promoting it were inside their comfort zone, satisfied they were right, without going out to talk to those who may have disagreed. In fact, since then they have been saying to Australians who voted no, 'You are stupid or un-Australian.' That sort of arrogance does not go down very well in my electorate, and a lot of ordinary Australians are very angry with those who are making such statements. We see arrogance in my electorate also in the Soorley city hall administration in Brisbane. They are an administration which tells you rather than listens to YOQ. They are causing people a great deal of harm and grief by their consultation style, which is essentially to mock up consultation and then to tell you what they think they have found out. People are starting to speak out. In fact, the response from the community is amazing. Ordinary citizens in Brisbane are now saying to the Liberal Party, 'We would like to be candidates because of what is happening in our streets and in our suburbs. The Soorley administration is not listening to us. ' Residents in Beverley Hills Street, Moorooka, were told earlier this year that they had been consulted over matters to do with a bus route going down their street when, in simple terms, they were not asked. A resident from that street, Stephen Walker, is now standing as the Liberal candidate in Moorooka ward. They were also told that traffic calming issuesroundabouts, speed bumps and so forth-had come about as a result of consultation in their street and their area, and of course that is not the case. In Yeronga West there were. bus route changes which brought about such strange things as not even putting a bus stop at the local shopping centre-in fact, the bus went past the shopping centre at about 60 kilometres an hour-and even produced a bus stop on Fairfield Road where a bus does not even go past. These were the great results of the Soorley city council's consultation with the communityconsultations that never took place-but of course people are being told that they were asked. People in Salisbury are angry, as well, that their buses are few and far between and that they wait an hour to get from Moorooka to Salisbury on the local buses which used to serve them far better. Now we find the local councillor in Moorooka ward and the local state member in Archerfield saying that, if the federal government does not build noise barrier fencing along Riawena Road, Salisbury, something is wrong. The simple fact is that, if those particular levels of government-local and state-were to put a submission to the federal government for funding for noise barrier fencing along Riawena Road, Salisbury, perhaps something could happen.",143,Representatives Main Committee

They deserve to go. The people will speak in March next year. time for members' statements has concluded. Second Reading Debate resumed from 22 September, on motion by Mr Truss: That the bill be now read a second time. Mr O'CONNOR (Corio) (9.58 a.m.)-I do not intend to take too much of the committee's time in dealing with this particular piece of legislation. The main purpose of the National Residue Survey Levies Regulations (Validation and Commencement of Amendments) Bi111999 is to correct an inconsistency between the starting dates of the Primary Industries Levies and Charges (National Residue Swvey Levies) Regulations 1998-the NRS Levy Regulations-and amendments that have been made to these regulations by statutory rule No. 182 of 1998. The National Residue Swvey implements chemical residue monitoring programs and recovers the costs of the programs from participating industries. As far as the meat industry is concerned, these particular levies are mandatory and must be paid by producers. Cost recovery is in the form of a statutory levy. These programs form the basis for documentation that enables the Australian government to certify that raw food products bound for export and domestic consumption are free from significant chemical contamination. This is a very important process, because we are finding in many of the European markets that the demands being put on Australian producers are quite stringent and require that producers supply very accurate and precise information about the level of residues in the product. Last year, the government put through a new act to cover the NRS levies. That act was proclaimed on 8 July 1998. Before this act commenced operation, the industry sought a decrease in the NRS levy for sheep and an increase in the NRS levy on lambs. The government sought to implement this request from the industry by way of regulation, and that is statutory rule No. 182. The date of this regulation was 3 July 1998. In other words, the government was trying to make a regulation under an act that had not been proclaimed. The government was apparently unaware of the problem and collected the levies from sheep and lamb producers at the new rate from 1 August 1998. As a consequence of this inconsistency, sheep traders liable to pay a per head levy on sheep transactions were unintentionally liable for a higher levy rate than that collected from 1 August 1998. Lamb traders were technically liable for a lower per head levy rate than that which was collected; The problem only came to light when the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances noted the inconsistency in the dates. On6 May the Chief General Counsel from the Attorney-General's Department delivered an opinion that, because of the inconsistency between the dates, statutory rule No. 182 was invalid. The government amended the regulation as of 1 September 1999 to ensure that the rate currently being collected is that sought by the industry. This fixed the present problem, but it still meant that levies on sheep and lamb",144,Representatives Main Committee
234,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Nehl),"Order! In accordance with standing order 275A, the12596 MAIN COMMITIEE Wednesday, 24 November 1999 collected from 1 August 1998 until 1 September 1999 were at a rate other than prescribed in the legislation. The government had two options on this; it could have refunded the overpayment or retrospectively legislated to validate the rates of the levies collected between 1 August 1998 and 1 September 1999. It has chosen the latter with this piece of retrospective legislation. It is really interesting that, in other forums, the coalition has spoken very strongly against retrospectively legislating on a lot of matters, apd here we have the government doing exactly that. It might not seem a big issue, but the principle that the coalition has enunciated in other forums obviously does not apply in this area. The other issue is the incompetence of the government in this whole process. I think it ought to be put on the public record that this situation was created by that incompetence and it is now being rectified by retrospective legislation. I see that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has chosen to join us in the chamber; I will not regard his presence as a red rag waved at a bull. I was in the minister's electorate the other day. I happened to be in Queensland and was invited up to Hervey Bay. I was invited by the press to make some comments on matters relating to sugar and regional forest agreements. My only regret on the day was that I had not informed the minister that I was coming into his electorate Mr O'CONNOR-Yes, it would have been a massive breach of courtesy. Although the reporter was very anxious for me to comment on those particular issues, I said no, that I had a private reason for coming to the minister's electorate. On that occasion I chose not to comment. I invite the minister to come to Geelong to see our wine and horticultural producers. The port of Geelong is a centre for the distribution of grain throughout the world, the largest bulk handling port. I would welcome the minister to come down at some stage, as I am sure he would welcome me into his electorate, and we will afford each other the usual courtesies of notification. As far as this bill is concerned, I am pleased that the government is rectifying its mistake. It is probably regrettable that it has to be done by means of retrospective legislation. The Sheepmeat Council are in agreement with the measures that are being taken by the government. They are quite happy for this legislation to proceed, so there will be support for the legislation on this occasion. thank the honourable member for his comments on the legislation, the National Residue Survey Levies Regulations (Validation and Commencement of Amendments) Bill 1999, and the indication that the opposition will not oppose it. Thank you also for visiting my electorate, even if it was without my knowledge. I hope you spent some money on the businesses of Hervey Bay so they could benefit from a bit of Victorian capital. Hervey Bay was largely built on Victorian capital as people exited Victoria during its rust bucket days. It now has developed a very strong economy, with much assistance from the people of Victoria. I certainly accept your invitation to reciprocate the visit and I am sure that the same hospitality the people of Hervey Bay extended to you would be available to me in Geelong.",145,Representatives Main Committee

236,Mr Truss (Wide Bay,"Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (10.06 a.m.)-IWednesday, 24 November 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 12597 As the shadow minister indicated in his comments, this is largely a technical bill in that it legitimises what everybody believed the situation always was. There is an element of retrospectivity about it, but it does not retrospectively legislate any disadvantage; it merely puts in place what the industry, the levy players and all those administering the program believed the situation to be until somebody discovered that there was a small technicality which at least some lawyers believed was not adequately addressed in how regulation 182 was put into place. This change follows a specific request from the industry. The new per-head levy rate was to have commenced on 1 August 1998 at the same time the National Residue Survey Levy Regulations were put in place. But, as the honourable member mentioned, the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances was the first to draw attention to the fact that there may be an inconsistency here. The Chief General Counsel confirmed that, while the regulation had been validly made, there was this problem with the commencement date of the regulations. The sheep and lamb industry has recently confirmed its commitments to the levy rates provided for in statutory rule No. 182. The impact on levy players of this technical anomaly will be nil once the bill has been passed, as the levy has been collected since 1 August last year at the rate requested by the industry. I thank the shadow minister for his contribution to the debate and the committee for granting it smooth and rapid passage. It looks like you might get a very early day today. I commend the bill to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. I will put the question forthwith.
