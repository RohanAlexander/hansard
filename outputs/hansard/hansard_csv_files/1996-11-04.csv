I would like to start by quoting from speaker, the member for La Trobe( Mr an article by Peter Robinson in yesterday's Charles), spoke about the demagoguery of the Sun-Herald: Nazi regime and its appeal to prejudice. What we have seen reflected in the mirror of the past few weeks is a nation that is lost. Its pride and We understand that prejudice is there and self-esteem, the very soul of nationhood, have been we understand what it means.

It was a part of being educated. It was a part of recognising businesses. Almost daily the communication revolution ensures that we watch events live, our individual acceptance of some sense of social norm, social mores and social cohesion. whether it be elections or debates or whether it be major catastrophes like those in Zaire or What we are being told now is that that was in other parts of the world.

We are seeing the notion of political correctness. That is a very breaking up of nations in the USSR and in limp excuse and a very limp explanation of a Yugoslavia.
