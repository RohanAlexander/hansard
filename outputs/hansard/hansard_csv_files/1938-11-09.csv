13,Mr Lyons,"In view of what I havetlie rule that public men should avoid being placed in a position in which their personal interests may conflict with their public duty, it would appear that, prima facie, no Minister should be a director of such a company; but this, too, requires some qualification. If the contract which the Government mates with such a company is one which results fro m the exercise of individual judgment or selection, as in the case of the supply of goods of some special kind, it seems clear that a directorship of the company concerned would be inconsistent with the discharge of ministerial duty. But some arrangements which are technically contracts are made on a non-selective or non-discriminating basis. Eor example, at election time routine electoral advertisements are inserted in every newspaper, great and small, in Australia. It would he difficult to suggest that some Minister, who was associated with a newspaper, would, be put into an invidious position simply because that journal accepted, in common with every other newspaper, advertisements of this kind. This consideration leads to the conclusion that, if there is the slightest element of judgment or choice involved in the placing of government business, no Minister should be a director of a company which is the recipient of that business. The second class of company consists of ' of those which have no business dealings Prime Minister, that no member of the with the Government at all. we are to lay down a rule that no a set of circumstances in which his public Cabinet Minister is to have any business duty conflicts with his private interests, or financial interests outside the adminisI ask the Attorney-Generali f he is able tration of his own department, it seems to advise the House as to the directorates impossible to decide that the holding of a which he held previously and subsedirectorship of this class of company is quently relinquished, and those which, he inconsistent with membership of Cabinet. at nresent retains?

In availing myself of this democratic privilege I should like to assure honourable members that I have no desire to delay the ordinary business of the House; but I am impelled to do so owing to the tragic position which has developed throughout a great portion of the wheat-growing areas of the Commonwealth owing to the failure of seasonal rains. The position calls for the active interest of this Parliament and of this Government, because it has been authoritatively stated in the last few days that the total Australian yield of wheat is likely to be 40,000,000 bushels less than of feed, stock is being sacrificed, and as last year. The greater portion of that decrease will be in Victoria. standing optimistic estimates I believe that the yield in that State is more likely to be 10 million bushels than 20 million bushels as has been stated in some quarters. I suggest to the Government that the position can be met by the payment of an acreage bounty to those growers who will get little or no return, and that the money should he made available by the Treasury. The wheat-growers have had to contend not only with drought conditions but also with low prices: and the conditions this year are similar to those which obtained when the Royal Commission on the Wheat Industry conducted its investigations. Owing to the policy of procrastination adopted by the Government rural rehabilitation has been unduly delayed, and debt adjustment payments which were promised have not yet been fully made. This has necessitated State governments having to hold up this important work. I believe that the debt position of the Australian wheat-growers is not much better, if it has improved at all, than it was when the investigation was conducted by the royal commission. The position is serious in the States most affected, and the ability of the State governments to deal with the situation is limited. opinion of many others it is imperative that the Commonwealth should offer co-operation and financial assistance. Honourable members generally should give serious consideration to the gravity of the situation which I believe Mr Wilson. is not fully appreciated. RecentlyI visited wheat-growing areas in my electorate where I saw a state of affairs which can scarcely be envisaged by honourable members who have not had actual experience of the ravages of drought. I saw miles and. miles of wheat lands that have heen sown from which not a grain of wheat will be harvested. In some instances a small return will bo obtained, but probably only sufficient to provide seed wheat for next season. These unfortunate growers will not have any grain to sell, and consequently will not have any income to enable them to carry on next season. Owing to the scarcity time goes on there will be further heavy Notwithlosses. Barren pastures are expressive of the struggle which stock will have to survive in the grim fight with nature. Men who have painstakingly given their labour in the hope of securing some return for their work will receive little or nothing. A great majority of the settlers have just secured a final adjustment of the contracts entered into with the States closer settlement authorities. They have been given what would be considered a small equity in their properties if the conditions were normal. Many of them, believing that it might enable them to raise small loans to tide them over, have been forced to realize that there is little that is tangible in the assets which they have created. Consultation with the executives of wheat-growers' organizations have revealed that they do not desire in any way to interfere, with the proposal to establish a home-consumption price for wheat. What is needed is a Treasury grant in the form of a bounty to be paid to those who will not have one bag of wheat to sell. Many men with wives and families to support are in need. Many of these men, with their wives and families, are in need of the barest necessaries of life. Thousands do not know how they are going to live until they may receive some return from In my opinion and in the the land, perhaps a year hence. There is another large section of wheat-growers Government who, normally, would be able to finance themselves over a difficult period, but now find it well-nigh impossible to finance themselves because the trading banks so seriously view the position that they are applying the most stringent financial restrictions upon their operations. In some cases, these men, fearing such a contingency, last year contemplated making use of the debt-adjustment scheme; but, heeding the counsel of the financial instiwith confidence, launched out in increased tutions and their other creditors and on their promise that they would be carried in the event of an emergency, they ignored the opportunity provided by the scheme to safeguard their interests. I am sorry to have to say that the promises given to them are not being honoured and that their future and, to a considerable degree, that of this valuable exporting primary industry is in jeopardy. I do not desire to paint too gloomy a picture of the conditions that I have seen and of the difficulties which beset the farm population in my electorate, but I do wish to give honourable members some idea of the seriousness of the position. My electorate, although probably the worse sufferer, is, unfortunately, for Ausshift the blame from the shoulders of tralia, not an isolated example. Recent information received from Western Australia indicates that an equally distressI am concerned with is an immediate ing position exists in the north-eastern wheat belt of that State. According to a statement issued by Mr G. L. Warner, a member of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly, anything from 20,000 to 30,000 acres of crops will not be harvested at all-, and, unless assistance is rendered, there must be a further exodus from that portion of the State. Reports received from the wheat areas of New South Wales suggest that the position is almost as desperate there as it is in Western Australia. In parts of the Riverina, of course, drought has already levied its toll upon stock, and limited period; make available to emin some districts sheep have long ago been transferred to better pasture areas. I understand wheat crops have completely failed in many Riverina districts. I. am, however, not entirely cognizant of the position in the Riverina, and, probdealing with the subject of rural diffiably, some other honourable gentleman will he able to supplement my remarks. A duty devolves upon this Parliament to take full cognizance of the position and to render effective aid to tide farm people over their difficulties. During the last two years, wheat growers, as the result of improved prices for their product and also, in my opinion, as the result of the frequent optimistic statements of the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) and other responsible Ministers to the effect that the depression was past and that the future could be looked to areas and bought new modern equipment. The position of these people is indeed desperate. First and foremost, let me say that there should be an immediate stock-taking of the farmers' debt adjustment. The Government cannot be admired for the manner in which' it has handled this matter. Many warnings have been issued in this chamber regarding the Government's evasion and procrastination in dealing with debt adjustment, but those warnings have not been heeded, with the result that there has been most unfortunate delay. I am not concerned with the arguments that have beeu adduced in an attempt to the Government and of this Parliament, however ludicrous they may be. What acceleration of the process which creditors and debtors thought would be adopted. The failure to honour obligations in regard to debt adjustment moneys has caused many cases to be held in a state of suspense and, at the same time, caused the present position to be aggravated. I urge, therefore, that the Government take immediate steps to provide the necessary moneys to the States for the completion of the work. Even now, if the Government would make the promised amounts available to the States, the State governments, possibly, couid again, for a barrassed farmers the benefits of the debt adjustment legislation. I suggest that this be done. I would remind the Prime Minister in culties of a statement which he was recently reported, to have made. If correctly reported, he said: "" We as a people now have a lasting peace"". If these words can be accepted as an indication of the Government's genuine belief, it is its duty to divert some of the £43,000.000 which is thought necessary for defence, into channels which will prevent primary and secondary industry from receiving the full impact of the blow which threatens to fall because of drought conditions. Otherwise there will be recession in business with resultant unemployment. There is a disposition on the part of some honourable members to suggest that the present position should ""be exclusively handled by the States. That that outlook is incongruous must be realized when it is recalled that the welfare of primary industry affects our whole national structure. It is not a problem which should be dealt with in piece-meal fashion; otherwise, the more impoverished is a State, the greater will be its difficulty in sotting to be given greater security. All sections affairs right. Furthermore, there are no existing State institutions adequately equipped to deal with the situation, whereas the Commonwealth has an authority which it can use with good effectthe Commonwealth Bank. I understand that proposals are being considered at the moment for the establishment of a mortgage bank, and I suggest to the Government and the House that legislation should also be introduced for the broadening of the powers of the rural credits branch of the Commonwealth Bank. At the moment its operations are confined to the provision of moneys for collective marketing. If the powers of that branch were increased, it would be enabled to ease the pressure upon those who have reasonably good security, but who are unable to borrow. It would, by that very operation, check the disastrous policy of deflation which financial institutions are at present introducing. ""We are told that there are at the moment influences at work which object to the use of free money for the purpose of the establishment of a mortgage bank. It is evident that those influences are concerned not with the greater national aspects, but with the protection of the interests of the private money changers and lending institutions. able member is going beyond the terms of his motion. keep within its limits. May I say that I have purposely mentioned the question of deflationary policy, because its operation in country areas bears a real relationship to its possible effect on secondary industry and upon those who are dependent for employment upon secondary production. in the motion of secondary industry. values, which at best prevents the normal money functions from being observed, is merely the beginning of the cycle. At the end of it are the industrial workers; therefore, any action which the Government may take to permit of the farmer borrower being able to obtain his needs, in the end enables the industrial worker of the community will suffer as the result of the drought. able member must confine his remarks to the terms of his motion.

In almost every State there is urgent need to extend water conservation schemes, thereby providing remunerative employment for many agriculturists. the honourable member does not understand my ruling. He is not confining his remarks to a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, the position of the wheat-growers. Mr Speaker, then I must curtail my remarks. I was about to urge that public works be undertaken in order to assist wheat-growersa policy which has frequently been adopted in similar circumstances.

At the present Wilson) for raising this subject, which is both urgent and important at the present time, for it gives to the Government an opportunity to reveiw the position of the wheat industry, and enables members of this Parliament to consider its more important phases before the Government actually introduces legislation on the subject. The problem is so difficult as to require the combined wisdom of all political parties to find a satisfactory solution. Moreover, the assistance of all the Governments of Australia, irrespective of their political outlook in other directions, will be necessary. A review of the subject reveals that this Parliament has always been interested in, and sympathetic towards, this industry. As the honourable member for Wimmera has said, Parliament has recognized that wheat-growing is one of the great basic industries of the Commonwealth; it employs large numbers of workers, and its prosperity or adversity is reflected throughout the whole community. A t the present time every wheat-growing country is facing a most serious problem. The difficulties are accentuated in Australia by the federal system of government, under which the Commonwealth Government and Parliament merely control the export marketing side of the industry, whilst the State governments and parliaments control production. Those difficulties have been enormously increased hy the interpretation of section 92 of the Constitution by the Privy Council in 1936. position is that neither the Commonwealth Government and Parliament nor the State governments and parliaments can control adequately the marketing of wheat. The story of the last few years in regard to the wheat industry is a sorry one, indeed. At the beginning of 1930 wheat was 5s. a bushel f.o.b. Australian ports, but by December of that year the price had fallen to 2s. 6d. a bushel. In 1931 the price reached the low level of 2s. Id. a bushel, and for the next four years it remained low. In 1936 there was an improvement, and wheat realized more than 4s. a bushel; in 1937 the price further increased to more than 5s. a bushel. That rise was the result of drought conditions in the northern hemisphere, which affected both the American time the price of wheat in Australia is below 3s. a bushel f.o.b. Australian ports. To-day's quotation is 2s. 9d. or 2s. 9jd. a bushel for bagged wheat, whilst the price quoted for January deliveries ex silos and for new wheat is 2s. 7^d. a bushel. Present-day prices reflect the world position in regard to wheat supplies. rail at country sidings? but generally 6d. or 7d. a bushel must be allowed for freight to Australian ports. The supplies of wheat available for export this year by all exporting countries are estimated at 925,000,000 bushels, but the world import demand is estimated at only 550,000,000 'bushels. That means that this year there will be a world surplus of approximately 375,000,000 bushels, and consequently it is not difficult to see the reason for the present low prices. The excess of production over demand has caused a relapse of prices, following a temporary recovery. I emphasize that the present prices for wheat are due not merely to Australian conditions, but to world factors. A world surplus of wheat is forcing down prices. One explanation of the over-production of wheat is that many European countries, in an attempt to become self-contained, are growing wheat on an uneconomic basis. Instead of The constitutional importing hundreds of millions of bushels of wheat, as they did in the past, they are supplying their own requirements.

64,Sir Earle Page,"That will have sonally, I regret that a larger proportionmake effective arrangements for both the domestic and overseas marketing of our wheat. The Government was grateful for this co-operation. Many of the members of the Labour party in New South Wales, however, refused to co-operate, and so it has not been possible, so far, to deal with the subject in a national way. After the defeat of the referendum proposals, the whole position was very carefully examined in the light of the decision of the Privy Council, and it was found that that decision undoubtedly revealed that the States had greater powers than was previously thought to be the case to fix the price of their products. In August, .1937, the Agricultural Council, at its meeting in Brisbane, found a. means by which the States could, by fixing the'price of flour, indirectly secure a home-consumption price for wheat. On the 26th August of this year, the Council again considered the wbole subject and the State Premiers said to the Commonwealth Government, in effect, ""We will fix the price of flour within the Statesi f Within the same State conditions in some the Commonwealth Government will take complementary action to make available from the proceeds of the fixed price a levy to permit the payment of a fixed price for wheat-growers for home consumption "". The Prime Minister gave an assurance that the Commonwealth Government would co-operate in bringing the scheme into operation, seeing that it had the unanimous support of the State governments. On the 29th August last, at a conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers in Canberra, the general principles, and the greater part of the detail of the whole scheme, were agreed to, and since then, bills dealing with the subject have been passed hy both Houses of the Parliaments of New South Wales and South Australia. The necessary legislation has been introduced in the Parliaments of Western Australia and Tasmania, and notice of its introduction was given in the Parliament of Queensland on the 4th November. The Victorian bill has been drafted and submitted to the Commonwealth Government for approval, though it has not yet been actually introduced. But the States have now suggested a variation of the agreed method of dealing with the position. In short, their ucw proposal is that the proceeds of the levy should be distributed on a different basis from that already approved. Mr Dunstan, the Premier of Victoria, was the first one to make this suggestion, when, a few days ago, he telephoned me. Mr Beid, the Minister for Agriculture of New South Wales, communicated with me last Friday, and Mr Playford, the Premier of South Australia, telegraphed me yesterday on the matter. As the result of the telephone conversations that have ensued, which suggest that some variation of the scheme already agreed to is desired, I have informed the State representatives that [ shall be available in Canberra next week-end to discuss the whole subject with them, and also to endeavour to find some means by which a measure of relief may be accorded to farmers in wheat growing areas where the seasonal conditions have proved to be extremely bad. Strange to say, such areas are to be found in every State, and are widely scattered throughout the Commonwealth. areas have been exceptionally good, and farmers will have excellent crops, whereas in certain other areas extremely difficult conditions prevail. The following table sets out some interesting details:Estimate 1038-39. Average State. previous Ave years. Offluial. UuoMtial.

Consequently, we are discussing the matter with all of the State governments, which are representative of all political parties, in an endeavour to arrive at some solution of not only the problem of providing a home-consumption price for wheat, but also the general question of relief in stricken areas. We desire to bring down legislation not merely to deal with the present crisis, but also to establish co-operative action as between the Commonwealth and the State Governments in the industry itself, and to secure not only organized marketing, but also systematic control of the industry in order to prevent the growing of wheat in areas in which farmers will obviously have a rough time. We hope to devise means to transplant farmers who already find themselves in such a position, to callings in which they will find a job of work to do and have a decent chance of making a success of it. general principles, I support the motion moved by the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Wilson), although I do not agree with the basis on which he suggests relief should be given to wheatinformed by the Minister for Commerce growers in distress. I agree with the principle of a home-consumption price for wheat. Furthermore, it is the duty of this Government to make special grants to the respective States for the relief of farmers who find themselves in distress as the result of bad seasons. I cannot quite follow the reasoning of the honourable member for Wimmera that such relief should be distributed on an acreage basis. In every case the financial position of applicants for relief should be taken into consideration. In some districts, wealthy corporations and individuals own areas up to 10,000 acres. Despite seasonal adversity, these remain in a strong financial position and, because they do not need assistance, they are not entitled to any. If relief were granted on the basis of 5s. an acre, for instance, the owner of a 10,000 acre farm Every honourable member who represents would receive £2,500. However, in many wheat-growing centres, the average cropthe last three or four years many farmers ping area owned by the small farmer is only from 300 to 400 acres, and on that basis, most farmers, despite the fact that tions. I suggest that this would not have they and their families depend on the industry for their livelihood, would rerehabilitation been made available more ceive only £75 or £100. The inequity of such a basis of relief is obvious. In respect to bounties also, I have always contended that payments should be made only to those who are in desperate financial straits. The honourable member for Wimmera has pointed out that distress is most acute at the present time among wheat farmers in his electorate, but I venture to suggest that extensive tracts in that district are controlled by wealthy informed that the money was not forthcorporations which do not need assistance from the Government. Assistance should, therefore, be distributed on the basis of need. The Minister for Commerce( Sir Earle Page) mentioned the sums which had been voted, and actually paid, in respect of farmers' debt adjustment. We Jtnow that the present trouble would have been obviated but for the tardiness of this Government in making that money available. Yet, in spite of the fact that the. sum which it was originally proposed to vote for purpose of rural rehabilitation was £20,000,000, and only £12,000,000 has been actually voted, whilst only £6,000,000 of this amount has actually been made available to date, we are now that the State governments have been given the option of saying how they will use the balance of this money. They have been given the choice of using it for the construction of public works. As the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Pollard) has interjected, this departure from the original promise of the Government constitutes a grave betrayal of the trust reposed in it by the wheat-growers. Throughout New South Wales, tinder the operations of the Farmers' Relief Act, during the last three or four years, hundreds of farmers, because of financial difficulty have had their holdings placed under the control of receivers. This position has been brought about, purely because the money promised for rural rehabilitation has not been made available as expeditiously as it might be. a country district is aware that during have lost their holdings through their' inability to meet their financial obligahappened had the money voted for rural expeditiously. New South Wales has not used all of the money which has been made available to it for this purpose. is so; yet, when I made representations to that government on this point, I was coming from the 'Commonwealth Govern-",24,Wheat Industry Formal Motion Foe Adjournment

I know, as one who has been engaged in wheat-growing all my life in the north-west of New South Wales, that the only assistance of any real value ever received by the wheat-growers was given by a Labour government. Years ago, when the Labour party was in power in New South Wales, and Mr J. T. Lang was Treasurer, the Government made an advance of 2s. 6d. a bushel which, in addition to the price of 5s. a bushel guaranteed by the Commonwealth, made a total price of 7s. 6d. a bushel, the highest ever received by the growers in Australia. The effect of this was to rescue many wheat-growers in northern New South Wales from their difficulties, and place them in a sound financial position, thanks to a Labour government. Labour governments hav 0 complaint has always done everything possible to assist those engaged in the key industries of wheat-growing and wool-raising. [Leave to continue given.] In 1930, when the Scullin Government was in power, a bill was passed to provide for a compulsory wheat pool with a guaranteed price to the growers of 4s. a bushel. Arrangements were made with the Commonwealth Bank for it to finance the pool, and make advances to growers on delivery of wheat -it railway sidings. This hill was rejected by the Senate-som e of the Country party senators voting against it. In December, 1930, another bill was passed to provide a guarantee of 3s. a bushel, without a pool, but, on the Commonwealth Bank Board receiving a legal opinion that it was not constitutional, it declined to make the money available. Later in that year, a bill providing for a fiduciary note issue was passed through the House of Representatives. It was proposed to find £3,500,000 for a wheat bounty and £2,500,000 for distressed wheat-growers, making in all £6,000,000 for wheat-growers. That bill vas rejected in the Senate by the anti-Labour senators. In spite of these setbacks, the Labour Government still persisted, and in 1931, made available £3,296,000 with which to pay a bounty of 4£d. a bushel to wheat-growers, on all wheat marketed. Yet, in face of these determined attempts to help the wheat growers, and of the practical assistance Country party persist in saying that the Labour Government did nothing for the wheat-growers. I hope that a bill will be introduced immediately for the fixing of a home-consumption price for wheat. very sorry that the honorahle member for Gwydir( Mr Scully) should have endeavoured to make of this more of a party question than one of assistance to the farmers.

74,Mr Gregory (Swan) [3.55],"I amthe wheat-farmers. I endorse the statement of the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Wilson) regarding the serious position of many of the agriculturists throughout the greater part of Australia. In youth Australia, Victoria, in many parts of New South Wales, and in Western Australia, the drought has been very severe, and this, combined with the very low price of wheat, has placed the growers in a position of extraordinary difficulty. Something drastic must be done to meet the position. Recently, it was decided, after much argument, to introduce legislation to provide a home consumption price for wheat. As was pointed out by the Minister for Commerce( Sir Earle Page) just now, wo are awaiting the passing of legislation by the State parliaments before complementary legislation is introduced into this It should at least lend money to the Parliament to give effect to that decision, State governments without interest for a that is the fixing of a home-consumption price of wheat. It would be a great pity if the scheme had to be dropped. In Western Australia, the wheat pool has decided to make a first advance of only Is. 3d. or Is. 4d. a bushel at sidings. When we realize how high is the cost of production, and the many difficulties which the farmers have to face, it is evident that this is an unpayable price, even for the man who gets 20 bushels an acre. Only a few days ago I gave notice to the secretary of our party that I proposed to call a meeting to discuss this matter. The meeting was held this morning, and it was decided to bring the matter before the Government with a view to having the scheme gone on with as soon as possible, and to urge that some relief be granted to growers, not on an acreage basis, but in accordance with their needs. member for Wimmera( Mr Wilson) invited to the meeting? attended if he thought fit. I should like the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde) to give an assurance that, if the States pass the necessary acts, the Opposition in this House will support legislation providing for a home-consumption price for wheat. It may he true that some wheat farmers on big areas of 10,000 or 15,000 acres are in a sound financial position, but I am not asking for assistance on their behalf. I am asking for assistance for those who are in actual need. In my own electorate there are more than 1,000 farmers, many of whom have been growing wheat for only the last seven or eight years. They were not able to take advantage of the good prices which ruled up to 1929. In 1930 and 1931 they had magnificent crops, but prices were ruinously low. Since then they have had drought after drought. It is true that many of the farmers are operating in marginal areas, but I do not want to see them forced off the land. After all, they are the cream of our population, and they are battling along, year after year, under the most adverse conditions. The Commonwealth Government should do something to help them. number of years to enable production to be carried on. Honourable members must realize the enormous value to Australia of the wheat industry. In my opinion the economic collapse in 1930 was due entirely to the catastrophic decline of export values, which was the direct cause of all the misery suffered hy the people during the depression years. It would be ruinous from a national viewpoint not to continue the development of a comprehensive production programme in order to increase our population and ensure the safety of the nation. There can be no doubt about the necessity for Commonwealth assistance to our primary producers. I have in my hand a graph which includes data taken from Table 13 of the memorandum on the international wheat situation, prepared by the secretariat of the Wheat Advisory Committee in London. This data has been the honourable checked carefully. It shows that over a long period of j'ears, from 1922-23 to 1937-38, the purchasing power of a bushel of wheat in Argentina, Canada and the United States of America, in every year, and in some years to a very great extent, was much higher than in Australia. This, I contend, has been due entirely to Commonwealth policy. I pointed out some time ago that a return, prepared by a qualified accountant, showed that the cost of the development of a thousand-acre",27,Wheat Industry Formal Motion Foe Adjournment

Some farmers may not be In urgent need, but I know that a great many wheat-growers are, year after year, finding it most difficult to carry on. Rather than allow these people to go off the land and increase unemployment in the cities, assistance should be given by the Commonwealth Government, not only in the interests of the farmers themgations of its predecessors. selves, hut also in the interests of the nation. In reply to the statements made by Gwydir( Mr Scully), I point out that the Loan Council is not controlled by the Commonwealth Government. Each State has one vote on the council and the Commonwealth has only two, so that the States have full control, if they desire to utilize it. I am, however, more concerned with the present condition of the wheat-farmers than with political considerations. I hope that all parties will unite in an appeal to State governments and to the Commonwealth Government to fix a home-consumption price for wheat and also to provide the very necessary assistance to those farmers who are in dire need of it. welcome the motion because it gives honthat has been of substantial help to the orable members an opportunity to imwheat-farmer. press upon the Government the necessity for steps being taken to deal with the effect upon the nation generally of the commission's recommendations, the Comdesperate condition of the wheat industry. monwealth Government immediately In my opinion, this problem ranks only made available £4,000,000 for the paysecond in importance to that of ment of a bounty on wheat production, unemployment.

89,Mr Pollard,"To the extent whichber is wrong. read the speech of the Minister for Commerce knows that, in respect of debt adjustment, the right honourable gentleman made the plain statement that £12,000,000 would be made available by the Commonwealth to assist the States over a period of three years. Now the right honourable gentleman tells us that, under the arrangements of the Loan Council, a certain amount of loan money is allocated to the States to assist them in carrying on their ordinary public works' programme; therefore, the wheat farmers and other farmers must suffer. Government finds the money for farmers' debt adjustment, and the States find the money for works. with the promise made by the right honourable gentleman when the farmers' debt adjustment legislation was introduced in this House. I do not wish to indulge in recrimination, but I think it is high time that this National Parliament faced up to its obligation in respect of this problem. It should not await the passing of uniform legislation by the different States, nor should it be necessary to call a meeting of representatives of the States and insist on unanimity among them when a new problem arises such as is confronting us to-day by reason of drought. This Parliament has all the financial and other powers necessary to give effective relief to wheat-growers and to distressed farmers generally. gentleman has been here a little longer he will know that that is not so. able gentleman will not deny that it is within the power of the Commonwealth to grant a bounty on wheat grown, to make an acreage payment or to provide any other form of assistance. I am prepared to admit that the decision given in the James case placed certain restrictions on Commonwealth activity; but, in the final analysis, it does not prevent the Commonwealth Parliament from taking the initiative and providing bounties or other forms of assistance. gentleman assisted the Commonwealth with its referendum proposals. proud of the fact. It ill becomes this Parliament, when confronted with certain obstacles by virtue of a decision of the High Court, to unload its obligation, to decline to explore new methods which undoubtedly exist, and to thrust back on the States the initiative iu the matter. While conferences are being held hy State governments, whose capacity to raise money is limited, the Commonwealth Parliament being all-powerful in the financial sphere, the wheat-growers lose their means of livelihood and the unemployment problem is intensified. I am not very much concerned as to whether the assistance takes the form of a home consumption price, a bounty, or an acreage payment; but, generally speaking, I have a decided preference for a bounty, according to the factors that operate in any particular area; because I have always felt-and still feel-that , under the home-consumption price proposition, particularly in relation to wheat, flour and the by-products of wheat, the undoubted effect is that the greatest burden is borne by the weakest and poorest section of the community, who are the greatest bread-eaters. I do not think that, that can be successfully contested. In these circumstances, I , and I hope other members of my party, definitely favour a bounty of a given amount a bushel, or a payment based on an acreage calculation. I know that there are many objections to the payment on an acreage basis; but I suggest that, because of the factors which operate in Victoria to-day, that basis might be favourably considered. One objection to it is that, as occurs in every walk of life, there are among wheat-growers dishonest people who, if they knew they were to receive an acreage payment yearly, would simply scratch the surface of their land instead of manuring and cultivating it properly. But that could not occur this year, when such persons could not realize that, owing to drought, an acreage basis of payment might be necessary. I put that view even at this late stage-and it is becoming late. The position in Victoria is desperate, and the Government should be",30,Wheat Industry Formal Motion Foe Adjournment

It has a certain responsibility towards wheat growers and has observed that responsibility in recent years.

It accepts certain responsibility for the effect of drought on diate government policy of relief. The the revenues of those Stateb. Consequent upon the recent calamitous depression, provision was made in respect of farmers of all classes in the different States. As the Minister for Commerce( Sir Earle Page) has stated, up to date the Commonwealth Government has made available to the various State governments for the assistance of those farmers no less a sum than £6,317,000, and for this year it proposes to make available for debt adjustment the sum of £2,000,000. Whilsti t may be possible to criticize with some modicum of justification what tbe Government has done in that respect, there is no denying the fact that it has made available a larger sum for debt adjustment than any other Ministry has done at any time in the history of the Commonwealth. That is something for which this Government can take considerable credit. The Government, finally, takes respongood ground, I think, for complaint that sibility in respect of a home-consumption the present Commonwealth Government price for wheat, because it accepts the has failed to bring to fruition any conprinciple that the man who grows wheat, crete .plan to place the wheat industry on as much as the man who conducts a a sound economic basis.

106,"Mr Forde (Capricornia) [4.26""|","was reduced to £12,000,000, and, in introducing the bill in March, 1935, the Ministerf o r Commerce( Sir Earle Page), who was Acting Prime Minister, saidIt ia anticipated that the total amount of £12,000,000 will be disbursed within three or four years. . . . It is estimated that tlie disbursement will amount to from £1,500,000 to £2,000,000 in the first year and probably £4,000,000 in the second year. What has happened with regard to that money? U p to the 20th June, 1938, which is over three years since the bill was passed, only £4,000,000 had been made available to assist distressed farmers. When the wheat problem was being discussed in the House on the 21st June, 1938, the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) referred to these promises, and the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) interjected and asked "" Is the Leader of the Country party the Leader of the Government?""; but I emphasize the point that the Ministerf o r Commerce was Acting Prime Minister when he introduced the bill, and was, undoubtedly, speaking on behalf of the Government. He set out to convince us of that fact. The honourable member for Riverina( Mr Nock) also interjected with the remark "" The farmers could have had £3,S00,000 last year, but preferred only £2,000,000."" I found, on investigation, that that statement was not only absurd, but also incorrect. Communications were sent to the Premiers of Victoria and Western Australia drawing attention to the statement, and I now quote extracts from the replies which have been received from them. The Premier of Victoria, who is associated with the Country party, wrote as follows:I cannot understand the statement of Mr would like to give. I thought it wise to Nock that "" the farmers could have had put these facts on record. £3,800.000 last year but preferred only £2,000,000.""

The amounts subsewheat-farmers is the high quently applied for by Victoria and those granted are shown hereunder:Applied for.

The responsibility must rest with the Commonwealth Government for not carrying out its pledges in regard to finding £12,000,000 under the debt adjustment scheme within the period of three or four years. The Premier of Western Australia was also asked for his comment on the statement of the honourable member for Riverina, and he replied as follows:I received your letter of the 22nd June regarding the farmers' debt adjustment scheme. The interjection that "" the farmers could have had £3,800,000 last year but preferred only £2,000,000"" Is very far from correct.

The reason for that is simply because they have required a certain amount for public works and have deliberately cut down their requirements for farmers' debt adjustment. ister has exhausted his time. that the members of this House who are seized of the position of the wheat growers do give them their sympathy; but I think that this Parliament has not only to consider the position as it affects the wheat-growers themselves but also to recognize how seriously their position reacts on the national position. The Although that State might figures published in the press a few days ago with regard to the prospects of the wheat crop in the various States wereBushels Victoria .. 15,000,000 New South Wales .. 40,000,000 to 50.000,000 South Australia .. 30,000,000 Western Australia .. 30,000.000 Queensland .. 7,000,000 It wil] be seen that the total is approximately 132,000,000 bushels, compared with 186,000,000 bushels last year. When we take the relative price of last year's crop, after having kept out seed, and compare it with this year's prospective crop, after having kept out seed, it will be found that represents a reduction of £22,500,000.

133,Mr Nock (Riverina) [4.48],"I thinkadvocated that there should be some extra assistance for those necessitous farmers who have been affected by drought and who will harvest little or no crop in respect of which they could participate in the distribution of money from that source. The position of the Government, as I see it, was outlined fairly clearly by the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr John Lawson). There must be a line of demarcation as to what its responsibility is, what is the responsibility of the State governments, and what is the responsibility of the individual wheat-grower, and nobody else's but his own. We know that neither the Federal nor any State government has any say in regard to the locality in which a wheat grower decides to farm or as to the methods adopted by an individual farmer in growing his crop, the acreage or seed he plants, or whether or not he uses superphosphate. Consequently I say that many of the disabilities of the man on the land are not the responsibility of the Federal Government. But the tariff effect on his costs is a responsibility of the Federal Government, and the burden of arbitration, which is national policy, cannot be borne by anybody else but the Commonwealth Government. It should not be put on the exporting industry. The primary producer has also to pay for workmen's compensation and will soon be burdened by contributions to the national insurance fund. Unlike those engaged in secondary industries he is unable to pass those costs on. primary producer pay for workmen's principle. I may add that I have compensation ? different position from those in secondary support of this view. industries, and cannot pass on these special burdens imposed upon the producers of wheat by national policy. They made during the course of this, are anomalies that should be compensated debate. The honourable member for for by the National Government. cannot be debated upon this motion. an obligation on the Commonwealth wheat industry has ever received from any Government to compensate wheat-growers government. The fact is that the New for the cost of these burdens. But compenSouth Wales growers received a. guaransation for drought is not a federal responteed price of 7s. 6d. a bushel, 5s. sibility. If there is necessity for particuguaranteed by the Commonwealth Golar assistance because of this or any other vernment and 2s. Od. by the State cause, it is for the State governments ro take whatever action they consider necessary. It may apply only to a part of a particular State or to the whole of a particular State, but to one State only, and, in these circumstances, it is not a federal responsibility. Men are established on the land in certain areas of various States which are quite unsuitable for wheat-growing, and governments which encouraged them to go there should have to shoulder the burden of any assistance necessary to aid them to carry on. This point should be considered. The proposed home-consumption price scheme will assist the industry, but not discriminate in favour of any particular farmers in the industry. Those farmers in the industry whose successful operations have been prejudiced hy drought conditions and other unfortunate circumstances should make an appeal to the xState governments, but if the State governments cannot provide the necessary finance for relief, I would take no exception to the Federal Government providing money on. loan to the State governments, possibly free of interest, so that they could have no ground upon which they could refuse assistance where it was justified. The £12,000,000 being provided by the Commonwealth Government for rehabilitation is surely all for which it should be asked. It would be a great mistake to mix necessitous cases with the proposal for a home-consumption price, the principle of which has been agreed upon by six State governments and the Federal Government.

137,Mr Nock,"I submit that there is greatest measure of assistance which the Government; but 1 would remind the honourable member that the world's price for wheat at that time, and paid to growers in States where no guaranteed price applied, averaged 7s. 4^d. a bushel. The Victorian farmers received 7s. 4-^d. a bushel. The extra advantage received by the New South Wales wheat-growers, as tlie result of the guarantee, was only 1W. a bushel on a crop of 53,000,000 bushels, less seed. The burden imposed upon the taxpayer to provide the extra. l£d. a bushel was 3d. a bushel. Thus, the taxpayers had to find a -total of £600,000, of which the wheat-growers received only £300,000. The honourable member compares that advantage of £300,000 with the £14,000,000 which this Government has provided by way of assistance to wheat-growers, and then claims that the New South Wales Labour Government did more in 1920 to assist the wheat-growers than has ever been done by any other government in Australia. Surely the fallacy is obvious. Tho honourable member's statements are not in accordance with facts nor are those of the honourable member for Ballarat. ( Mr PollaTd) in regard to rural rehabiliClark, J. J. tation. They show that he has not a clear conception of the manner in which the Loan Council operates, because he contended that some of the money allocated for rural rehabilitation purposes has been used for public works. That is not so. The Loan Council has the power to allocate a certain proportion of the money raised by loan for specific purposes, and the State Ministers, having a majority on the Loan Council, have the power to determine the purposes for which such amounts are made available. The Commonwealth Government does not intend to default, in its promise that £12,000,000 shall he made available. that special purpose. hand but was to be provided as required. The sum of £6,000.000 has already been paid and the remainder will be provided from time to time, as the States are able t.o use it satisfactorily in carrying out their schemes. The accusation that there has been delay in regard to rural rehabilitation cannot be sustained. No State government has complained that delay has been caused owing to finance. The arranging of compositions with the creditors has been found to be a most intricate problem. Victoria. ment is getting the money. Any delay in the States is not because of the shortage of funds, and the Commonwealth Government is carrying out its obligation. Let the States do their part of the job.

147,Mr Gregory (Swan) [5.14],"Iwore adopted with the trade diversion policy, which caused immense losses to graziers and wheat-growers, and honourable members shou.d resent such important decisions being applied without the approval of Parliament. There is too much apathy among honourable members of Parliament towards Executive action without the authority of Parliament. A long period has elapsed since I placed my motion on the notice-paper, but, until to-day, when it was realized by the Government that it would have to be disposed of, I have not had the opportunity to move it . Members of this Parliament are losing that control of Parliament and of legislation which is essential to the best interests of parliamentary government, and it behoves them to enforce their rights. It is worthwhile to recall the events which led up to the imposition of the embargo on the export of iron ore from this country. It was imposed simply as the result of the report of a departmental officer to the Ministry. It was the most drastic action that it was possible for the Government to take, and its results have been detrimental to the interests not only of the State of Western Australia, but also, I venture to suggest, of the Commonwealth as a whole. The embargo could quite possibly have become a major issue resulting in hostility to Australia on the part of other nations. When a government does something that is likely to cause serious trouble, it is the duty of this Parliament to decide i m mediately whether or not its action is justified. Eor a long time prior to the imposition of the embargo all of the actions of the Government in respect of the export of iron ore, showed that it had no objection to it ; but there was a sudden change of policy, and an embargo was enforced. In substantiation of my claim that the Government made a volte face, I shall, at a later stage, quote from Hansard and various documents. There would have been extreme antagonism towards an embargo had it been imposed oven early in the history of the development of the iron ore deposits at Yampi Sound, when comparatively little expenditure had been outlayed; that antagonism must be intensified now when tens of thousands of pounds of expenditure has gone for nothing, because of the Government's change of policy. It is in the interests of Western Australia that I have moved this motion, because that State w ill undoubtedly suffer a great financial penalty as the result of the Government's action. Another motive that actuates me is the fact that for more than 20 years I have advocated greater freedom of trade between nations of the world. ThatI am not alone i u that attitude is amply shown in the annual report if the Department of External Affairs for the year ended, the 31st December. 1937, page 65 of which contains the following passage:The Economic Committee (of the League of Nations) has also formulated a number of principles which in its opinion governments should adopt, viz.:(1) Raw materials should not be subjected to any export prohibition or restriction, except in pursuance of an international regulation scheme. . . . (2> Foreigners bhould have the same rights and facilities as nationals to develop national resources in any particular country or colony, subject to compliance with the laws and regulations of the countries concerned. . . . On the one hand, we have the Minister for External Affairs advising the people of Australia and members of this Parliament as to suggestions that have been made by the Economic Committee of the League of Nations on the need for breaking down international trade barriers, and on the other, the Commonwealth Ministry, including the Ministerf or External Affairs, agreeing to do the very thing which it was counselled not to do in these suggestions. It was as the result of a somewhat similar policy in Europe that this country, along with othei countries of the world, a few weeks ago was confronted with the likelihood of a repetition of the horrors of 1914-18. The situation was engendered by Germany, like Italy, previously, and Japan, even now, demanding expansion. In Australia we have an area, almost the size of the United States of America, supporting a population of about 7,000,000 people, which, in itself, presents a grave menace to this country's safety. Yet, when then is more than a possibility of the development of a sparsely-settled part of thii. great nation by the development of the iron ore deposits on the north-west coast of Western Australia, the Government prevents that development by prohibiting tlie export of that ore. Only a few weeks ago we were oppressed by the fear of war, with a renewal of all the horrors of 1914-18. The League of Nations has proved to be a complete failure in its efforts to preserve peace. Pacts of non-aggression and of mutual assistance have been found wanting. Not only have they not prevented war, but also they have not solved the primary essential of the cause of war. We ought to do more than spend millions of pounds to protect ourselves; we must go to the people and tell them the fundamental causes of war. And restraint of trade, excessively high tariff restrictions, exploit the iron ore deposits at Yampi embargoes on imports and exports, are undoubtedly those fundamental causes. They breed discord, antipathy and a sense of injustice. When we extend the policy to the application of an embargo on raw materials in the manner that we have done, we flaunt a policy of ""what we have we hold"", irrespective of the needs of the nations of the world. The embargo applies only to iron ore, for Cowper, in his capacity as Acting but honourable members know that for Prime Minister, answered the questions years past hundreds of thousands of tons thus:of iron ore have been exported from Australia, by, not an outside organization, ment but the Broken Hill Proprietary ComBrassert and Company Limited, of London, in pany Limited, the only great smelting respect of iron ore deposits at Koolan Island, company that we have in Australia.

I cannot imagine agreement with the Nippon Mining Company, that it was the Broken Hill Proprietary of Company Limited that informed the Goway of loan to an operating company to be vernment there was likely to be a formed for the purpose of working the deposits, shortage of iron ore in Australia, because on the understanding that the Nippon Mining it would be a strange thing, if it had that Company will take the whole of the output. information, for it to he exporting vast quantities of iron ore for many years to first came under notice, the United Kingdom japan and the United States of America. authorities were consulted through the High It has been said in support of the emCommissioner in regard to the desirability of bargo that iron ore is an essential to the reserving manufacture of munitions for war purposes, but I remind the Government that there are other materials equally essential for that purpose, the export of which Air. Gregory. from Australia remains unchecked-pi g iron, iron and steel, copper, spelter, wolfram, tantalite, and scrap iron. At least three years ago the Government was aware of the development that was taking place at Yampi Sound, because certain questions about the project were asked and answered in this Parliament by the then Acting Prime Minister( Sir Earle Page). About a year later another question was asked as to whether certain Japanese assayers were to be allowed to enter the country in order to watch the operations of the company. I am constrained at this point to emphasize to honourable members that the laws of Western Australia do not permit Asiatics to work on mining projects in that State. I also emphasize that the company which was set up to Sound was an English company which had financial assistance from Japan. Only people of our own nationality could be employed at Yampi Sound. The honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Drakeford), three years ago, asked a number of questions relating to the export of iron ore from Yampi Sound and in doing so explained the position from his viewpoint. The right honourable member 2. Leases have been granted by the Governof Western Australia to Messrs. H . A. 3 and 4. See reply to 2. 5. Messrs. H . A. Brassert and Company is registered in London. 0.

A t the end of 1035. when this project these deposits for Empire purposes, and advice was furnished to the effect that[a) Iron ore deposits of the world are so extensive that there is no need to consider the conservation of Yampi Sound deposits for future Empire purposes; (b) There are other Empire deposits, greatly rich much closer to Europe which it is impossible profitably to develop for Empire purposes. Consequently there is no question of the development of Yampi Sound with the aid of the United Kingdom Government I (c) Although not at present required for Empire purposes, would be of more use in emergency if some steps had been taken to develop them, and if the ore way readily available. Some months ago, I pointed out to the Government that the great deposits of iron ore at Yampi Sound would he useless unless some developmental work in connection with them were undertaken. The original contract was for 25,000,000 tons, but, later, the quantity was reduced to 15,000,000 tons. If an emergency arose, how different the position would be if development had proceeded to that stage 1 A syndicate in Western Australia expended over £8,000 in 1922 in an attempt to get British people interested in these deposits, but the people in England pointed out that the distance from that country was so great that they could not associate themselves with the enterprise. Yet there are people in Australia who tell us that the decision of the Commonwealth Government was made at the request of the British Government. There has been no request by the British Government for such action. answer of the Minister continued(d) It would serve no object, and it would not be desirable to prevent drop scenes for theatres, and other purJapan obtaining its ore from this poses where a fire-resisting material is source. sources available.

A preliminary survey of the potential supplies of iron ore has revealed the existence ot very considerable deposits, sufficient for all our requirements for a great many years ahead. The exports of iron ore from Malaya amount to about 1,000,000 tons a year. The deposits at Yampi Sound have remained untouched for thousands of years, and although efforts were made to obtain British capital to develop them, it was only when Japanese capital was made available that their exploitation was undertaken. I emphasize that, although Japanese capital would have been expended to develop the deposits, no Japanese labour could have been employed. The arrangement between H . A. Brassert and Company Limited and the Nippon Mining Company to provide £300,000 was somewhat similar to an agreement entered into for the development of some deposits of crystolThe lite asbestos in Western Australia. This material, which is difficult to mine, is useful for making clothes for firemen, There are many other required. Mr Fenton, a manufacturer of asbestos clothing in England, visited Western Australia where he found a man and offered to supply a plant from Yampi Sound was similar, although on a Its decision will seriously affect the development of the north-west portion-of the continent. All honourable members will agree that the peopling of that part of Australia is of vital importance. Here was an opportunity for the employment of 200 or 300 Australian workmen directly in the production of iron ore, but no one could say what other developments might have taken place had the work been proceeded with. I have been to Y a m pi Sound, and I realize something of its possibilities. In addition to great deposits of iron ore, there is a magnificent harbour. Moreover, it is claimed that in the vicinity there is not only copper, but also coal and gold. The Government's decision was made despite the fact that it did not know of any other company willing to undertake the development of these deposits. It arbitrarily decided that the works should be closed down, regardless of the consequences to Western Australia. The Premier of Western* Australia, speaking in the State legislature, recently said The figures I shall quote are based on the export of only 1,000,000 tons of iron ore per annum for fifteen years, which was the latest proposition submitted by the company, supported by the State Government, but rejected by tlio Commonwealth Government. The amount of royalty lost will be £250,000. Wages constitute the backbone of the Australian iron lost, which would .have been paid to Western Australian workers, reckoning 200 men at an average of £6 10s. a week, approximate £1.000,000. The decision of the Commonwealth acted by dilution of the ore with other, iron Government w ill result in heavy losses ore low in manganese, since the manganese to Western Australia. I should like to know what induced the Government to take this action, and, particularly, the Proprietary Company Limited has exreason for keeping secret the reports of ported iron ore of low manganese content the Government Geologist.

Moreover, with such things. A report from the Mr Montgomery's report on Yampi Sound was made only after a personal investigation on the site, whereas D r . Woolnough's report was made before he had visited the islands. In a f u l l report Mr Montgomery estimated the quantity of iron ore above high-water level in the two islands at 97-,300,000 tons, whereas Dr. Woolnough reportedThe Yampi Sound deposits have been variously estimated to contain from 63,000,000 to about 00,000,000 tons of ore. These estimates, however, assume a depth of profitable mining which is almost certainly excessive in existing economic conditions in Australia. 1 do not know whether D r . Woolnough was responsible for the statement that the ore below high-water level could not be economically worked. Whoever made it , the statement is preposterous. A t Bell Island, in Newfoundland, mining operations are carried out below the sea for 2 miles. There has been no estimate of the quantity of iron ore below high-water level at Y a m pi Sound. In any case, .Dr. Woolnough's report is vague. He statedIn South Australia, the only major accessible deposits are those of the Iron Knob group. Official estimates of tonnages available lie between 150,000,000 and 200,000,000 tons. These deposits do and must unquestionably industry for a long time to come. Unfortunately, the largest deposits of the group show an increasing percentage of manganese, to more than the admissible limit, with increasing depth of exploitation.

151,Mr Gregory,"If we approve ofLeague of Nations, which Sir George Pearce referred to in the Senate some time ago, mentioned the extreme danger of action such as the Government took on this occasion. A t present these islands are useless to Australia. H ad they been developed they might, in certain circumstances, have become a very valuable asset. It was proposed that 15,000,000 tons of ore should be taken from the islands. The first suggestion was that 25,000,000 tons should he mined. But I remind the House that an arrangement had been made that if Australia desired to smelt any of the ore it could be supplied with such quantities as it requested. It has been said that the ore cannot be mined below high water level. I entirely disagree with that view. Mr Montgomery has declared that iron ore exists at Yampif or a great depth below high water level and that it could be mined. I now direct the attention of honourable members to an article which appears in the Chemical Engineering and Mining Review of the 14th A p r i l , 1938, under the heading "" Australia's I r o n Ore Deposits"". The whole article is interesting, but I ask honourable members to give special consideration to the following summary which it gives of the iron ore reserves of the various States:Actual 'Reserves.

This statement, which appears below, is based on information obtained from geological reports and from other official sources. Iu some eases it will be noticed that deposits of uneconomic size have been ineluded in the estimates. estimate is sixteen years old. but as against that I ask honourable members to consider the following statement which is also contained in the article:Since the estimate for South Australia was prepared boring and exploration have shown the existence of very much larger tonnages: just recently Dr. L. Keith Ward, government geologist, stated that the supplies of iron ore at Iron Knob were estimated at 200,000,000 tons. I admit that some of the deposits to which reference is made in the article are not accessible and might be very costly to develop; but some of them are quite accessible. As to the economic handling of the ore, I do not know whether the Government has given any consideration to the probable cost of shipping ore from Yampi Sound to Newcastle under Australian conditions. That would be a costly operation. At present the freight charge between Sydney and Darwin is £3 a ton, though no doubt if large parcels of iron ore were shipped that rate would be reduced, but freight costs around the tropical north of ""Western Australia would be very high. There were good, economic reasons for continuing to develop the deposit at Yampi. I am not very greatly impressed by the statement that Australia could not afford Possible ""Pro ba bio to allow additional quantities of Iron Ore Iron Ore iron Ore ore to be exported.

I have already reminded honourable members that, at Bell Island, Newfoundland, iron ore is mined for 2 miles under the sea. The iron made from it is sold for a. much lower price than irou is sold for in Australia, to-day. to tunnel the ore as coal is tunnelled. not deal with that intricate subject in reply to questions. 1926-27, the Bruce-Page Government brought British specialists to Australia to make geophysical surveys in various parts of the country. At that time, an amount of £32,000 was expended in such work. One result of it is the development of the Captain's Flat mine, not far from Canberra. The present Treasurer ( Mr Casey) introduced a bill into this Parliament not very long ago which provided for the making of geological and geophysical surveys of certain parts of North Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory. Parliament passed the bill, and an amount of £180,000 was expended under its provisions, but, so far as I know, there i» very little to show for it. [Quorum formed.] The introduction and passing of that bill showed tnat the Government and the Parliament had considerable confidence in geophysical survey work. I ask now that arrangements be maae for a thorotigh geophysical examination of the iron ore deposits of Australia to ascertain their probable extent and It should also have obtained quality, so that we may have reliable and up-to-date information on the real position of Australia in respect of iron ore reserves. If a geophysical survey had been made we should have been enabled, within a couple of months, to ascertain the extent and tonnage of these deposits. Some honorahle members seem to be inclined to treat this matter lightly, but the honourable developments in geophysics during the last century in Sweden and Germany,' and more recently iu Russia and the United States of America, prove that estimating fairly accurately the tonnage of dense bodies of ore. When I advocated the adoption of this method the Treasurer replied to me by letter stating that geophysical methods would not enable us to arrive at the value of the ore. The value of the ore was beside the point. The Government's advisers estimate the quantity of ore available at Koolan Island and Cockatoo Island at from 60,000,000 to 90,000,000 tons. That is the available ore above high water level, but it is quite possible that treble that tonnage could be profitably won below high water level. As far back as what we want to know. could have got that information fairly accurately through geophysical survey. However, the Government intends to survey the deposits at Yampi Sound by tunnelling, and it will bear the whole of that expenditure, which, it is estimated, will he between £30,000 and E40,000. That estimate was supplied to me by Major Vail when I was last in Western Australia.

We shall not get anywhere if we accept advice of that kind. I the loss which it is estimated Western Australia will suffer through the imposition of this embargo. We must also bear in mind the loss of trade with Japan which will result from the imposition of this embargo. All of us are aware of the losses which the wool growers of this country sustained as the result of this Government's trade diversion policy. I entirely disapprove of legislation of this kind. I cannot go so far as to allege that the Government, in imposing this embargo, yielded to vicious influences. I prefer to believe that it was actuated by the fear that Japan might obtain control of the valuable deposits at Yampi Sound. That fear, however, is quite unfounded, because every safeguard has been provided to ensure that the Government of Western Australia, as well as this Government, shall retain that control. I repeat that it would bo far more preferable to develop these resources than merely to allow them to remain unworked. I recall that when, in 1924, the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited was approached with the object of developing these deposits it refused to have anything to do with the proposition. So small a quantity as 15,000,000 tons which, it was proposed, should be the maximum quantity allowed to be exported under this contract, is but a small proportion of the total deposits. The exploitation of these deposits would mean a great deal in the development of the north-west, and would enable us to police and people that part of the Commonwealth, whureas the policy of this Government in this instance must not only antagonize other nations, but also destroy Western Australia's hope of settling the north-west and inflict a serious injury on that State in respect of its commerce and finances. second the motion.

I listened very carefully to the speech of the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory). In moving my amendment, I do not want honorahle members to assume that I am in favour of allowing the export of iron ore from Australia if it can be shown that we have not more than sufficient reserves to meet the requirements of our great key industries. Our first duty should be to Australia, and we should not approach this subject from a purely State viewpoint but from the viewpoint of the interests of Australia as a whole. As a protectionist and a strong advocate for the development of Australia's primary and secondary industries, I emphasize that we must give first consideration to our own requirements. I have a right to ask, however, what are our resources of iron ore ? Is the Minister for the Interior any definite statement in that respect in addition to that made by the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) when he announced the imposition of this embargo?

Indeed, but for the pertinacity of the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Drakeford), in raising this subject on numerous occasions by means of questions, the position in regard to the export of iron ore would have been completely overlooked. I find that the Government earlier opposed the placing of a ban on the export of iron ore. In the beginning of last year the then Minister for Defence( Mr Thorby) said that the Federal Government had no intention whatever to prohibit the export of scrap iron or other metals, even if they were to be used for war purposes by a foreign country. That bore out what had been said by Sir George Pearce, who for several years had heen Minister for Defence. Yet twelve months later the Government decided to impose a ban on exports! In my opinion, it is largely to blame for the position that has arisen, and from which it is to-day endeavouring to extricate itself. There is no doubt that Yampi Sound but should try to develop those secondary has very valuable iron ore deposits, which industries which utilize it so that iron are a great asset to Australia and should and steel products may be exported. not be sacrificed if they are likely to be That ""is done to-day to a limited degree, required hy our secondary industries. and there is no reason why it should not Various estimates have been made of be done on a much larger scale. their extent.

188,For The Interior ( Mr Mcewen) Asked Pearce Added That To Prohibit The Export,"quite understand the Leader of the Opposition making the following commentAs the result of the withdrawal of labour from this industry, the States of South Australia and Western Australia will, I think, be faced with a certain degree of difficulty which otherwise they would not experience. It is not sufficient to say that the Commonwealth Government will be able to ensure that the iron ore which is not exported will ultimately be usable in Australia itselfThe present economic position of South Australia and Western Australia is such that those States are without that great variety of industries which it would be to their advantage to possess. Consequently the Government of Western Australia was quite justified in looking forward hopefully to the development of, for example, Yampi Sound. My point is that since the Government has received authentic and up-to-date in formation regarding Australia's iron ore resources, and is convinced that it would be .against the best interests of Australia to export iron ore, it should immediately take steps in co-operation with the governments of the States concerned, to develop those resources. It has been said that the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited is largely interested in this matter. Indeed, the honourable member for Swan insinuated, although he did not say so in so many words, that that company largely influenced the Government in imposing the embargo. I should like to know whethor the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited has given an undertaking that it will work its lease at Yampi Sound. Has the Government discussed this matter with the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited, which, exporting iron ore from Australia for 3ome time in small quantities? It exported 437,000 tons in 1935-36, and 267,000 tons in 1936-37. doubt this export trade is still being carried on. Interior has said that exports would cease in December next. Practically every country in the world is demanding increased supplies of iron ore. That is not due solely to re-armament programmes ; it .is due in some measure to the fact that nations are becoming increasingly industrialized and therefore require greater supplies of this commodity. Large quantities will be required for Australia [50] in the near future-ver y much larger quantities w ill be needed ten or fifteen years hence than are required to-day. We do not want to find our3elve3 short of this essential raw material. In the United States of America the shortage is so acute that the construction of six warships has been delayed. Beserve stocks in France have been exhausted, and the Government of that country has proposed a prohibitive export tax on iron ore. In Italy steel has heen rationed, and in Germany military demands have monopolized practically all available supplies. The position is so acute in Italy that limitations have been placed on the use of metal in buildings. It is strictly forbidden to use iron bars on railings, gateways, parapets, balconies, floors, &c. The Japanese government has suspended the import duty on pig iron and steel. Several reports have been issued in connection w it h Australia's iron ore resources, and, as D r . Woolnough has said, only two ore bodies of large extent, high grade, and easy access, are known i u Australia, namely, Yampi Soundi n Western Australia and Iron Knobi n South Australia. No one will deny that the conservation of our iron ore resources is a national necessity. Australia must look to its own supplies for its future requirements, and not to overseas countries. Iron ore is an irreplaceable asset, and a great obligation is placed upon the Commonwealth Government to look, not to the immediate future, but to the f a r distant future. An adequate supply of iron ore is of paramount importance to Auswe are told, has been tralia. There is au obligation upon this Government to ascertain definitely and without delay the extent of these resources. The Queensland Minister for No Mines, Mr Foley, last year stated that Queensland was complying with the The Minister for the Commonwealth Government's request to defer the granting of mining leases or rights for the working and export of iron ore.

I have spoken, not as one holding a brief for overseas companies with foreign capital, as is the honourable member, but as one desirous of conserving the interests of Australia generally. The Queensland Cabinet realizes that the mineral deposits of the State cannot be replaced. advisable to refrain from granting any iron ore leases in Queensland until there was definite information regarding the accessibility of supplies. Recently, I read a report by Sir Herbert Gepp on this subject. Honourable members opposite will not quibble at anything which Sir Herbert Gepp may have to say, because he has been the spoiled darling of the present Commonwealth Government for some years. It utilizes him on all kinds of jobs. Sir Herbert Gepp, who had been visiting the gold-fields at Claudia River, in northern Queensland, said that there was considerable evidence of the presence of millions of tons of commercially valuable iron ore which could be easily won. He saidThis deposit requires careful, detailed examination and estimation, as it is possible ing to patch up its internal quarrels, and that it will add materially to Australia's reserves of iron ore. There are also knowu iron ore deposits in Tasmania and New South Wales, but the exact extent of them we do not know. This Government has heen shilly-shallying regarding this matter for three years, and it cannot give us any authentic information even to-day. We have been told that at Blythe River, Tasmania, 30,000,000 tons of ore is in sight, whilst in New South Wales 65,000,000 tons is in sight. Those, however, are merely guesses. What is being done by the Government to ascertain beyond doubt the extent of the iron ore resources of the country? The Government is blameworthy for having fooled the company in Western Australia by tacitly agreeing to the investment of a large sum of money. It allowed the company to develop the enterprise to the point of production. It has fooled 250 men who were offered employment, and has done serious injury to 80 men who are actually employed at the workings, and who are now to be put off. Mr Fmiir. 1 shall accept the Minister's correction. Those engaged in the cattle-raising industry in the north-west of Western Australia, were led to believe that a settlement of 1,000 persons was to be established on the island, or in its vicinity, and they proceeded on the assumption that this settlement would constitute It was thought a market for beef. Various commercial enterprises have been committed to the expenditure of substantial sums of money because the Government was not able to make up its mind; because, in fact, it went to sleep on the job, and was as apathetic in de.iling with this matter as it has been in its approach to other important national issues. Its failure in this regard was very similar to its failure to formulate a truly national policy to be considered hy tbe Premiers Conference held recently at Canberra. The Premiers came to the conference with all kinds of schemes for the development of Australia. The Government of Western Australia had in mind the development of the iron ore resources in that State. The visiting Premiers received an unsympathetic reception because the Conoh monwealth Government was too busy tryin trying to establish an inner Cabinet group to determine national policy. It is no wonder that there was keen disappointment among the representatives of the States, which have the responsibility of caring for upwards of 150,000 unemployed persons throughout Australia, in regard to whom the Commonwealth Government has disclaimed all responsibility. The honourable member'is not now discussing either the motion or the proposed amendment. the House will carry the amendment which I have moved. If it does, it will indicate to the Government that, in the opinion of this House, an obligation rests upon it to take steps definitely to ascertain the extent of the iron ore deposits in Australia, and to co-operate with the State governments in their development.

This is especially necessary, in view of the fact persons unemployed in Australia at the present time. that they are unemployable. In fact, the vast majority of them could be employed on developmental works of this kind. The difficulties of the Government of Western Australia have been greatly accentuated by the backing and filling and general indifference of the Commonwealth Government. Ministers of the Government gave misleading answers to the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( MrD r j k e for d ) and other honourable members who made inquiries on this subject. Then, like a. bolt from the blue, came the action of the Government in imposing a total prohibition upon the export of iron ore at a time when the Government of Western Australia, mid every reason to believe that nothing would be done to prevent the development of the industry. ber has exhausted his time. Interior) [8.23] -The arguments used by the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) in support of his motion show that he is not f u l l y acquainted with all the circumstances of the ease. for the amendment of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde), it is only necessary to point out that what lie proposes has, in fact, already heen done by the Government. His amendment is to the effect that the Government should undertake a comprehensive survey of Australia's iron ore resources. It is within the knowledge of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, as of other honourable members, that many months ago the Government arrived at that conclusion and acted upon it . It initiated a survey of the iron ore resources of Australia, and I shall give details of that survey a little later. I should like to set out clearly the history of events which led up to the imposition of the export embargo by the Government, and to the decision to embark upon a survey of the iron ore resources of the country. It was stated by the honourable member for Swan, and reiterated by the Deputy Leader of the that there are 150,000 Opposition, that the Prime Minister( Mr. Lyons), and the Leader of the GovernI t cannot be said ment in the Senate at that time, had stated that there existed no reasons for preventing the export of iron ore fro m Australia. That is true: those statements were made, but, unfortunately, it transpired that the statements had been made without such knowledge as later came into the possession of the Government. Very briefly, the history of that phase of the matter is as follows: On the 16th November, 1935, the Premier of Western Australia advised the Prime Minister of a proposal to develop the iron ore leases at Yampi Sound, and to export the ore to Japan. At that stage, the Commonwealth Government aud its officers believedthe. company concerned, had and their belief was in accord with the general impression of most Australiansthat the iron ore resources of this country were very substantial; in fact, so substantial as to be practically unlimited. Acting on that belief, the. Prime Minister advised the Premier of Western Australia that he saw no reason why the leases should not be developed for expon. purposes. It is the attitude of the Government to-day, as it was then, that if there is more than sufficient iron ore in Australia to provide for our requireAs ments now and in the future, there exists no reason why the surplus should not be exported to foreign countries. Shortly attei* rKat expression of opinion by the Prime Minister, doubts were raised regarding the extent of our iron ore resources. On the 9th March, 1937, Cabinet decided that an investigation should be made, and all the States were approached in an effort to obtain information on the subject. It may be noted here that the Constitution leaves all matters pertaining to raining within the control of rhe State parliaments. It is another unfortunate aspect of Australia's federal system of government that the governments which were constitutionally",52,Speaker Hon. G J Bell Been Disposed Of Because I T Showed That

196,Mr Mcewen (Indi,"Minister for thehi control of mining had not, in the exercise of their powers, conducted a survey of the iron ore resources of the various States. No doubt they desired to make the survey, but the fact remains that they did not do so, probably because of shortage of funds. In reply to the inquiries addressed by the Commonwealth Government to the State governments, information was furnished on the ISth June, 1937, and was submitted to Mr Nye, the chief executive officer of the North Australian survey, for comment. J937, Mr Nye furnished a report in which he said, among other things, that there was. evidence in the information supplied by the States that iron ore deposits were adequate for the immediate needs of Australian industry,' but that there was considerable reason to doubt the adequacy of those resources to meet the needs of the more distant future. Acting on that report, Cabinet decided, on the Sth August, 1937, that Dr.' Woolnough, the Commonwealth Geological Adviser, should make an investigation. On the llth August, 1937, the States were asked to grant no further leases where there was any prospect of the ore obtainedon those leases being exported. They were told that the preliminary investigation had raised a doubt as to the adequacy of Australia's total resources. On the 31st August, 1937, the Prime Minister announced that, in view of the definite information then in his possession, he saw no justifiable reason immediately to interfere with the development of the Vampi Sound leases. Eurther inquiries proceeded, and, on the 14th April last, Dr. Woolnough submitted a report in which he stated that, unless our known resources of accessible iron nr« were, conserved, Australia, in a little more Australia's steel industry. The honourable than a generation, would become an importer rather than an exporter of iron ore. On the 19th May, 193S, the Prime Minister announced that the exportation of iron ore would be prohibited as from the 1st July last. That action was not claimed to have been taken by reason of final aud sufficient information as lo the total resources in Australia. The prohibition was imposed rather because serious doubt had been thrown upon the previous estimates, and consequently most serious apprehension had arisen as to the adequacy of the resources for the future development of Australia's iron and steel industry. vious estimates? on that point later. Throughout the history of the investigation of these resources, we have experienced, without a single exception, successive and serious diminutions of the estimates, not only of On the 22nd June, the total resources of Australia, but, also of each individual group. counting the offal, and only took into consideration the rich ore. said in support of the honourable member's statement. The honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) based his case on a series of contentions from separate aspects of this matter. He introduced, with very great force, the international implications of the embargo. We must all agree that it is undesirable to deny to any foreign country access to raw materials; but I am sure that the honourable member recognizes that this objection to the prohibition could be upheld only if conclusive evidence were available that the supply of raw material was adequate for the nation's own use. He also referred, as did the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mv. Forde), to the economic aspects of the embargo. He told us, with considerable force, of its economic effect upon Western Australia, and also upon individual miners and mining interests. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition dealt more particularly with the economic effect of the embargo on the national development of member for Swan further mentioned that the projected development at Yampi Sound has been prevented. that regard. deny that the imposition of the embargo has had an immediate effect upon development at Yampi Sound; but I hope to satisfy honourable members that, although Western Australia has suffered temporary",53,Speaker Hon.

203,Mr Mcewen,"It would be futile toloss, inevitably the resources at Yampi Sound will be fully exploited later. The general right of every nation to make a preferential reservation of its raw materials and natural resources for its own use will not be disputed by any honourable member. Tlie honourable member for Swan quoted a statement by Sir George Pearce during the time when he was Leader of the Government in the Senate, that to deny access to these resources by, for instance, Germany, would be to strengthen the claims of that country for colonies. It has been pointed out, and none of us wish to dispute the fact, that to deny to any foreign country access to raw materials is to engender at least an unfriendly attitude to ihe country imposing the embargo; but it is conceded by every civilized nation that any country has a right to reserve for its own people first use of its natural resources. ciple been generally conceded, but the Raw Materials -Committee of the League of Nations, during the time when Japan was a member of the League, declared, on behalf of all the member nations, that, whilst it was desirable that available to it which is not equally availaccess to raw materials should not be denied to foreign countries, it was the belief of all members of the League that each country should have the first right to its own raw materials, and that only when there was a reasonable surplus of those materials should there be an expectation that they would be made available to other countries. Only because serious doubt has arisen in the mind of the Government as to the adequacy of Australia's resources of iron ore has it imposed the present prohibition. Every one of us hopes that it will not be necessary to maintain the embargo permanently. The Government has made it clear that if the investigations demonstrate that sufficient reserves of iron ore investigation will not be unduly long. are available in Australia for our own immediate and future requirements, it will lift the embargo, and make available to foreign countries any surplus which Australia can afford to export. The embargo has not been aimed at any particular country. The Government's action has heen taken for one reason only, namely, the need for conserving for our own people the resources which we are fortunate enough to find in Australia, and which are certainly necessary for the development of our iudustries. tion from anywhere else? able to reply that this action has most definitely been taken without any outside suggestion. The point, on which the honourable member for Swan has dwelt most fully is his doubt that there is a fear in the mind of the Government regarding the adequacy of Australia's resources of iron ore. He has referred to the opinions of various authorities, and has quoted some who have said that the resources are adequate. He remarked that one authority estimated sixteen years ago that Australia had' visible and potential resources of iron ore totalling S00,000,000 tons. I believe that that estimate was Not only has this prinmade by a committee from Great Britain, which visited this country for only a few weeks. It made no personal investigation, but, collating the estimates in certain old reports, merely ventured that opinion. It certainly had no information able to the present Government. posed the embargo after a very shors examination. nation sufficient to leave grave doubt as to the adequacy of the supply. The Government does not claim to have acted on definite and conclusive information. It took what it believed to be the proper course, when a sufficient degree of doubt was raised regarding the adequacy of our resources. long task to ascertain how many tons of iron ore we have in Australia? It is not sufficient to know the dimensions of the beds of iron ore; it is also necessary to find out their assay value and their mineralogical characteristics. It is important to know whether the ore is suitable for smelting, or whether it is of a refractory kind. It i i certainly necessary to consider tht resourees from economic aspects.

Therefore, the Government proposes to conduct an exhaustive and detailed examination of all the iron ore resources of this country. In this regard, the Commonwealth Government has called to its assistance the Mines Departments of the various States and their respective experts, and has asked every State government whether it would choose with its own Mines Department and its own ofiicers to conduct a survey of its own ore, or whether it would prefer that the Commonwealth Government should do so. With this inquiry has gone the offer of the Commonwealth to bear the cost of the survey, irrespective of whether a State elects to conduct the survey itself or asks that the Commonwealth should do so. The States have elected in different ways. 1. propose briefly to refer to a few of the known deposits in Australia, and to give a short history of them, so far as the claimed knowledge of their magnitude is concerned. We have heard much, for instance, of the Portland Roads deposit, in Queensland. lately been made of that deposit by Dr. Woolnough in company with the Queensland State Geologist, and the conclusion which they arrived at-and in this they are in agreement-is that this deposit is much too highly contaminated with silica and rock material, and is too scattered for economic working. The ore is too friable to stand transport without high loss, and therefore the deposit must be regarded as of no value when assessing the iron ore resources of the Commonwealth. The deposits at Mount Lucy, in Queensland, are regarded-and in each instance I am stating the joint opinion of Dr. Woolnough and the State ""Geologist-as too small and too impure in the bulk. Then there is the deposit at Iron Island, off the Queensland coast. A preliminary reconnaissance indicated that that deposit repMr SfaEiacu. resented a bulk of iron ore of some Creek, 2,500,000 tons. A more close examination has disclosed that it is merely a sheetSuch ing of iron ore over a core of diorite, and been taken into it has been necessary to reduce the initial estimate from 2,500,000 tons to 500,000 tons. The ore has also heen disclosed to be of the magnetite variety which is refractory and not amenable to smelting. At Biggenden, Queensland, there is a deposit which was estimated at 600,000 tons, a very small quantity in considering the iron ore resources of the Commonwealth. This earlier estimate still stands, but considerations of quality eliminate the deposit from consideration. It contains impurities of various kinds, including bismuth, and the ore itself is of the magnetite variety. At Mount Philp and Mount Leviathan, in the Cloncurry district, there are undoubtedly large deposits but these are 400 miles from the coast and very much further from any potential smelting centre. The cost of transport would put these deposits quite outside the range of economic consideration. future as it is possible for us to look. At Cadia and Carcoar, in New South Wales, there are deposits originally estimated by the State Geologist at 39,000,000 tons. They would be included at that figure in the total cited by the honourable member for Swan( Mr An investigation has Gregory). This is one deposit which has been actually worked. Exploitation has proved that there are very substantial quantities of enclosed rock, and very great impurities in the ore. There is conclusive evidence that the total volume of usable ore in those deposits is 2,000,000 tons as against an original estimate of 39,000,000 tons. Certain other deposits in New South Wales disclose similar features. In the opinion of the State Geologist in Victoria, there are no deposits in that State of any consequence which could possibly be taken into consideration. Turning to Tasmania, there is a deposit at Beaconsfield which was originally estimated by people who were regarded as competent investigators at 35,000,000 tons, t t is obvious that they did not make a very comprehensive investigation",55,Speaker Hon.

MrM o EWEN T h a t is the pronouncement of competent investigators. WhatI have said goes to show that in the eastern States of Australia, with the exception of the Cloncurry district, there i.s not one iron ore deposit of any consequence. I invite, any honourable member of this House who doubts that statement to mention the name of any one deposit in the eastern portion of Australia which is of economic consequence. The deposit iu the Clonc.urry district is more than 400 miles from the seaboard and the cost of transport eliminates it. from economic consideration. Two States only.

[Leave to continue given.] In 1919, Mr Montgomery, then State Mining Engineeri n Western Australia, proceeded to Yampi Sound to make an investigation and assessment of the quantity of iron ore at Cockatoo Island and Koolan Island. He spent six days at Yampi Sound and estimated that the total quantity of iron ore available at that centre is approximately 97,000,000 tons. water level. assessments made by various personsinvestigations have been made by private mining interests as well as by Government authorities-hav e agreed in certain respects, in that they have shown that of the two deposits those on the northern ends of the two islands must be eliminated from consideration hecause their siliceous nature suitable for smelting purposes. The southern ore body on Koolan Island, leased by Brasserts Limited, of London, tapers from a thin deposit at each end to a thicker deposit in the centre. The whole of the deposit was taken into consideration by Mr Montgomery, but later investigations tend to show that the tapering ends are highly siliceous and will have to be eliminated. Only the middle portion can be considered. Even acting upon Mr Montgomery's estimate, the centre portion of the southern deposit of Koolan Island will not give a total of more than 40,000,000 tons of iron ore. A t present the usable deposit at Cockatoo Island is being investigated by Australian I r o n and Steel Limited, a company which has been merged tlie BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited. Later this deposit w ill be invesmight have been employed at Yampi tigated by Western Australian mining authorities at the request and at the expense, of the Commonwealth Government. The result of the investigation to date compels us to reduce the expectation from the I r o n Knob and the Yampi groups very materially-to what extent, I am it is the considered opinion of the Commonwealth Dr. Woolnough, that the total usable iron less than 150,000,000 tons, and that it is not likely to exceed 200,000,000 tons. This has to be considered against the knowledge that Australia is at present using 2,000,000 tons a year, that two new large blast furnaces just completed w ill raise this amount to about 3,000,000 tons, and that our iron and steel industry is sure to expand and demand a constantly increasing amount of ore. I have given to the House the history of the successive investigations of individual deposits, showing a progressive diminution of the estimates of iron ore available. Deposits may be eliminated for various reasonsSubsequent high land transport costs, their siliceous nature, or the fact that the ore is refractory. In the light of this information, I -suggest that every honourable member should coneur in the action which the Government has taken in imposing an embargo upon tbe export of iron ore from Australia. If further investigations should discloso renders them unthat there is more than an adequate supply available for Australia's immediate and future requirements, the embargo will be lifted and the export io foreign countries permitted.

Dr. Woolnough has informed me that he has studied in the original language the full reports upon which action was taken in Sweden, and he points out that whereas geophysical investigation discloses, not the certainty, but the probability of a deposit, it is not possible by that method to disclose the type of ore, its usefulness or its smelting properties. impossible to determine whether it is associated with impurities or is of a refractory nature. That can be determined only by the actual excavation of the iron ore itself. The honourable member for Swan also referred to the possibility if working the iron ore deposits at Yampi Island below high water level. He has informed us that similar deposits in Newfoundland arc worked below the high water level, but he does not know that the geological natures of the two ores are dissimilar. know that there are great cavities or voids iu the ore at Yampi Sound.

None of these opinions need be accepted tunnelling and certain other as conclusive or final, but we must ask ourselves whether we can permit our iron ore resources so to diminish that we shall be forced to import supplies.

It was then apparent that foreign interests were seeking a foothold in Australia, and the information that the Government had available did not make it necessary for an investigation' to determine the extent of the Commonwealth's resources of iron ore.

Something should he done by this Parliament to compel the BrokenH i ll Proprietary Company Limited, that great organization which appears to have a monopoly in Australia, to develop its lease at Yampi Sound, or to encourage some otlier local company to do the work which is waiting to be clone, but the Government has done nothing in either direction. As the result, the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) has movedThat Statutory Rules Kos. OH and 80 of 1»3S, were assured that there was only amending the Customs Regulations, be disallowed. The honourable member's action is undeistandable in view of the delay which took place in prohibiting the export of iron ore from Australia, delay for which this Government was entirely responsible. 1 do not think that it can shift its responsibilities, no matter how hard it tries to do so, on to the shoulders of any other authority. The Government's inaction has .justifiably given rise to a spirit of disappointment Western Australia. As far back as September, 1936, the Government encouraged those interested and the general public to believe that there was little, if any, chance of a restriction being placed on the export of iron ore. Minister( Mr Lyons) said that the control of the development of the deposits in Western Australia was a matter for the Government of that State. He indicated that the Commonwealth Government had power to prohibit or to refuse a permit for export, but said that the Government felt no more justified in prohibiting the export of iron ore to Japan than in prohibiting the export of wool! The ridiculousness of that statement is shown by the fact that, whilst we can produce large quantities of wool every year, we know that, if we export our iron ore, we can never replace it. That is just an example of how this Government looks at things until it is startled into life again by the Opposition. When attention was drawn to the matter in August, 1937, the then Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Pearce, expressed the view of the Government in a way which would encourage the interested parties and the public to take the view that the Commonwealth Government had no fixed opinion on the matter, because he -saidThe Commonwealth Government is aware of no reason why it should interfere. The excuse made by the Minister for the Interior to-night was that the Government was not at that time in possession of information which would have justified it in taking action; yet we know that the Government could have been in possession of authoritative estimates which showed that the supplies of iron ore were limited. If the Government 313,000,000 tons of iron ore available, would it in 1936 have permitted export to take place? That question demands an answer. When I raised this matter in 1937 it was received with incredulity by members of the Country party. They ridiculed my estimate that Australia would soon be absorbing 2,000,000 tons of ore a year as not being worth considering, but we have since learned that the amount of iron ore which Australia uses aud resentment in annually has increased much above 2,000,000 tons, and it is possible that, before long, we shall be needing 5,000,000 tons per annum. If it be true, as was suggested by the Minister, that iron ore resources in Australia do not exceed The Prime 200,000,000 tons, they will not have a very long life on an annual local use of 5,000,000 tons of iron ore. The Government has fallen down on this job as it has fallen down on other jobs. There was plenty of information available at each of the dates mentioned by the Minister on which the Government could have acted, but it failed to obtain it, and it caused the belief to develop that the deposits at Yampi Sound could bo exploited, and the ore extracted and exported without damage to our position. It neglected its duty, and that neglect, in the first instance, has given rise to an expression of sentiment, both in this Parliament and in the Parliament of Western Australia, which indicatesI am sorry to find that it is so-a n extension of the feeling against the Commonwealth at a time when everything possible should be done to allay such hostility. How can we make progress towards a more united Commonwealth when these things are done? There is at least, one newspaper in Australia, the Melbourne Age, which did not hesitate to point out the danger of allowing the export of iron ore to proceed. It gave particulars and information based on an interview with or an article by Dr. G. B. Pritchard, a well known authority, who was lecturer in geology and metallurgy at the Melbourne University and head of the School of Mines at the Melbourne Technical School. The estimates by Dr. Pritchard were, as a matter of fact, more conservacarrying it to Japan, the remainder of tive in regard to Yampi Sound than those of Mr Clements, and they seem to have been based on good grounds. The Government, as the result of questions and criticisms, awoke from its sleep and decided that it was time to do something. The article and the publicity helped to concentrate attention on the position. It was followed up in Victoria by another persona layman, but one who is wellinformed on the question. I refer to Mr J. Bell, a constituent of mine. He is a blast furnace man, but he spends hours in seeking information as to Australian resources, not only of iron ore but also of other raw materials. has rendered valuable service and whose opinions are backed up by those of experts who have technical knowledge. One of the aspects of this matter that warrants consideration is the claim made by Western Australia. T think that wo have to take a broad national outlook and not just a State view, but I realize that the Government of Western Australia has grounds for complaint, because it was encouraged in the belief that it could continue to make arrangements with a foreign company to come to Australia, and then, after a large amount of capital had been invested in the project, found that an embargo was to he placed on the export of iron ore. mis-handled. upon honourable members for Western Australia, however, that we could reap no real gaiu from foreign nations exploiting our iron ore. In what way would the Western Australian Government or the Commonwealth Government gain any advantage by permitting foreign nations to exploit the best iron ore resources in Australia ? In what way would the export of iron ore to foreign countries mean the development of agricultural or pastoral industries in the north-western area of Western Australia? It seems to have been claimed by the State Premier and other members of the Western Australian Parliament that as iron ore would occupy only a small space on vessels the space could be filled with cattle from ;he north-western districts. I l seems to iue that there is very little in that claim. Even store-bred cattle cannot be exported from Canada to England, so what chance would there be of exporting wild cattle from Western Australia to Japan? Derby to Fremantle; there would be no difference in sending cattle to Japau. would uot be economical. My statement is made on views expressed by such an authority as Mr Cramsie, who said that the transport of stall-fed cattle between Canada and England was unprofitable because of the wastage of condition on the voyage. If that wastage took place on the voyage between Canada and England, it is ridiculous to suggest that wild station-bred cattle could be carried satisfactorily from Australia to Japan. The Minister has indicated that something will he done by way of compensation. There may be some justification for compensation being paid to the State of Western Australia, but before any payment is made to the company or other private interests concerned, the nature and extent of the work carried out by it at Yampi Sound should be ascertained. was carried out. 0 hand, it is claimed that a great deal of work has been done there, why did the warden at Broome Tecommend twelve",60,Speaker Hon.

Blast furnaces, steel-making furnaces, and steel mills are being erected in Japan, Korea, Manchuria, and China by Japanese interests.

Mr Spurr went on to sayI t is conceivably a step backward, a reversion, but what attitude shall America take? Thu British and French nationalism need not disquiet us so much as that of tliu Japanese, still more intense and purposeful and working with the same German tools (not made in Germany, but in America, but like most Gorman arts successfully copied and utilized.) now adopted by England and France in self defence. America also has had a re-birth of nationalism quite necessary in the existing state of affairs. Later he observedAs the case now stands, ( I ) The United States of America holds 71 per cent, of the world's petroleum in 1917. (2) Great Britain far behind, but in a way to overtake us under her new system. Dealing with iron and coal he saidIn iron and coal, United States leads. The second place in the steel, held by Germany, was lost during the war, and now goes to Great Britain, already second in coal and with her iron industries in charge of a government controlled syndicate for the purpose of protection and expansion. Mr Spurr included in his review a long list of minerals of one hind and another and the position, in order of importance, of the nations in respect of each mineral. The list is interesting, but time will not permit me to give it in detail. Mr Spurr emphasized the important place that the United States of America holds in respect of petroleum which is, of course, the source of power and light and is the key to the mastery of the air. Next in order is fuel coal and its ally, the great metallic mineral, iron, which must go together for the manufacture of iron and steel, the backbone of .all our mechanical achievements. Why should we permit this essential mineral to go away to other countries? Australia has certain mineral resources which should be used to the best advantage. I have no desire to say anything that could be justly interpreted as expressing a wish to prevent another country from obtaining minerals from Australia which are available in this country to. an almost unlimited extent. AllI say is that iron ore does not fall into that class. We have not an unlimited supply of iron ore. In these circumstances Western Australia has no real grievance; in regard to the embargo itself, it should look at the subject in the light of the national requirements of Australia. Undoubtedly when the Lyons Government first considered this subject it showed that, like practically all composite and compromise governments, it lacked vision. Otherwise it would not have permitted, without protest, foreign interests in the guise of a company with a British name, to acquire a footing at Yampi Sound. When it came to understand the real position it also showed that it lacked the power, as do all governments comprised of opposing interests, to deal with the situation effectively. If the Government yields to the pressure now being brought to bear upon it to withdraw or slacken the regulations now in force, or if it does anything to weaken the effectiveness of this too-long-delayed embargo on the export of iron ore, it will undoubtedly deserve the derision of the Australian people. However, the claim by the Western Australian Government, and the representatives of Western Australia in this chamber, that the Commonwealth Government should take steps at once to develop the iron ore deposits of Yampi Sound and utilize them for the benefit of the Australian people has merit in it. A government which is not deprived, by its very composition, of the capacity to put into operation progressive ideas would find no insuperable difficulty in developing this deposit, and, by pursuing such a course, it would win the admiration of Australia, generally, and of Western Australia in particular. The amendment of the Acting Leader of the Opposition should commend itself to every member of the House who has a true Australian outlook, whereas the proposal of the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory), being of a retrograde nature, should be resisted. The carrying of the motion for the disallowance of the regulation would lay Australia open to present and future danger. The amendment provides the opportunity for honourable members to indicate, on a -non-party subject, that the Parliament believes it to be the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government to ensure that the resources of this country, in whatever State they exist, are not allowed to remain undeveloped so long as any Australian citizen is looking for an avenue in which. his brains and energy may be advantageously employed. gratulate the Minister for the Interior of the Government's policy.

243,Mr Nairn,"No; he is more thancourse, we must bear in mind that, so far, there has been no real exploration of the iron ore occurrences of the Commonwealth, the reason being that hitherto iron ore has been too cheap for us to devote much time to it . The proposal made to the Commonwealth Government in respect of Yampi Sound was that the export of 15,000,000 tons of iron ore, at the rate of 1,000,000 tons a year, should be permitted. Even if D r . Woolnough's figures were accepted, the iron ore at Yampi Sound would not be exhausted for over 50 years. Of the acknowledged resources of first class iron ore in Australia, au export of 15,000,000 tons would represent only about 5 per cent. bers to contrast our attitude in respect of iron with that adopted by America with respect to oil A t one stage alarming reports were circulated that the oil wells in the United States of America were rapidly becoming ijxhausted, but, in spite of such fears, the people of that country realized that the export of oil was a profitable trade and refused to curtail it in any way. I fail ""> see any reason why we should expect, a shortage of iron for our requirements. Iron has been used for thousands of years-as f a r back as Tubal-Cain, of Genesis. It was used freely in the earliest ages, and at no time in its history has the world experienced a shortage. the cheapness of iron. hand, however, there is a prospect that the demand for iron w ill diminish, because the tendency in modern times is to rely more on the use of lighter metals, and, it may be, that iron w ill share the fate that has befallen coal. A t one time the fear was expressed that the coal deposits of GreatB r it a in would soon become exhausted with the result that opposition arose to the export of coal. As the result of the discovery of other kinds of power, however, coal has become comparatively a drug on the market, and to-day England, like Australia, has moro coal in reserve than it can use. In hoarding up our resources of iron, we may hoard up something for which, in the not far distant future, we shall have comparatively little use at allThe existence of the deposits at Yampi Sound has been known for half a century, and at various times efforts have been made by specu lators to induce others to exploit them. Those efforts were unsuccessful, and there was no suggestion of prohibiting the export of iron from Yampi until, at last, a company was formed which was prepared to do something, not merely hi the way of speculation, but actually to utilize the deposits. Immediately that company showed that it meant business, and proceeded to go about its work, propaganda of the kind usually associated with commercial rivalry was disseminated in the eastern States, and, ultimately, pressure was brought to bear upon this Government to frustrate it . AlthoughI invite honourable memthe Government had for eighteen months permitted, and, indeed, encouraged this company to gu on with its proposal to work these resources, i l finally yielded to that, pressure and imposed this embargo. ber's statement that the Government yielded to pressure is entirely wrong. rect that statement and say that, at any rate, the Government changed its opinion. The Government has placed itself in the humiliating position of having to meet claims for compensation amounting to hundreds of thousands of pounds. It was asked to permit the export of 15,000,000 tons of iron n r at the rate of 1,000,000 0 That probably accounts for tons a year. It would have been eighteen On the other months before any ore would have been exported. In any case, 15,000,000 tons is not an appreciable proportion of the total deposits of iron ore in Australia, and I am of opinion that the Government rather gave way to panic in going back on its previous decision. It has been said that this embargo has been imposed in the interests of our own iron industry which is at present controlled by the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited. I shall not yield to the temptation to say that that company is behind this move, because [ can find no evidence to support such a statement. Indeed, I have the greatest admiration for that company. However, the result of the embargo w ill , in fact, be to the benefit of that company, because it has a monopoly of iron in Australia. Taking a long view of this policy, I am quite sure that, despite the fact that under",66,Speaker Hon. G J Bell Been Disposed Of Because I T Showed That

I suggest that if this embargo is being imposed in the interests of industry in Australia, and if that company enjoys the monopoly to which 1 have referred, it is the duty of the Government to sec that the company works the leases which it holds at Cockatoo Island, Yampi Sound. It is not right that any company should be permitted to hold leases unless it makes some attempt to work them. I point out that the taxpayers of Australia will have to foot the bill for compensation, and that, perhaps, is one of the most retain possession of large areas of land unfortunate results of the Government's action. The people of Western Australia are extremely disappointed that this embargo has been imposed. They had hoped that this new industry would have been established in that State, particularly in view of the fact that it will be extremely difficult to develop the north-west by any means other than mining. Australia does not receive assistance from the Commonwealth proportionate to that Northern Territory. bear in mind that an empty north-west is a national danger, and, consequently, there are strong national reasons for populating that part of the Commonwealth. It would be more satisfactory to have a. sturdy population of miners South Wales or Victoria. If they were, established at Yampi Sound. There may be room for differences of opinion as to how we can best serve national interests in this matter. bers have suggested that Japanese interests should not be permitted to secure any footing in Australia. On the other hand, purely as a matter of national expediency, it may be better to adopt the policy of trading freely with our neighbours rather than provoking them by refusing to trade with them, or by refusing to supply to them raw materials which they require and of which we have ample supplies. More than in any other way the peace of the world is endangered by the placing of restrictions upon trade between nations. The interests of peace can best Mr Xaim. be served by insisting upon the principle that there shall be no hoarding of raw has been said concerning the necessity for a policy of decentralization in Australia. Australia may very soon have to consider its position in relation to tlie Mandated Territory of New Guinea. The adoption of this dog-in-the-manger policy in regard to raw materials will, more than anything else, provide grounds for the intervention of otlier countries. After all, we are only a small community. We cannot expect to hold valuable deposits like those at Yampi Sound, unless we are prepared to use them. Instead, the opinion is being put forward, I think with justification, that no nation is entitled to unless it can effectively occupy them, and countries like Australia will not be permitted to hold large and valuable areas unless they can defend them. If we are to defend Australia, and particularly north-western Australia, we must people that area, and the exploitation of the mineral resources there offers the best Western hope of establishing a population. In this regard, the Government seems to be actuated by those narrow and selfish which is given to the motives which are, unfortunately, too We must also much in evidence in Australia. I do not think that honourable members are looking at this matter from a national standpoint. It is unfortunate for those whose capital has been vested at Yampi Sound, that the deposits are uot situated in New find the Government had proposed an embargo, honourable members representing the State affected would have combined Many honourable memin protest against interference with the exploitation of natural wealth. general experience. State interests are just as strong in the eastern States as in tbe west. It is most unfortunate that this industry, which is the most promising development we have had in Western Australia for many years, should be squashed by the Government in the alleged interest of Australia as a whole. It does not seem to me that there was any need to impose this embargo, in view of the limited quantity of ore which was to be",67,Speaker Hon. G J Bell Been Disposed Of Because I T Showed That

There was no clanger of the development of interests which might cause international complications at a later stage. The Government could have made it quite clear that, in allowing that quantity of ore to he exported, it reserved the right to restrict or prohibit exports at any stage, if necessary. Fifteen million tons is a mere trifle compared with the total iron ore available, and it would have been better, in the interests of Australia as a whole, if the embargo had not been imposed. [10.14] I do not propose to speak on conserve this matter at any length. The honourable member for Maribyrnong ( MrI am opposed to the proposal of the Drakeford) has expressed the views honourable member for Swan( Mr which I hold, and the explanation Gregory) to disallow these regulations, of the Minister for the Interior and I support the amendment of the factory to me.

It is essential that we should utilize these raw materials for the development of our own iron and steel trades. Every ounce of iron ore which can be economically mined will be needed for the production of raw materials for Australian industries. Honourable members may recall tliat construction work on the Sydney Harbour Bridge was delayed tor some time owing to a shortage of Steel, and it is well known that the scarcity of steel girders is retarding the building boom in all States. Yet some people are inclined to encourage the export of Australian iron ore. My principal reason for taking part in this debate was to protest against the regrettable note sounded by the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory), who seemed to imply that there was something underhand about the method in which the more recent reports on Australian ore reserves were furnished to the Commonwealth. PossiblyI misunderstood the houorable member for Swan, but dearly he gave me the impression he was casting a reflection upon Dr. ""Woolnough, adviser. I regret this very much indeed, and I should not he doing my duty if I did not say that not long ago I had the pleasure, not of working with Dr. Woolnough but of accompanying him through Central and North Australia. occasion he was engaged in making an examination of a ridge 30 miles long at Tennant Creek, where gold had been discovered. 150, whose interests were bound up in that venture, were very concerned about the potential value of their leases, and were waiting for some company or the Government to assist them. reluctant to install plants, which would cost probably pending a report from some recognized expert. was sent to Tennant Creek to examine the area and report to the Government. saw him carrying duties there under very great and doing work which many a younger man would not have cared to face. Later, at Darwin, I met the Mines Director, and other mining experts at Waverley, Creek and other parts of Central Australia, all of whom expressed satisfaction with the work done by Dr. Mr Holloway. Woolnough. 1 think that the Government is very fortunate to have an adviser deservedly enjoying such a high reputation inside and outside Australia. D r . Woolnough has had 40 years' experience in this country. He is a competent adviser in all matters relating to metals, minerals, oil or other geological features, and knowing him as I do, I resent any suggestion that he would be associated in any way with advice that was not founded upon a thorough investigation of any problem submitted to him. I do not know whether the honourable member for Swan intended to convey that impression of Dr. Woolnough's report, but I would say that if there was any suggestion of ulterior motives in connection with the exploitation of the Yampi Sound deposits, it was in the method by which the original company iron obtained its charter. All the world knows that the promoters did not make clear that it was a purely Japanese concern. that Only when those in authority became aware of this fact was action taken to the Commonwealth geological put a stop to foreign exploitation. Then with the assistance of some Australian people and some English people, a company was established in London to work the deposits; but everybody knew that it was still a Japanese firm. I am not conOn that cerned whether Japan or any other country gets our raw materials if they are not necessary for Australian industries. I do not believe in favoured The miners, numbering about nation treatment. I believe that if we have an excess of raw materials they should he made available to all nations on equal terms. I cannot understand any Australian not desiring that raw They were materials should not be exported until we are quite sure that our own requirements .£100,000 or £1.50,000, nre met.

It has been I discussed exhaustively from all parts of out his important rhe House, and I think that the House difficulties, is agreed that the first duty of the Commonwealth Government in this matter is ro ensure that we retain within Australia, an adequate supply of those raw Pine materials which are essential for our < future development.

The development of the last 150 years proves that the more remote an area is the more necessary is reliance upon the mining industry to provide the initial urge to the introduction of population. Surely every honourable member must realize the necessity for fostering that area and placing in it a population which will engage in economic endeavour! I was astonished at the remarks of the Minister, who inferentially practically admitted that he has not yet sufficient information in regard to the resources of Australia, and stated that the Government will later alter its decision in regard to the export which tlie money was made available for of surplus production. a surplus. would not be lowered in any degree if the company in Western Australia were permitted to operate for another fifteen or 40 years. Even during that fifteen years, however, I do not think that it should exploit the ore to the full extent. The ore should be rationed, as was suggested hy the honourable member for Perth( Mr instruments respond in about four general Nairn). A negative attitude has been adopted by the Minister to Portland Roads, regarding which only meagre information has been obtained. stated that the iron ore beds in the Clonciirry district, are too far from the coast, but I claim that they are in an ideal positiou. They art near Mount Isa, where machinery to the value of £4,000,000 is available. That plant could be converted into a little arsenal. If this Parliament is to display any vision at all, it must realize that an outlet to the Gulf of Carpentaria will be required in the near future. Portland Roads is only fifteen miles from the North Queensland coast, where deep water is available, yet the Minister is prepared to accept a tentative report from two geologists to the effect that that area is inaccessible. 1 am given to understand that the iron ore a downhill grade to the sea and thence to Bowen, where there is a deep-water barhour and ample supplies of coal and coke. Therefore, I am surprised that the Minister seems to show an unconscious bias against the development of known resources without accurate information regarding their value. The honourable member for Swan referred to the geophysical survey now being undertaken in Northern Australia. It seems to me that in the near future this Parliament will demand to know whether it is receiving full value for the money already expended in connection with this investigation. To a certain extent, I am in. favour of this survey; in fact, my maiden speech in this chamber was delivered in support of the bill by this work. Yet, I fear that much money has been wasted, because advantage has not been taken of scientific information that was available to us by reason of the Canadian practice. This practice has not been followed in locating ore at depth, apart from the simple procedure of locating magnetic iron at depth. The survey committee has been guided merely by the movements of a compass on radial lines in locating anomalies at depth. In locating ore structure, geophysical ways. In the first place, iron responds in the simple way to the compass, and this is the only method that seems to have been adopted here. Secondly, they The Minister respond to a sulphide body, but no geophysical instrument is accurate at a depth greater than about 400 feet, and attempts are being made to locate ore at greater depths than that. In Canada., where glacial action exposed the sulphides, it was possible to obtain information as to conditions down to 400 feet, because the sulphide bodies were either exposed or left at a lesser depth than 400 feet. Under the third method, the instruments are influenced by a shear or fault at depth, and it would be necessary to sink a. shaft to a point near or within 400 feet of the shear-zone before it would be possible to obtain a definite reaction by the instrument; even then, it",71,Speaker Hon.

Fourthly, by the sound method used in Canada, the scientist can recognize certain reactions off the dome, in contrast to the greater depth from the oil bed abutting on it ; naturally, the bore is not placed above the dome. member should confine his remarks to the matter before the Chair, rather than discuss scientific methods of locating iron ore. rated the vairious methods was to point out that further immediate advantage should be taken of the one and only method that has proved of value to Australia, the location of magnetic iron ore, and that money should not be wasted in producing maps such as I have before me, unless shafting and cross-cutting are adopted to tost values at depth. We should find out as expeditiously as possible the extent of the iron resources, and then we should adopt a vigorotis policy by allowing the exportation of ore not required for our own purposes. Unless we utilize the methods which I have outlined, and get down to depth by shaft and cross-cut, the greater part of the present geophysical survey will be of little value. I have for years advocated the adoption of this course, but, .up to the present time, with no satisfactory Woolnough determines whether a shaft shall be sunk or a cross-cut made in the Northern Territory. The State geologists determine this policy in their respective. States. I appeal to the Minister to call for a report from Dr. Woolnough, now that he has changed his opinion and is utilizing both shafting and crosscutting, in order to compute the volume of the deposits at Yampi Sound.

Question so resolved in the affirmative. the House is "" That the words proposed to be inserted, as amended, be so inserted."" direct the attention of honourable members, to the paucity of reports received by the Government. The speedy manner in which reports were obtained rendered it impossible to determine the actual area of Australia's iron ore deposits. Moreover, those submitted in connection with Yampi Sound dealt only with the estimated quantity above high water level, but in a locality where there is a tidal rise and fall of 2S feet one can readily imagine that large quantities exist below high water mark. stated that reports have been received that boring has disclosed large cavities or voids which preclude the possibility of working the deposits below high water level. The extraction of 15,000,000 tons of ore for export from such a huge deposit would have had but a slight effect upon our iron ore reserves, but it would have enabled the deposits to be fully developed and made available for our future use. In the event of a national emergency the Government has power to impose an embargo on exports and thus reserve sufficient supplies for Australia's requirements. ment should expend money on geophysical and other surveys in order to demonstrate, as far as is possible, the actual extent of our iron ore resources.

[11.28J I can assure the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde) and the honourable member for Griffith( Mr Baker) that there is no truth whatsoever in the rumour that the national health and insurance scheme will not be proceeded with, or that its operation will be indefini tely postponed. -This morning a Sydney daily newspaper set out to misrepresent me and to As similar create in the minds of people in my electorate, and other supporters, the impression that a statement. I made recently connection with my parliamentary duties, I take this opportunity to give the facts to the House, and to name some of the people concerned in this matter. On Wednesday, the 14th September, 1938, the maritime unions connected with the port of Sydney, invited the secretary of the British Transport Workers Union, Mr Ernest Bevin, to a luncheon at Usher's Hotel, Sydney. Al l the mariI t is stated that even the time unions were represented and others present included Mr D. Clyne, M.L.A., representative for Darling Harbour, and I , as representing the ports. I was requested to propose the toast of the health of the visitor, which I did. I was supported by Mr Clyne, and Mr Bevin responded. At the conclusion of the luncheon, Mr Bevin, accompanied by the secretary of the Maritime Unions' Council. Mr J. Tudehope, visited me at the Federal Members' rooms on the eighth floor of the Commonwealth Bank Building, Martin-place, Sydney. A conversation took place.

However, Mr Bevin said that was duly ushered in to see Mr Bevin. he made some reference to two features After introducing himself, Sir Alfred appearing in the newspaper. He explained Davidson early indicated his mission. The to me that his reason for that was to 1 request he made to Mr Bevin was that "" try out"" Sir Alfred.

This test had Bevin had no knowledge of the Heffron an effect, according to Mr Bevin's advice Labour party, so he made some inquiries to me, in that two days later he noticed from Sir Alfred Davidson, who explained that corrections had been made in the that it was a party that had broken away features. That fact was sufficient for him from the official Labour party of New to know who was running the Labor South Wales and formed another organiDaily. zation. He added that the Heffron party was anxious to discuss its problems with Mr Bevin. Mr Bevin's answer was Davidson and Mr Bevin continued, and to the effect that he had no desire Sir Alfred Davidson again pressed Mr to meet any breakaway organization. Bevin to meet representatives of the Such a discussion would, in his opinion, Heffron Labour party. Mr Bevin was he in extremely bad taste, and conof the same mind as at the previous intertrary to the conduct which visiting labour representatives should observe. He further declared that if a representative of Labour in Australia went to London and engaged in consultations with breakaway movements iu England the action would be roundly condemned by the British Labour party. Therefore, he added: "" I am not going to consult with or meet people in Australia that I certainly would not expect an Australian Labour representative to meet in Great meet the breakaway organization. Sir Mr Bevin continued his conversation More than likely of the Macarthur Onslow family at CamMr Bevan duly arrived in Herald. He informed Mr Bevin that he The conversation between Sir Alfred view, but Sir Alfred Davidson continued to press his request.

Do you cluded the talk between Mr Bevin, Mr know, Bevin, that this Lang also selects Tudehope, aud myself. Mr Bevin returned to Lapstone.

They have of the Bank of New South Wales. attached themselves to the movement."" The conversation that took place at that dinner was told to me hy Mr Bevin in none of his business. While Sir Alfred Canberra on the 23rd September when he. Davidson's statements were all very inarrived here on his way to Melbourne, teresting, he, Mr Bevin, recognized the en route for England. At the dinner, Sir Alfred Davidson his province, as a visitor to Australia, to put several points to Mr Bevin. These interfere in the domestic affairs of the were as follows: "" We want to alter the Labour party of New South Wales. rules of the Labour party in New South Wales. We want to remove Mr Lang what his reactions were to the whole from the leadership of the party. We affair. Mr Bevin replied: "" It is all want the party and not the conference very strange to me to find a leading to elect the leader. Generally, a new banker so deeply interested in the Labour organization is required in New domestic affairs of the Labour party as South Wales "". In speaking of the rules to have such a close alliance^with men of .the party, Mr Bevin said he told Sir who claim to be militant Labour repreAlfred Davidson that he thought it was sentatives. I do not know all the details, a matter for the members of the party, but Sir Alfred Davidson's anxiety about as was the cas» elsewhere, and that if Lang was most pronounced He had Lang the members wished to alter the rules it firmly impressed in his mind, and, it was within their power to do so. Sir appeared to me, that he would do all in Alfred Davidson's answer was to the his power to remove him. It is a strange effect that the Heffron party, lacking the alliance. I know what I would think numbers, was unable to do that, so of such a position in England. It is another organization had been set up. Referring to the leadership, Sir Alfred larly requesting me to work for the sucDavidson said that the Heffron party cess of the Dominions Labour Conference claimed that Labour could not win with in New Zealand in 1940.

I point in New South Wales. Davidson said: ""You know, Bevin, it all that I have said. Mr Tudehope is different here from what it is in will substantiate my statement of what your country. What we want here In took place at the first interview with New South Wales is a ' properly-led' Mr Bevin. and corroboration of all of Opposition.

Lang has raised the Mr Bevin replied that he felt it was official movement, and it was not within Naturally, I inquired from Mr Bevin natural that I must think the same of it in Australia"". Ho concluded by particuI have made this definite statement Sir Alfred out that I have corroboration for this matter, and to make perfectly clear my determination to disclose, so far as 1 am able, what appears to be an unholy alliance between Sir Alfred Davidson and the Heffron party, and also to warn supporters of the Labour movement of what is actually going on. I wish also to reveal to them the manner in which a leading banker is dabbling, interfering and assisting financially, and otherwise, certain people, some of whom I have named, for the purpose of gaining complete control of political affairs in the State of New South Wales. I thank honourable members for their courtesy in allowing me to make this statement. Mr Bevin's statement that he had never previously come into contact with a Labour party with so many rich friends. orable member's interjection bears out largely the truth and candour of the conversations I have just described. feel sure that my statement will serve to clear the minds of not only people resident in my electorate, but also others who may be interested in this matter.

This embargo was modified in September oi tliat year, imports being permitted for roasting and manufacturing purposes. obtained until April, 1929, when action was taken under the Customs Act to prohibit further imports of peanuts, excepting tliat prior contracts entered into by importers were exempted from the embargo. As a result of a drought the Australian production of peanuts in 1932-33 represented only 14 per cent, of requirements, and the following year there was again a shortage due to many growers changing over to maize production on account of the high maize prices at that time. regard to the needs of consumers the Government removed the embargo in December, 1933. Since that time the Australian industry has heen adequately protected by duties under the general tariff of 4d. per lb. on unshclled peanuts and (id. per lib. on peanut kernels. The adequacy of the protection is demonstrated by the small quantities which are imported under these duties.

The money advanced to companies has been expended on geological Biirvey work and test drilling at Roma, Hutton Creek and Arcadia, Queensland; at Kulnura and Mulgoa, New South Wales; and at Lakes Entrance and Longford, Victoria. Four drilling plants have been purchased. One is at Hutton Creek, another at Kulnura, while a third has been made available for the joint Oovernment scout drilling campaign in Gippsland.
