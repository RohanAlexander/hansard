The question was one entirely of federationwhether the movement should be pushed on or whether it should be left in statu quo. I stood for the Glebe electorate, and I supported the right honourable gentleman at the head of the Government, because I recognised in him tbe one man upon whom the federal cloak of Sir Henry Parkes had fallen. The question of free-trade or protection was never raised. A protectionist association wrote to me to inform me that they intended-no t to nominate me, but-to give me their support on federal grounds. I wrote back acknowledging the offer, as I was bound in courtesy to do: taking care that I should not be associated in any way with the protectionist cause.

21,Mr Conroy,"Not a Tariff in which suchto-day in just the same light as that in which it appeared to me prior to federation. I recognised then, as I recognise now, that it will be necessary for us to have a Tariff perhaps somewhat higher than some of those which have hitherto been in operation in one of the States. I did not stand alone in that opinion. When we were opposing the Federal Enabling BillsandI say candidly that I opposed bothwe had on our side, in connection with the opposition to the first Bill, the leader of the Opposition, and the majority of honourable members who are supporting him. These honourable members pointed out that a higher Tariff would have to be imposed upon the imports into New South Wales, and their opinion was exactly the same as our own. Before, however, the second Bill was submitted to a referendum of the people of New South Wales, many of these honourable members altered their opinion and supported the second measure, although it did not differ in its financial aspects from that which was first submitted. I now tell these honourable gentlemen with all candour and all respect that, if I could believe that the State to which I belong had been placed in a bad position by joining the Federation, I should not take any responsibility myself, but should throw it upon those who upon one occasion pointed out the dangers that were to be apprehended, and on the second occasion lulled the fears of the people, and asked them to join the Federal Union. These are the men who must be blamed if blame is to be attached to any one. I do not go so far as to say that the State of New South Wales will suffer to the extent that some honourable members predict. I had other reasons for opposing the Federal Constitution, which I Bhall not disclose now. The position in which we stand to-day is that we have a Tariff before us which is intended to provide for the wants of the whole of the States of the Commonwealth. I am not altogether satisfied with it , but up to the present time, although I have listened anxiously, I have heard nothing proposed by the Opposition that could take its place. I ading newspapers in Tasmania on behalf of mit that during the late federal elections the free-trade party-as we knew them in New South Wales-acknowledge d that it would be necessary to impose customs taxation ; but they indicated that their taxation would differ in its incidence from that which they I view the position expected to be proposed by the Government. That is the position that they then assumed, but we have not had any form of taxation suggested by any one who has spoken on the Opposition side-in fact, we have heard nothing but declamation against the way in which the Tariff now before us would press upon the producing classes. The Daily Telegraph, a free-trade journal in New South Wales, has . proposed a Tariff which, in my opinion-ba d as this Tariff may be-woul d in some respects press more heavily upon the producing classes of the Commonwealth. If we take another organ which has supported their policy, a paper called Our Covmtry,we find that whilst they have declaimed against the duties on tea, coffee, chicory, and cocoa, their own proposal is to derive an average revenue from these articles of at least 4^-d. per lb. I am willing to join hands with the members of the Opposition if they will join with me in lightening the burdens upon the people; but at the same time. I recognise that a purely revenue Tariff of the old free-trade type would involve higher taxes upon the articles which cannot be produced within the Commonwealth than upon those which could be produced here, so as to insure revenue easily. To say that that form of taxation will press less heavily upon the people is to tell me something that I cannot -understand and cannot agree with. I cannot conceive how a purely revenue tax upon those things which cannot beproduced within the Commonwealth is going to lighten the taxation upon the poorer classes of the community. The members of the Opposition who have come from New 'South Wales have accepted 'the position that the Tariff must necessarily be protective in its incidence, and I should like to quote a passage from a manifesto that was issued by the right honourable member for Tasmania, Sir Edward Braddon. The right honourable gentleman put the position very clearly when he asked the people of Tasmania to join the federation. The statement. I am about to quote was not made during a public speech, but is taken from a carefully considered manifesto published in the two leadhimself as the Premier of that State. He pointed outWhat will Tasmania's position be ? She would be then a small fragment of that outside world against which the Commonwealth would set up its Customs barriers. The market of New -South Wales, now free to us, would be barred against",15,Smith The N I T Explains The Intention Of Honourable Members
22,Mr Watkins,"us by the Federal Tariff; and instead of tliat wider market which intercolonial free-trade would give for our fruit, jam, timber, oats, hay, straw, potatoes, woollen manufactures, &c., we should have a market even more restricted than that which now blights many of our industries. Whereas, New South Wales now imports large stocks of wheat, duty free, from India and San Francisco to replenish her stores, and so reduces her demand upon Australian granaries, she will under federation only receive that foreign wheat on payment of duty, and by so much the wheat exporting States will be protected. So will they be against New ZealandI f that was the position at that time it is equally the position to-day. A great deal has been said in the course of this debate iby way of comparison between the various States. I do not propose to follow the example of other honourable members in this direction, because I think that such comparisons are not only unreliable, but distinctly unfair. I have lived in Australia long enough-al l my life-to know that to compare the populations of the various States from time to time affords very little guide as to their relative prosperity. Rushes of population take place from State to State as gold-fields break out, and men follow them up in order to take advantage of any temporary improvement. That condition, I believe, has obtained in every State of the group. I refuse, therefore, to follow in the footsteps of some honourable members who have indulged in the practice of pitting one State against another. It is not to the advantage of federal union that we should set State against State at this particular juncture. Some honourable members who represent New South ""Wales have been called the enemies of that State because they have freely criticised its position under a free-trade policy. I have too much respect for New South Wales to compare such a large State with any of the small States of the union. All my life I have been associated with the industrial classes, .and I think I can fairly claim to view this question from their standpoint. To my mind the ulti-mate emancipation of the working classes does not depend upon the fiscal policy of Australia. A t the same time. I freely admit that the fiscal system which we adopt must exercise a potential influence upon their position, whilst we live under present conditions of trade and commerce. But that they can get absolute emancipation from the adoption of either one policy or the other I absolutely deny. It has ever been my endeavour to secure the best possible 19 M 2 conditions from the employers of labour for the working classes generally. In this connection I have assisted to pass many reforms which impose certain conditions upon the employers of New South Wales. How, therefore, can I consistently advocate the throwing open of our home market to the employer of sweated labour abroad? I have always been, from the workman's standpoint, a protectionist, and I should not be logical if I did not protect tlie producers of this country generally against the unfair competition of foreign countries. That is the position which I take up in regard to this Tariff. I recognize in it many items with which I cannot agree, and it will be my duty to assist, as far as I possibly can, in the reduction of those imposts which, I think, will press most heavily upon people who have to earn tlieir bread by the sweat of their brow. I believe that the Government will have to go short of the amount of revenue which they estimate is required for the needs of the various States, but we shall be acting wisely, if, instead of attempting to return to them the amount of Customs revenue which they have hitherto received, we permit them to make up their deficiency by other taxation. I think that they can perform that task better than can this Parliament. I have already said that the workman's emancipation does not depend upon the. adoption of either one fiscal policy or the other. I believe that he can be boiled by the importer just as readily as he can be roasted by the manufacturer. From time to time during this debate our attention has been drawn to the British worker, whose condition has been cited as one to which the workers of other countries might well aspire. It has been urged that fiscal freedom has practically emancipated the British workmen, and that they can win their strikes, when, according to to theleader of the Opposition, the workmen in protected countries never win a strike. All my life I have lived in a free-trade State. I have engaged in a good many industrial, troubles from time to time, but even there I have had to contend with the same difficulties as those which confront the workers in America, which has been held up as the country wherein times of industrial trouble the soldiers are called upon to preserve order. But I have met the soldiers in a free trade country. I have seen them with their cannons and small arm*. T have also beheld an army of police, which by the way, the workmen view with infinitely more distrust than they do a regimental coips. I merely emphasize this point to show that the same conditions prevail in free-trade countries as obtain in protectionist countries. reading of the progress of the workmen in other countries does not enable me to conceive of any civilized people who have descended to the depths of degradation which have been reached by the people in the midland counties of England. My reading has not been confined to the works of those who may have been biassed in their judgment. I have carefully studied the works of those who have investigated the position in England, and I defy any man to affirm that any condition could be worse than that which obtains in some of On the other hand, we are told that much the same condition of things prevails in America. I admit that perhaps in the manufacturing centres of America some of the evils which I mentioned do obtain. In this connection I wish to quote, not an American, but a representative of the British artisan, who made a thorough research into American conditions. I refer to MrH . J. Pettifer, the secretary of the Workmen's Association for the Defence of British Industry. The extract, which I wish to read, is as follows :Last night the executive committee of the paid in Paisley, Scotland.

I recollect that in the case of the quotations given by the honourable and learned member for In d i exactly the same doubts were expressed. Every authority is bogus and a sham, even if it be a free-trade authority, if it does not agree with the opinions of the honourable member. A t any rate, this man went to America as a free-trader, and gave a faitliful report of the condition of affairs. to America as a free-trader 1 the manufacturing centres there. before he went.

28,Mr Watkins,"He was a free-traderpresent industrial position of the old country. That motion was not proceeded with, because some of the delegates were afraid of the dislocation of trade temporarily, but all the delegates admitted that the Nottingham representatives were correct in their contention that something should be done, and advised that the motion should be introduced later on. In my opinion, as I stated before, the salvation of the working man does not altogether depend on the settlement of the fiscal system. In the discussion of tliat question we have to take a hand, but Ave have to be guided, not only by what is best for ourselves but by what is best for the whole of the producers of the different States which comprise the Commonwealth. We have no right at this juncture to advocate a Tariff which will suit one State alone-w e have no right to consider the interests of one industry and neglect others. I will go so far, by way of admission, as to say that we have no right to give consideration to the manufacturer and neglect those who engage in natural production. We must strive to study the interests of all alike, and endeavour to settle the Tariff on a basis satisfactory to all concerned. If I am asked to believe in a revenue Tariff, I say absolutely"" I do not."" I do not believe in obtaining much revenue through the Customhouse, because I am with those who advocate direct taxation, if direct taxation is practicable. Buti t would be a vital mistake for the .Federal Parliament to propose direct taxation at the present time, because, in my judgment, we could not deal out justice to the various States-w e could not tax them in a fair proportion per sapikt. A better way would be to dispense with, or reduce a number of the revenue duties, which in many cases are imposts on the raw materials of manufactures, and leave the States to make up their deficiencies by way of direct taxjition after we have left them with a shortage. As one who believes in, and has from time to time endeavoured to extend trades' unionism, I am not afraid of carrying the principle to its logical conclusion. I hope tlie final arrangement of this Tariff will be of such a nature as to give some inducement to production in the Commonwealth, as against the importation of goods manufactured by cheap labour elsewhere. I have never been able to see the difference between attempts to keep out the black man, and attempts to keep out goods made by the black man in other parts of the world; and, in advocating protection for the working man, I have always been prepared, as I am prepared now, to go to the logical conclusion. I am not with those who believe in a protective Tariff at the Customhouse, but who do not attempt to protect the working men within the Commonwealth. We ought to go in the direction of uplifting the people who work in our midst, but, on the other hand, in attempting to impose conditions on employers, I am prepared to go to the extent of saying that we ought to protect the latter from unfair competition which comes from abroad. If we are to provide a market for the producers of the Commonwealth, we must, at least, look after the home market. That is the view which I hope honourable members on both sides of the House will take in dealing with this Tariff. I hope they will see that it is their duty to fix, if possible, a Tariff which will suit the requirements of the people who inhabit tlie different States. low Tariff? Tariff might be particularly bad or good for the people of the country ; it all depends upon the manner in which the imposts are arranged. I have stated that I am in disagreement with the Government in the incidence in some respects of the proposed taxation. We were told by the honourable member for Parkes that we could have a low Tariff, but I did not hear him state that he was prepared to let the different States go short: which meant that while he would have a low Tariff, he would practically knock out the free-list altogether. Now, sir, I believe that the problem can be solved, and I am prepared to take a hand in_ solving it. I am prepared at least to fix a Tariff that will, as far as lies in our power, suit the different producing interests of the whole Commonwealth of Australia. BecauseI desire, as I think other honourable members desire, that tlie Tariff framed at this juncture, should be the settled policy of Australia for a considerable time to come. I have always thought, and think now, that what this countiy wants is a settled fiscal policy. It was the idea of those, who promulgated federation that such a result would follow ; and I hope that when this Tariff is determined it will be one that will bear equally",18,Smith The N I T Explains The Intention Of Honourable Members

30,Mr Watkins,"A low Tariff or a highupon all classes within the Commonwealth, and that it will remain the settled policy of the country. that has been expressed by the honourable member who has just resumed his seat is one which I think might be very well echoed by all sections of the House. That is, that whatever policy is finally determined upon in connection with the Tariff, that policy, for a considerable time at least, shall be the fixed policy of Australia. Nothing -can do more harm than a continuous tinker^ ing with Tariffs. Nothing can be more injurious than the upsetting of business by unnecessary legislative interferenceTherefore, I hope that both sides of the House will join with me, and with the honourable member for Newcastle, in that particular wish. One thing that has struck me more than any other, in connection with this debate, is the wonderful earnestness with which honourable members on both sides have addressed themselves to the subject matter of it. Whatever may be the verdict of history on the ultimate result, credit must at least be given to honourable members for the caref u l preparation of their utterances, for their member stated on the 7th MarchI quote earnestness in advancing, then arguments, and their industry in collecting their facts. Further; I believe that honourable members on both sides have been honest in trying to arrive at a proper conclusion. I am not one of those who would suggest that a man who is in opposition to my views takes up that stand because it suits his pocket or his politics. I prefer, to believe that he is guided by honest puqjoses; and is really endeavouring to do what he conceives to be right and proper. which must inevitably followfrom this debate is, tliat though some honourable members will have gonefrom this side of the House, others will have come over from the Opposition. Speaking as one of those who sit behind the Government, and support them, I am strongly of opinion that it will be a l l the better for the Government' that the debate has taken place; because I ' am inclined to think tliat the views of honourable members who sit together after the division will be much more in accord than they were prior to the division. Those whom we have lost from this side will find greater sympathy and support amongst those with whom they are about to sit, and those who come to us wulfmdhonorablemernbers behind the Government more in accord with their opinions. If no other result followed, that at least would be a good one. The honourable member for Flinders, who has announced that he will take his seat with the Opposition after this debate isconcluded, has told us that he leaves the Government party because he is-a^moderate protectionist. He has assured the House that he has had numerous letters from persons throughout his constituency, congratulating him upon the step he has taken. I have no doubt that it is true. I fancy that if I were to make up my mind to go overto the opposition side at the conclusion of this debate, I should receive quite a number of letters from persons who would be delighted to find that I had changed my views. But I am afraid that those letters would not befrom people who voted for me at tire last election,, and I very much doubt whether the letters received by the honourable member for Flinderswere written by electors who voted for him. I should like to direct attention to the state of affairs existing in the electorate of Flindersat the time the honourable member was seeking election. It appears from the press that the honourable from the newspaper which favours his side, the Argus-that he made tlie following, statement :--I belong to a third party, who want moderate protection of from 20 to 22 per cent, to protect those industries that are worth protecting. Henow says that he has to leave the Government because their: Tariff is one above 15 per cent.! I also find this honourable member classed by the Argus as a low Tariff candidate. He was opposed by One other result two who were set down as high Tariff candidates. Those two gentlemen polled 3,28:8 between them, whilst the honourable member who was elected. i>olled 2,154 votes. So that; at all events, he represents merely a minority in that constituency. Probably those-who are now congratulating him on going, over to the opposite side belong, to the minority. However; I am not here to criticise, at very great length, at any rate, the actions of individual members. We all hope, I am sure, that those who have changed sides will find more congenial company. One of the remarkable things connected with the arguments of the free-traders' -or , as I suppose we ought now to call them, the revenue Tariffists is the wonderful amount of logic they bring to",19,Smith The N I T Explains The Intention Of Honourable Members
31,Mr Hume Cook (Bourke),"The wishbear on the subject. It is almost impossible, from a logical point of view, to upset the free-trader. there are quite a number of things that can be set out logically as quite practical, but which in actual experience will not exactly "" pan out,"" to use an Americanism. Those who have read the writings of Oliver Wendell Holmes will recollect the story of"" the deacon who built "" the wonderful one-hoss shay."" They will remember how beautifully every part was related to every other part, its constructor claiming that when, in the course of time, it became worked out, it must inevitably burst like a bubble. The story tells us that that is just what happened. knowstliat no such thing could have occurred. It is very much the same with the arguments of the free-traders. Though, from a logical point of view, they are beautifully constructed, they will not, in the light of ordinary work-a-day experience, bear the scrutiny which logically they seem to be able, and ought to be able, to bear. That has been the case with many arguments used in the course of this debate, and I need not therefore further refer to them. Before proceeding with my arguments I should like to say that I think sufficient credit has scarcely been given to the Ministry, and more particularly to the Treasurer and the Minister for Trade and Customs, for the immense work they have done in preparing this Tariff. When one takes into the really remarkable that so few faults, taking them in detail, have been found in it. For my own part, I am surprised that two or three men should have been able to construct a Tariff in which a critical assemblage such as this has discovered so few flaws. Personally, T desire to congratulate the Government upon the very successful way in which they have framed, the TariffiI t is true that in many respects alterations will have to be made. The Treasurer has admitted in one of his speeches that the Ministry, unlike Lord Bacon, do not assume ""all knowledge to be their province,"" and they are prepared to make alterations where tlie weight of evidence-will justify alterations. successful had they been in their operaFor my own part I think that, contrasting their work with that of the Opposition, the responsible Ministers are deserving of more praise than I can find words to express. I have not counted them, but I should say that at least 40 speeches have been delivered on this-motion. W it h the exception But I am reminded that of one solitary member of the Opposition, however, no one on tliat side of the House has yet attempted to put forward a policy, to frame a Tariff, or even to suggest an outline of one to take the place of that proposed by the Government. As shown by the Treasurer, the one scheme put forward from the opposite side of the House will not stand the test of criticism. One would imagine that, if there is so much brains, skill, and-ability on the otherside, honourable members of the Opposition would have given usat least something constructive. The reverse, however, is the Yet every one case. Tliey have given us nothing. It is true that we have had tirades of abuse against protection, and it would appear that Victoria isa veritable anailiema maranatha to honourable members on the other side. We poor Victorians have a number of industries that we are told in one breath are so weak and an<Bmic that thpy are tottering to the ground, while in the next breath it is said that the proprietors are making enormous fortunes, and that they are so rich that they are plutocrats. Howi t is possible to make these statements agree I fail to understand. ber does not expect free-traders to want them to agree 1 not expect them to be very careful after consideration the exposure which some of their leaders magnitude of the work, it is suffered last night at the hands of the Minister for Home Affairs. One of their chief objections to the protectionist policy is that it leads to the formation of rings and trusts, and other unholy business combinations. They would lead us to believe that that is a state of affairs peculiar to a protectionist country. It happens, however, that this is not the case. It was brought under my notice recently that a very substantial ring had been formed in Great Britain -with the object of controlling the wall-paper trade of the world. For years English manufacturers had had practically the entire control of the world's marketsfor wall papers, and so tions that they determined to form a conn bination or ring and in that way secure 1 better prices. According to the information I have received the ring was formed something less than three years ago, but -with a very",20,Smith The N I T Explains The Intention Of Honourable Members

33,Mr Hume Cook,"I suppose I shouldstartling result to the English manufacturers. The Germans had been endeavouring for some time to get the colonial markets for wall-papers, with paper somewhat smaller i u the average size than that of English manufacture. But when they found that the British ring had put up prices in the way I have described they altered the whole of their machinery, and they are now ready to supply orders for wall-papers of English pattern and size for the Australasian market. will do a large business here. A friend of mine has found himself forced to give an order to a German firm, notwithstanding that he is one of the sturdiest of Britishers. He was led to do so, because the English ring have entered into an arrangement whereby they will supply only five houses in Victoria, and unless my friend buys from one of these he cannot obtain the English wall-papers. These houses demand middlemen's profits, which he does not feel inclined to pay, and thus, in spite of his British predilections, he has been compelled to place a very large order for wall-papers with a German firm. foolish it is to attempt to form a ring in a intend to give the primary producer. But free-trade country. honourable member's logic. object in mentioning this fact is to prove that so far from rings being peculiar to protectionist countries-of course I do not deny that they exist in protectionist countries-the y are peculiar to all countries where it is possible to make a profit in that way. The moral of my story is that the action of the British manufacturers served only to give another opportunity to the Germans, who are up-to-date in business methods, and who, as I shall prove presently, are monopolising practically the whole of the British colonial trade. BeforeI do so may I repeat what has been said in effect already, that, although we on this side of the House cannot complain of the action of the Opposition in bringing down a want of confidence motion, if they honestly believe that tlie Tariff is wrong, and in enwrong, when that wrong, if it is such, is deavouring to substitute a Tariff of their own. I think we have some right to complain of the tactics they adopt in endeavouring to secure that end. If they were to declaim against recognised protectionist duties; one would luive something to answer, and no cause fuv complaint would exist. But when they make use of the inclusion in the Tariff of revenue duties-whic h they themselves have advocated-as the chief ground of complaint against a protective Tariff, surely we have a right to doubt the honesty of their attack, and to protest against their tactics. If honourable members examine the tirades of abuse which have been levelled against the Ministryi n the House, and the speeches which have been made outside in opposition to the I have no doubt that they Government Tariff proposals-if they note the utterances of the leaders on the opposite side-the y will see that the duties which are said to be shockingly unholy, and which are condemned by the Opposition, in order to capture public approval, are not the protectionist duties brought down by the Ministry, but revenue duties. the revenue duties to be high. the revenue duties are the lowest in the Tariff. We hear a great deal about the free breakfast table, which the Opposition are going to obtain; about the easing of the burdens of the poor, and the assistance they the articles of which they speak as being so unjustlytaxed, are tlie very goods which they My only themselves would be compelled to tax if they were true to their own particular principles. Therefore, I say we have a right to complain both of their honesty of attack and of their tactics generally. The revenue duties have been forced upon the Government by reason of the obligations imposed by the Constitution. The Ministry have to carry out the obligation which that Constitution throws upon them, and in spite of their own predilections, in spite of tlieir own fiscal leanings, it has been found absolutely necessary to include in the Tariff a certain number of revenue duties or taxes which will bring in money, and which are not supposed to assist, and cannot assist, any particular industry. It is hardly fair to blame the Government as though they were doing something forced upon tliem. I have ""said that many of the remarks hitherto made have been'. -*?tirades of abuse against Victoria and against protection.

It is a free-trade newspaper, but it reprints an sirticle from the London Daily Mail, under the heading, "" American Invadersi n England-What is their Secret 1"" The article is as follows :We have lost or are losing some trades directty through bad legislation. The tobacco, printing, and electric industries are instances of this. Once Ireland had flourishing tobacco plantations. These were purposely killed in order that the tobacco industry in our then American colonies might be fostered. Our erstwhile colonies are now a rival nation, but the revenue restrictions still make tobacco growing here practically impossible. There is no reason, climatic or other, why Ireland to-day should not produce great tobacco crops. A short Act of Parliament fostering the home growth of tobacco by a simplification of the collection of duty, and a rebate or even temporary remission of taxes on tobacco grown within the Kingdom, would create a new industiy in Ireland at a bound. Some of us would, as a matter of taste, prefer the leaf of the nicotine grown in Kilkenny to Schleswig-Holstein cabbages doctored and browned in Hamburg. That is a very strong statement, and it shows that even in Great Britain, despite what has been said by the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr ever may be said as to the aggregate number Glynn, there are persons who advocate a protectionist policy. By the way, tliat honourable and learned member, in order to confute something which was said by the honourable and learned member for Indi, quoted from Professor Davidson as follows:It is idle, and worse than idle, for it raises false divides them under three heads, ""domestic,"" hopes, to point to the weakening of free-trade sentiment in the United Kingdom. The honourable and learned member should have read on a sentence or two, and he would have found these remarks exactly following what he read :It is within the limits of human possibility that in some constituencies a majority could be found for protection against goods made in Germany and elsewhere; and in other places a candidate who declared in favour of a re-enactment of the Corn Laws might be victorious. But these two wings of a possible protectionist party cherish contradictory ideals, and would fall out as soon as they came to practical legislation. might finish the paragraph while he is about it. of"" finishing the paragraph lay rather with the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn. My point is that he read one sentence only from the paragraph which suited his argument, and that the balance of the paragraph' which I have read goes to prove that there are protectionists in the mother country divided into two wings, and that if these two protectionist wings could only be united they would be a very substantial factor in the politics of the old country to-day. It is simply because they happen to be in different camps, and because of the impossibility of uniting them, that the protectionist cause does not make greater progress in Great Britain. tionists were touching the colonial trade, and that they were prepared to retaliate. member's interjection goes to prove that he knew all about the case, and did not give the House the benefit of his knowledge. Arguments have been adduced in reference to the relative positions of the factories of New South Wales and Victoria, and figures relating, to these factories have been given over and over again, until I think honourable members are tired of them; but there is one aspect of the question which has not been touched upon in my hearing. Whatemployed in the factories of the two States, and I do not now propose to discuss that phrase of the question-somethin g must be said as to the divisions of that aggregate. If honourable members take Mr Coghlan's grouping of the industries of Australia-h e ""natural,"" and ""competitive,""-the y will find that the number of hands employed in Victoriai n competitive industries is 41,175, and the number employed in New South Wales competitive industries is 25,887, a difference of 15,000-no t a difference of"" only a thousand or two, as some honourable members will have us believe. It must be borne in mind, too, that Victoria has a smaller population than New South Wales, and has been working under conditions which in many respects have not been at all favorable. The fact is, that protection is responsible for the larger number of hands employed in Victoria, and we are proud of it .

It would appear, notwithstanding, the selfrsatisfied manner of those who have spoken on behalf of New South Wales in thisdebate, that that State is not so marvellously prosperous as they would have us to believe. I find from, the annual report of the New South Wales Government -Labour Bureau for the .year ending 2.0th June, 1900, tliat, since the date of the founding of the bureau-betwee n 1892 and 1893-ther e have been registered no fewer than 81,889 unemployed persons, while work has been found for 96,044 persons. The figures seem contradictory, but the answer is that in some cases employment has been found for men more than once. These figures show that a very large number of adult males-person s who ought to be bread winners-hav e been out of employment in New South Wales during the last few years. The report saysNotwithstanding the many we have sent to ber seems not to be aware that 81,889 rework, and the large number of young, men we presents the number of. times for which have sent to the wars in South Africa and China, application made for work, not the number there does not appear to be any appreciable difof persons who made the application. ference in the number of unemployed. I naturally expected that the official who made that statement would endeavour to suggest a remedy for the evil of which he complains, and I was not disappointed. What is the remedy that he suggests for this tremendous evil, an evil which the leader of the Opposition said, when he launched a successful want of confidence motion some years ago, he would cure in 24 hours? Notwithstanding that statement, over 81,000 unemployed persons have been registered in tire State, and the official at the head of the bureau reports that there is no appreciable diminution of the number. The remedy he suggest was thisWhat is wanted most in these colonies is the rji-omotion and establishment of large manufacturing, industries, where the youth of Australia could be trained, in all the art and science of manufacture. Thousands of youths annually leave our public schools and entering the path of manhood, and seeking some calling whereat to make a living, have at -present little open to them except i he professions, which are not within the reach of thousands, orclerical labour, which is already overdone. Manual labour is open only to the physically strong, aud in this the supplyfarexceeds the demand. If we had large manufacturing industries, our-young meu could be trained and employed, and I have no doubt thousands of them would make their mark in the multiplicity of avenues these industries would open up. The Australian native is notwanting in brain power or ambition. This has already been shown by the superiority he has established in not only the science of sport and athletics, in courage and endurance, but. also in learning and culture. And if in these, why not in the arts of manufacture. It is to be hoped that the policy uudei federation will bring into existence a large field for the employment, opportunity, development, and expansion of the best talents of our brightest native Australians. of the New South Wales Labour Bureau was a protectionist Member of Parliament, who lost his seat, and was then given his present position. to the Protectionist Association. appointed to that position to silence him ; but he has not been silenced, and he speaks the truth. protectionist Government which he had supported. been registered twenty times. there were no unemployed in New South Walesj that, in free-trade they had a panacea for all ills, and that if the whole Commonwealth were underfree-trade employment would be found even for the unemployed in hitherto protected States; though how, I do not know, because I am unable to understand how more employment can be found where half the work is done outside the country than where the whole of it is done within the country. A favourite answer to the statement that more hands are employed in factories in Victoria than iu New South Wales is, that if it is true, these hands are mostly women, and no credit should be given to the policy which finds them employment. There are two answers to that rejoinder. The first is. that, as compared with New South Wales, Victoria has industries which must employ women. The shirt-making industry in New South Wales employs scarcely any one; but in Victoriai t is a very large and flourishing industry. The other answer is that the tendency all the world over is to employ women in i factories. It is an unfortunate tendency",24,Smith The N I T Explains The Intention Of Honourable Members

The first one reads as follows:The Board of Trade returns of the United Kingdom *'under free-trade,"" for the month of February, 1901, as compared with the same month of 1900, shows that the value of the exports decreased £2,182,394. The other cablegram reads thusThe trade statistics of the United States for the past three years have been most remarkable, and those for 1900 were the most remarkable of the series, as an excess of exports was then recorded of £132,395,743.

85,Mr Hume Cook,"It may be saidCommonwealth developed under that policy which seems to me to offer the only rational way of developing them. I hold the home market to be the best and most profitable market. Industries have been developed under protection that could never have been developed otherwise. By this system we can attract capital and population to a greater extent than we can do by sending out for one-half of what we require to other countries. If Australia needs one thing more than another it is population. We desire to lighten our burdens, to add to the volume of our trade, and to develop our great natural resources. We can best do these things by means of a large population, and population will flow to us when we offer it sufficient inducement. The greatest export of Britain to-day is the export of human beings. We want some of that export to come here. courage it to come here is to open up avenues of employment by developing our natural resources. Apropos of this matter, what does Mr J. S. Larke say in a lecture delivered before the New South Wales Chamber of Manufactures in February of this year 1 He saysIron is the secret and source of manufacturing success. There was a time when all the iron Canada used came from Great Britain. It is not so now. Some ten years ago the Iron and Steel Institute visitedfcheUnited States^ and many of its members came i nto Canada. The secretary-reputed one offchecleverest statisticians of England, be fixed for seven or ten years-as the a high authority in the iron trade-made a speech in Ottawa, in which he was reported to have said -"" Canada professes great friendship for England, and great loyalty to the Empire, bufc shehus put on heavy duties on the importation of English iron, and that is not in keeping with her professions."" On reading-that speech, the next morning I said to some members of the Institute whom I met:-""Has that secretary of yours gone through the United States with his eyes shut ? Anybody but a fool must see that to-day it is not a question whether we shall get our iron from England or not, but whether we shall take it from the United States or make it ourselves, and Canada has decided to make it herself."" As I have stated, practically all the iron and iron prostatus. ducts imported into Canada, came from Great Britain. Fifteen years ago, of the imports of pig iron, 70 per cent, were still from Great Britain, and 30 from fche United States. Ten years after, and the proportions were 16 per cent, from Great Britain and 84 from the United States. Railway supplies in 1884 from Great Britain 80 per cent., from the United States 10 per cent. ; in 1889 it had become 6£ per cent, from Great Britain, and 934 per cent, from the United States. Take castings and forgings ; once it all came from Great Britain; last year there was only 2^ per cent, from Great Britain, but we received 97^ per cent, from the United States. Great Mr Hume Cook. Britain is no longer the iron king, and the supremacy of British engineering establishments and ship-yards is threatened. That is from the report of a lecture delivered by Mr J. S. Larke before the Chamber of Manufactures, Sydney, on the 27th Februaryi n tlie present"" year. He says that iron is the secret and source of manufacturing supremacy. Have we any iron in Australia, and shall we develop the industry 1 Do not the Ministry propose, by a system of bounties, and by other means, to put the secret and source of manufacturing supremacy on a fair footing in Australia ? Do the Ministry not propose to develop those very industries which are to contribute so largely, I trust, to the manufacturing supremacy in the southern seas of the Commonwealth of Australia 1 I believe that under protection in Australia, we can The way to endo what has already been done, according to Mr Larke, in Canada and the United States; we can produce our own iron, and gain some of the secret and source of manufacturing supremacy. I believe, further, that it is our duty to afford encouragement, not only in respect to iron, but in respect to every other portion of our great natural inheritance. Believing that can be done by the means I have indicated, I stand here more confirmed than ever in my'protectionist convictions. I am satisfied personallyI was never more so-that if this Tariff honourable member for West Sydney desires,, we shall find very great impetus indeed given to every kind of industry in Australia; and that, so far from one particular State monopolizing industries, each State will develop its own particular and peculiar resources with advantage to all the others. Our home market will have been secured to us; our added population will have come to find employment in industries, and will found homes here, thus adding to our numerical strength and to our commercial This is the true path to that nationhood, to which we have all been looking forward, but which we have as yet only on paper. Australia, to reach and to enjoy her manifest destiny must develop her own resources, must' find employment for her own people, and let tlie rest of the world look after its own concerns. Our duty is to ourselves, and we can do far better by employing the whole of our own people, and by importing nothing, than by employing one-half of our people, and giving the rest of our employment to the outside world. -offer a personal explanation in regard to the state that Mr Hume Cook did not proclaim himinterjection I made on the question whether self -or not the honourable member for Bourke others who were mainly instrumental in securing was a free-trader. -can make an explanation if it refers to his authority on which the honourable member -own speech, but not if it merely refers to an makes assertions against an honourable meminterjection. has arisen out of my speech, which was able and learned member wait one moment. in reply to statements made, in the The letter proceedsfirst instance, by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports.

97,Mr Thoma S (Barrier),"I m o v ebeen said by protectionists against revenue tariffists, and on the other hand I agree with all that has been said by revenue tariftists against raising money by protective duties. In order that I may show my impartiality, I intend in committee to vote for every reduction, from whichever side that reduction may be proposed. If the revenue tariffists propose a reduction of a protective duty, I shall, I hope, be found voting for it , and vice versa,; in short, whatever reductions are proposed in committee, I shall be found voting for them. To me the discussion .seems for some considerable time to have been conducted on the assumption that there is no way of raising money for Commonwealth purposes except through the Custom-house. So widely does that opinion prevail, that I believe there is a large number of people who think that our Constitution does no provide any other means of raising revenue I have met people holding that view. I was told the other day by a person on the press that he had had to show people of his acquaintance a copy of the Constitution in order to prove to them that it was possible to raise money in some other way. I could well understand a discussion similar to that which we have had, taking place in the Congress of the United States, where, I understand, the Government must raise their federal revenue from customs and excise. That is the only source of revenue open to them. The Attorney-General shakes his head. Of course, I am prepared give way to his opinion, but still, I remember reading some time ago that the Government of the United States had instituted an income tax, and that on appeal to the Supreme Courti t was disallowed on the ground, I understood, that the Government had no right to levy such an impost. tionate to the population. ment can impose direct taxation, but subject to certain limitations that do not exist under our Constitution. moment differ from the Attorney-General on that point. The fact remains that under our Constitution we have the right to impose taxation in any way we think f it. ThoughI was one of those who opposed the Constitution B ill for various reasons, I said that I was glad that it contained this provision. I think the Billwasrightingranting that power to the Parliament, and in givingtlie people of Australia absolute control over the mode in which revenue should be raised. So that I do not object to the proposals, of the Government so much because they areof a protectionist character, or because they are of a revenue producing character, asbecause they do ""not provide . for any direct taxation. It will not be necessary for me to point out at any great length the distinguishing features of direct and indirect taxation. The principal reason why I am in favour of direct taxation is that there is practically no leakage of revenue from it.. In connection with indirect taxation there is not only the cost of collecting the revenuethrough Custom-houses, and the rest of! the necessary machinery, but there is also the profit that is made out of the duty that is levied. I suppose t h at every honourable member will agreethat that criticism applies to such, portions of the Tariff proposals as are merely revenue producing. Even those who claim to be revenue tariffists will admit that notonly have the people of the countiy to pay the amount of money that the Governmentrequires, but also a certain amount of profiton the extra money that is laid out by the merchant in consequence of the duties.. AVe are all agreed in that as far as concerns the revenue producing portion of the Tariff. The revenue tariffists have to to admit what I have stated, and of course the protectionists admit it also. There are, however, some protectionists who argue that the same objection does not apply to protectiveduties-that we do not in all cases owing to the operation of internal competition pay all the duty that is levied. But even the protectionists have to admit that in the case of duties which are not affected by internal competition-that is to say, in those industries in which it may be, perhaps, twoor three years before manufacturing can besufficiently developed to cause internal competition-the price of commodities is increased by a protective duty. That beingso, I take it that the protectionist is prepared to admit that not only have we toI would not for a pay the import duty, but also the added interest on that import duty. So that if we have to raise £9,000,000 through theCustoms, it will be putting it extremely low to say tliat the people of this country have to pay not only the £9,000,000, but alao a t",31,Smith The N I T Explains The Intention Of Honourable Members

Some time ago, in New South Wales, before the Dibbs Tariff was removed, there was a duty of 2d. per lb. on jam. In BrokenH ill we were getting jams of excellent quality-the Glen 13win and the Glen Osmond brands. storekeeper at BrokenH ill told me that these jams were at that time being sold foils. 3d. per 2-lb. tin. He said-""As soon as the duty of 4d. per 2-lb. t in is removed, we shall sell these jams for lOd. per tin. That is, we now charge the 4d. duty, and the extra I d . for laying out the i d . "" That was 25 per cent, which the people had to pay on those jams. I am aware that if the Government requires money it must be raised through taxation in some way. I do not so much object to the 4d., in the case of going to the Government, but I do object to the people having to pay an extra penny, simply because some one else is' collecting that 4d. for the Government. By the time tlie wholesfile man has paid the duty and has sent the goods to the retailer, who has to make his profit, it is an exceedingly low estimate to say that the people of this country will have to pay £1,000,000 in addition to the £9,000,000 being raised through the Custom-house. But in the case of direct taxation there is no profit made by any one. The whole duty collected goes straight into the coffers of the State. Then again, I venture to say that there will be no disputing tlie fact that direct taxation is certainly more just as a means of raising revenue than taxes imposed through the Customs, whether those duties be of a revenue producing or of a protective character. Who is it that is called upon to bear the overwhelming proportion of customs duties ? If we put that question to ourselves we shall come to the conclusion speedily that they must necessarily be borne by the masses, and not by the classes. I do not suppose, for example, that as a rule a rich man drinks a great deal more than does an artisan in the course of twelvemonths. Of1 course, if he drinks champagne he pays 19 N 2 more duty than the worker. But there are some rich men who are teetotallers, so that, as a matter of fact, such a man would pay less actually than the artisan who, while extremely temperate, was not a teetotaller. If we take 100 rich men and 100 artisans, cent. has to be paid before the probability is that we shall find that in goods come to the consumer. the course of twelve months tlie latter pay as much as the rich men in the way of duties on stimulants and narcotics. Take the wife of the rich man and the wife of the artisan. The wife of the one probably would not drink any more than the wife of A the other; but, when we come to the consumption of rice, we find that the artisan and the worker generally consume far more than the rich man. The artisan has a better appetite than the rich man, and, consequently, by means of tlie duties on such articles he is called upon to pay more of tlie taxation of the country. Customs duties must necessarily come out of the stomachs and from the backs of the workers ; and, although tlie rich people may use a little better furniture and wear superior clothing, in no these 2 lb. tins of jam, way is the taxation which they are called upon to bear commensurate with their banking accounts. We are all agreed that under a mere revenue-producing Tariff the people pay more than the duty. They have to pay the profit which is made by the imposition of the duty. Let us assume for a moment that so far as a protective duty is concerned, the consumer, in some cases, pays only the duty itself. We will concede for the sake of argument, that as the result of such a duty a local industry is established, internal competition takes place, and prices are brought down. If an article can be produced locally, however, and sold at a price below that for which it could be imported, where is the necessity for the imposition of a duty 1 The fact that a duty remains upon an article should in itself be sufficient proof that there is some need for it . On some articles, however, the people must necessarily pay the'whole duty, otherwise the Government proposals would bring in no revenue. Not only have they to pay the duty, but, as I have said, they have to bear the added amount of profit. If we assume, for the sake of argument, that the whole of tlie protective duties balance-that is to say that the people have to pay the duties and nothing more-w e have still to consider what is the .effect of a protected industry upon the",32,Smith The N I T Explains The Intention Of Honourable Members

102,Mr Thomas,"The honourable memberprimary industries of the Commonwealth. When I speak of primary industries, I refer to agriculture and mining, which are, in my opinion, the two great primary industries of Australia. I use the word agriculture in its widest and fullest sense. cludes in it the pastoral industry ? deal with the effect of a land values tax on agriculture ? point presently. If we killed our two great primary industries then within a few weeks this continent would be handed over to the undisputed possession of the aboriginals. I do not know whether the honourable and learned member for Werriwa is present, but during the course of the debate he made an interjection in regard to the champagne provided by the manufacturers of Melbourne on the occasion of visits paid to their estaband if there is no other way of finding emlishments by Members of Parliament. I am sorry tliat such an interjection should have been made. I was one of those who accepted the invitation of the manufacturers of Melbourne to view their places of business. myself, and I was very pleased with a great deal of what I saw. a matter of fact, however, I did not drink any champagne, because I am a total abstainer. If I had not been a teetotaller I should have partaken of it with the rest. Passing from that matter, I want to point out tliat there are some protected industries which would have no effect upon the primary industries of the Commonwealth. Take the shirt,' boot, and umbrella making trades, for example. The manufacture of umbrellas is a very big business here, and the manufacture of boots is another large trade. If , under a protectionist Tariff, we had to pay more for a shirt than we would pay for it under a free trade policy, that fact would affect only the buyer, because, so far as I know, a shirt is made to be worn and does not enter into any other province as raw material. There are some manufactured articles, however, which come within the category of raw materials, and are used as such in other industries. Bar-iron might be cited as an example. The honourable member for New England made a speech on the motion before the Chair, which, I am sure, we were all pleased to hear, but he concluded with the remarkable statement that, while he was in favour of allowing the raw article to come hi free, he would support the protection of the manufactured article. As a representative of no small mining constituency, I do not care very much about the manufactured article, provided that the Government allow the raw material to come in free. But what is the W ill the honourable memraw material of the miner in BrokenH ill { It is the engine and the machine, and not the bar-iron. I shall come to that MrV . L . SOLOMON -And timber. vernment will allow the raw material, which I have just named, to come in free they will place the mining industry in the same position as the engineer in the metropolis, who is asking that his raw material shall also come in free. Shirts, umbrellas, and boots cannot be regarded as raw materials that interfere with any primary industry, ployment for a large number of people than by supporting the local manufacture of these articles, I am prepared to say that it is better to do that than allow them to walk the streets. But let us call these I desired to see them for industries by their proper names. If they are started simply as relief works, let us As call them relief works, and pay for them as such, but do not let us call them manufactures. W h y should the man who wears a shirt or a pair of boots, or uses an umbrella, alone be called upon to pay in order to keep the people employed in these factories in work 1 Why should not the people as a whole be called upon to bear the burden of these relief works 1 I regard eveiy industry that has to be supported by revenue which comes from the primary industries of the Commonwealth as a relief work, and I would be quite prepared to support anything of tlie kind under that name. The raw materials which are very important to the mining community are the machines, engines, dynamite, and other articles used in the development of a mine. I trust that honourable members will pardon me if, for a moment or two, I refer to my own constituency, because not only is BrokenH ill important in itself, but on its welfare depends to a large extent the welfare of South Australia.

Jt is to-day one of the leading places in South Australia; but shut down the mines of BrokenH ill to-day and to-morrow Port Pirie would practically cease to be. I have not brought tlie figures up to date, but I know that three or four years ago the exports and imports of BrokenH ill were more than those of Tasmania. The 36 miles of privately owned tramway at BrokenH ill , the Silverton tramway, has a bigger revenue than have the whole of the railways of Tasmania. show that it is an important thing to keep that place going, not merely for its present inhabitants, but also for the great State of South Australia.

AlthoughI have not a single share in the mines myself, I personally should like to see them pay more, because I know that if mines are paying dividends, it is better for the community in their neighbourhood. There is only one mine that I know to be paying, and it has paid only a shilling dividend in six months. I know that some of the mines are in a very precarious position. The profit and loss accounts are balancing, and in the case of some of the mines I am afraid the balance is leaning to the side of loss, and if we add this extra £30,000 a year to the expenses, I am afraid it will have a serious effect upon them. I have had some official statements supplied me by the secretaries of mining companies at BrokenH ill , and I find that the Proprietary mine alone 'will have to pay £21,000 a year under this Tariff, and what for? What benefit are they to get from this extra taxation? The Central £6,700 a year under the present Tariff. Block 10 will pay £1,725 ; Block 14 will pay £2,500. for the South mine and other mines.. I should have written for them, but omitted to do so. However, over £30,000 will have to be paid by all these mines. I do not say that the extra £30,000 will do it, and, of course, I hope it will not, but if it was to have the effect of shutting down some of the mines, I venture to say it would be the means directly and indirectly of throwing more men out of employment than all these protective duties will find work for throughout the Commonwealth. Now we find that the Government are going to tax the timber that goes into the mines, and I hope tliat when we are in committee they will see their way clear to yield upon that point. They have proposed a terrifically high duty, as much as 50 per cent, on the value of the timber I see tliat the Minister for Trade and Customs shakes his head, but four days ago the price of timber at PugetI quote this to Sound was 3s. per 100 feet, and the Government are charging a duty of Is. 6d. upon that. By the time the timber is brought to Port Pirie, and freight has had to be paid upon it, I admit that the duty will not amount to 50 per cent, of the value, but it amounts to 50 per cent, on tlie value of the timber at Puget Sound. 10, 12£, and 17 per cent. gentleman will look at the Tariff schedule he will find that the duty upon this big timber is Is. 6d. per 100 feet, and the price of that timber at Puget Sound is 3s. per 100 feet. I asked for these figures from the secretary of the Proprietary Company and he gave them to me when I saw him a few days ago. He says that the price paid is 3s. pei 100 feet at Puget Sound and this 1 Tariff proposes a duty of Is. 6d. on that. I admit that when it comes to Port Pirie, and freight is paid on it to BrokenH ill , the price is increased, but on the price of the timber at Puget Sound the duty proposed is 50 per cent, of the value of the tiinber. This timber alone pays £28,000 a year to the South Australian railways, and the Minister for Trade and Customs should be very caref u l before he does anything that is likely to interfere with the railway returns of South mine will pay Australia because they will want all the money they can get there. WhilstI should be glad to see every man in work I have not the figures and getting something for his workthere is not much in working unless one is paid for it, one might just as well be idlewhilst I should like to see every one in work, it would be a pity if in trying to find work for five Or six men we should do an injury to a great industiy like this.

109,Mr Thomas,"If the right honorablemine at BrokenH ill , and saw a new machine which had just been brought out for the purpose of treating some of the ore there. It had cost the company £10,000, and had been sent from Germany because it could not be produced here. I do not say that it was altogether an experiment, because I have no -doubt the general manager of the company went into the matter considerably before he was prepared to launch out to the extent of £10,000. A t the same time it must necessarily to some extent be an experiment, because many of these patents work all right in the laboratory, but immediately they are brought out into the open air and daylight they do not altogether pan out as expected. A great deal of the future success and development of the"" mine depends upon this machinery. It was imported a little while ago, but had it not been imported until a few days since it would have had to pay a duty of 25 per cent., or £2,500, which would make the cost of the machine to the company £12,500 instead of £10,000. I am prepared to say that I would just as soon think of putting a galvanized-iron roof over Australia to keep the sun out, in order to develop a local industiy in artificial light, as I would keep out the inventions of men of genius, which might perhaps be tlie means of finding work for a large number of people. I say tliat, in connection with the experiment going on at this mine, if it can only be proved that by the employmentof this machinery they will be able to make a profit of a single ounce of silver per ton, the outcome of it will be that at least 2,000 men will have work found for them directly or indirectly by its operations. It will take a long time before tlie effect of some of the duties under this Tariff will be to find work for 2,000 people. This company might be prepared to layout £10,000, and might not be prepared to layout £12,500. We might have a company that would lay out £12,500 upon an experiment when they would not be prepared to lay out £15,000, and so on, and I say it would be a very great pity if anything were done to prevent machines of this kind coming into the country. I leave the agriculturalists and the pastoralists alone, because I do not profess to know anything of tlieir industries, but I say that the miner wants the best, the cheapest, and the most efficient machinery to be had in the world in order to enable him to develop his mines ? Mr Thomas. machine to which the honourable member refers ? that some people say, that under protection we can have these engines and machines developed here. Victoria is quoted, and it is said that in Victoria we have been able to produce some of the best gold saving machinery in the world under the system of protection. I believe that up to a little time ago some of the best gold saving machinery produced in any place in the world could be produced in Victoria, but that was simply because Bendigo and Ballarat developed that particular kind of machinery, and there was no great competition elsewhere. But immediately the Johannesburg mines were opened up, British and American capital swept into them, and I venture to say that a very short time afterwards the machinery out here was as out of date for gold saving as are horse trams for traction in every civilized place in the world, except Adelaide. To show how special requirements develop means of meeting them, I might point to Martin Brothers' establishment at Gawler. They have been able to develop and to manufacture a first-class concentrating machine. Why? Because of their proximity to the BrokenH ill mines, and the knowledge of tlie requirements of those mines which they' have been able to gain there. But, so little has protection helped them, that not long ago one of the members of the firm told me that he had been begging the others to leave Gawler, and establish the foundry in Sydney. WhilstI am glad to see people employed in factories, T say that it is suicidal to develop, say, a foundry at the expense of a mine, because, while in the foundiy you may give employment to 50 men, by sacrificing the mine you throw 400 or 500 men out of employment. No other industiy affords such varied and extensive avenues of employment as mining does, because it employs not only the miner, but also the carpenter, the tradesman, the engine-driver, the fitter, and many other artisans. One reason why I object to protective duties is this : If a mine does not pay it is shut down but if a woollen factory does not pay with the assistance of 15 per cent, duties, the proprietor asks for and obtains 25 per cent, duties. The mining, agricultural, and pastoral community has to pay to keep the woollen manufactory and other protected industries going ; but",35,Smith The N I T Explains The Intention Of Honourable Members

I was not present during the sittings of the Federal Convention ; but I understand that the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, moved to insert in the Constitution a provision to the effect that all money required for direct federal purposes should be raised by means of a land tax. the ground that the land would receive a particular benefit from federation. were promised a great deal of benefit from federation. I hope that all the benefit which was promised by the Prime Minister, the Minister for Trade and Customs, and others, will be obtained. think it would, but still I hope that I was wrong and that they were right. A t any rate, if the land is to be improved in value as the outcome of federation, it is a fair thing tliat revenue should be raised by a tax upon it . We may be told that the States would be impoverished, but I think I am right in saying that the honourable and learned member for In d i stated at the Federal Convention, when speaking about the way in which Wester.il Australia would be affected by the reduction of the revenue collected through the Customs, that if the people were not taxed in that way the money would be left in their pockets. That was reported to have been said by the honourable and learned member, but whether he said it or not, I believe in the correctHe was a free-trader; he was prepared ness of that view. If you do not take money out of the pockets of the people through customs duties, the money must remain in their pockets. I venture to say that a land tax affords a just, fair, and equitable means of raising revenue ; besides which it would stimulate enterprise, and thus tend to provide employment. If you tax a man's land you compel him to make some use of it in order that he may be able to pay the tax. There was a great deal of land in New South Wales and other States of which no use was made until a land tax was imposed, but when taxation had to be paid, those who held land had to do something with it , and they thus provided employment for the people. If there are any free traders in this HouseI would like to see them support this resolution. There is as much difference between free-trade and revenue tariffism as there is between protection and revenue tariffism, and for a man to say he is a free-trader and at the same time a revenue tariffist is to take up a position which is a delusion, asnare, and a mockery. . Some time ago, in New South Wales, there was a band of very able men who believed in free-trade ; and it is to their credit that, under the leadership of the right honourable the leader of the Opposition, they carried out theirpolicy. Whether they were right or I think he did, and on wrong, they did what they believed to be the proper thing. They went into Parlia-' We ment to reduce the customs duties, and they did so. They did not remove the duty on boots, and put it on rice ; but they reduced the duties, and raised revenue by putting a tax upon the land. These men I did not believed in free-trade, and it is argued by them to-day that New South Wales isbetter off because of the free-trade policy that was then adopted. If free-trade is a good thing for New South Walesi t must be a good thing for the Commonwealth, and the only way in which we can secure free trade is by resorting to direct taxation. I confess that I admire the magnificent pluck and heroism of John Bright when he took tlie action he did some 50 j'ears ago. Free trade in England then was not the thing toswear by that it is to-day, but there was tremendous opposition to it , which went so far that on a certain afternoon a number of land-owners met and subscribed £250,000' with which to fight John Bright. He advocated free-trade-no t revenue tariflism. to remove customs duties, and he wanted to tax not only the land', but property generally. If there are any free-traders left in this HouseI would ask them to support this resolution, and if there are any protectionists here who have the courage to protect, I would like them to support it . I do not regard a man as a protectionist if he is prepared to impose only duties of 10 per cent, or 15 percent., and allow goods to come in here subject only to a slight restriction. The natural corollary to protection is a land tax. There are some members who say that this Tariff is not high enough, because it will allow certain imports to come in, and from the point of view of the protectionist thatisaperfectlycorrect attitude to take. I admire tlie man who is sincere in his political professions, and I do not care what a man is so long as he is whole-hearted and logical. If there is a ti'ue protectionist here I claim his",38,Smith The N I T Explains The Intention Of Honourable Members

Believing that to raise .£9,000,000 through the Customs would impose very heavy burdens upon the community, and that a land tax would afford us an equitable mode of raising reveuue, I hope my amendment will meet with cordial support. ""that this amendment would be moved, I have carefully considered the way in which, under the standing orders which control -our proceedings, it should be discussed; -and after some little difficulty I have arrived at a conclusion which I wish to state to the members. Standing order 257 providesA member may speak to any question before the House. And concludesBut not otherwise. According to that standing order, as I am now putting the question to the House, "" that the words proposed to be added be so added,"" the only debate that could take place would be on the one issue whether -or not a direct tax, in the shape of a land tax, should be imposed in the Commonwealth. Standing order 263 says :An amendment proposed should be disposed of before another amendment can be moved ; after .all the amendments have been disposed of the main question us amended, or otherwise, should I and those who sit with me are quite in T>e forthwith put. ;So that, at the conclusion of the debate, if I -confined the discussion to the question before the Chair, I could not permit the leader of the Opposition to speak in reply, or allow any honourable member who has not spoken on the main question to address himself to it. I should be compelled, on the amendment being negatived, to put the main question forthwith. Under the circumstances I have decided to permit the debate on the main question to continue on the part of those who have not yet spoken. Such honourable members will also be allowed to address themselves to the amendment -as a cognate subject. Honourable members who have already addressed the House upon the main question may speak again, but their addresses must be confined strictly to the question whether or not a land tax should be imposed in the Commonwealth. I think that this course will best conduce to the convenience of honourable members, and that it will be in accordance with the forms of the House. External Affairs) I would be the last in this House to call into question the opinion you, Mr Speaker, have expressed, and, indeed, as far as I am concerned, I have no necessity to appeal to the indulgence of the House. I have spoken on the main question, but I have no intention of adding to the length of the debate, which has been very much prolonged, in view of the necessities of .the countiy. Even if I did not doubt my right to speak on the main question again, I should in any case confine myself to the amendment at this late stage. Indeed, I have very little to add. An additional satisfaction to me, in my retrospect of this debate, has been to find that I have . not been one of the longest, but one of the shortest speakers. Therefore I do not intend to impair the pleasure of that retrospect by speaking for more than a very few minutes. Having to deal with the amendment alone, I am confronted with this position-that it was not only the policy of the party which sits with me when we went to the countiy, that at any rate for the present, the revenue of the Commonwealth must be raised wholly from customs and excise duties, but this view was-if not at first, at any rate later on-supporte d by the leader of the Opposition, with whom, therefore, in this respect, unison. It is far from my mind to lay down the proposition that at no time will a land tax be necessary for the purposes of the Commonwealth. It was a wise foresight that in the drafting of the Constitution subsection (2) of section 51 was made so wide. It includes the whole ground of taxation so long as that taxation does not discriminate between States or parts of States. Therefore, the Commonwealth has the power to impose taxation of any kind, whether direct or indirect, so long as there is no unjust discrimination about that taxation. The amendment therefore cannot be quarrelled with on that ground. Nor can it be quarrelled with in any other way except in regard to the position which I put forward, and the inherent merits of land value taxation to which I do not think it necessary to address myself to-night. On the other grounds of tone and temper the amendment has been put forward very calmly and very ably. Without any long argument as to",39,Smith The N I T Explains The Intention Of Honourable Members

135,Mr Bart On (Hunter,"Minister for the necessity of raising a revenue adequate to the needs of the StatesI do not say adequate to their demandsI merely say that I still hold the opinion, which I think -was held by all parties when we went to the polls, that therevenue must be raised by customs and excise, and that it must be .sufficient in its returns to prevent undue embarrassment to the finances of the States. As we know, the provisions of the Constitution render it necessary for the Commonwealth, during the bookkeeping period, to return to the respective States all that has been spent in the transferred services, less the expenditure in those States, -and their pe<' capita share in the new -expenditure of the Commonwealth. That necessity-as is evidenced by the figures -of the Treasurer, which, however much they may be quarrelled with in respect to their accuracy, have been compiled with the very greatest care-establishe s one thing very clearly, namely, that there is a certain ratio between the returns yielded by any Tariff imposed by the Commonwealth, which necessitates that some States shall receive more than they need, if it is to be recognised that we are to return to the remaining States something within a measurable degree of what they need. To that measurable degree we must come for the safety of the Commonwealth, not taking the course which the honourable member for the Barrier advocates of raising the Commonwealth revenue without paying -any regard to the necessities of the States, but having in view the fact that any result which causes an undue and perilous embarrassment to the States, or to any one of them, reacts with immense force upon the -credit of the whole Commonwealth. levy direct taxation if we fail to impose it -ourselves 1 -decide. I was going to say that that is the position to which I still adhere, notwithstandnecessary, trespass upon any taxable capacity ing my honourable friend's arguments. We -cannot support this amendment, because the Government and the Opposition parties were united in indicating that the revenue -of the Commonwealth must, at any rate, at this stage of our history, be raised from -customs and excise, and because it is tlie bounden duty of the Commonwealth to guard against the possibility of any serious embarrassment to the States. If it does not do so, it abandons its position of trustee to the whole of the States during the bookkeeping period, and it can only abandon its trusteeship at its own peril, because the impairment or ruin of the credit of one State would impair that credit which we must maintain for the nation as a whole. That is a result which we cannot permit to be brought about. Therefore, taking it for granted tliat it was the consensus of opinion on the part of the Government and of the Opposition that the whole of the revenue of the Commonwealth -a t this stage, at any rate-shoul d be raised from customs and excise, I say that that revenue must be such as to pi-event any undue embarassment to the States. Let us go a point beyond that. There is another aspect of this duty of preserving the credit of the States. We have so to adjust the burdens of taxation as to leave to them the capacity to raise for themselves any shortage which may be imposed upon them as the result of the operation of our Tariff. It is impossible-as has been indicated-to frame any Tariff which will supply to all the States the Prime Minister that the amendment does not necessarily involve the raising of any less sum than is suggested in the Government proposal, and therefore tlie question of whether or not funds should be provided to a greater or less extent for the States, is hardly within its scope. that this tax is submitted as a part substitute-as the honourable member for the Barrier put it-for the duties proposed to be raised by customs and excise. It involves the question in itself of whether it is an efficient substitute-efficien t for those needs which all parties recognise must be satisfied. That is the whole extent to which I wish to go. It is important that in raising our revenue we should not, to any degree that is not positively and absolutely of the States which might enable them to supply any shortages that result from our Tariff proposals. I do not wish to advert to those proposals any more than to point out that it is impossible to satisfy the greatest needs of the States, because that would involve an unheard-of revenue being raised from the source I have indicated. The course, therefore, which is possible and practicable is the medium course, which may leave some shortages. Without going over",40,Smith The N I T Explains The Intention Of Honourable Members

139,Mr Barton,"I was going to urgethe old ground, or traversing the old figures, it will be clearly seen that those States which will be left with shortages by this Tariff must have a field of taxation from which to put their finances in a proper position. If the field is trespassed upon as is now proposed, by so much is it rendered more difficult for each State that is short to preserve its solvency and its credit. That is, I take it, the whole point involved in the amendment. to dispute that land taxation may sometimes be necessary. There are those of us who, if we look into this matter, must foresee that in some of the States, at any rate, a greater degree of internal direct taxation is necessary. The sole reason is that the whole of the ordinary powers of taxation provided by Customs and excise are given to tlie Commonwealth, and the States cannot, as States, have any voice as to how those powers shall be exercised, and if the result of the unaided exercise of our rights, which are the rights of the whole Commonwealth, leaves tlie States with a shortage, then to enter on the other field of taxation-one longs to us as much as to the States, but one which morally we ought to leave to the States as much as possible-would their credit and their ability to satisfy the needs of tlieir own Treasurers. for us to say that in this or that State there here to rectify the internal of the States, to them, subject to the needs of the Commonwealth, order to prevent their being placed in an improper position. If the States choose to "" outrun the constable,"" and to enormously increase extravagant expenditure, so that anything in reason tlie Commonwealth Government do is not sufficient for them, it must be their responsibility to make up tlie balance. But even if the Governments and the Parliaments not recognise their duty, we have.still remember that the solvency of tlie States is the solvency of the Commonwealth, and, therefore, we should not subtract them any reasonable field of taxation by means of which they can rehabilitate their finances. If , having that proper field, the States do not choose to resort to it, that may be their mistake, but it is not our business to interfere. the Commonwealth Government, having the main sources of revenue, resort to other Mr Barton. sources and take it out of the power of the States to rectify anything that needs rectification, then we begin to be chargeable, because we have entered on a domain which at the present time we ought to leave to them, in order that their individuality as contracting States may be maintained in f u l l strength. No one desires that the States should become crawling dependents, on the Commonwealth for grants; we doWe are not concerned not want anything of that kind to occur. The position, as I pointed out, is a temporary one. It will exist, at any rate, during the bookkeeping period, and it may exist later. The movements of trade which w ill follow the abolitionof the Inter-State barriers cannot be foreseen. We can only make the best attempt that our present knowledgeopens up to us to provide for the contingencies of a few years, but the position of the States financially will probably differ very much from the position in which they stand now in relation to each other. The States which at present have the greatest consuming capacity may tend to equality, and that bethose with less consuming capacity may make some advance to their level. All these are matters which must be observed and watched ; impair and it may be thatattheend ofafewyearsweshall find ourselves in a better position to It is not saj' what should be done in regard to direct taxation. But the needs of the States comis extravagance. We are not pel both parties to take the position tliat the finances Customs and Excise shall be, for the present, but simply to return the sole source of revenue. We are pledged to that course on the Government side of as much as we can in the House, and honourable members on the opposition side are similarly pledged, so far as the voice of a leader can represent the voice of a party. I take it that that pledge was given on the considerations I have pointed Out, which apply to tlie finances of the Commonwealth irrespective of free-trade and protection, and apply as much to one party as to the other. Under these cirof the States do cumstances, therefore, without expressing to too much opposition to land value taxation, which, as I say, the necessities of the Commonwealth itself may some day render from necessary, I point out that as the necessities of the Commonwealth do not at the present moment render such taxation necessary, it is better to leave the States in possession of that confidence and security which they will have when there is this source of revenue to On tlie other hand, if make up for possible financial necessities. Having said that, I do not think I need prolong the debate further than to say that I shall not find myself in a position to vote for the amendment. this debate is pretty well exhausted. AVe have had speeches of undue length from some members of the Opposition, and we are now in the third week of the debate. WereI to consult my own personal feelings, or were I to consider the time of the House, I should not speak, but I feel I have a duty to perform on an occasion like this. represent a constituency which is made up largely of farmers, and the Tariff' which we are now considering, will very seriously affect that class. I have heard honourable members on the opposition side state that the Tariff, as proposed, will be of no benefit to the farming community. In fact, we have been challenged to show in what way the .Tariff will benefit the farmer. I accept that challenge, and I shall prove that the Tariff will be of immense advantage to the farmer, and particularly to that class of farmer which I have the honour to represent. One thing has struck me very forcibly during the progress of this debate. We have heard able speeches from honourable members on both sides of the House, but I am sorry to say that there are some honourable members sitting in opposition who have not refrained from indulging in the grossest misrepresentation. anticipated that when the Tariff proposals were submitted to tlie House, there would be a fight, but some of us, at any rate, expected that the fight would be carried on in a fair and honourable manner. We have not only had misrepresentation from honourable members on the opposition side, but we have found those misrepresentations backed up by that section of the press which supportsthepolicyoftheOpposition. We have had the spectacle of the leader of the Opposition telling the House and the country that this Tariff has been framed purely in the interests of the Victorian manufacturer. That is a splendid start; and we now hear that statement cheered by members of the Opposition. This Tariff has not been framed in the interests of Victorian manufacturers. If the Tariff resembles the Tariff of Victoria more closely thaii it does the Tariff of New South Wales, that is simply because the former is found more suited to tlie circumstances of the Commonwealth. But the statement has been taken up by a section of the free-trade press in Sydney, and sent broadcast from one end of the land to the other. It is a nice state of things that we should have not only honourable members in the House, but the free-trade press of New South WalesI am now addressing myself particularly to honourable members who' represent New South Wales adopting methods which are calculated to stir up disaffection and disloyalty to the union into which we have just entered. Again, in addition to the statement that I the Tariff is purely a Victorian one, we find all sorts of misrepresentations in the New South Wales journalsas to its operation. Comparisons are made between the cost of living under the old Tariff and under the new one. How are these tables compiled t In a most unfair way, on the assumption that, under the new duties, the people of New South Wales and of the Commonwealth are not going to use anything that we. grow or manufacture ourselves, but are going to consume the imported article in every instance. We have free-trade merchants in Sydney professing the utmost regard for the poorer classes, and expressing the greatest solicitude for them in their alleged sufferings, under the new Tariff-saying , in fact, that they will not be able to live. Yet we find these people in some instances increasing the price of goods on which they have not actually paid any duty, We a l l so great is their solicitude for the poorer classes. But that is not the worse. We find here honourable members who insinuate that members of this House have been bribed by manufacturers to impose the Victorian Tariff. who generally sits behind the honourable member for Macquarie has said so. stand the honourable member for Cowper to assert that such a statement has been made in this House1 in the House; but it was made by insinuation within the precincts of this House. I challenge the honourable member to whom I allude to repeat that statement in the House. I hope he will do so, as he has not yet spoken. When we find such statements being made, it is enough to cause anyone who wishes to see the affairs of this Commonwealth carried on as they ought to be to speak strongly.

It has been foreseen so long that the real issue of the first federal election audience. must be under which Tariff the Commonwealth shall exist, that the question is by no means raised now anew. I wish now to read an extract from the same paper, published on the 7 t h February last If there is any meaning in plain words, the fiscal intention of the followers of the Federal Ministry should be sufficiently clear from the remarks of Mr Wise and Sir William Lyne, as we gavefchem3'esfcerday morning.* The utterances of Mr Wise do not bind the Ministry. We know that their Tariff will be protective in character, however. Sir William Lyne has much more advanced views on this Tariff question than Mr Wise. While that gentleman was explaining his views in one column yesterday morning, Sir William was reported in the adjoining column as frankly telling tlie people of Adelong that our industries must be protected. What was iu Sir William Lyne's mind-and as a Minister he is in the confidence of the Federal Cabinet-wa s clear enough when he told his hearers at Adelong, that under a free-trade Tariff they could only raise five millions, while it would be necessary to raise eight and a-half or nine millions every year. He r e is a leader w h i c h appeared in the He r a l d the m o r n in g a f t e r the speeches delivered by the P r i m e M in is t e r and the Attorney-Generali n the SydneyT o w n HallAfter last night's meeting tbe Federal Ministry stands before the electors as committed to protection. Mr Beid has so far succeeded that he has drawn from Mr Barton almost as explicit a declaration as could be expected, and one explicit enough for the free-traders of Australia. Mr Barton said, in so many words, that the first concern of the Government in its fiscal policy is revenue, and the next moderate protection to maintain the industries of Australia. He would not offer a remark as to the nature of the duties, because any disclosure of that kind would defeat the object of securing revenue. At the risk of wearying the HouseI must quote another passage. I refer to the report of a speech which was delivered Mr Clarke. honourable member for We n t w o r t h , a t Randwick, and which appeared in the SydneyM o r n in g Herald, of 26th February, 1901. Honourable members w ill remember t h a t the federal campaign was then a t its height:l t was said that some of the opponents of free trade were not sufficiently clear in their views. People were told that Mr Barton was not sufficiently definite. He believed that Mr Barton was as definite as he could possibly be. T h a t statement was applauded by the The people knew one thing from Mr Barton and that was that he ( Mr Barton) was a protectionist. That was enough for u free-trader. How could Mr Barton be more definite when he did not know the composition of the Houses of the Federal Parliament. If Mr Barton got a majority of five it meant a moderate dose of protection, if a majority of ten it would be a much stronger protectionist s t ill ; and if the majority was 25 would Mr Barton be the master of the situation ? Those were the sentiments of the honourable member for We n t w o r t h a t t h a t particular time. W h a t were his sentiments here the other n i g h t when he delivered himself in this w a y The constituencies had been badly used. They had been misled, and Mr Barton was a renegade from the principles be laid down at Maitland. W h a t do honourable members make of t h a t % W h e n I see honourable members opposite adopting these tactics, and changing t h e i r opinion upon this question to suit different sets of circumstances, I am led seriously to t h in k t h a t the policy adopted by the Labourp a r ty of sinking the fiscal issue has a good deal to recommend it . It is n ot t h a t I have lost f a it h in the efficacy of a good fiscal policy, b u t that I have an abhorrence of honourable members who adopt this opinion to-day and another to-morrow for p a r t y purposes. It h in k the f u t u r e of the Commonwealth and the question we are now discussing are matters which are too serious to be trifled w it h in this way. It h in k the discussion of this question should have been on a very much higher plane ; and t h a t we should have risen above the tactics t h a t I am sorry to say prevail in the State of N e w South Wales. Of course, I have no means of proving it , b u t I can well imagine t h a t some of those who are howling so much about the T a r if f proposals are electors who voted against federation. They are adopting the ""I-told-you-so,"" and the "" what-did-I-tell-you"" attitude, j u s t as some of the journals in Sydneyt h a t by the stone-walled federation are now pointing out to the electors that they had sufficient foresight to show them what they might expect. I think the people of New South Wales were not left in any doubt as to what federation would mean for them. They were told by those opposed to the Commonwealth Bill, as well as by those who supported it, that it meant increased taxation. An Honorable MEMBER -Some told under the old, if the home-nw.de article is them that it meant an expenditure of asked for.

Thus on the one hand we have an honourable member of this House who belongs to the free-trade party proposing to reduce the amount of taxation, and, consequently, the amount to be returned to New South Wales, whilst in New South Wales we have the free-trade leader of the Opposition in the State Legislature telling the Government that tlie amount which they will receive from the Commonwealth posals will not be sufficient to balance the finances. The surplus which we hope to see returned to New South Wales might be applied in many ways towards the reduction of State taxation. It is not for I Mr Clarke. members of this Eederal Parliament to say in what way that money should be applied. On the other hand, That is a matter which the State Parliament has to determine.

I am not one of those who believe that we can have a golden rule or policy applicable to all countries, irrespective of their conditions. I am inclined to think that England, under the present profor instance, acted wisely in adopting the policy of free-trade up to a certain point, but in my opinion she has pursued that policy to too great an extent. I should like to quote a passage or two from a book by a very learned author. I select this work",47,Smith The N I T Explains The Intention Of Honourable Members

175,Mr Clarke,"A great deal has beenfor the reason t h a t it is of recent date, and because the w r it er does not appear to have extreme views on either one side or the other. There are one or t w o paragraphs only in which the question of free trade versus protection crops up. I refer to a work on politica l economy byCharles S. Devas, examiner in politica l economy at the R o y a l U n i v e r s it y of Ireland. A t page 24:4:, the following passage occurs : If we have rightly apprehended the nature of international trade and its advantages, the question of what is called free-trade versus protection ought to be easily determined; not indeed the question whether any particular country like Germany or New South Wales should adopt any particular policy, but the general principles which each can apply to the particular circumstances of his own country. Protection for the present purpose means the giving home producers an advantage over foreigners, either by taxing the foreign produce as it comes into the country, or by giving the home exporters a donation (a bounty) in addition to what they can earn commercially. Now the following are valid reasons for protection, not anywhere, but wherever the conditions exist that render them applicable. First reason. If a country lacks certain industries for which it is physically suited, say the manufacture of woollen cloth, leather, and potteryI t h in k a l l these conditions are present here ; the iron industry, for example, is one t h a t we have of t e n talked of, b u t for which nothing has been doneand is supplied with them from abroad, a protective duty levied on the importation of these goods will call into life the manufacture of them at home, and utilize the productive power of the country. True that tlie encouragement of these industries will be ipso facto a discouragement to the production of those goods, say oats, butter, and iive cattle, that were exported to pay for the woollens, leather, and pottery. But our hypothesis is that the new industries ave ""suitable."" Hence the diversion of national industry will result in a larger net return after the first difficulties are got over, the workmen collected and trained, the kiudi-edandanxiliaiy trades set up, industry properly localized, and on a scale large enough to allow the ful l application of concerted labour and the advantages of the law of increasing returns : moreover, a secure body of customers acquired (business connection), and the vis ivertkti rolled away by the expectation of certain profib. I do not wish to quote the whole of t h is article; it w o u l d be rather tedious to honourable members. the writer, applies particularly to our present conditionsI f an existing industry, really suitable to a country, is threatened with ruin b}'foreign importations, it is plain from the foregoing reason that such industry should be protected, but not plain how such a case could occur. 19 o 2 Honourable members w ill notice t h a t the w r it er is very impartial, and it was for t h a t reason t h a t I selected the article. For the via inertue is here on the side of the home producers, the difficulties of change lying with the foreigner. Yet in two ways at least the case could occur. First through the action of misdirected consumption, explained in the first book, by which good merchandise is driven out by bad, solid and suitable home goods may be supplanted to the public loss by flimsy, showy, unhealthy foreign goods, unsuited to the climate and circumstances ; and the increased exports of some other merchandise to pay for these new imports, is no adequate compensation, and the natural industry is diverted from more to less advantageous production. Secondly, as Professor Sidgwick has pointed out, an extraordinary temporary advantage in production possessed by a foreign country, may destroy or greatly injure a suitable home industry ; and then when that great advantage is past and gone, the cost of restoring the lost or lessened home industry may far outweigh thab previous gain of the cheap imports. We m i g h t easily imagine such a state of things coming about here if we failed to protect those industries which are established. I have heard honourable members in speaking of certain industries which have been p r e t t y well established, say t h a t if they could produce an article and sell it at as low a price as the foreign-made article, they would no longer need protection. It h in k t h a t is a fallacy, because if the protection were removed, the foreigner would at once send his importations in to the country, and, by c u t t in g down prices, even by selling at a loss, wipe out our industries. Thet h i r d reason is given in these termsNational safety may require the home production of all bhe requisites of warfare, and such measures as may avert the risk of an enemy beingable, hy shutting off the importation of food or some other necessary, bo starve their opponents into submission. The w r it e r goes on to reason in t h a t way how necessary it is for the purpose of national safety t h a t a protective system should be adopted; and then he gives a f o u r t h reason, as follows :Social harmony is a good of incalculable value : its injury is, among other things, one of bhe greabesb injuries to national wealth. Now, under certain circumstances, protection may be needed to prevent changes in tlie national industiy, and a consequent break up of a happy aud harmoniousconstitution. A secure and steadj' market The second reason given by may be essential to an organised industiy, and to the proper insurance of the poorer classes. Hence the apparent loss by the exclusion of foreign ' goods may be outweighed by the real gain of steady habits, sober profits, and mutual goodwill. I agree w it h the honourable member for Newcastle t h a t a policy of protection in itself is not sufficient to improve the state of the labouring classes. I admit that we must go further, in order to elevate the workers, and that protection is but the first step. Speaking about the necessity of protection as a means of national safety I should like, with the indulgence of the House, to quote an article from the London Daily Mail, which was reprinted a little while ago in a Sydney paper, and which draws attention to the decline of agriculture in Great BritainA disquieting document is the report of the Agricultural Committee on National Wheat Stores. The witnesses examined, with only one Or two exceptions, agreed that the dependence of the nation on seaborne supplies of breadstuff's demanded serious attention, and the adoption of some precautionary measures. Mr W. J. Harris estimated that in May, 1895, there was not more than seven weeks' supply of wheat aud flour in the United Kingdom, ""and probably not so much."" Mr Procter stated that "" we want 500,000 quarters of foreign wheat to keep us going a week,"" and added that then (May, .1897) he did not Suppose we had more than six weeks or two months' supply. Our dependence on foreign importation is shown in the following table :Home-grown Wheat and Flour. Wheat and Flour. Qrs. of 480 lb. 1854-55 17,563,000 1874-75 12,900,000 11,700,000 1895-90 Tbe committee state that they are profoundly impressed by the evidence given as to the immense importance of Government wheat stoves as an essential item of national defence, and they are unable to conclude that the stores would have any material effect on the interests of agriculture or of the corn trade. They recommend that the Government should be most strongly urged to obtain the appointment, as soon as possible, of a Royal commission, to include representatives of agriculture, the corn trade, the shipping, the Navy and the Army, so as to conduct an exhaustive inquiry into the whole subject of tbe national food supply in the case of war. In a leading article on the 28th October, the Sydney Morning Herald refers to the state of agriculture in Great Britain in these terms:The recently published official returns of the Board of Agriculture in England point to a steady and serious decline of the agricultural industry in the mother countiy. Within the lost quarter of a century the wheat area has decreased by one-half, and within the twelve months an area about equal in extent to the county of Middlesex has disappeared from wheat cultivation. Although some of the causes of the falling off may be of a temporary character, the facts seem to point to the conclusion that there has been a steady decrease in wheat cultivation, which is not likely to be arrested. The stock statistics Mr Glarke. point in the same direction. In sheep the decline is very great, and the outlook for the agricultural industiy is serious enough. The article continues in an apologetic strain with reference to the decline of agriculture in Great Britain. I do not mean to say that a quotation of that sort, or the fact that the agricultural industry has declined in England, is sufficient to prove that the people of Great'Britain should adopt a protective policy, but it goes to show that the agricultural interests of Great Britain have been neglected, and that some means should be devised for giving an impetus to the industry. I know that the people of Great Britain think that it pays them better to import produce and exchange something else than to grow ' it ; but I do not think that is altogether a sound policy. To come nearer home, a challenge was thrown out by the honourable member for Macquarie, who stated that the Tariff would not have any beneficial effects on agriculture. I have the honour to represent the largest maize-producing district in the whole of the Commonwealth, and I Imported. have very closely watched the movements of the maize markets for some years past. Qi-s. of 480 lb. When the Dibbs duties were in operation 2,983,000 in New South Wales the local production 4,800,000 23,300,000 of maize was in excess of the demand, but shortly after the Reid Tariff came into existence, and the duties on maize and other cereals were repealed, it became very evident that our market was being exploited by foreign producers of maize. During 1898, 1899, and 1900 the imports of maize into New South Wales exceeded the exports by 1,148,000 bushels. A t 2s. per bushela very low price-the value of the imports of maize in excess of the exports would be £115,000. I should like the honourable member for Macquarie to tell the farmers along the north coast of New South Wales that this importation of maize had no effect upon prices, but was really good for them. In quoting these figures, I have taken the maize importations from countries outside of tlie Commonwealth, but if I include the figures for the States of the Commonwealth, I find that there is an excess of imports over exports of 747,922 bushels. Now we come to still another item in the list of farm products ; namely, potatoes, which are largely grown on the north coast of New South Wales. They have virgin soil there that is capable of producing potatoes sufficient to supply tlie needs of a very great portion of the Commonwealth-soi l that has not been touched, simply because it is rather remote from the markets. We imported into New South Wales during 1900 potatoes to the value of £185,000, whilst we exported only £52,000 worth. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -Wher e were they imported from ? those particulars, but considerable quantities came from Tasmania and New Zealand, and possibly from Victoria. I am only quoting thesefiguresto show the effect of the freego so far as to say that if it can be shown trade policy of New South Wales during a few years upon the agricultural industry. The excess of imports of potatoes was valued at £132,000, and such an amount of money distributed amongst the farmers of New South Wales would represent something very substantial. ber show how much of the imports came from outside of the Commonwealth? honourable member to go to the statistical register for that information. I should like to refer briefly to what was put forward by the honourable member for Langi n reference to the timber industry. The honourable member made a comparison between New South Wales and Victoria with regard to this particular industry, and he evidently thought thai he had made a very strong point when he showed that the number of saw-mills in operation and the number of hands employed in New South Wales under free-trade exceeded those in Victoria. I should like to remind the House, however, that in New South Wales we have a coastline of 800 miles, which is practically dotted with saw-mills, whereas they have no such advantage in Victoria. Then, again, across the ranges in the west we have fine timber country, and along the Murray there are vast supplies of tiinber upon which we can draw. Therefore, it does not follow that, because there are more mills in operation and more hands employed in New South Wales than in Victoria, free-trade is therefore better than protection for the timber industry. Nature has been more bountiful in the supply of timber to New South Wales than to Victoria. The imports of timber into New South Wales-and I know honourable members will not want to know where this timber comes from -fro m countries outside the Commonwealth, exceeded the exports by the value of £736,871 during the years 1898, 1899, and 1900. The imports from all countries, inclusive of the States of the Commonwealth, exceeded the exports by £1,029,784. I have heard honourable members say that only imported timber is suitable for use in mining operations. Whilst not venturing to give a positive opinion about the matter, I did not go into I have a sufficient knowledge of timber to induce me to believe that our own timber can be used for mining purposes with as much advantage as imported timber. I will that imported timber only is suitable for mining work, I shall be willing to give my vote in favour of allowing timber to be used for mining purposes to come in free. owners say that imported timber is the only timber suitable for their purposes. BrokenH ill have never used anything else but imported timber. I have known people I would ask the who have been in the habit of using a certain material for many years, who could not be made to believe that it was not the best, but -when they were induced to use something else, they expressed regret that they had not made the change long before. owners tried the local timber before they used the imported material. considerations other than suitability, such as the cost of carriage, or something of that sort, might have induced them to make the change. I know that in New South Wales, imported timber is used for purposes for which it is not so suitable as our own hardwoods, and that this has had the effect of displacing our hardwoods. I know the hardships and privations which are endured by timber cutters. It is hardly fair to these men that an article which they can assist in producing should be discarded to their detriment in favour of the use of a foreign article merely for the purpose of allowing a ring of Sydney importers to grow rich by this trade in imported timber. I do not say that there are not purposes for which the imported timber is superior to our hardwoods. But at the present-time the imported timber is put to uses in respect of which it is not superior, but decidedly inferior. I come now to that despised commodity in regard to which there'",48,Smith The N I T Explains The Intention Of Honourable Members

182,Mr Clarke,"That may be so, buthas been much sneering by honourable members opposite. I refer to the duty upon eggs. I venture to say that if those who sneer at this commodity were to visit some of the farming constituencies and to ascertain the low prices which the farmers have been receiving for their eggs, they would be very much surprised. As a matter of fact, tlie Sydney market has been supplied by the importation of eggs from China. We keep the Chinaman out, but we do not object to receiving eggs from him. During 1900 we imported 606,000 dozens of eggs valued at £23,000 and exported only 32,000 dozen, valued at a little over £1,000. There was thus an excess of imports over exports upon this one line representing a value of £22,000. A great proportion of these eggs came from China. I venture to say that the duty which it is proposed to levy upon eggs will be very acceptable to the farmers of the whole of New South Wales. The farmers' wives devote their spare time to this industry, and it is a matter of considerable moment to them that they should have a market for those eggs. other articles which the farmers produce, such as oats, onions, &c, and prove that new South Wales under free-trade is absolutely unable to supply its own requirements, and has had to import largely from abroad. According to letters which have been received from the South Coast, we have now an opportunity of starting a business in condensed milk. Surely honourable members will not deny that such an industry would be of immense advantage to the farmers throughout the whole of these States. I know that the free-trade representatives of the South Coast district of New South Wales used to vote faithfully for the retention of the duties upon cheese and butter in the State Parliament. of the four free-trade members voted against them. present leader of the Opposition was revising the New South Wales Tariff, the only free-trade representative of the South Coast recorded his vote in favour of the retention of the duty upon butter. In regard to every other commodity he was a free trader. The same thing occurred in regard to a representative of the Newcastle district. That honourable member was in favour of a duty upon biscuits and candles because there were biscuit and candle factories in his electorate, but in regard to everything else he was a free-trader. These are facts which cannot be denied. A great deal has been said about the sugar industry, and the leader of the Opposition, in his opening speech, intimated that he would have dealt with that industry in the same way as the Government propose to deal with it . I am pleased that the Ministry have grappled with this question, and have decided upon giving a preference to sugar grown by means of white labour as against that grown by black labour. I am glad to find that the cost to the consumer has been very little increased by the new duty which has been imposed. I was told on Monday that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company had increased its price by £ 2 a ton. I visited two retailers and found that in some of the leading houses in Sydney the 70-lb. bag of sugarhad increased in price by only Is. 3d. That is equal to £ 2 per ton. I also ascertained that the 4-lb. packages of sugar, which are sold by tlie small retailers, have increased in price I could enumerate from 9d. to 10d., or \ d . per lb. I have been informed that some of the country storekeepers have increased the price of the bag which was formerly sold at 13s. to 20s. Whether that statement is true, I am not in a position to say. A great deal has been said about the boot trade in Sydney. Let me tell honourable members that as the result of the introduction of this Tariffi t is the intention of the boot manufacturers of Sydney to increase the wages of their employees from to-morrow by 10 to 15 per cent, all round. It is also intended to improve the old Woollen mills, which have been lying idle at Parramatta for so many years, and to resume, operations there. I do not know whether that is a bad sign. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -Why should it remain idle, when factories in Tasmania send their wool into New South Walest In 1895, when the may answer his own enigmas. I wish also to touch upon the iron industry, about which so much has been said in New South Wales, but so little has been done. I wish, to show that the prestige which Great Britain had in the iron industry is fast slipping away from her. Mr J. S. Larke saysI n 1873 England produced more than half the iron of the world. In 1888 she had increased her production from 5,000,000 tons to over 8,000,000",51,Smith The N I T Explains The Intention Of Honourable Members

184,Mr Clarke,,52,Smith The N I T Explains The Intention Of Honourable Members
185,Mr Clarke,"The honourable membertor»s, but her output was only one-fourth that of the world. To-day she was exceeded in her iron and steel production by the United States and Germany. The great competitor of England in the future would be the United States. I do not wish to detain the House much longer, but I felt that in addressing myself to this question I had a public duty to perform. If we approached the question in a better spirit, we might deal with it much more satisfactorily. I hope, in fact we are assured by the Treasurer, that he is prepared to consider amendments in the Tariff; and if, instead of beating the kettle drum outside and making a noise about the Tariff, we were to approach the question, as we ought to do, from a national instead of from a party stand-point, our efforts would Vie much more likely to be successful. The leader of the Opposition foresaw a good while ago-so far back, at any rate, as 1899 -that the Tariff which would be adopted or proposed by the Government of the Commonwealth, would have to be of a protective character. So far-seeing was the right honourable gentleman, that he took occasion at Wellington, in New South Wales, to go through a little rehearsal in anticipation of a political drama, though that drama never came off, owing to a slight political accident. The leader of the Opposition is recorded as having said at Wellington, on the 19th June, 1899He did not know aboub becoming a protectionist, but had got broad enough in his mind mow not to have only one idea. It had taken the right honourable gentleman years to get broad enough for that. Ib had taken him years to get broad enough for that. Seven years ago he used to walk nnto the old man "" Parkes"" like a tiger, because lie was still a fanatical free-trader ; bub, as a man .grew older, and got responsibilities, he got more broad in his opinions, and saw things a little more in their true proportion. He had now more than one idea. Where he used to have room -only for the one idea of free-trade, he never used :to think of anything else now he thought of national union. The right honourable gentleman did not .say protection, but we can well see what he had in his mind when he made that speech. .It was one of those speeches which we know .so well in New South Wales, and which .are delivered preparatory to the performance of a little political somersault. That .somersault, however, was never performed, -and now he stands on the Opposition side, and in vigorous terms condemns the Government for carrying out the policy which he himself would have had to introduce. I have said all I wish to say on this question. Much more might be said, but I feel that I have, at any rate, given voice to the sentiments and feelings of those whom I represent. Free-trade farmers there may be in my constituency, but they are few and far between. I am quite sure tliat the Tariff which has been introduced by the Government, while a Tariff for the farmers of my constituency, is also a Tariff which, with a little modification, will meet the requirements of the people of the Commonwealth. I wish, before concluding, to make a personal explanation. During the first part ofmy speech, I referred to an honourable member who had stated outside the precincts of the chamber that Ministers had been approached and bribed in a corrupt way to introduce this Tariff. A t the time. I asked the honourable member whether he was going to repeat the statement in the House, and he said he was. However, I have since had an opportunity of seeing the honourable member, and he assures me now that the remark was made jocularly. HadI not believed at the time that the honourable member was serious, I should not have mentioned the incident in the House, and, now having received an assurance that the remark was made jocularly, I regret very much having made any reference to the matter. MrA . PATEBSON(Capricornia) -Look ing over some statistics lately I was rather startled to find that in one leading State of the Commonwealth there are no fewer than 1,157 people blind of an eye. On turning over the next page of the statistics I found the still more extraordinary fact that in the immediately adjoining State there are 1,164 people blind of an eye. I would not for worlds divulge the names of those States. It would be difficult enough for clear, wideeyed men with perfect sight, to look at all sides of a sexagon, and they cannot do it without shifting their stand-point. How, then, can we expect one-eyed men to do such a thing ? This Commonwealth has six sides, represented by the six States, and in order to get a true appreciation of the position we must look at them all. It appears to me that this debate is very much like a duel between New South Wales and Victoria. I am, I believe, the first Queenslander who has spoken on the subject, and we, who represent the other States, can, it appears to me, look more dispassionately on ' the position.

It has often been said that there is great difficulty in discriminating between what are called revenue duties and prohibitive duties. As to composite duties, I never heard any one attempt an explanation of them. People think that it requires a superhuman intellect to distinguish between these various duties.

It is not necessary for me to make any remarks as to what these duties are. Every one knows. Yesterday, the honourable member for Riverina made a splendid point against our side when he described to us the position of the wheat farmer. The honourable member told us how the farmer prepared his crop, and that when it was gathered he put it into bags. These bags the honourable member said were free under the new Tariff. I felt very grateful in my heart to the honourable member for stating this publicly, and I was willing to acknowledge it, but I must say my gratitute fell considerably when I found that corn sacks were already free in all the States except my own. On behalf of the farmers of Queensland, whom I have the honour to represent, I tender the honourable member told us, with an appearance of great satisfaction, that we ought to be exceedingly grateful to the Government because they had put no less than £29,000,000 worth of goods on the free l is t being the amount of the Inter-State trade. AVe are very grateful to the Prime Minister for doing this, but I think our thanks are due to the Constitution under which we Now, it must -take live. I tell honourable members that if it were possible to put New South Wales back I ' appeal to the into her old position of free-trade, I am perfectly certain we could raise a good deal of money from that State and she would Biscuits, l ^ d . The duty probably make £27,000,000 more out of it as compared with Victoriai n the next fouler five years. Now we come to the composite -duties. This word "" composite"" was first used in connection with ships. When I was a youngster I had some connection with a shipping firm, and I took a great deal of interest in everything connected with ships. I do not know very much about the practical work of ship-building, but I understand all shipping business pretty well. that time the wooden sailing ships, the old fashioned Quebec bruisers were going out of date. We were getting a smarter class of ships, which, being built lighter, sailed faster, and made much more money for their owners. in connection with what were allied "" composite "" ships. I do not quite understand the construction of them, but the iron plates of the frame-work were fastened in some places with copper bolts. -vessels were used for carrying sugar, and the dampness of the sugar gradually corroded the iron. where they came in contact with the copper, eat the copper bolts, and what was the result ? What right have we to go to her for an The ship-owners were coining These vessels became extremely fashionable. They attracted much attention, and many ships were built. But one fine morning the loss of one of these ships, not more than two or three years old, was posted up in the Glasgow Underwriters' Exchange. few months passed, and another of these ships was missing. In less than twelve months a third vessel was missing and was seen no more. Naturally the underwriters became alarmed. They ordered an inspection to be made of the first composite ship that entered the harbour, and they discovered the secret. It was found that, by coming into contact with the corroded iron, the copper bolts were eaten away; the plates fell out, and the vessels went to the bottom and were never heard of more. I hope that these composite duties will go to the bottom and never be heard of again. This word "" composite "" is becoming quite fashionable. and in to-day's papers a telegram is to be seen which refers to some of the doings of a composite South Africa. posite flag. But, alas! there is nothing composite about the Ministry. vernment propose, however, to impose composite duties. composite duties, and what is their intention 1 The Tariff answers both questions. Turning to item 82 in the Tariff we find Mr A. Palernon. enumerated under the heading of "" Varnishes"" the article of patent knotting. On that article there is a fixed duty of Is. per gallon and 15 per cent, ad valorem. I am informed that the lowest market price quoted by the biggest houses in this line of business in Melbourne is 5s. a gallon. Thus, At if we take the fixed duty of Is. per gallon and the 15 per cent, ad valorem-, we find that it is equal to Is. 9d. per gallon. That is nearly the same as the Victorian Tariff. I am not going to say anything about this being a Victorian Tariff, because I do not A new departure was made think an observation of that kind would be wholly justifiable. Sometimes it is quite apparent from a consideration of the Tariff that the other States have been taken into ccnsideration to some extent. Occasionally These the Victorian Tariff is actually exceeded, and I think every free-trader will join heartily in resisting an excess of that kind. The rust collected on the plates I wish to point out how this Tariff is made up. Why is Canada taken as a pattern 1 money. example ? According to the latest figures in the DaUy Mai l Year-Pook tlie population of Canada is in round numbers 5,125,000; her exports are £28,750,000 in value; her imports are £23,200,000 in value, and her revenue is £8,000,000. A Poor little despised free-trade New South Wales, with only one-quarter of this population, shows 80 per cent, of Canada's exports; 90 per cent, of her imports, and £1,250,000 more revenue. What effrontery it is to suggest that we should take our pattern from Canada! I wonder very much that the Government did not go to Germany or France. Why should we take our pattern from Canada1 The truth is, as it appears to me, that this idea was a perfect Godsend, I will not say to the manufacturers of Melbourne, but to manufacturers all over the State. Here was a magnificent chance of fooling the consumer, and especially of bamboozling New We use composite candles, South Wales. The Government first impose an innocent looking revenue duty, and then accompany it with a destructive meatBushmen's Regiment in axe duty. This peculiarity, however, We actually fly a comchanges. Let me show how it works. I will refer first to the duties on boots and The Gohats, and in this connexion I would draw especial attention to a letter which appeared What is the origin of these in both the Age and the Argus, signed by Sir Frederick Sargood. That gentleman should be thanked for the careful way in which he has gone into the particulars relating to these duties. He points out that the fixed duty, with the percentage duty on hats, actually ranges from 37 per cent, up to 183 per cent. There is this peculiarity about the Tariff, that the meat-axe the goods of the poor. It is to be found always on the low priced goods. There is absolutely no exception to that rule. The lighter duty is imposed on the goods purchased by the rich. What do honourable members think of that for a Government policy ? The lowest duty on boots is 27 per cent, aud the highest duty 61 per cent. In this case, also no mistake has been made. The meat-axe duty, and the innocent go-tosleep duty are imposed always on the goods consumed by the poor, although they change places sometimes. Occasionally it is the fixed duty which is to be regarded as the meat-axe duty and sometimes it is the 15 per cent, ad valorem duty which is the meat-axe, just as the goods are used by the rich or the poor. This is extremely fine for the manufacturer, but very puzzling and disgusting to the consumer. There is another question which I wish to put. manufacturer requires protection to the extent of 183 per cent I am not particular, and I will call it 100 per cent, and knock off the remaining 83 per cent, as discount-le t me ask business men who are accustomed to deal with goods and with figures, who runs the factory 1 Isi t the ostensible owner, is it the bank, or is it the State1 The sooner we alter the name of this duty the better. Instead of -calling it the composite or the compromise duty, the "" mongrel duty "" would be more -accurate and significant. honest, and for the credit of the first Australian Parliament, let us blot out the duty at once and for ever. I wish now to speak about the importance of primary producers. City people are a little above primary producers. As I represent primary producers, I shall make out the best case I can for them. AndI shall do so from the pages of Cog/dan, with absolutely correct figures ; there are no assumptions on my part. The relative values in the year 1899 were : .Manufactures, £28,666,000; primary products, £83,607,000-total , £112,273,000. This is pretty strongly in favour of the primary producers, but it does not indicate the real position. How1 Because the primary products are included in manufacturers returns over and over again. Take, for instance, hides. The station-owner sells his cattle to the meat-works, and he returns the cattle, with the hides of course, in the official statistics. The meat-works get hold of the bullocks, and at the end of the year duty is always put on furnish to the Government the number of bullocks dealt with, and the hides are included in tliat return. The tanner makes the hides up into leather, and he returns them in his statistics. We have not done with the hides yet. The tanner sells the leather to the boot factory, where it is made up into boots, and the boot manufacturer makes a return to the Government. Taking one part of the bullock, the hide is returned five times-onc e by the primary producer, and four times by the manufacturers, whereas all they are really entitled to return is the value of their work on that hide. See how it swells up the returns and makes them appear altogether ridiculous. It is only a business man who can understand these figures. I shall tell . the House how my attention was drawn to the matter. On one occasion I had to make up the returns for the meat-works of which If the I was manager. When the yearly returns were made up, I checked them and saw that they were right. Within a week or two some returns for a station over which I had a sort of advisory control were sent to me to be forwarded to the Government. On looking over them. I found that nearly all the cattle which were included in the return had been bought by me for the meat works, so that they were returned a second time. It did not end there, because afterwards I had to make up a return for a tannery in which I had a slight interest. Let us be Some of thehides had gone to the tannery, and had to be returned again. That is the advantage of having a business man to take charge of these things, because he really understands them. The same thing occurs with sheepskins. They are returned by the sheep station, then by the meat-works, and next by the fellmonger, who keeps the wool ; the pelts are returned again by the tanner, and afterwards by the saddler. So that one article which originally belonged to the primary producer is returned five times. Wool is returned by the sheep station and the clothing factory, and tallow by the cattle station, the meat-works, and the soap and candle works. Sometimes the product is shipped direct without any 1 change, but where it undergoes manufacture at all, it always passes through three, four, or can primary rock, but the manufacturing absolutely delusive and shrink tremendously. I stake my reputation on this that the manufacturing returns do not represent half what is stated hero. able members will see what a case can be made on behalf of the absolutely greater importance of the primary producers. Next, let us take the relative According to Coghlan, there are in Australia factory hands to the number of 171,107 that is, 1 in S and other workers to the number of is, 7 in 8-making Surely the primary producers ought to have some voice in the making of this Tariff. The question is, should the dog wag the tail, or the tail oscillate the dog ? It is hardly neeessaiy at this time of day for me to say that primary production is the source of all wealth. The capitalist says""You can do absolutely nothing money."" What is it made of? Copper. does it come from ? The bowels of the earth. Whose image and superscription does it bear ? That of a king perhaps, the creature of a day ; but right through it has the stamp of primary production on it. Therefore the primary producer should be specially considered in connection with this Tariff. I must offer ray congratulations to the Government upon a fact that has not yet been referred to during this debate, and that is that the Post-office and Telegraph department enormously increased revenue since the Tariff was laid on the table-that are to judge by the correspondence which I and several of my friends have received. There may have been waggon loads of correspondence sent to honourable members on the Government side of the House in favour of the Government proposals, but we certainly have our doubts. the post litis brought me a letter from the manager of a large and well meat meat wraps. He wrote to me explaining that the bag-makers were up in arms because the Government had put meat wraps on the free list; and he certainly nished a splendid argument why they should be free, which I may use in committee. He said that meat wraps were imported Mr A. Paterson. five hands. Honourable members for a special purpose, and that they were see that all the time the exported within two or three weeks. Thisreturns stand as solid as a I thought a very excellent and conclusive returns are argument, but the same mail also brought, me a letter from two or three bag-makers in. statement, Australia, pointing out the absurdity and. the oppressive effect of the action of theHonorGovernment in imposing a duty of 10 percent, on the calico from which they make their bags, whilst allowing meat wraps to come in free.

America has high exports, low imports, and increasing wealth. are these facts to be explained ? To start with, we must know about the country. for a time in the various countries of Europe knows what a traveller the average American is. standing in business considers it absolutely necessary for his commercial education that he should travel through Europe. They all do it. They do not manage it for nothing. They do not travel second or third class. They travel like princes, and spend their money like dukes. More than that, the American woman gets her dresses from Worth in Paris, or some imitator of Worth. The extravagance of the American woman is notorious. the vast wealth of some of the American heiresses, that many silly-headed women of other countries have been ruined in attempting to copy their example. sums of money are spent by the Americans in their travels, their dress, their residences, and their sports. Only the other day it was cabled all over the world, as an extraordinary fact which was perfectly unprecedented and entirely unexpected, that the wife of the President of America spent only £60 a year upon dress. The Americans were so astonished about the matter that they could Mr A. Paterson, Why1 Benot help telling every one. The newspaper men, who know everything, got hold of it , and considered it so extraordinary that they immediately sent the news flying all Thus, instead of the latter cornerover the world. It must also be remembered that the Americans spend a greatI remember the deal of money in investments. They own newspapers in London, they have invested summer's millions and millions sterling in buying up steam-ship companies; they are in numberThat less commercial businesses, and they are now attempting to compete with English tobacco manufacturers on the latter's own ground. Although these amounts repreThe sent millions and millions sterling they are not sufficient to account for the difference. I will tell honourable members what I believe does account for it. Owing to the American policy of levying duties, it is to the direct interest of every importer to undervalue his imports, and he does that.. That can easily be understood, because it is in accord with human nature. But if we I were to tax exports, what a difference! Thescale would be entirely the other way. I am not speaking without knowledge, because I remember-and no doubt some How Victorian representatives also rememberthe case of a .Flinders-street house 25 years something ago. I saw the police attempt to get into Any one who has lived a warehouse in Flinders-laneI am sure the honourable member for Mernda remembers the occurrence-and I saw a Customs Every American of any officer with blood flowing from his head, he having been knocked down with a bludgeon of some kind. That case disclosed scandalous under-valuations, which had been going on for years, and by which the State of Victoria had been robbed of thousands of pounds. Nobody knows of these things better than the Melbourne merchants; and that is not the only scandal, or the last of the kind. Now, as to the pauperism and distress which are said to It has been so great, owing to exist in England, of which we have heard very harrowing accountsI have noticed that while some of the speakers are from England, a great many others have never been in Incredible that country, and it is astonisliing how much these latter honourable members know about the state of affairs at home. 1 suppose we all agree as to the veracity of the Ago newspaper, and here is an extract from an. article by the London correspondent of that journal, dated the 27th of September lastThere is a curiously large proportion ot London paupers who live well beyond the average span of life. A short time ago half a dozen lively centenarians were counted among them. Perhaps their tenacity is due to the regularity of their habits and the severe simplicity of their food, since doctors say there are virtues in these things. one-seventh of 1 per cent -hol d the And this leads one to fear for the health aud prospects of longevity of a certain male pauper, who, by a strange and amusing chance, is just now the sole inmate of a work-house at Bermondsey, a south-eastern suburb of London. There are no fewer than 28 officials to look after hima master, a matron, a medical officer, two chaplains, and over a score nurses and other attendants ! If he were to take his discharge, the whole staff would be out of employment. It is to their interest to make him entirely at home and contented, but in their zealous anxiety they may overdo it. And the worse of it is, that the old fellow himself seems to over-look this aspect of the case. It was reported at the last meeting of the local board of guardians that he was enjoying the situation immensely. That is the other side of the question as presented by the Age. We will now take the Argus. We have heard some horrible tales about miners' wages at home, but commercial men know what amusing nonsense all these tales are. England was never so prosperous as she is at this moment, and there is not much in the contention that tlie prosperity is due to the war, because there has not been much improvement since hostilities began in South Africa. The extract from the Argus is as follows :At the Berlin Mining Conference in 1894, the Northumberland miners presented the following comparative statement of daily wages paid to miners in different European countries :-Eng land, 6s. to (is. 6d.; Belgium, 2s. Od. to 2s. 8d.; did not consider that a great part of the Prance, 3s. (id.; Austria. 2s. 8d.j Germany, 3s. to 3s. Od -The Times, January, 1896. M. Lamendin, French delegate to the Miners' Congress in Berlin, said on his return :""The English miners were absolutely indifferent to the miseries of the miners on the Continent, because they did not experience them themselves. The economic conditions in England were infinitely better than those affecting the Belgians, the Germans, and the French. In truth, the English could afford to scorn the discussion of the minimum wage question, because they literally dictated their pay themselves.""Standard. Everybody knows that that is the absolute truth. How can any reasonable human being explain the immense immigration of foreigners into London on any other grounds than that better wages are obtained there ? It is utter nonsense to talk about the better wages in any other country. Then as to the comparative wealth of Great Britain and the United States, the honourable member for West Sydney stated that in Great Britain2 per cent, of the population of very rich men hold 66 per cent, of the national wealth. Buti n the United States 0*14 per cent -that is enormous proportion of 58 per cent, of the national wealth. A nice sort of democracy, to he sure ! Is that the example we are going to follow ? And the fact I have stated does not represent the worse. Rockfeller takes the share of nearly 100,000 men, and there are eight or ten men who have not far short of Rockfeller's wealth. The honourable member for West Sydney has the clear perceptive eye to see the unmistakable d r if t of democracy when corrupted by immense aggregations of wealth. What is the use of talking about average wealth anyhow ? If one member of this House owned £742,600, and the rest of us poor mortals had only £100 each, Mr Coghlan, or even the illustrious Michael Mulhall, would make it appear on paper that we were worth £10,000 each. How ridiculous! But I fear that such an argument would not suffice to stave off the services of writs by stupid, unsympathetic tradesmen. This reminds me of a speech which was made in the city of Melbourne by a well-known auctioneer at the height of the land boom. He stood up in a public building in this great city, and said"" Oh, it does not matter whether property is sold at a loss or not; it only passes from one hand to the other."" He money was recklessly spent in bell-toppers, champagne, carriages, and splendid furniture, while much of it also went away into other countries. But I think that auctioneer knows now, and that he will not speak in such a strain again. NowI come to the kernel of the whole question. What is the avowed object of protection ? Isi t not to provide employment and to keep up wages ? Has protection accomplished these objects in this or any other country ?' The poor half-timer cries, from the bitterness, of his soul, "" No"" ; the manufacturer says, "" Yes."" Then what is meant by this fuss about wages boards? The leader of the Opposition has said that wages boards', are the absolute corollary of j>rotection ;and I agree with him. But supposingthe wages boards fail to secure theseends-wha t is the next coronary, I pray It is to strike at the root of the evil astraight, direct blow, and let the nations .take over all those industries which ask for high protection and work them for the common good. That would be a real Com. monwealth, not a sham protected Commonwealth. We could make a very fair start with such glaring monopolies as nails, cement, salt, and perhaps hals. MrA . PATERSON I think starch is out of it this time. I am no revolutionary, and I am opposed on principle to all fiscal protection-indeed , to all protection except that of public health and morals, and purity of race. But if honourable members opposite persist in subsidizing manufacturers unjustlyand illegitimately, and only city manufacturers at that-no t the poor struggling manufacturers in the country-if they persist in doing this at the expense of the masses, I say that it is simple justice that the masses should divide the profits, or share the losses if there are any. That, to me, appears to be an argument conclusivelyandabsolutelyirresistible. It will be said that this idea is visionary and impossible. But I reply that it has been done. France has enjoyed an annual revenue of £12,000,000 of money out of her tobacco monopoly, and I know that Spain for many years enjoyed a very handsome revenue from the same source-thoug h I am afraid she does not enjoy very much now. I think that if this alternative were submitted to these beneficent manufacturers, not in Victoria alone, but throughout the whole of Australia-becaus e they are all "" tarred with the same brush "" ; Victoria is not a bit worse than the New South Welshman, and the New South Wales manufacturer is no better than the Victorian-thei r claims would be speedily reduced to something like equitable dimensions, and we should secure a fairly honest and satisfactory Tariff. Sir LANGDONBONYTHON (South Australia) I do not intend to detain the House more than a few minutes. I propose to follow what I regard as the very excellent example set by the honourable member for Northern Melbourne. I had intended to go somewhat fully into the history and the relative merits of protection and free trade, but I feel that at this stage, after all the speeches which have been made, anything of the kind would be out of place. It -would be the repetition of very much more than a twice-told tale. that has been said and written on this subject, there seems to be. much misconception, and in quarters, too, where one would least expect to find it. The Tariff introduced by the Minister for Trade and Customs has come in for some condemnation, but it should not be forgotten that any Tariff introduced by the leader of the Opposition And starch. would have shared the same fate, with possibly this difference-that the outcry would have been more pronounced, because, as honourable members will admit, it is tlie revenue lines of the present Tariff to which the greatest exception is being taken. The hard fact which cannot be shirked is that the sum of £9,000,000 has to be raised. Sir LANGDONBONYTHON I maybe wrong, but sometimes it appears to me that there are people who actually believe that somehow the leader of the Opposition could raise the money necessary for the Commonwealth and the States without any one having to pay anything. Well, I know that tlie right honourable member is clever -ver y clever indeed-bu t of this I am quite sure, that when he takes £9,000,000, or even £8,000,000, as the honourable'member for Dalley suggests, out of the pockets of the people of the Commonwealth, they will know all about it, and will think no more kindly of him than they do of the Minister for Trade and Customs at the present moment. During the course of the discussion which has taken place we have heard some very admirable speeches. I honestly believe that the debate, both as regards character and tone, is one that would have done credit to any Legislature in the world. But, at the same time, Mr Speaker, I must enter my protest against this perpetual wrangling between New South Wales and Victoria. I am not specially interested in either State, but I am very much interested indeed in the Commonwealth of Australia. There have been many references to prices under protection and under free-trade. I do not for a moment assert that the manufacturer, given a free hand, would extend to his customer too much consideration ; but, at the same time, I fearlessly assert that the importer is not always the embodiment of righteousness. ThatI may illustrate this point is one of the objects for which I have risen. In the year 1885 ploughshares were imported into South Australia to the Buti n spite of all value of £11,288. A duty was imposed, and the imports were reduced until in 1897",59,Smith The N I T Explains The Intention Of Honourable Members
193,Mr Wilks,,62,Smith The N I T Explains The Intention Of Honourable Members
194,Mr Wilks,"£8,000,000 .the total viilue was only £474. But in tlie meantime an industiy had grown up, and the exports of plough shares represented £3,920. In the following year the exports rose to the sum of £7,277, and this amount roughly represents the annual exports since. I can imagine that I hear some one saying, "" Oh, but what did the poor farmer pay for the coddling of this industry."" That is precisely what I want to tell honourable members. Before the duty was imposedand it was a duty of 15 per cent -the farmers paid for cast-iron plough shares of English manufacture 16s. per dozen. From that time until now, there has been a gradual reduction in price going on, until the present price in the Adelaide market is 10s. per doz. But the locally made article is sold for 8s. per dozen. Now, it occurred to me that when I made this statement some gentleman from the other side of the House, in perfect friendliness, might say, "" That is your statement of the case; but had we some one who knew something of the other side, he might put it differently."" Under these circumstances I telegraphed to Mr William Copley, one of the most respected and best known farmers in South Australia. Mr Copley is at the present time a member of the House of Assembly, and has twice been a Minister of the Crown. This is the reply I received from himHave just received you r wire aski ng for some parSouth Wales or Victoria. I desire also toticulars re South Australian plough shares. Speaking from my own experience, they now give general satisfaction, more especially the cast shares. I have used them about sixteen years. For the first three or four years the chilling was not as well done as in the imported, but now they are quite equal, and thepvieeisOs. perdozen retail as against 14s., the price of the imported a few years ago. Of course the importers say the price would have gone down without local competition, but I venture to doubt that. At any rate I know what the prices were ancl what they are now. This letter was written from Parliament House, Adelaide, and Mr Copley adds in a foot-noteI have just spoken to Mr Cummins, one of the members for Stanley. He and his brother are large farmersHe quite agrees with my favorable opinion of the local manufacture. Sir LANGD ON BONYTHON referred to this matter in order to show that the imposition of a duty on a farming implement does not necessarily mean adding to the cost of agriculture. I cannot say that I am personally very pleased with the Tariff. I am not sure that it is equitable, 19 P and I shall reserve to myself the right to endeavour to amend it in committee, so that it may be improved as much as possible. It appears to me that it is too burdensome as regards the working classes; and I shall be glad to see such an arrangement of duties as will put the producer in the best possible position. A t the same time. I realize that the Treasurer must have the money required by the Commonwealth and the States, and therefore there is no use in putting duties on articles that are not of general consumption. There is, Mr Speaker, an epigram which seems to me to have some sort of"" application to the present occasion, and it might inspire certain gentlemen to accept"" the inevitable in connection with this Tariff. The epigram was written by Horace Smithnot Sydney Smith, nor even Bruce Smith, but still a veiy distinguished member of the famous family. This is what the epigram says, and I am sure when the Honourable the Minister for Trade and Customs hears it he will commend it to the serious consideration of the members of the OppositionLet this plain truth those ingrates strike Who still, the' bless'd, new blessings crave ; That we may all have what we like, Simply by liking what we have. MrO ' MALLEY (Tasmania) First of all, I desire to apologize to this House because I am not going to speak of New apologize because I shall not attempt tonight to take up the time of honourable* members by giving them either Mulhall or Coghlan, or any other statistical gentleman. It does seem to me that it is a good thing"" that the right honourable the leader of the Opposition moved this motion of no confidence. Certainly there have been somegreat speeches made here, speeches, in my opinion, equal to any I ever heard? in Europe or AmericaI could not say better. I want to say, furthermore, that I am somewhat jealous of the leader of the Opposition. I was told when I came here that I should have a monopoly of the humour of the House, but I find I am not even a little flickering light alongside of this great electrical lamp. However, I will I have say this, tliat I regard the right honourable gentleman as the Daniel Webster of Australia, and when a man born on the American Continent says that, he says all.

I have got sick of these political Misters Facing-bothWays. Let us excommunicate them, and let us know where we are in Australia. There is, unfortunately, too much readiness to jump over any stone wall or any hedge or ditch if one can only get a vote. I want to say that I stand in a different position to-night from almost any other honourable member for Tasmania. I am a protectionist, and I intend to show honourable members why I regret tliat the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr Cameron, is not here, because when I say anything of a man, I want to say it to his face.

MrO ' MALLEY would not have mentioned this matter but for the fact that the honourable member repudiated the other night the statement made by me that he had reached this House on my surplus vote. There can be no doubt on that point. We have the Hare-Clarke system of voting in Tasmania. I went before the country as an out-and-out protectionist, and the honourable member for Tasmania, Sir Edward Braddon, fought the campaign as au out-and-out free-trader. He was first on tlie poll and I was second. But for the fact that the elements joined hands with the fossildom of Tasmania, inasmuch as it rained all day on the West Coast, I should have been at the top of the poll. I desire to quote from one of the speeches that I made in Tasmania, because the right honourable member for Tasmania, Sir Edward Braddon, stated the other evening that mine was the parish-pump policy. As a matter of fact I am really the only member of the House who did not preach the policy of the. parish-pump, because I had not lived long enough in Tasmania to know where the pump was to be found. One has to reside some time in a district before he becomes proficient in building culverts, plucking roosters, and chasing snakes. This is what I said, and I want to call particular attention to it We must inaugurate pure economic legislation and administration, establishing a profound respect for the people. I cannot see to read the speech, Mr Speaker, and I ask you to allow me to light a candle. ber must not read his speech. MrO ' MALLEY I want to quote from that speech.

Mr O'MALLEY -The difference is this, Mr Speaker, that the electric light represents protection and this candle represents free-trade. I will put it out. It is going out to-night. In the speech to which I refer, I said that I was going to the country as a protectionist. I went to tlie country as a protectionist, and the people sent me here. The question we have to determine is not what England has done, nor what America has done. I regret I withdraw it, sir.

We have been discussing for the last two and a half weeks what people are doing in every other part of the world, but not showing why we should adopt their schemes or plans. For the few minutes during which I shall occupy the attention of the House to-night I shall endeavour to talk of what will suit the people of the Commonwealth. A few years ago Australia consisted of a few segregated, wrangling, political entities. To-day it is a nation far larger than was America when she started on her own career. The difference is that the Americans were plucky men. They had gone through a seven years' war against the greatest nation in the world, and had come oat triumphant.

198,Mr Speaker,"The honourable membeard a great dearabout the riches of England. I will admit that there are riches there, but I am sorry to say they consist of aggregated riches, such as we find in India, and not average riches. I know something about England; perhaps I know more about it than any other honourable member, because when I was there I studied the conditions of the people. Two hours a day were sufficient for my business, and I spent the rest of the day with the suffering, trampled upon, hard-up people, studying how they made their riving. I saw misery there and I saw misery in New York. I regret that the misery went to New York from England, from Germany and the Netherlands, and from all those countries where the people had been under the heel of tyranny for a thousand years. There is another matter which I cannot understand. Por years the people had read about the accursed corruption and accursed protection in America. They knew all about it in England. far and near. Every man one met in England told him about tlie corruption in America, about the rottenness of tlie country, and the rottenness of protection! Yet every ship that left England was laden down with Britishers sailing to that accursed country, packing Castle Garden like bees in a hive. Five millions of Britishers live to-day under the accursed American flag, and bless and praise that accursed American protection. Three millions more lie planted in the American soil. They all cleared out from Great Britain in order to get away from the blessedness of free-trade to the accursedness of protection.

Mr O'MALLEY -That is what I am doing here. Thank God, I was able to pay my fare out here, and I am able to pay it back again. I am as independent as a Rocky Mountains grizzly bear on roller-skates. I am not here as an abject slave. But let me return to the question of why people are leaving England. Why do they leave the blessed free-trade? Why do they go to America? They never go back until they 19 P 2 return to live in castles, like Andrew Carnegie. When they return to England they live in palaces aud beautiful homes. I will admi t that there are grand palaces in England, magnificent universities, lovely homes, and everything that one could possibly wish for. But that is only one side of the picture. What about the hovels there? What about the wretched people who walk bare-footed down the Strandi n winter? What about the people living around Whitechapel ? I have studied some of the conditions of the people of England. But for the regrettable fact that so much has been said about this matter I should not have referred to it . I want to talk of the primary producer. What an interest my honourable friends opposite have shown in tlie primary producer. Sir John Macdonald, formerly Prime Minister of Canada, was for years an out-andout free-trader, and it does seem to me that a little common experience gained by obserEvery newspaper spread it vation, investigation, and calculation is nearly as good as anything one can read in a newspaper. This is what I have known to occur in Canada. The honourable member for Capricornia asked why we should take Canada for a pattern. He said that the trade of Canada was only some few odd millions per annum, and that New South Wales did more than half that amount of trade. Is that a fair comparison, when the Canadian people have had the run of the Dominion for the last 30 odd years, and its internal trade is something enormous, and when the whole of the traffic of New South Wales, with Victoria, Western Australia, Tasmania, and Queensland is bulked in as foreign trade ? It is, however, as fair as I could expect under the circumstances, because my honorablefriendsoppositearefightinga desperate battle. I think a world of them, but I tell you, sir, that we are going to plant them toI am hereto-night to night. Let me say something about Canada. Sir John Macdonald was an absolute free-trader. He said he believed in Cobden and Bright; I heard him say so 50 times. But when 1,300,000 born Canadians, of whom I was one, went over to live in the States, and became producers, and we sent our manufactured products back to our own people in Canada, he began to think, and, in 1878, he s a i d "" I am going to try protection, though I do not believe in it . "" He tried it, and what is the result ? Today, we have the Massey-Harris reaper in Australia. They never made a reaper in",64,Smith The N I T Explains The Intention Of Honourable Members

When your country is free trade you have nothing to offer to others ; they have your markets. They step in, and sell you what they cannot sell anywhere else, because the competition is so terrific. Any rubbish which was left in the States we used to send over to Canada. ' The people of a free-trade country nothing more or less than primary producers, and the consumers of the products of a more intelligent race. According to my honourable friends opposite, if free-trade should become the policy of which they say it will, but which it will not do to-night, the clothes of the people will never wax old ! They will never get shiny at the elbows or the knees. If this free-trade is what honourable members say it is going to be, the boots of the people will never wear out, but will grow on them, as they did on the children of Israel in the wilderness. a mother buys a little dress for a baby, and puts it. on her, and places her in the perambulator, the baby will grow up a young woman with the dress on her back. I do not know where free-trade is going to end, or what it is going to do. It has cursed every country I have ever known of. A few years ago there was a great war in the United States. Before that war the North was for free-trade, and the South for protection. The Southhadtheprimary there owned the niggers and the plantations. They produced raw materials, and they said -""Now, They sent to England, and to the northern States, and opened factories in the southern States, but as soon as ever the Englishmen and the northern men went down amongst the colored people they began to teach them the spirit of liberty. They free ; why should you be their slaves ?"" As soon as ever the southern people found out that there was going to be a moral resurrection, and a they at once closed the mills, and sent away the artisans, put their niggers back on the plantations, and then became revenue tariffists. My honourable friends cannot even claim tlie honour of having Mr0 Motley. invented the expression "" revenue tariffist,"" because it came from the slave masters of We the southern States. Mr F. E. McLEAN It is very much older than that. They Mr O'MALLEY -Wher e did it come from ? of Commonsi n 18*28, and again in 1835. Mr O'MALLEY -Let my honourable and learned friend show me one speech made in 1828 in which the expression "" revenue tariffist"" was used. He is labouring under a delusion. In the history of the House of Commons there become is not one record of the use of the expression "" revenue tariffist."" It was first used by a slave-master of South CarolinaJohn C. Calhoun, the great nullifier, and when he became a great free-trader Daniel Australia, Webster, of the north, became a protectionist. The factories were shifted to the north, and then by every stream, everv little highway, every waterway, a factory village sprang up. So, when the rebellion broke out, the southern people had no artisans. They had the primary producers, what my honourable friends want in AusWhen tralia to-day. They liad the coloured gentlemen who raised the cotton, but they had no artisans. When the first few battles had been fought, and they found that they required to have factories and mills, they could not get artisans to manufacture anything for them. But every stream in the north, every spindle that turned, every wheel that revolved, was one of the soldiers of the army of tlie Lord, to put down that rebellion. And yet, industries. The people having that experience to go by and to guide them are my honourable friends going to have nothing but primary producers in we shall start our own factories."" Australia? I have the profoundest reverence for the primary producer. I am a primary producer myself. My honourable friends for whom I have the greatest respect have spoken of the Australian primary producer in wails and lamentations. They have told said-""Get us of the wrongs we are inflicting on the primary producer. In fact they have demonstrated conclusively that the Australian is unfit for any calling which requires inpolitical insurrection, tense application, genius, or talent. I cannot get away from that. I am judging my honourable friends on their own declarations, and I cannot separate the sin from the opposite sinner on this occasion. I want to confine them strictly to this primary production.",65,Smith The N I T Explains The Intention Of Honourable Members
201,Mr Conboy,"It was used in tlie HouseIsi t possible that this great Commonwealth, teeming with the boundless resources of nature, is capable of affording no other sustenance to the human family than the milk from her own sad breast. The whole idea has been founded on the presumption that all her people, like aboriginals, served by women in bondage, are for ever to vegetate on potatoes, turnips, and cabbages. Is the great Anglo-Saxon-Celtic race transplanted in the Southern Seas, to fall to the rear of the rest of the world. Are we, although coming from the old original stock, and cousins of the American people, willingly to allow ourselves to be outstripped in the arts and in enterprise by our own relations ? It seems to be thought that the people of Australia turned their backs upon the old world only to become abject slaves in tlie new world. According to the declarations of my honourable friends opposite, Australians were simply created and endowed to perspire in the open fields, and to produce the raw materials, so that a more refined, delicate, and cultured race might return manufactured products, wrung in agony from tlieir own human slaves, and then draw away the earnings of the workers, to rest in foreign pockets. They speak as though Australia were not an Empirea world in itself. I am already proud to be a member of this House; although I only missed the presidency of the United States by 30 feetI was born on the wrong side of the border-in Canada. Honourable members talk as though Australians did not possess sufficient genius and skill to make progress in manufacturing not only the necessaries of life, but also the luxuries that may be required by her people. I have no such idea. Honourable members talk as though from the moment they crossed the mighty ocean from the north to the south, they were doomed to industrial and inventive death. They speak as though inventive genius were native only in foreign nations. If I could agree with them, I should have to come to the conclusion that the Australian people could only become a dependent industrial tail to foreign nations. people who have not got genius and art in their souls are only fit to be slaves, and the people who produce only the raw materials, and hand them over to others to add many values to them by the application of skill and science, can never hope to claim equality with those nations that make progress in all the arts and sciences. Are Australian people to be simply beggars upon foreign art ? Free-trade, to me, means simply the essence of international industrial cannibalism, because it allows t':c strong to eat up the weak. Free-trade means that the whole of the Australian Commonwealth should be an open field for foreign commercial buccaneers and freebooters to exploit as they choose, disregardful of the interests of Australian manufacturers. The principle on which free-trade rests, and the spirit which actuates it, are identical with the principle underlying the reign of anarchy, because that spirit involves the complete elimination of law. The hawk wants no protection on the chickens; the crow wants no protection on the cattle when they are bogged in the quicksands, but he wants to pluck out their eyes in the same way as the foreign manufacturer would pluck out the eyes of the local producer. The wolf wants no protection on the sheep, but the shepherd does. The snake that crawled over the garden wall of Eden wanted no protection. The mother who nurses the child in the cradle, and then watches him grow up year by year, until he reaches manhood, does not then throw him like a pup into the stream and let him sink or swim, but she sticks to him. on h i m ! Mr O'MALLEY -Sh e puts leeches on him if he is suffering from pleurisy, and the honourable member was leeched by his mother many a time ! The free-traders say that we should throw our industrial pups into the stream, but the great speech made by the honourable and learned member for In di absolutely squelched them! His speech was like an avalanche on the eastern peaks of the Rockies. It came down upon honourable members opposite with such crushing force that they have not recovered from it yet. I sympathize with my honourable friends, because they are fighting a losing cause, and it requires more courage to suffer defeat and fight again, than to return The to the conflict after victory. speaking feelingly.

An not foreign! MrO ' MALLEY the conditions of Australia are concerned. What is good for England is not good for us. A few moments ago, the honourable member for Capricornia said that in New. South Wales they eat so many more pounds of meat a year than they do in Victoria. But meat-eaters never yet thought out anything for the world. In Scotland, where they eat "" parritch,"" they have given the world the best thought it has ever had ; and next to Scotland come the rock-ribbed hills of New England, where the snow lies on tlie ground for six months at a time. AVhen the Scotchman lives in his own country, and has to think to get his food, he becomes a great thinker and inventor; but when he leaves his country, and makes plenty of boodle, he begins to live on meat, and does not think any more. Therefore, I do not consider the statistics in regard to meateating worth anything. If people did with half tlie eating tliat goes on, it would be better for them. themselves into the gripes. members all know that it does not require a great amount of ability to be a destructive critic, but it requires a mighty amount of ability to be a constructive philosopher. I remember once seeing a mule in Texasand everybody knows that a mule is a hybrid, with no pride of ancestry or hope of posterity-kic k a crockery shop down in about twenty minutes ; but if you started him to make a cup and saucer he could not do it if he lived 50 years. I have tlie greatest sympathy for my friends opposite, and I want to tell them the truth. ago I was travelling through the country, and I came to a place where there was an old sign-board pointing to an abandoned, scrab-infested paddock, but the direction of the road had been changed. Thousands of people went along the road and left tlie sign-board unchanged, and so for 50 years it diligently directed the attention of heedless travellers to the scrub infested paddock, swearing tliat the road still led that way. I said to myself when I saw it , "" That is the free-trade party of Australia."" They do not know that the times have changed, and they never will know, because they have lost their hearing, and have become blind. I remember that on another occasion I came to a place where there had formerly had been burnt down, with the exception of It is foreign so far as three chimneys, which stood there, monuments of the the terrible disaster that had occurred. But the sign-board at the roadside was untouched, and it said, "" Entertainment for man and beast."" It kept on saying that, although there had not been a man entertained in the hotel for 40 years past. The birds perched upon that board and sang in the summer time, the wind whistled round it in the winter, but it still stuck to its tale"" Entertainment for man and beast."" I said again to myself, "" That is the free-trade party of Australia."" I regret that they are living in tlie past ages. They are children of darkness, but they do not know it . The members of that party in this House are as nice, refined, and cultured gentlemen as I have ever met, and I think highly of them. It is said that on one occasion a darkness overspread Egypt that was so thick that you could feel it , and they had a bottle of that darkness in Rome for 500 years. But Nowadays, they eat if the Egyptian darkness was so thick that Honourable you could feel it, the darkness which overspreads my friends opposite is so thick that you could eat it . In every department of economic research we find men of great intellectual endowments and loud pretensions who get notions, or theories, or some kind of wavy idea that is floating in the air into their heads, which they baptize with the name of science, and, mounting their hobby, they ride it furiously to death. True science is, undoubtedly, something to be proud of. AVe know that in every countiy there are people who are always looking for something striking. Our friends A few years opposite believe that in free-trade they have the hope of the philosopher's stone, which will turn the mallee scrub and sage bush into wealth and gold. AVhat a charming and beautiful theory! The beauty of it lies in this, that it requires no verification. Buti t is a one-legged truth, and has never yet budged an inch, norever will. All the same it is very captivating, and we see our friends waltzing round it, singing hymns of satisfaction. AVe see them doing homage to it as to a thing of mystic import. They see their goddess, tlieir Venus, lying dead, and they know that her copper-coloured bosom will never heave with love again, but they refuse to believe it . All over the world their musty covered mummies are still waiting for the commercial resurrection promised by their prophets. But instead of blessing them, they will turn round and curse them. England became a free-trade nation for self-protection and self-preservation. She thought that after her 200 years of protection, having lent money to the whole world, and made it her debtor, she was strong enough to proclaim herself a free trader. The great Adam Smith got a comfortable situation in a Glagow Custom-house, and he preached free-trade to the world. The doctrine went forth everywhere. But the nations found that a man behind an entrenchment, with cannons and maxims well mounted, can keep 100 or 500 at bay, as the Boers have done during the present war. So one nation after another began to adopt a policy of protection. Honourable members hear a lot aboutthe corn laws of England, but the abolition of the corn laws was another act of self-protection. England preaches free trade to the world, but believes in protection if she could adopt it . I have the greatest possible regard for my friends opposite. To me, metaphorically speaking, they are the blind bats of fiscalism, sitting on the withered limb of the ring-barked, dying, free-trade tree. Yet, how heroically they exhibit their onelegged economic deformity. They stand up and fight nobly for a dying cause. But let me tell them that free-trade was born in the Utopian imagination of the closet, the birthplace of millions of theatrical delusions, many of which die in pi-emature birth, whilst numerous others drive people to destruction. It was then transferred from closet to closet, and there it was elaborated and re-elaborated by the brains of eveiy succeeding theorist without the slightest knowledge of the practical application of these pernicious theories to the common affairs of the world. Like hothouse plants, when exposed to the rude action of the changing seasons, they perish. ber refer to protectionist manufactures'!

But I want, however, to take that infamous shadow out of the hearts of honourable members opposite. It has got them bad. Following up the cause of this theory of free-trade and its effect, I shall take another point, and then I shall close.

210,Mr Sydney Smith,"What did Sir Philiphow to manufacture. They are putting in the best and most improved machinery. Let us assume that three of these Japanese can manufacture as much as can two Australians, and that 5,000 Japanese are employed in one factory and 3,000 Australians in another. Let us further suppose that the Australians are paid £ 2 a week. If we calculate the wages thus paid to the Australians as against those paid to the Japanese, we shall find that there is a vast .difference between the cost of the production be produced and sold in the States; and we, by the two races. I ask how the Australian manufacturer can keep his factory going .and compete successfully with the Japanese? What are prices based upon 1 The price of .a commodity is the cost of the labour which produces it . Mr O'MALLEY -The cost of the raw .material is always added. If my honourable friend has studied Adam Smith, Walker, Riccardo, and other economists, he will know that they tell us that the raw material must be present before we can manufacture anything. Nothing made out of nothing is a very small quantity. If we destroyed every factory in Australia, and turned the operatives into the streets, would they go over to Tasmania and buy stations'! Would they go to Camperdown and buy .stations ? No. They would put their swags on their backs and "" strike out"" for the primary producers, where there are already, possibly, 50 or 60 people waiting for employment. Such a course would simply .enable the manufacturers in connection with primary productions, to bid for labour, and Australia would be reduced to what the .Southern States of America were before the wara population of masters and servants. toria now that servant girls cannot be obtained, because, as it is said, all the girls are employed in the factories. As a. working man, and belonging to working people, I do not want to see the number of women in factories increased. We do not want to see the women of Victoria thrown out on the streets, yet day after day we .hear honourable members talking about shutting up factories which do not pay. Are we prepared to find husbands for the women who will be thrown out of employment ? If we shut up the factories, and let the foreigner send his goods here, we will not increase the wealth of our workmen, but will simply lay them open to competition, dividing wages amongst the many. The people have to live, and they cannot live on the wealthy, who will instruct their lodge-keepers to keep them out. primary producers. Mr O'MALLEY -Exactly. I have had experience of factory life in America. The factory in which I worked was closed, because British manufacturers were able to sell goods more cheaply than the goods could who were thrown out of work, started west. We got into Colorado, where we had to take what work we could get, and I worked for 3s. 6d. a day, displacing a good man who had been getting 8s. a day. When we got into Texas, we"" found a free-trade speaker, and ducked him in the river. Free-trade is not the policy for the Commonwealth of Australia, and I cannot understand how honourable members can conscientiously advocate it . I believe in protection, because it means the protection of Australian labour. Protection will diversify Australian industries, and the diversification of Australian industries will mean that every portion of the human brain will be developed. If all the people of Australia were engaged in one calling, however important that calling might be, we should have a stupid people. If all in Australia were agriculturalists or pastoralists, we should have a solemnly stupid, and a stupidly solemn people. If our industries are diversified, as in America, we shall have inventors and thinkers, and there will be produced better and brainier men, better looking women, and healthier children. Today, if all the boots which are made in Australia, and in the making of which hundreds There are complaints in Vicof people are employed, were imported, where should we find employment for the people now engaged in the trade 1 Freedom lies in the winning of the great battle for the rights of labour-in the protection of commercial values, and in the enjoyment and individual control of the values created by the people. Every attempt to establish free-trade in Australia is, in my opinion, another breach in the rampart of freedom. Freedom is not license to allow the world to come and prey upon our people ; but it means the complete enjoyment of the commercial values here created. W it h the exception of Buskin's works, there is not one proper or true book on political economy in the world",69,Honokable Membeij Englan D Is Been An Hotel And Stable But Everything

212,Mr Mccoll,"They will come to theto-day; all the others deal with mercantile economy, and the axiom"" Buy in the cheapest market and sell in the dearest."" That is the cruellest, damnable doctrine ever preached. crushes and cripples all who are weak, and allows the strong to do as they like. In my opinion, freedom of trade is unrestricted license to strong commercial bullies to despoil the industrial Australian maiden. MrM c DONA LD (Kennedy) I had expected that the honorable member who has just spoken, would have attempted to show some connection between his speech and the condition of the working classes, or the conmay be circumstances which enable the ditions which protection are likely to bring about for the benefit of working men in general. I am reminded of a little incident that occurred, where two men had a very strong argument as to whether it was better to live under a free-trade flag or a protectionist flag. After they had very nearly come to blows, they thought it would be a wise thing to ask their third mate what his views were. ""Well,"" said the mate, "" I have worked in a free-trade country, and I have worked in a protectionist country, and whether under free-trade or protection, I have had to work mighty hard for the few shillings I That just about sums up the whole question of free-trade and protection. What is the good of telling us about the deplorable condition of the working classes in England? Do we not know that the same kind of thing exists in America today 1 Does the honourable member mean to tell me that either free-trade or protection has anything to do with the condition of the working classes 1 I listened patiently for nearly three weeks to t r y and get some information which would show that either fiscal policy materially affects the condition under which the Working classes live. But, as a matter of fact, whether we go to a free-trade or a protectionist country, we find that competition for the right to work and earn sufficient wages to live is becoming more difficult. We are living to-day under a system hy which we produce for profit and not for use. The consequence is, that whether in free-trade England or in j)rotectionist America, 77 per cent, of the workmen who reach the age of 65 have to seek pauper relief. That is a fact which is stated by every statistician of importance in every community. No doubt are based on there have been some eloquent and able speeches delivered in tlie course of this debate. I naturally thought that some of most vicious, and most those who take such a strong and earnest It interest in the questions involved would have given us information to show the connection between the fiscal policy they advocate and the condition of the working classes. But, as a matter of fact, not one honourable member on either side has shown that connection. I am prepared to admit-thoug h I have not gone into the matter sufficiently to discover it for myself with any degree of satisfaction-that there working classes to benefit from free-trade conditions in certain countries, or from protectionist conditions in other countries. But let me say this-and I say it not only to honourable members who are present, but with the wish that it may go forth to the workers of Victoria and New South Wales -that people who work for their living have very little hope in regard to improving their condition from either the one policy or the other. There are other economic causes outside of fiscal laws that affect the condition of the working classes. I have just said that we are living got every week,"" under a system by which we produce for profit and not for use. We are also living under a sj'stem in which the means of production are greatly in excess of the demand for commodities. The honourable member for Darling pointed out the other day that under our factory system, and owing to the introduction of machinery, we have been enabled to socialize our production and to produce so rapidly and in such a perfect manner that I suppose it ma)' be said that goods can be turned out at almost a minimum of cost. But the moment we begin to exchange our commodities our social system fails. Every one who has had anything to do with commercial life knows that as soon as one particular line in an industry has had a run, the whole of the manufacturers in that industry start to produce it at an enormous rate. The result is that we have over-production, whilst at the same timethereare thousands of men, women, and children going hungry and in want of food, clothing, shelter, and all other necessaries of life. It is an extraordinary thing that the very moment our factories are producing in excess of the requirements we are precipitated into the midst of a crisis, and. that is the very moment when thousands and thousands of people are thrown out of employment, and misery and destitution reign throughout the country. conditions deeper consideration than has been given to them during this debate on free-trade and protection. subject thoroughly as far as I was able, but I am not going to waste the time of the House in a way that a number of other honourable members have done. I say tliat with all due respect to them ; but I certainly think that a great number of tlie speeches that have been delivered could have been condensed into something like one-third of the time taken. Having said so much, I will just touch upon one or two matters of importance to which I think attention should be directed. question of direct taxation, which has been brought forward by tlie honourable member for Barrier. I am in thorough with that proposal. have some system which will get at those people who are best able to bear a fair share of the obligations tlie State lays upon its citizens. Something like 80 or 85 per cent, of taxation through the Customs falls upon the working classes. That is a state of affairs that ought not to exist, but which is maintained by the conditions of our society. Under the Tariff of the Government, the wealthier classes will not pay their fair share of taxation. the duties will fall evenly upon all consumers. be equal as far as the payment of taxes is concerned, but one class of those who pay the taxes receive no benefit from them, whilst the wealthier classes or those who have tlie control of the means of production, reap the advantage of an unearned increment which they have done nothing to create. It should be the duty of this Parliament to introduce such legislation as will break down the monopoly enjoyedat present by these controllers of the means of tion. to be broken down is that in connection with large agricultural Take in Queensland the magnificent country represented by the honourable member for Darling Downs. There will be found some pf the finest agricultural country that exists in any part of Australia, and what is it used for at the present time ? Hund reds of thousands of acres there were handed over at a nominal sum originally of about half-a-crown an acre. It is country upon which people from all These economic parts of Australia would be glad to settle, require more weighty and but they cannot settle upon tliat magnificent countiy simply because it is locked up in the possession of huge landed proprietors. I say I had intended to go into the that if it was.only for the puipose of breaking up these huge landed estates, it would be a good thing for the Government to introduce some form of land taxation. I do not say that a land tax should be the only form of direct taxation. I think that other forms should be included, such as an income tax, a property tax, and an absentee tax. By that means, we should get at the people best able to bear taxation, and the masses of the people would in that way be to some extent reThere is the lieved of its burdens. Under existing circumstances, however, while I am entirely in accord with the amendment proposed by sympathy the honourable member for the Barrier, I I think we should should like to suggest to -him the advisof direct taxation ability of withdrawing it . There seems to have been a fight between the two parties, in the House, the free-traders and the protectionists. If they like to wrangle and fight it is their own business, and we have no cause to complain, but under the circumstances I think the honourable member for the Barrier would be wise in withdrawing his amendment so as to permit of a clear-cut issue being decided upon the motion moved by the right honourable It will be argued that gentleman who leads the Opposition. If , however, the honourable member persists But that is not so. AU may with his amendment I shall support him if he takes it to a division. There are one or two other matters on which I should like to touch. The Treasurer referred to Tasmania and Queensland as two States likely to be deprived of a certain amount of revenue, owing to the reduction of taxation upon certain articles. The people of Queensland will have less drawn from them by way of customs duties to the extent of some £ 2 0 7 , 0 0 0 ; and in Tasmania the revenue producderived from customs duties will be less by One of tlie first monopolies some £135,000. I point out, however, tliat the people of Queensland will not estates. be a bit worse off under this Tariff, because this amount of £207,000 will be still left in their pockets. Queensland is actually losing nothing under the Tariff, but I admit that it may be necessary for the State Government to make some other arrangements to secure that £207,000 of revenue.",70,Honokable Membeij Englan D Is Been An Hotel And Stable But Everything
213,Mr Mcdonald.,"Still, I do not think it is going to affect Queensland, which, in my opinion, is one of the richest Statesi n the group. The time is not far distant when she will have a population, if not equal to that of New South Wales or Victoria, then very nearly equal to it . The possibilities of Queensland are, I believe, greater than those of any of the other States. She has an enormous amount of territory as yet practically untapped. She has some of the finest grazing land in any part of the world, and she has an enormous extent of agricultural land unsurpassed in any of the other Australian States. Then the mineral resources of the northern portion of Queensland are far above those of any of the other States, with the exception, perhaps, of Western Australia. In view of these advantages, I do not think there is any cause for the Treasurer, or any one else, to surmise that Queensland, in not getting this £207,000, is going to be landed in utter ruin. Last year she had a deficit of about £500,000, and the Treasurer looked upon it as of so little importance that he would not even propose any substantial additional taxation. Treasury bills to meet it 1 MrM c DONALD admit that, but what I want to say is, that he has never looked upon it with any great alarm, or supposed that tlie State is going to be ruined because he requires to issue those Treasury bills. Most of the States have, at some time or another, had to adopt a similar course. One regrettable course I think he has taken, and that is, the selling of land to redeem those Treasury bills. That, I think, is one of the most regrettable courses that any Government could follow, and I hope the wisdom of the people of Queensland will be sufficient to make the Government realize that it is not a wise thing to sell land for that or any other purpose. I repeat that I do not think that Queensland is going to be inconvenienced to an}' great extent by this Tariff, and though some people there may believe that some mild form of disaster may follow from other causes, personally I do not think that any disaster is likely to take place. So far as the Tariff is concerned, I think the Government, in framing their proposals, might have had some more consideration for the various primary industries of the States. I am not going to dilate upon the farming industiy, as I leave that to those who are interested. The honourable member for Barrier spoke this afternoon in connection with the mining industiy, and the people occupying the portion of Queensland I represent are wrapped up to a large extent in the mining industry as well as in the pastoral industry. I think the Government might take into consideration the desirability of reducing the heavy duties levied upon mining machiner)-. I shall not deal with that any further, because the honourable member for Barrier made a very good speech on that subject this afternoon. I think that fuse and explosives used in connection with the mining industiy should be placed upon the free list, and when the Tariff gets into committee, as I presume it will during the coming week, I shall move in that direction, if I get an opportunity. There is a duty imposed also upon shears, cutters, and combs used in connection with the pastoral industry. These are things which cannot be made in Australia, and I believe that no firm will come to Australia to make them. I am led to believe that the manufacture of cutters and combs used in connection with sheep-shearing machines could he not floating not well be conducted here, or only at such an enormous expense tliat it would not pay I am prepared to any company to undertake that particular industry in Australia. Seeing tliat these articles cannot be made in the countiy, I think they should be placed upon the free list. It must be remembered that the men who have to work with these particular tools are compelled to pay for them, and in placing a duty upon them we are putting a direct tax upon the labourer himself. I do not propose to detain honourable members further. I should like to have had a better opportunity of dealing with this question from an economic stand-point, but I feel that I would not be doing justice to the House nor to myself if I were to attempt to do so at this late Stage of the debate. I desire to impress upon the two great leaders of the opposing parties in this House that when next a debate of this kind occurs they should make some effort to indicate what the rival policies of free-trade and protection have done to improve the economic con-' ditions of the working classes. Within the last few months I have had an opportunity of going through the slums of Melbourne. I saw there some of the-greatest misery that one could look upon. I have had also an opportunity of going through tlie slums of S)*dney, where I saw exactly the same",72,Honokable Membeij Englan D Is Been An Hotel And Stable But Everything
214,Sir George Turner,"Isunhappy condition of affairs. In free-trade and protectionist countries alike the conditions of society will breed criminals and prostitutes, millionaires and paupers, and misery, want, and destitution on every side. This is no fanciful picture. Every one knows tliat what I say is correct. These conditions occur both in free-trade and protectionist countries, and to those who study the economic conditions of society that fact should afford sufficient evidence that there must be some cause other than free-trade or protection responsible for such a condition of affairs. Mv. SALMON (Laanecoorie) -It has been the custom for honourable members, after addressing themselves to this question at length, to conclude with an intimation that they desire the debate to close as soon as possible. I intend to commence with that intimation. I shall endeavour to do what I think other members might well have attempted, and that is to show some consideration for others by making my remarks as brief as possible. need not assume the r61e of the doubting Thomas. I am prepared to be judged entirely by results. I feel that this debate, interminable as it seems, is not without its good features. I do not believe that a single vote has been gained on either side by the speeches which have been delivered. But a vast amount of education has been afforded the public generally, as well as to some honourable members-mysel f among the number-by the efforts of those who have made themselves conversant with the effects of the two fiscal expedients, known by the names of free-trade and protection. I feel that every honourable member has been actuated by a desire to do his best for the Commonwealth at the inception of its career. Therefore the remarks I have to make will not, I trust, be regarded as carping criticism, but rather as an indication of the feelings I entertain in respect to these most important matters. A t the outset, I wish to state that I had the privilege of hearing the Prime Minister deliver his speech at Maitland. The pledge which he gave then has been fulfilled to the uttermost. I do not concern myself with the twisting and torturings to which his words have been subjected. I have regard only to the impression which the speech conveyed to me, as one of the vast audience present on that occasion, and I say honestly that, in my opinion, the Tariff brought down by the Government fulfils exactly the promise then made by the Prime Minister on behalf of the Government. Whether the Tariff will suit the several States or not is a matter which the members representing those States must determine. They must be regarded as the best judges. So far as Victoria is concerned, I feel that if there are any shortcomings in the performance which the speech promised, they are in the direction of a failure to carry out altogether the promise of protection to industries already established. In his Maitland speech, the Prime Minister made clear the attitude which he intended to adopt with respect to revenue. He told us that revenue would be a primary consideration. He promised the people of Australia that, in obtaining that revenue, there would be no disastrous interference on the part of the Government with any industry which had been established, and that at the same time opportunities would be given for the establishment of other industries within the Commonwealth. If there is to be any doubt at all in regard to the fulfilment of the promise then made, it will be in the direction I have indicated. I have studied the Tariff carefully. As a member of the State Parliament of VictoriaI had experience of Tariff revision in 1895. In their wildest moments those who then called themselves Tariff reformers could not have anticipated such marked reductions upon the Victorian Tariff as those now proposed by the Federal Government. I make that statement from my own personal experience. I was one of those who considered at the time that as Victoria was a State with artificial boundaries erected against other States on the same continent, inhabited by people speaking the same language and living under the same system ! of government, the duties which we were imposing were too high. was for 25 per cent, duties. Smith, who was the leader of the free-trade party in that Parliament, proposed that no duty should exceed 25 per cent. His party -whic h was a free-trade and not a revenue Tariff party-wa s prepared to accept that as the maximum. A vote was taken on that proposal, but it was defeated. During that revision some reductions were made, but",73,Honokable Membeij Englan D Is Been An Hotel And Stable But Everything

217,Sir Georcse Turner,The free-trade cry,74,Honokable Membeij Englan D Is Been An Hotel And Stable But Everything
218,Mr Salmon,"That is so. Mr Murraythe reductions now proposed by this Government were not even dreamt of by those who at that time worked for lower duties. During the last two or three weeks I have met a large number of farmers in various parts of Victoria, and I have been astounded by the amount of ignorance displayed by them in regard to the various items on the Tariff. Apparently they have been content to accept the condemnation which has been hurled against tlie proposals of the Government by the leader of the Opposition and those who follow him. They have not troubled to inquire into the matter for themselves. When the fanners of the Commonwealththe primary producers, about whom we have heard so much, and for whom most of us have as much regard as those honourable members who refer to them so frequentlyrealize that in the free list alone there are nearly 100 articles which may be looked upon as farmers' tools of trade, they will see that the Government have not dealt unfairly with them. I was astounded yesterday when I was told by an ex-president of the Royal Agricultural Society of Victoria that the Government had taxed every tool which the farmer used, and that they were actually collecting a duty of 15 per cent, on reapers and binders. indicate the colossal ignorance displayed in regard to the Tariff by those who have been looked upon as leaders of this particular class. The amount of revenue to be raised certainly seems large, and, as one of those who desire to see the Government of the Commonwealth conducted on economical principles, I feel that there is a danger in raising an amount larger than will be necessary to meet the necessities of the Commonwealth and the various States. We have to remember the dependence of the States upon the action of the Commonwealth Parliament at this particular juncture. proposed various alternative schemes have somewhat shocked me by the want of thought which those proposals evidence. They have given no account at all to the fact that, at the inception of the Commonwealth, the power to levy customs and excise duties passed away from the States; and that, if we were to levy direct taxation, we should be infringing on their rights and threatening their solvency. I am not going to speak of the various alternatives. A few years ago I was travelling with a representative of New South Wales, a free-trader, who is looked upon as a representative of what we call the labour party. He told me that in New South Wales they had reached a point at which they felt a great deal of satisfaction. He said"" In the past the bedrock of democracy was supposed to be no taxation without representation, but we have gone one better, and now we have representation without taxation."" Apparently that is what is desired by some of those who oppose the proposals of the Governmentthat the minority shall be taxed, and that the majority shall have the power of imposing the taxation. A true revenue Tariff will depend very largely on such procedure as that. It has been suggested that the Tariff should be submitted to the people. But I ask whether any Tariff which would impose taxation on a majority of the people would ever be carried by means of a referendum 1 We know, of course, that it would not. It would be only such a Tariff as my honourable friends opposite would propose, which would have any chance of being carried, because it would provide for the taxation of the minority for the benefit of the majority. There is one regrettable incident, I think, in connection with this debate, and that is the That serves to lamentable defection of three members from this side of the House. I desire to express my sincere and deep regret that they should have considered it neeessaiy to take that step. All of them, I know, are wellwishers to the Commonwealth, and were ardent workers on behalf of the Constitution Bil l when it was before the people. I do not regret the fact that they have left us-becaus e I know that in spirit, at any rate, and in very many votes, they will be with us-so much as I fear the result of their association with the conservative side of the House. While they were on the more liberal side, while they Honourable members who have were members of the more democratic portion of the House, wefelt that, at any rate, if there were a change, it would always be a change for the better. But I am fearful lest in their new environment they may find themselves losing that amount of grace which they obtained during the time when they were with us. that I am almost one of the last to speak in the debate, but I hope it will not be thought that I am occupying too much time if I have to go over some of the statements",74,Honokable Membeij Englan D Is Been An Hotel And Stable But Everything
219,Mr Conroy (Werriwa),"I suppose,-which have been made by honourable members on either side. That, in a case like this, is very difficult to avoid. possible I intend to an enunciation of the general principles -which I think ought to have governed the Ministry in this, the first attempt at dealing with the finances of Australia. the utterances of the Ministry-and utterance which they have been continually repetiting, as if we on this side were forgetful of it-has been that we must remember that Australia is a nation, and that we must speak as members of an Australian nation, and not as representatives of States. To a certain extent I thoroughly agree with, that view, and I wish that the Ministry themselves had followed it. I am sure that there is no State which more heartily desires that than does New South ""Wales. There is no State which made more sacrifices to enter into this .unionthere is no State which, even strongly free trade as it was, was more prepared to give up willingly a large amount of principle in order to secure union. But what do we find? from the Ministry treating the people of Australia as a whole, they have been considering States only, and have ignored their obligation as members of the House of Representatives to deal with the majority of the people. cry has been, "" Oh, we must give this tate a little more revenue,"" or ""we mustgive that State a little more revenue."" out that very idea, they have utterly ignored the great question by which all taxation ought to be decided-that the great bulk of the population of Australia. There was an admission to that effect by the Prime Minister when he stated that for New South Wales a Tariff of £5,000,000 would be sufficient; for South Australia a Tariff of £6,600,000 would be sufficient' £7,300,000 would be sufficient. If he had thought for a single moment that the population of those three States aggregate no less than 3,000,000 out of the population of 3,S00,000in Australia-if he entirely by what the bulk of the people require, thinking over this, seeing where the population lies, remembering that, after all, taxation is a burden, that no taxation ever made a country wealthy, and finding that it is a matter of sound to try to avoid taxation, he would then have Mr Conroy. said"" Well, it is a pity that, owing to certain sections in the Constitution, we are As far as not able to help certain of these States in to confine myself the way in which we should like."" But he was one of the men who forced upon us those sections in the Constitution. In the name of the Australian people, and One of sitting here as members of the House of an Representatives, representing the majority of the Australian people, we should decline to raise a larger sum in taxation than is necessary to carry on. Why did not the Prime Minister carry out, not only the implied promise, but the direct promise, he gave to the people of New South Wales at Maitland? When the men opposing the acceptance of the Commonwealth Bill declared that a Tariff of £9,000,000 might be necessary, he pointed out, not only then, but in subsequent speeches, that the Tariffs of Australia did not raise more than £7,500,000; and he asked how could anybody think that he as au honourable and upright man would dream of going beyond that ? What do we find him doing ? The very first thing he We find that, so far does is to depart from that promise. Surelyi t would not have been too much to have asked the people of Victoria, if New' South entirely Wales had consented to an increase of £2,000,000 in customs duties-fixin g the federal revenue at £7,000,000-to exercise The whole of their a little economy in their own State, when they could have got along very well ? It is never any harm to any people to say By following "" We shall diminish your taxation."" The real trouble occurs when you try to increase it, and ask them to think it a blessing. If is, the needs of the Prime Minister had said"" We shall fix the Tariff at £7,000,000,"" it is perfectly true that Tasmania, for instance, would have had to collect £80,000 more revenue in another form. But what has he done in order to save not the people of Tasmania, but the State of Tasmania from raising that revenue and for Victoria, a Tariff of in any other way than by customs duties ? Noti n order to save Tasmania £80,000 of taxation-becaus e that is still going on under his proposals-bu t to prevent it from being raised by direct taxation, as it would had been guided have to be, he deliberately imposes on the rest of the people of Australia, taking the estimate of federal revenue at £7,000,000, no less taxation than £1,920,000. That, of course, includes Queensland. It is perfectly true that the revenue of that State would statesmanship have fallen £300,000 short, but the money would still have been in the State for its Government to collect. If the wealth of Queensland, or the wealth of Tasmania cannot contribute £80,000 in the one case, and £300,000 in the other, how, may I ask, do the Government expect the workers to find the money ? The Government, instead of considering the interests of the great bulk of the workers, have gone against them, and in order to prevent tlie States from raising revenue by direct taxation, they have resolved to increase the taxation of the workers through the Custom-house by an enormous sum. It surprises me to hear honourable members opposite talk as though taxation were a blessing, and increased employment, when we know that no Government has ever existed which could put its money to such productive uses as capital is put to by private individuals. We may fairly assume tliat the raising of the £2,000,000 of extra taxation that is proposed, will decrease the amount of employment in the Commonwealth to an extent equal to the throwing out of work of 20,000 persons earning £ 1 0 0 a year each. However we may talk, we must acknowledge that labour cannot do without capita], just as capital is necessary to the existence of labour. There can be no separation of these interests. Labour may claim a largesr share of the wealth which is produced, and no doubt we are all inclined to support that claim, because we must all recognise that the amount now distributed amongst labour is not an equivalent reward for its share in the process of proif taxation were not necessary we should duction. If we acted on the principles which are acted upon in England, for every £ 1 raised by indirect taxation we should raise £ 1 by direct taxation, buthonorable members know what an outcry would be made if it were proposed to raise another £9,000,000 by direct taxation. The people would be up in arms if they truly understood their interests, they would be equally opposed to indirect taxation going beyond the absolute necessities of the administration. Before this Tariff came into force, direct taxation in the States amounted to 21 per cent, and indirect taxation to 79 per cent, of the whole.

What right has any body of men to do that t I admit that every one of us is bound to contribute according to his means, and as far as we can carry out that principle it ought to be observed. That is why I do not declaim wholly against customs duties. My argument, however, is directed against those who say that even if the Government do not require taxation beyond that which might be placed on narcotics and stimulants, we should still tax the commodities which enter into daily consumption. I hope that when we properly understand the true functions of government we may be able to raise through the taxation of narcotics and stimulants all the money that is necessary for State requirements.

As tlie rate of wages in their factories depends entirely upon tlie supply and demand of labour in the particular Statei n which they carry on their business, it is perfectly clear that the erection of artificial barriers of this sort means injury to the bulk of the workmen and protection only to the particular manufacturers engaged. A few months ago I had a good illustration of how weak are importing rings, if such rings exist. It was my duty, representing tlie free-trade council of New South Wales, to wait upon certain individuals and see whether I could not induce them to contribute to our funds, so that we should be enabled to carry on the federal campaign. I am bound to say that that campaign was conducted with less funds than has any other campaign of which I have any knowledge. Indeed, had it not been for the contribution of the poorer men, we should have been absolutely unable to provide the necessary money even for printing and advertising. I mention this because I happen to have a friend who is engaged in importing both in Melbourne and Sydney, and who represents a very wealthy house indeed. Privately I know that man to be a strong free-trader. He has always advocated commercial freedom, and I have not the slightest doubt that h6 has always voted for it . I waited upon him and asked for a contribution of £ 5 or £ 1 0 in order to help us along. His answer was characteristic, and showed how little the importing rings have to gam from free-trade, and how, so far from desiring it, they really favour the erection of this ring fence. He said"" Mr Conroy, have you been through my warehouse?"" that I had not. He then said"" I do not mind telling you that, at the present time, I have £50,000 or £60,000 worth of goods there, and if a 15 per cent, or a 20 per cent, duty were imposed upon those goods it would mean £10,000 in my pocket. In view of that fact, do you think that I am likely to contribute to your funds in order to prevent the imposition of such duties ?"" -That happened last February, just prior to the elections. I shall not mention the gentleman's name, but the honourable member for Mernda knows him very well. Robert Harper? member for Mernda was not in Sydney at leader of the Opposition to make his speech 19 Q the time. The gentleman to whom I refer went further, and said that, whilst he was a. free-trader in principle, and would vote accordingly-becaus e I reminded him of his former statements-if the people of Australia were so foolish as to vote money into his pockets, he was not going to be so foolish as to take it out again. In other words, whilst he would act according to his principles, he would be only too glad tn receive the money which a protective Tariff' would place in his pocket. I said to him""Although you may make this sum of money by reason of the imposition of protective duties, surely in the course of two or tliree years the demandwill be so limited that you will not get on as well as you otherwise would. If the consumption of a large quantity of these goods ceases-as it undoubtedly will-yo u will be worse off."" "" No t in our case,"" he replied. ""We happen to be a wealthy firm. We shall be able to put down all the money re>quired to be paid for the goods when they arrive here, and we shall be in a position to collect from the people not only that amount, but interest upon it . Further, such a duty will wipe out the small men who are cutting into our profitsmen who can send a £ 5 0 note home and indent goods out. It will do away with a large number of our competitors, and then we shall be better able to form a ring, because the larger the amount of capital required to go into this business, the smaller will be tlie number of men who can embark upon it . We shall thus be able to combine more easily. That, however, is impossible under the present I replied fiscal system, and therefore your arguments cease to have any weight with me. The most you can expect from me is that I shall adhere to my principles. WhilstI shall vote for the adoption of a free-trade policy, I shall not l if t my finger or contribute one penny towards preventing the imposition of these duties. I am quite willing to be called a bloated importer or anything else. If the people will insist upon imposing these duties, I am perfectly willing to allow them to put £10,000 or £12,000 into my pocket."" I ask leave to continue my remarks to-morrow. Mi-.

There was a slight of importance to tlie country as a whole, and the Ministry ought to concede what is asked. Under the circumstances, it may be necessary for me to be somewhat more lengthy in my remarks, in order to show that from the earliest times the great places in every country have been those which offered the best facilities for trade, and those hi which, in consequence, the people most congregated, and here in Victoria we find the people at the port of Melbourne. protectionists ference with the great law that trade is carried on without compulsion and must consequently whole. The other day, on coming into the House, I was somewhat puzzled to account for the pleased expression on the face of tlie honourable member for Melbourne Ports, but I found an explanation on reading, in the Age newspaper, a report to the effect that the channel to Melbourne was silting up. honourable member advocates should be done by artificial means. If goods had to be landed at a distant port, and brought overland, I can quite understand the honourable member being delighted at the prospect of the work which would be afforded to carriers, breeders of horses, and all those engaged in dependent industries. honourable member for Melbourne, who is a protectionist and a ship-owner, ought to feel delighted every time one of his ships goes down, because then, in order to replace the vessel, he has to spend money in employing more men in the country. it true that the honourable member for Corio actually joined the volunteers, and practised rifle shooting, in order to promptly dispose of an engineer who had suggested that the bar at the mouth of tlie Barwon could be removed-this from being the chief city in Victoria, as ships could not enter t No doubt his objection to the removal of the bar was the valid protectionist one that it would sweep away 25 to 30 per cent, of protection, Geelong now enjoys or suffers, by being compelled to bring all its goods first to Melbourne, and then by rail to itself. The honourable member for Bland, in the course of his speech, said that he would not put a duty on articles that only employ a very small number of men. He gave as an instance the manufacture of matches, Mr Conroy and said that the number of hands emmistake in that figure, because that is the number of hands employed in the matchmaking and ftre-kindler manufacturing industries combined. Those engaged in match-making only number 49, of whom only eight are males. A t one time the duty on matches in Victoria returned a revenue of £14,000 a year. It was a purely revenue duty. But a certain firm in England, after a high duty had been It is for imposed here, established a match factory to show how their interin. Melbourne, as the consquence of which the revenue of £14,000 sank to £3,000 per annum. Of course the proprietors of the benefit the people as a factory got the benefit of the £11,000 a year; whilst the amount they paid to thenemployes was only £1,500 a year. Consequently the people of Victoria made the proprietors of this factory a present of £9,500 per annum. Even if it were true that no manufactory could be established without the aid of a protecHere was nature doing what the tive duty, I would still say-What right has the State to guarantee to a manufacturer interest upon the money he puts into his business 1 Tlie State never guarantees to a farmer that, if the crop he puts into the ground is lost by drought or storm it will return to him the money he has lost. It does not treat the pastoralist and the Then again, the agriculturist as it treats the manufacturer in a protected industry. As long as the worker or the farmer is downtrodden, protectionists will do nothing for him ; but they will stand by the wealthy manufacturer who is able to Is give champagne lunches, with cigars, and invite them to pleasant little ceremonials. Of course honourable members opposite would not take anything in the shape of money if it were offered to them. We have not come to that in Australia yet. We have not bar which prevented Geelong come to such a condition that manufacturers will openly say"" What is your price for an extra duty on this article ?I can make £100,000 out of it . "" But I was grieved beyond measure to hear it suggested by the which Government that there might be an increase of the duty upon some commodities. That was something like an invitation to interested persons to ""come along."" If there is to beany ""coming along,"" let us all know about it, and let those who are interested state what they are prepared to give. Some of them would be ready to give handsome sums. I dare say some members of tlie Government know that. No one can suppose that the members of the present Ministry are open to suspicion in this direction. very fortunate thing indeed, that the private character of all of them stands so high. If even one member of the Ministry were a man of doubtful character, it would probably be said that persons went to him and offered him so much, and that was why the extra duty was put on. The taxation has to come from the pockets of the people, and if it does not go into the Treasury, there is no excuse for taking the money. If persons outside were to conspire to compel a man to pay £ 1 for an article worth 15s., we should put them in gaol. But when these people go to members of the Ministry and Members of Parliament, and hoodwink and persuade them into so fixing the law that it will legalize these exactions, they escape being put into gaol. What is the whole aim and object of protection but to do under the law what no individual would allow to be done to him, under any other circumstances we can conceive of, without calling in the aid of the police. All this is being done in a legal way-the aid of a legal Ministry has been called in to do it , and we have the legal member for In d i getting up and justifying it. says-""The people of Victoria object to this, but have we not given them protection, and have we not during the last five years or more spent £220,000 amongst the farming class."" I looked up the figures and found that the amount of revenue contributed during that time to the State Was no less than £35,000,000, and of that sum no less than £20,000,000 were contributed by the farmers. tlie exact proportion, and it would mean that out of every £ 1 contributed they have been given back 2£d. The honourable and learned member asked what was the building of a railway but protection 1 It is really a further extension of free-trade, because it is widening the area which can be brought under it . If the contentions of the honourable and learned member were right, people would never congregate at the ports as they have done, even in protectionist Victoria. They would not be at Melbourne and Geelong, which offer the best facilities for trade, but away up in the mallee, 200 miles from any port, because there the natural protection due to distance 19 Q 2 alone would amount to from 50 per cent, to 60 per cent. We have found a great deal made of comparisons between EnglandI t is a and America. And even had they been shown to be to the disadvantage of England they would not have been fair or correct, because up to the year 1840 the condition of poverty was so great in England that every movement since has' been an advance out of the slough of despond. England has had to raise herself, and the great bulk of her people, whereas in the case of America at that time, we remember Charles Dickens, in 1842, writing to Mr Eorster that there was not a man in New England who had not his own fire and a meat dinner every day. One of the duties of a Ministry is to attend in the House, and I think it is wrong that Ministers should leave two or three honourable members to carry on the work. I protest against their action in retiring from the chamber. I am prepared to close at once if the Government will allow the leader of the Opposition to move the adjournment of the debate so that he may go straight on with his speech when the House resumes to-morrow. If I were behind the MinistryI should take care to see that the leader of the Opposition was treated with that respect to which his position entitles The honourable and learned member him. Without a party in opposition to criticise strongly the proposals brought forward by a Ministry, there would not be any true or sound government. If we had absolutely irresponsible individuals bringing measures before the House we could not expect what was every one's business to be attended to by any one. I have calculated matter has anything to do with the financial proposals of the Government. sion of terms that when an honourable member on the Government side of the House says he can employ 3,000 men in his manufactory, and asks for a protective duty, people are inclined very often to be charmed with the idea. They do not ask the cost. But if I were to come forward and say that I would build a large house, and lay out magnificent parks, which I would throw open to the people, that I would employ no less than 7,000 servants-workin g them no more than an hour a month, and paying them a wage of £ 2 a week-if in return I was allowed to draw one penny a week from",79,Honokable Membeij Englan D Is Been An Hotel And Stable But Everything

230,Mr Conroy,"There is such a confuevery man, woman, and child in Australia, that offer would be refused. A penny a week from every man, woman, and child in the Commonwealth would bring me in £16,000 a week, while I should be able to employ these 7,000 people at a total cost of £14,000 a week. Every one would vote against such a proposal; but when, instead of asking for a duty to enable him to throw open his gardens and employ servants, a man speaks of factories and factory hands, and demands a protective duty for that manufactory, his request is granted, and he is regarded as a public benefactor. In reality, however, the people themselves would be paying to keep those hands atwork. Mulhall has shown us that something like £488,000,000 go into the pockets of the rings and trusts in America. I am sure that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports must have read of a protectionist economist named Carey, who has been described by the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr must have had an opportunity of saving O'Malley, as the bald-headed eagle of the Rocky Mountains among political economists. Mr Carey is a political economist who advocated protection on lines that certainly received a good deal of attention at the time. He urged that in every young country a very high Tariff should be imposed in order many men can be employed in the greatest to prevent exports. He said that the natural exports of a new country were agricultural products, and that to export the agricultural products of a countiy was in fact to export tlie soil of that country which in time would have to be made up. One is not surprised that a man of that class of mind adopted protection. But the question is receiving a little more attention in America to-day. Mr Carey, in his work, says that so high were wages and so difficult was it to induce workers to enter factories that protection was recommended and adopted in order to reduce wages. Is that the true reason why certain members support duties? We have the testimony of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, that that is exactly what protection has done, or at all events, without going quite so far as to make that statement, he said that certainly it has failed to prevent men from working 90 hours for as low a sum as from 7s. 6d. to 10s. a week, and that sweating is universal in this State. He showed that the condition of the great bulk of the people here is truly deplorable. them. has pointed out that only now have they been able to succeed in raising the condition of the workers to that of a living wage, and that outside the factories which have not the minimum wage, and which are not regulated by law, the condition of the workers is very deplorable indeed. He has shown that times out of number. If he had gone further, he could have used this argument-""It is perfectly true that protection has produced this result. It is only meant for the manufacturer, and, naturally, he is not going to look after the interests of any worker. What does any man mean by not having sufficient money to enable him to pay all these duties ? A man like that is not to be considered for a moment. It shows that he will not work."" Or perhaps the honourable member went on the argument that because a man is poor he money, and, therefore, ought to be well off, and that because he makes no display of wealth, he must be saving it . Sometimes the reason why a man is not saving wealth is because he does not make it. If the honorable member had ever asked himself how manufacturing industry in any country in sound work, he would have found that in protected industries not more than one man in ten can be so employed, and that if a duty is needed, in order to keep the tenth man going, the nine others must be taxed. In Victoria not so many as one in every ten are employed in factories. I do not think it has been right to quibble at the comparisons which have been made between New South Wales .and Victoria, because they are two States which, though side by side, have adopted diametrically opposite principles. In New South Wales they have gone on tlie principle that the less you tax the people the better it is for them, and chat the less you interfere with them the more likely are they to find out what is to their interest to do, and act accordingly. Buti n Victoria they have proceeded on quite tlie other principle. It is said that Parliament can far better regulate the affairs of the people and teach them how to trade than they can themselves. Before we consent to apply that principle to individuals, ought we not to be quite ready to consent, each of us, to hand over the management of his own affairs to",81,Honokable Membeij Englan D Is Been An Hotel And Stable But Everything

Although the honourable member for Echuca will not allow the rest of us to take control of his own business, because, in his opinion, we are not competent to undertake its management, he says"" We should pass a law to regulate the trade of other people, and teach them what lines to go into, although we know nothing about them.

We ask what reason is there for making that impost. I can point to the instance of Victoria Honourable members sometimes say-"" Oh, we want to give employment to our young men. come of age 1"" policemen, but the whole community benefits by the fact that we have a few policemen. do not benefit by a policeman if he goes about robbing other people instead of looking after their interests. He may benefit just as the manufacturer does if he is allowed to rob others. I am speaking on behalf of those other people. Honourable members sometimes ask-""Ho w are we to give employment to our young men 1"" Xiet us see whether they have carried out this policy, even in Victoria. W it h a population such as that of Victoria the number of young men who grow up and attain the age of 21 every year is something like 8,000, and the manufactories should provide employment for that number. We find, however, that fifteen years ago there were in Victorian factories 41,500 male operatives, whereas in 1899 there were 44,000, or an increase of only 2,500 men, Thus, in spite of the extreme burden imposed on the people of Victoria, the factories have utterly failed to provide that employment which it was fondly hoped they would afford. The people have borne heavy duties with manliness and cheerfulness, because they thought that the welfare of the community would thus be promoted, but their self-denial has been in vain. During that fifteen years no fewer than 120,000 men have reached the age of 21, and thus only 22 out of every 1,000 of those who have reached the age of manhood have found employment in the factories of Victoria. I have seen an economic calculation which shows that the amount contributed by the people of Victoria towards the protection of their manufacthe honourable tures has amounted to £5,000,000 per annum ; but even assuming that only one-fifth of that-amount has been devoted to one man in ten is that object, the community has sustained an enormous loss. The greater part of Supposing tliat that amount has gone into the pockets of the manufacturers, and considerable sums have been spent on entirely unproductive works I admit that the position of affairs in New South Wales is not much better than in Victoria, itself. but still it is better. In New South Wales, during the same year period, 127,500 young men reached the workWhat are they to do when they ing age, whilst the number of men engaged in manufactories has been inmen cannot be creased by 10,800. Thus 81 out of every 1,000 have found employment in the factories of that State. Isi t a matter of wonder, considering the large amount of indirect taxation that has been imposed upon the people of Victoria, that the State has not been able to keep its population, and that, during the last ten years-allow ing for the natural increase-it has actually lost 130,000 people? This very serious result is, no doubt, largely due to high taxation. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports may smile because 130,000 men have been driven from their homes. To the protectionist manufacturer it is a grand thing to see the working men crushed down and wiped out. A manufacturer, who has establishments in both Melbourne and Sydney, told me on one",82,Honokable Membeij Englan D Is Been An Hotel And Stable But Everything

Perhaps they recognise this as one means of keeping down the population; but this is the first time that I have ever heard of a Government allying itself with the Makins of society for the purpose of killing off the babies. Perhaps it was with the same object in view that this baby-farming Ministry imposed duties upon medicines, amounting in some cases to 300 per cent. Many of these medicines come out in solution in alcohol, and that is the only form in which they can be imported. make of spirit being under proof, and if these medicines have to pay the full spirit duty impost upon them to 300 per cent, ad valorem. the medicine is cloudy, and the drugs precipitated cient alcohol has not been mixed with it. Alcohol in itself is one of the most valuable medical agencies. It holds in solution half of the drugs in daily use. The imposition of a duty of 14s. per gallon upon alcohol really amounts to quite 300 per cent, on the medicines in which it is used because many of the drugs in them are not worth more than 3s. or 4s. a gallon. It may be, therefore, that there is some wisdom in the Ministry after all. This duty upon babies' foods may have been imposed as the result of careful deliberation in order to wipe out the infants in the first place, and to kill off sick people in the second. The honourable member for Bland says that those industries which employ only a few people cannot expect to receive consideration. very good admission.

On the other hand the industry which employs a large number of men must manufacture an article which is consumed by the great bulk of the people. humble."" The great bulk of the population is always poor. When we impose taxation upon an article that is largely used we are taxing the great bulk of the people. But I did not expect in this advanced age to hear men bold enough to declare ""We will tax the great bulk of the people. They ought to be made to pay."" Surely those honourable members cannot have considered the full force of their admission. I yet expect to see the honourable member Perhaps the Government had for Bland fighting vigorously upon our side. I know that in some respects he is quite as democratic as I am. Unfortunately he still believes that the bulk of the people ought to be taxed, a proposition from which I entirely dissent. We cannot point to any case in history in which the taxation has been so heavy as that which is proposed under this Tariff"". To my mind some consideration ought to be paid to the State of New South Wales, which represents over one-third of the population of the Commonwealth. The finest recognition of the fact that that The Government, however, State is really the wealthiest of the group is no reduction in consideration afforded by the admission of the Ministry that they expect to receive 36 per cent, of the total revenue of the Commonwealth from of 14s. per gallon the it. If the States of America imposed the will be equivalent same amount of customs taxation upon their Where people no less a sum than £180,000,000 would be collected, whilst in England itthat is often because suffiself about £93,000,000 would be collected. I should like to ask the Treasurer whether he really thinks the Tariff is intended for revenue purposes of for protective-purposes 1 allowed to answer questions while a vote of censure is pending. the Treasurer cannot complain if I interpret his answer in my own way. Among the very fine phrases used by the Prime Minister in his speech at Maitland, was that there would be no "" wanton destruction of industries."" But if the right honourable gentleman had meant what he said, he would never have proposed to put a duty on the raw material of the vehicle-makers of New South Wales. The That in itself is a total value of the vehicles imported into New South Wales last year, including two State carriages, was only £13,000; whereas the value of the raw material imported was about",83,Honokable Membeij Englan D Is Been An Hotel And Stable But Everything
237,Sir George Turner,We are not,84,Honokable Membeij Englan D Is Been An Hotel And Stable But Everything
238,Mr Conroy,"That being ' so£100,000. The profit on the £13,000 could not have amounted to more than £2,000, supposing the vehicles had been made in the State. No doubt the right honourable gentleman contends, as a protectionist, that similar vehicles will be prevented from coming in now, and that will be so to a certain extent. the raw material of this industry no less a sum than £22,500. There are 1,570 men engaged in the industry, and before they can be placed in the same position they were in before the imposition of the Tariff, they will have to make an extra profit of over £20,000. The right honourable the Prime Minister has behaved so badly that there is not to be found in New South Wales any one who would place the slightest reliance on his word. He has done more to bring discredit on politics than any other man has ever done, and in the future it will doubtless be said of others who behave in a similar fashion"" Oh, do not believe them, they are only Bartonising."" learned member must not speak of another member of the Housei n that way. show that the Prime Minister in his utterances has so departed from the spirit and meaning of the words he used, that the revulsion of feeling against the Federal Government is very strong in New South Wales. learned member may say that, but he must not speak in the strain he previously adopted. Prime Minister did not make it more clear to the people of New South Wales that they were expected to make all tlie sacrifices, and that the other States were not expected to make any sacrifices at all. If a low Tariff would conduce to more rigid economy on the part of the States Governments, I should hail with joy as low a Tariff as could possibly be framed. I admit there is difficulty in the way of the Federal Government imposing direct taxation, because we must leave some means open to the States of obtaining revenue by direct taxation. I should like to see every individual in the State, even the humblest, contribute his share of taxation, because each taxpayer would then know exactly what he was paying. The Government unduly hampered the finances by taking over the Postal and Defence departments, and their mistake in doing so is going to be felt by every Federal Government for the next ten years. There is no reason whatever why those departments should have been taken over. The first work that should have been done was to bring forward the necessary machinery But there is to be collected on Bills before the introduction of the Tariff. Instead of that, look at the time that has been wasted. which I do not feel called upon to quarrel with just now, but that is the fault of the Government itself. In consequence of the taking over of these departments, the Government will have to create a works department. This will involve the employment of an additional army of civil servants. When civil servants are doing necessary work, they should be well paid for it , and there should be a sense of security in regard to the positions they hold. But I do not believe in creating unnecessary work. The honourable member for Gippsland went so far as to urge, as one argument in favour of protection, that the home trade is four times more valuable than foreign trade. That can be shown clearly to be not the case. If the home trade were more valuable, no one would trade abroad with his goods, because the risks attending foreign trade are greater than those attending home trade. Adam Smith, in the infancy of scientific knowledge upon the subject 130 years ago, fell into the same error as the honourable member for Gippsland, and it shows that that honourable member is 130 years behind in his knowledge. To carry out the honourable member's argument to its logical conclusion, it is clear that as what we are -seeking to do under the Federation is to increase the wealth of the community, it would be an advantage to continue the Inter-State duties, because the trade done in each State would be four times more valuable than that between any two States. A very simple way, also, of increasing the wealth of Victoria, if the honourable member's contention is correct, would be to divide it into ten districts, with a separate Government for each, because, as the trade between two persons in each of the subdivisions would be four times as valuable as trade between them and anywhere else, tlie sum total of the trade of Victoria by this simple method of subdivision would be",84,Honokable Membeij Englan D Is Been An Hotel And Stable But Everything

244,Mr Conroy,"That is a correctionincreased 40 times. Assuming that the trade of Victoria at present is £20,000,000 a year, we might by so subdividing it and granting a Constitution to each subdivision, raise the trade to £800,000,000 a year. between two Wesleyans should be four times as valuable as that between a Wesleyan and a Presbyterian. I have only reduced tlie argument to this absurdity to show how ridiculous the original statement was. I was referring to the vehicles imported into New South Wales, and the damage done there by imposing a duty of 20 per cent, on the raw material. I said there were practically 1,600 hands engaged in the industry, but I did not at the same time touch upon the effect of the Tariff upon saddlery ware. I ask, in reference to that industry, how has the Prime Minister carried out his Maitland promise, that there should be no wanton destruction of existing industries 1 I admit that in regard to many Victorian manufacturing industries, he has tried to carry out his promise, but with regard to industries in the State from which he conies he has pursued the -opposite course. The raw materials used in the manufacture of Saddlery and harness amount in value to about £90,000. I have tried very hard to separate the various items that come under the heading of raw material. The value of raw material directly stated is £49,000, but taking into consideration all the other items that must be taken into account the total amounts to something like £90,000. I will assume, for the sake of argument, that the total is only £80,000. In order to prevent the importation of £17,000 worth of saddlery, the profits on which if made up Would not exceed £3,000, the men engaged in the affected trades have to pay 20 per cent, duty on £80,000, or some like £17,000 altogether. It is an unalterable law that i.fie price of an article cannot be increased -w ithout lessening the demand for it. Wages tire not increased simply because the price of an article is increased, and I would remind the honourable member for Bland of the economic fact that when prices are raised 20 per cent, there is an absolute depreciation of the wages of the people to that extent, unless their wages are increased correspondingly. proposed by the honourable and learned Australia ready to support the principle I member have the effect of increasing prices 1 I have just enunciated. It is only because it honourable member was present when I explained it. I have pointed out already that, so far as 3,000,000 of the people are concerned, a'Tariff of £7,000,000 is all that is In the same way the trade required, on the Prime Minister's own statement. Therefore we should not go above that amount. After all, on whom do the taxes fall 1 Why is one class of taxation called "" direct,"" and another ""indirect?"" The term ""indirect taxat i o n "" is another name for ""protection."" It means the collection of a tax from one man, in the certain expectation that he will collect that tax from other individuals. As a matter of fact, not only the amount of the tax, but interest in addition is collected. That is why it is said that indirect taxation is one of the most wasteful forms of raising money. When I look at the Tariff papers, and see that the Ministry estimate that they will raise only £ 9 2 hy means of the duty of l ^ d . per lb. on biscuits, I feel that I may well ask why the tax is imposed, unless it is to allow certain manufacturers to form a ring, and raise prices against the jaiblic. If there is no revenue to be derived from it, why should the duty be raised to l | d . per lb. 1 The public may well ask"" Who are the men engaged in the biscuit trade 1 The firm of Arnott and Co., of Newcastle, in free-trade New South Wales, has been doing a very large exjxu't' trade, with a duty of only £d. per lb. on biscuits. Last year that firm did a very large trade with South Africa, and was able to do it owing to the abolition of the duties on such articles as currants, which are used in certain classes of biscuits, and the very low duty on sugar. learned member aware that it was a duty of Id. per lb. on biscuits that first enabled Mr Arnott to get on his feet 1 An Honorable MEMBER -No. He called his creditors together, and paid them 20s. in the £ 1 like a man. compelling every nian who says that he is a protectionist to trade only with protectionists, and thus keep the money in the countiy 1 If 1,000,000 people in Victoria were able to support a protective policy,",85,Honokable Membeij Englan D Is Been An Hotel And Stable But Everything

Why should we compel those who do not share our political views to give up some portion of their hard earnings to keep other men going? ""When a man is sick, do we provide for him ? Do we provide for every farmer who loses his crop ? Do we provide for the gold miner when he is out of employment or bottoms a duffer^ ing vote ? the remarkable generosity of the proposal of the honourable and learned member for Indi, who said that it is ungrateful of the farmers to complain, because out of the £20,000,000 taken from them they have .received back £220,000. It is like saying that a man whom you have knocked down ought to be grateful to you for giving him 2-Jd. out of the £ 1 you have taken from him. According to the honourable ancl learned member the farmer ought to be grateful because, when he is robbed of £ 1 he is given back 2£d. What nonsense it is to bring forward such an argument here. If the doctrine of honourable members is founded on truth why do they not go round the country and preach it to tlie people ? Let them go round to the people and state that the true proportion of direct and indirect taxation is 50 per cent, of each. Theory, which is really the explanation of the relationship which facts bear to one another, shows that. I have been surprised at the use which has been made of the word theory here. It would lead any one to think that it means something which is false. I ought not be surprised to hear an argument of that sort from the other side, because one ought not to wonder at such expressions coming from men who have given no study to the question of political economy. I was very much concerned to find that the honourable and learned member for Corinella, who on many other things has been pretty clear, has not paid attention to the science of political economy. I do not object to any man not having paid attention to the question, because it involves two or three years' study, and men cannot be expected to get np and speak on it at a moment's notice. I cannot expect the great bulk of honourable members to be acquainted with a science which has been known for only 120 years, and the first principles of which it has taken the human mind so long to work out. There is no shame in a man acknowledging his ignorance. In my early days I used to go in for explaining the principles of political econonry. I have never blamed a man for confessing his ignorance of them any more than I would blame a man for saying that he was ignorant of the rudiments of surveying or of astronomy. I have touched on the item of biscuits, and observed that the great public of New South Wales want an explanation from the Ministry. It is a pity that every time protective duties are introduced it gives rise to a cry in the mind of the public. When they find a certain class of manufacturers deriving a gain, and themselves called upon to make good-the losses, they naturally ask why they should accept such a policy. If it can be defended on the grounds of revenue only, there is the answer, "" The money we take from you goes direct into the Treasury."" Bnt once it goes beyond that point what answer can be given to the general public 1 This is a matter that the public have an interest in knowing something about. Honourable members must have heard or read of the disgraceful lobbying which takes place in America. In Apri l last, I met an American gentleman, who asked me what politicians made out of their positions in Parliament, and I told him that I was perfectly safe in saying that, so far as Australia was concerned, up to the present time we had had no instance of any man making money out of politics, and that the most that could be said was that Ministers had sometimes listened to the representations of individual manufacturers, and had given them the right to levy tribute on the people, though politicians themselves had been singularly free from anything in the way of making profits out of the public.

Why should £3,000 be put into the pockets of this particular manufacturer just as directly as if he were allowed to collect it from the individuals themselves'? Here, again, the fact must be remembered that he is a great friend of the Prime Minister. Wales will want an explanation in regard to the duties upon biscuits, twine and yarn, soap, pianos, and a good many other articles which I have not time to discuss just now. to point out that these duties lead to the creation of trusts. In Victoria there is a nail duty is given to this industry, although the and barbed wire factory. Of what possible benefit can the imposition of a duty upon these articles be to the bulk of the people 1 These wages are paid out of money collected from the people, and unfortunately the money does not go directly into the pockets of the workers, but has to filter through the manufacturers. Buti f a policy be framed for advancing the interests of individuals as against the interests of the nation, no wonder we find men eager and willing to take advantage of it. Are we not entitled to say that the protection of the Australian Paper Mills Company and of the proprietors of the strawboard mills is unjust to the great bulk of the people 1 Then the American Tobacco Trust will doubtless, as time goes on, under this Tariff reduce their expenses of management by closing up their factories in Adelaide and Melbourne, and conducting their business entirely at their factory i u Sydney. The difference between the excise on leaf and the duty on imported tobacco means thousands of pounds to the consumer, and no one can for a moment contend that it is right that this company should make such enormous profits in consequence of the .Tariff. If the policy of the Government be right, why not make tobacco factories a State industry ? ber support such a proposal ? such a proposal in the case of tobacco, and if the proprietors of the tobacco factories are protectionists, they need not be* given any compensation, because they will know that tlie ""money is still in the countiy."" I have already referred to the two reaper and binder factories in Victoria, which are combined, or, at least, form a ring pledged not to sell below a certain price. If the Government had said that this was a revenue Tariff, I might have urged that they had overstepped the bounds, but when they declare their proposals to mean protection, we are entitled to know what particular classes of manufacturers are given the right to levy money on the bulk of the people. The more of these rings there are created, The public of New South the more difficulty there will be in getting rid of them, and with a Commonwealth containing over 4,000,000 of people, these rings are given greater power than ever they had before. Even the proprietors of the three I should like further candle factories are under an agreement to charge certain rate3, and the advantage of a estimated revenue is only £403. I admit that sometimes the money does not go into the pocket of the manufacturer, owing to bad machinery and wasteful management, which tend to reduce the profits, but as population grows, the manufacturers are given an increased advantage. Although the duty on sugar is not to be collected unt i l the 1st June next year, the price of this commodity has been raised by £ 2 per ton; indeed, the honourable member for South Sydney, who is a large jam manufacturer, declares that the price has been increased by £ 2 10s. per ton, so that the effect of the duty has been to put large sums of money into the pockets of the shareholders of the Colonial Sugar Company. I should like to know why a company with a capital of a million of money should be allowed to collect money from the public in this way 1 The duty puts £450,000 into the pockets of its shareholders. I am told that some of tlie rich lands of Queensland may go out of cultivation if these duties are not imposed. How can they be rich lands if they cannot be cultivated without the benefit of a tax on the rest of the people of Australia 1 What would the farmers who live on the potato lands near Warrnambool say, if they were told that they might levy a tax for their own benefit upon the people living .in the mallee 1 I am glad to say that amongst a great many of the people in the sugar growing district of New South Walesi t is coming to be recognised that they ought to be thankful for the rich lands on which they live, without seeking to tax their poorer neighbours.

Orders are being received for them from all parts of the world. But this duty on sugar is going to increase the cost of producing jams, and will injure the trade. diminished employment and lower wages. Duties like this injure the whole community. If the people of England had listened to some politicians in 1845 and 1846 her duties would have been retained. Their argument was that if they wanted revenue they must keep up high duties. They would not believe the political economists who told them that the lower the duties the greater would be the revenue, because the greater would be the demand for the articles j and so far from the bulk of the people being out of employment, and a condition of misery existing, it would tend to sweep all that awa)-, because the greater demand for the articles would increase the demand for labour. I mentioned that if the wages of men were not increased 20 per cent, the effect of this Tariff would practically be to diminish their wages by 20 per cent. It is true that in the case of two staple theoretical idea, nor would direct taxation necessaries of life, meat and wheat, the injury that protection does cannot be felt to the fullest extent. I concede so much to the protectionist. AVhen a statesman like Sir Robert Peel came into power he was willing to be guided by the teachings of science, and how clearly the result proved him to b'e right. From 1836 to 1846 the revenue in England was falling off by from £500,000 up to £2,000,000 a year, the people in hundreds of places were starving, and the metal heaps at Leeds, which were given to men to break up, had increased to 150,000 tons. One honourable member opposite told us during this debate tliat Lord Salisbury had become a convert to protection, but what the Prime Minister of England did say on the subject was that the people must not forget that now the amount of direct taxation equalled theamountof indirect taxation, and that any further increase of taxation must be an increase all round. I find that on 2nd May, 1894, he said "" Protection is dead and cannot be revived,"" while on 10th March, 1897, he said. "" I do not doubt that free-trade is tlie policy for this country, and which this country will continue to pursue."" Could there be any stronger declaration ? We expect to lose on this division, but I have no hesitation in saying that if the voice of the people of the Commonwealth could make itself heard-and I trust that it will yet have an opportunity of doing so, because the Tariff has to go before another Houseconsequently it would be found to be with us. The This will bring about silent forces which make for freedom will triumph in the end as surely as good conquers evil. There will yet be found on the part of the people an insistence, not for taxation, but an insistence that whenever any taxation is to be imposed it shall be borne fairly by us all in proportion to our means. I admit that the proportion of direct taxation which can be raised in a new country like this is not what could be raised in an old country, but it will yet be far nearer than anything theMinistry has proposed. Sof ar as they are concerned the amount of direct taxation which will have to be imposed will be something like 15 or 16 per cent. The only State which has made an approximation towards the equalization of taxation is New South Wales. It imposes direct taxation to the extent of 29 per cent. In a new community it is impossible to carry out the be correct, to my mind, if it were excessive. But the relative proportion in which direct and indirect taxation should be borne is far from finding a place in tlie proposals of the Ministry. I trust the people will learn this great lesson, that no taxation will be for the benefit of the people; that every penny that is taken from the productive power of the country means so much diminished employment, and consequently general deterioration. So far from advancing the interests of the wealthy classes, it is to their own injury, and their selfishness in avoiding their fair share of the public burdens unduly depresses the masses, and widens that gulf between rich and poor, which all earnest men wish to see narrowed.

296,Mr Batchelor (South Australia),"hour of the morning, I feel tliat perhaps I ought to apologize for addressing members even for the few minutes that I intend to speak. My only reason for rising is that so far I have not spoken on Tariff matters in this Parliament. I did not speak to the address in reply, nor have I given any indication of my views on the fiscal question. The debate has been unprecedentedly long, and I am afraid honourable members must have concluded that it has been somewhat wearisome Perhaps, however, it has had some educational effect. Let us hope that it has. I am rather afraid not only that the greater part of what has been said during this debate has been irrelevant, but that the mass of matter, having very little relation to the real question before us, which has been put forward, clouds the issue, and prevents the people from obtaining a fair and definite conception of the real principles at stake. We have had a mass of statistics quoted, giving comparisons between the positions of New South Wales and Victoria. We have had a great many recriminatory expressions used by honourable members on both sides of the House, but certainly to a far greater extent by those on the opposition side. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -No. member is as fair and candid as he is usually contemporary history, and that is that all he will admit the correctness of my statethe nations which have built up industries to ment. Scarcely one honourable member has any considerable extent have done so under referred to New South Wales throughout a system of protection, and that every this debate, except in a courteous and fair nation but one-Great Britain-whic h has manner. On the other hand, it cannot be practised protection has stuck to it . Notdenied that expressions have been used with withstanding 'the fact that all the offreference to Victoria which seem to me, as shoots of Great Britain were trained in one of the representatives of aa outside free-trade views, and had a natural love for State, to be of an unnecessarily offensive British ideas, in every case but one they have character to Victorians. must have misunderstood them. the honourable member has been guilty of gress under a protective system, when we see that kind of conduct, and I am not referthat all nations except Great Britain have ring to him. refer to question of free-trade or protection, and are not located in Great Britain, Newi t was unnecessary I think that its introduction has been a disfrom that fact, surely there must be someadvantage. this Parliament some national sentiment. friends are prepared to admit 1 If we admit We do not want to continually at States represented by Great Britain, New South Wales, and honourable members holding views different Turkey, are we to conclude that in those from our own. I said just now that most of these comparisons had very little relation to the question at issue, and I think honourable members must agree that very little can be proved by statistics. Much depends on the circumstances, and we cannot get similar circumstances in all the States,' so that the statistics which have been quoted are of no particular value. For instance, if we consult Coghlan in order to ascertain which of the Australian States have shown the greatest progress during the last 20 years, and the best conditions for labour generally we find, strange as it may seem, that they are those States which have had a nominee Legislative CouncilNew South Wales, New Zealand, Queensland, and, for some little time, Western Australia. But how absurd it would be to argue that therefore the high road to prosperity is to have a nominated Legislative Council. Yet, such a conclusion would be quite as logical, though it is so absurd, as some of the arguments which have been used in this debate. Like the honourable member for Darling, I am quite convinced that fiscal policies have not a great deal to do with the conditions prevailing in various communities. Only one inference, I think, can be drawn from the general statements of the conditions prevailing in various countries. One broad If the honourable fact is to be learned from looking at adopted protection, and not thrown it over. Surely we can conclude from that fact that incompatible with a protective policy 1 It I do not say that is idle to suggest that Australia will not proA great deal of what I done so.

299,Mr Batchelor,"countries which have adopted protection the people are more easily cajoled and imposed upon than are those in other countries ? I do not think that that contention can be sustained. Taking an historical view, all the arguments protection. I for a moment that nations are prosperous protection or free-trade : I do not believe it but at least it can be said that protection is certainly compatible with a very high state of prosperity. have been drawn between Victoria and New South Wales by the free-trade party to the advantage Had New South Wales been compared with New Zealand or Queensland or any of the other States, quite the reverse result would have been shown. What particular value is it to draw a comparison between New South Wales and Victoria, when if it were drawn between New South Wales and Queensland, or New Zealand, or other protectionist communities, quite a different result would be shown as regards conditions of life and general prosperity? It has not been shown, though a great deal of time has been devoted in the attempt, that in free-trade countries better conditions prevail for the workers than in protected countries. An attempt has been made to show that the conditions in England are very much better than those in the United States, and that the conditions in New South Wales are very much better than those in Victoria. But the country in which the general conditions of life are best, and certainly where the agriculturists are most prosperous, is New Zealand, a most highly protected community. So that a very high state of agricultural prosperity can exist under a protective policy. at the expense of the farmer 1 that in New Zealand, where we see an agricultural population chiefly engaged in primary production, the people are so blind to their own interests that they permit their industries to be injured by allowing a system of protection to exist ? The absurdity of the suggestion of honourable members opposite is evidenced by the fact that, instead of being crushed, that colony is in a more prosperous condition than is any State in the Commonwealth, or probably any other country in the world. I confess myself a moderate protectionist. I realize thatthephrase requirestobe defined, and I understand a moderate protectionist to be one who believes in protecting industries which are of considerable importance. certainly make for I do not approve of protective duties do not wish to say for tlie establishment of industries such as the manufacture of nails, or to keep or the reverse because of a few men employed. Unless an industry is well worth, establishing, there is no justification for imposing heavy burdens upon the people, but I believe that in AusComparisons tralia we should be able to meet the chief wants of our people, and that the more we can do so, the better it will be for the comof the latter State. munity. I do not believe in prohibitive duties. I am convinced that while a revenue duty must inevitably add to the cost of living, a protective duty, so long as it is not prohibitive, very often leads to competition between outsiders and the local manufacturers, and so brings down prices instead of adding to them. I do not see how under any system of free-trade we can secure to the workers those conditions which I think should exist in these States. Wages boards are not the outcome of either protection or free-trade, but I believe that they are necessary to insure the very best conditions for labour. A t the same time, wages boards and boards of conciliation and arbitrationwhich are designed to secure reasonably good conditions for working men-can not operate successfully unless they are associated with a system of protection against the outside world. I have a perfectly free hand in this matter. South Australia has been evenly divided on the question of free-trade and protection, and the elections were not influenced at all by fiscal considerations. It has been claimed that South Australia has returned a majority of free-traders to this House. Taking the order in which the representatives of that State were placed on the poll at the election, the two leading representatives are protectionists; the next two are free-traders; next comes a protectionist, and then two free-traders, whilst the last among the successful candidates was a protectionist. If there had been six or eight representatives required, there woidd have been equal numbers of both political creeds. In the Senate there are three representatives on the one side, and three on the other, and the whole of the honourable members who represent South Australia would have been returned irrespective",92,Honourable Members

301,Mr Batchelob,"I s it not curiousof their views on the fiscal question. I have never been allied with any fiscal party, and when I had to make up my mind upon the Tariff question I was as free as any man in Australia. In view of the difficulties I foresaw in connection with future labour legislation, unless we have protection for workmen against outside competition, I was influenced to give my adherence to a protectionist policy. A t the same time. I do not think that it is wise to pile burdens upon the people for the sake of protecting industries that are exotics, or to put on heavy duties which would only lead to the formation of rings. The protection of industries which are necessary to meet the requirements of the people does not always add to the public burdens. Take the salt industry of South Australia, foi instance. A few years ago the salt lakes of South Australia were a nuisance to travellers, and were absolutely useless. All the salt that was used in South Australia for curing and other purposes was imported from abroad. was about £ 5 10s. ' per ton, and the price ran up to £ 6 per ton for salt of the Black Horse brand. A duty of 25s. per ton was imposed upon salt in South Australia, and with this encouragement means were devised for properly refining aud jiurifying the local salt. South Australian salt is as good as that of the Black Horse brand for curing purposes, and is being put upon the market at from 30s. to 35s. per ton. The price of 30s. per ton delivered at. Port Adelaide to-day presents a great contrast to the £ 5 10s. per ton which was formerly charged for the imported salt, ancl the local production of salt has proved a great boon to those engaged in the meat ancl curing industries generally. This result shows that where protective duties are put on articles which enter largely into consumption in the States, they donotnecessarily in Adelaide prior to the introduction of the increase prices, but sometimes operate in a contrary direction by permitting of the establishment of valuable industries, which not only result in the of produce, but also provide employment for a large number of people. W it h regard to the proposed Tariff, I think it is fairly satisfactory, upon tlie whole, from a protectionist stand-point. ber believe iu the composite duties ? tage about the composite duties, inasmuch 30s., which is the price per 1,000 at which as under fixed duties the cheaper classes of goods pay a very high percentage than the dearer classes. The composite duties, however, are indicative of an attempt-probabl y the first in Australia-to improve the incidence of the taxation. the measurement charges. the composite duties to which the honourable member was referring were the fixed and the ad valorem rates. I do not know that I have a very great admiration for the duties to be charged upon the outside measurement of cases, but before expressing a very definite opinion I should like to hear what the Minister for Trade and Customs has to say upon the matter. amount to four times as much as the value of the goods, in addition to the 15 per cent. ad valorem. If the honourable member can show that The cost of curing salt those duties will inflict hardship without conferring a sufficient benefit upon the community, I am quite prepared to vote with him to strike them out. I repeat that the purely protective duties are, in my opinion, fairly satisfactory. I know that some industries have sustained a severe blow even -in South Australia, where the duties which formerly operated were not very high. For example, since the day after the Minister for Trade and Customs introduced this Tariff, not a single man has been employed in the cigar-making industry there owing to the reduction in the differential duties. I have heard the importers' statements, and I have also secured very f u l l details from persons in the trade, who traverse the arguments of the importers, and show that they are entirely biased and one-sided. There were five or six factories Tariff, and every man who was employed therein has been thrown out of work. times do that for other purposes. It wants to be looked into. looked into.

These cigars could not be immediately manufactured in any one State much more cheaply than in the others. In South Australia they can be manufactured as cheaply as they can be elsewhere. The cost of the raw material is not greater there, and the conditions under which the men work are about the same as those which obtain elsewhere. member account for the fact that the factories in the other States have not been shut down ? been shut down because the difference between the duties which formerly operated in those States and the duties imposed under the present Tariff is not so great. Victoria is the only State in which the cigarmaking industry has attained to any proportions. There are not many cigars made in Sydney. In Victoria a considerable number of cigars are manufactured, and South Australia has also turned out a fair quantity relatively to her population. In Victoria the industiy has sustained the same blow as that which it has experienced in South Australia, though not quite to the same extent. Nevertheless, the cigar-makers here have informed some honourable members that they will not be able to continue the industry under the changed conditions. I refer to this matter only as one instance in which this Tariff has led to tbe destruction of an industry 19 R which formerly employed a considerable number of men, and enabled them to provide for their families. Whilsti t is a small industry, I cannot, with indifference, contemplate its destruction. the labour displaced in that way should go into primary production. member for South Australia, Mr Poynton, knows that these cigar-makers have about as much chance of getting employment in primary producing industries as they have of reaching the moon. Another industry which is "" hardly h it "" is that of the white workers who make up cotton piece goods; and I think the Ministry would be well advised if they carry out their pronouncement that there shall be revenue without destruction. I do not want the Ministry to impose heavy duties in order to bolster up industries which are not worth consideration, but this is one of the few avenues for employment for women, and a tremendous amount of harm will be done if it is impeded in the way proposed. duties on the raw material 1 between the cost of production here and the import duty which is the protection to the local manufacturers and workers, but if the duties on the raw materials are raised, that has the same effect as the abolition of the protection. Unquestionably, the Minister for Trade and Customs and the Treasurer are to be congratulated on the fact that on the whole there has been so little outcry from the various industries which, except in New South Wales, have hitherto been protected in various ways in the different States. The whole outcry against this Tariff has been in connection with the revenue items; Excepti n the case of the cigar-ruakerSj the white workers, and one or two other classes, I have heard no complaints to speak of, the whole outcry having arisen in connection with the increased cost of the necessaries of life, as they are called, such as timber, kerosene, tea, preserved milk, flannelette, and cotton goods.

I do not feel inclined to add to the burdens of the people by taxing those articles which are in common consumption, and which cannot be made in the Commonwealth, though these are the articles which members of the Opposition regard as affording the only proper means of raising revenue by Customs duties. £2,500,000 more than is necessary is being raised, which is unjust to the people of that State. learned member is confusing South Australia with the Commonwealth.

It requires no capital to become an indent agent. an importer, but importing does not bring out the skill and business faculties of the people to the extent that manufacturing does. A t the risk of repeating myself, I must again say that the whole trouble about this Tariff is raised in connection with the revenue items, and not in connection with the protective items. If the leader of the Opposition had had to bring in the first Tariff for Australia, it would have been the very best thing that could have happened for the It certainly does protectionist cause. In such a case, free trade and the name of the leader of the Opposition would have been associated with duties as high, if not higher, than those proposed in the present Tariff, and such a policy would have simply added to a cheaper article the cost of living, without causing the the employment of a single additional person or giving any corresponding benefit. industry Had the free-trade party introduced a Tariff on the lines they must have followed produce. in order to carry out their theories, pilingeven heavier burdens of taxation on such of these people does articles as tea, coffee, kerosene, and blankets, it would have been the very finest thing that could have happened for the protectionist cause. I admit that I am dissatisfied with the Tariffi n regard to tlie revenue items, because all my political life I have been fighting against the taxation of such articles; and when I have an opportunity to vote in favour of the importation of the necessaries of life as cheaply as possible, I do not intend to neglect it . What is more, I find from the speech of the honourable member for South Australia ( Mr Poynton) that, though he is classed as a revenue tariffist, he is going to do the same.

Under the circumstances, I am compelled to vote with the Government rather than with the Opposition, who can offer me no relief in the direction in which I think relief is required. The Opposition offer only destruction without relief. That phrase is the watchword that should be printed on tlie banner of the free-trade party in this connection. On the other hand, although the Government, I admit, oppress the people to a considerable extent by revenue duties, they do not add to the difficulties of the people by bringing about the displacement from employment of large numbers of workmen. That is certainly what would happen if the Opposition were successful. As to the amendment of the honourable member for Barrier, I have at his request to ask for its withdrawal. He has had to leave earlier than was expected, and has, of course, paired; but he finds that there is such a general feeling amongstf honourable members on both sides-som e of whom are favorable to his proposal-that it would complicate the present issue, and he has come to the conclusion that it would be undesirable to press it to a division. As far as I am concerned I think he is wise in doing so. Had he pressed the amendment to a division I should have voted for it , though I think the better plan is for the Commonwealth Parliament to leave the imposition of direct taxation to the States. We can bring about direct taxation if we desire it without imposing it ourselves. If we do not give the States a surplus sufficiently large to enable them to carry on, they will be compelled either to make great reductions or to impose direct taxation in any form they like. I certainly think that some proposal for direct taxation is necessary to make the motion of the leader of the Opposition complete and definite; but under present circumstances it is just as well that the amendment should be withdrawn. I therefore ask the permission of the House for its withdrawal. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. late period of the debate, and early hour of the morning, I should not have troubled the House had it not been that in certain quarters a doubt has been expressed as to how I shall record my vote in connection with the motion of 19 R 2 censure proposed by the leader of the Opposition. I rise more for the purpose of removing that doubt than for any other reason. Why such a doubt should have been expressed I know not. A t the election I stood as a supporter of the Barton Government. I was opposed by one of the high priests of the free-trade democratic league, which did all it possibly could to secure my defeat. A section of the press tliat has devoted a considerable amount of attention to me during the last three or four weeks, on that occasion placarded its columns with my name as a high Tariff candidate. Yet within the last week or two they have stated that I should be false to my pledges if I voted with the Government on this occasion. In support of what I now state, I may add that some little time before the day of nomination there were three candidates for the Wimmera seat in the field in the interests of the Barton Government. I thought it was inadvisable for the three of us to stand, and brought about a conference, the result of which was that an arbitration committee was formed. One member of that committee was the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, and I was chosen as their candidate. That, I think, proves that knowing the policy of the Government I was their candidate, and I have broken no election pledge. I desire to draw attention to a quotation from the first speech I delivered in connection with that election. The speech was circulated throughout the length and breadth of the Wimmera, and every elector in that district got a copy of it . I am reported to have said in that speechThe most important question the Federal Parliament would have to deal with was that of the Tariff. It was now resolving itself into a fight between the advocates of free-trade and protection, but many of them overlooked the fact that a certain amount of revenue had to be raised for the working of the Commonwealth. Clause 8G stated that on the establishment of the Commonwealth the control of duties, customs, and excise passed to the executive Government, and clause 87 stated that for a period of ten years, or till such time as Parliament otherwise provided, of the net revenue not more than one-fourth should be applied to the Commonwealth, the balance to be paid to the respective States. It would take £8,500,000 to provide the necessary revenue of the Commonwealth and return to the States the three-fourthsproportion they were entitled to. That revenue could only be raised through the Customs. He supported the policy of Mr Barton, whose Government he was prepared to follow. Mr Barton's motto was, ""Revenue without destruction,"" which meant that, while the whole of",96,Honourable Members
332,Mr Phillips (Wimmera),"A t thisthe revenue would be raised through the Customs, the duties would be such ns would enable consideration to be extended to the industries that have been built up under the protective policy. If there was any shortage in the Customs revenue ib would have to be made up by a land tax, which, of course, he (the candidate) or any farmer would not for a moment approve of. If an all-round revenue duty were imposed it would mean that the present free list would be taxed. In that list were a considerable number of articles in daily use amongst bhe producers, and he would be no party to have those articles taxed. This list included kerosene, and other oils, corrugated iron, manures of every kind, cream .separators, traction engines, reapers and binders, -wine presses, sewing machines, sheep shearing -machines, safety matches, posts and rails, brown rock salt, wool packs, and a large number of obher articles.

Mr Phillips, I think these quotations clearly prove that by voting with the Government on this occasion, I do not violate any election pledge, on the 'contrary, I redeem my plegdes. I recognise that I was returned as a consistent supporter of the Government, and I am so. While making this statement it does not follow that I agree entirely with the Tariff proposals which the Government have submitted. I certainly disagree with very many of their proposals as contained in the Tariff. It will be observed that during my election campaign I pledged myself to the retention of what was called the farmers' free list. I find that that list has to a very large extent been interferred with by the present Tariff proposals, and when Ave get into committee I shall take advantage of the invitation of the right honourable the Treasurer. The right honourable gentleman, in speaking the other night, saidI am not going to say that this Tariff is perfect. I admit, in the light of bhe. information I have recejved since it was submitted, that it contains many blemishes which we are prepared to rectify. If the information for which we have asked from those interested shows us that we have made a mistake in regard to any particular article, and that what we propose is likely to injure any indusbry, we do not intend to continue to do wrong merely because we have done so up to the present. We are perfectly prepared to asand then, if we bhink ib wise, to modify or alter any of the anomalies which may possibly exist. fesses to set out the duties the farmers must published the Federal Tariffi n regard to those articles, hut oinitted to place beside it the old Victorian Tariff. The omission may not have been intentional, but it looks remarkably like it. I am inclined to think it was an attempt on their part to gull the farmers. The duties on six out of the seven articles which I have enumerated are the same as under the old Victorian Tariff, while in regard to tlie seventh there has been a reduction of 10 per cent. The duty on horse-works under the Victorian Tariff was 25 per cent.; under the Federal Tariffi t is 15 per cent. It is stated that reapers and binders are to be taxed to the extent of 15 per cent., but the Argus omitted to mention that this duty is conditional upon the establishment of a factory within the Commonwealth. On the day following the publication of this list, I met a representative of one of the largest agencies for reapers and binders in the Commonwealth. I brought this duty under, his notice, and inquired whether it would not pay his firm to establish a factory here. He replied that if they had the whole of the Australian trade to themselves it would not pay them to do so. I think it was the leader of the Opposition who said that reapers and binders could be purchased for about £ 3 0 . That statement is ""correct. Some two or three years ago, however, the price was 55. year. self some three years ago, and paid £ 5 5 for it . Some four or five weeks ago, however, I bought a machine of the same make at Braybrook. The price of disc harrows for £30. The cause of the reduction is ranges, according to size, from £19 to £ 2 5 ; that the ring which existed amongst the the rotary disc jump plough ranges in importers here has been broken up. The price from £ 2 5 to £ 4 5 ; the steel stumpreapers and binders for which we had to jumping plough from £ 2 6 to £ 4 2 ; and pay £ 5 5 a year or two ago can now be winnowers from £ 2 5 .

There are something like 80 articles which enter into daily use among the producer's and other sections of the community in respect of which reductions have been made as compared with the Victorian Tariff. There may be many more. Candles have been reduced by 25 per cent.; currants, 33 J per cent.; oatmeal, 7-|per cent.; maizena, 6 per cent.;corn-flour, 50 per cent.; bran, pollard, and chaff, 80 per cent.; jams and jellies, 33-Jper cent.; hops, 25 per cent.; linseed meal, 20 per cent.; maccaroni and vermicelli, 50 per cent.; preserved milk, 25 per cent.; peel preserved in brine, 66f per cent.; soap, n.e.i., 50 per cent.; apparelwoollen, silk (not piece goods), 10 per cent.; apparel (not woollen, silk, or piece goods), 15 per cent.; paste for leathers, 5 per cent.; polishes, stains, and varnishes, 5 per cent.; bricks-glaze d and fire, fire-lumps, 5 per cent.; fire-clay manufactures, asphalt and roofing-tiles, 5 percent.; glass, 10 per cent.; gelatine, sheet, 66 per cent.; soda crystals, 50 per cent.; picture frames, 5 to 15 per cent.; mirrors, 10 per cent.; wicker, cane, bamboo, or wood articles, 5 to 25 per cent.; casks and spooks, 15 per cent.; timberbent, 5 per cent., axe-handles, 5 per cent.; leather manufactures, 10 per cent.; leather cut into shapes, harness, razor strops, and whips, 10 per cent.; paper manufactures for advertising, 25 per cent.; paper bags, 25 per cent.; stationery, blotters, billheads, <fcc., 10 percent.; rugging, 5 per cent.; carriage mats, 10 per cent.; cosies and cushions, hats and caps (sewn), 37|per cent.; piece goods, wool, 5 per cent.; ammunition, shots, bullets, and slugs,, 20 per cent.; lamps, 5 to 10 per lampware, 5 to 10 per cent.; washing machines, 10 per cent. ; horse gears, 10 per cent. ; weighbridges, 5 per cent.; blacking for leather, 5 per cent.; dressing for leather, 5 per cent. ; oils for leather, 5 per cent.; inks for leather, 5 per cent.; and several other articles on which as to Victoria the duties have been reduced considerably. responding reduction made in the price of of 5 per cent, on jewellery and imitation these articles to the consumer. as well as a farmer, and up to the present clocks, which would provide £9,220 ; and an time my firm have not advanced the prices of more than half-a-dozen articles in the Tariff. I particularly inquired the other day whether the price of tea, in ordinary use amongst farmers, has been increased. I found out that the Melbourne merchant has raised, by £d., the price of tea, which is retailed to the farmer at Is. 3d. per lb.; but that the storekeeper has not charged that ^d. on to the consumer. articles on which revenue duties are imposed have been raised in price ? stated that I have pledged myself to the retention of the farmers' free list. In committee I shall endeavour, in accordance with my pledges from the platform, to have put on the free list corrugated iron, traction engines, trough iron, lubricating mineral oils, kerosene, and sewing twine. I shall also endeavour to have put on the free list, iron .tanks, which are very largely used by the farmers in the dry districts. I desire to get a reduction made in tlie duty on reaper and binder twine. The two factories in Victoria do not confine their operations solely to the manufacture of reaper and binder twine. They also manufacture rope, mats, and many other articles; and even if their industiy be interfered with to a slight extent, it is only right that producers should get the benefit of a reduced duty. I am quite aware that the reduction of the duties on these articles will diminish the estimated revenue to a considerable extent. The estimated duty on corrugated iron is £13,800 ; on iron tanks, 10 per cent.; £7,560 ; on kerosene, £157,500 ; and on reaper and binder twine, nil. I would also support the reduction of the duty on salt by 10s. per to n ; this will mean £9,800. cent; I would also support a reduction by one-fourth of the proposed duty . on soft-wood timber; this would amount to £29,795. If the whole of the estimated revenue is required, it is only fair when we suggest a reduction of the duties on certain articles to indicate how the deficiency could be made up. My idea of how it should be made up is that there should be an increase of Is. per gallon on spirits, jewellery, which would produce £7,375 ; an I am a business man increase of 5 per cent, on watches and",99,Honourable Members

As a representative of the producers, I think that bicycles come' into unfair competition with farmers who breed horses and grow horse feed; therefore I would tax them as much as I could. I would raise the duty on silk in tlie piece from 15 to 25 per cent., which would provide £63,146. The increases I advocate would amount to £223,458, and the reductions to £218,455, so that the one would pretty well balance tlie other. There are many other anomalies in the Tariff. I strongly object to the composite duties. I do not know where this method came from. It is entirely new to all Australian Tariffs, and the objection is that it is misleading as it hides the real amount of the duty which has to be paid. All commercial and business men strongly object to composite duties, and in committee I shall vote for their alteration, because it is only fair that we should know exactly the amount of duty which we are called upon to pay. Another matter I wish to mention is the mode in which the Government are collecting tlieir duties. It appears that they are charging duty on the cost of carriage from the factory to the port of export, and on the package itself. This is quite new to ""Victorians, and I certainly think that some explanation should be made by the Government in justification of their action. I have here the bill of lading of a small shipment of axe handles which has arrived from America since the imposition of the Pederal Tariff, and I think it speaks for itself.

349,Mr Phillips,"I have another exbenefit conferred by customs duties so far as one particular section of our producers is concerned ; I refer to the fruit-growing industry, and particularly to tliat branch of it relating to the preparation' of dried fruit. We have a most successful fruit-growing settlement at Mildura, in my electorate, and I have a few statistics here that will show what protection has done for the dried f r u it industry. Mildura was brought into existence some fifteen years ago as the result of the Victorian protectionist policy, and is now one of the most thriving settlements in the State. The fruit-growers there have 9,000 acres under frui t cultivation, and in 1S9S the value of their products amounted to £64,866 ; in 1S99, to £72,302 j in 1900, to £93,504, and in 1901, to £113,000. The population of Mildura at the last census was 3,329, and the production per head of the population, including every man, woman, and child there, amounted to £ 4 0 . The capital expended on the settlement totals £819,000. Company expended £ 4 0 7 , 0 0 0; £52,000 has been expended by tlie water trusts, and the settlers have laid out £360,000 in tlie improvement of the 9,000 acres they have under cultivation. Mr G. B. EDWAKDS -They robbed me of £200. slightest doubt that Mildura will become tlie sultana producing centre of the world. I am creditably informed that the world's production of sultanas amounts to only 17,000 tons, and that all of this particular class of f r u it comes from Arabia and the Levant. The production of this particular raisin at Mildura amounted last year to 10S tons. The great advantage Mildura possesses over any other part of the world is that the raisins can be dried by natural means, whereas in the Levant and Arabia they have to bo dried by means of kilns, which deprive them of their brightness, and some of their weight. There are no sultanas in the world equal to those produced at Mildura, and, without doubt, before many years a very great proportion of the world's supply will come from this settlement, which has been built up under protection. that the producer does not derive'all the benefit he might under a protective policy, but he does enjoy some very great advantages. In 1889 the Victorian Parliament remitted no less than £1,642,611 to the from New Zealand by the Wesf.ralia on her last producers of the colony in the form of capital that had been advanced to them, and interest that had accrued in connection with water and irrigation trusts. £330,748 was remitted to the settlers in the Wimmera. Not only that, but the Government have now started the construe tion of waterworks for the benefit of settlers in the southern portion of the Wimmera, which are estimated to cost £234,428. The State Parliament of Victoria has placed a sum of £25,000 upon the Estimates, in addition to the £50,000 which they had previously provided for the purpose of making up the deficiency in the railway revenue caused by a reduction in the cost of carriage of the farmers' grain to market. Another £20,000 has been expended in my district by way of mallee road grants. One of the latest of the concessions which have been made to tlie producers has reference to thecarriage of manures, which are now being conveyed by the Railway department at a The Chaffey Brothers' loss. The manure traffic upon the railways is destined to be a very large one. Throughout the whole of the northern portion of Victoria quite a revolution is taking place in connection with drilling and manuring. When speaking of the duty upon agricultural implements I omitted to mention that I shall endeavour to obtain a remission of the I have not the duty upon seed drills. I understand that only one factory in this State manufactures these drills, and that its attention is not confined exclusively to their manufacture. This factory also turns out harvesters and other machinery, so that it will not be injuriously affected by the remission of this particular duty. To give honourable members some idea of the extent to which the seed drill will be used in the near future, I may mention that in the small town in which I live no less than 120 drills have been sold this year. Each drill represents an average use of 10 tons of manure. I trust, therefore, that I shall have the assistance of honourable members in obtaining a remission of the duty upon seed drills. It has been said that the producer derives no benefit from a tax upon produce such as onions, wheat, eggs, oatmeal, &c. In this connection I should like to read a clipping I am quite prepared to admit from the Age of yesterday, having reference to the effect of the Tariff upon the exports of New Zealand. It is as follows :A comparison of the cargoes shipped to Sydney few trips gives an idea of the effect which the",101,Shitment Of Fittv Six Cases Or Lamp Glasses
350,Mr Phillips,"Federal Tariff is likely to have on New Zealand's exportation.? to Australia. In September, 906 tons were taken from New Zealand, consisting of 577 sacks of oats, 75 sacks of wheat, 7,245 sacks of potatoes, 26 sacks of peus, 563 bales of hay, 120 cases of bacon, 64 cases of cheese, 129 bales of flax, 86 casks of tallow, 19 sacks of hides, 11 bales of hops, and 62 tons of sundries. On the present trip, the first which the Westralia has made to Sydney since the Federal Tariff was announced, she carries only 730 tons, including 7,353 sacks potatoes, 43 sticks peas, 9cases bacon, 9 cases cheese, 60 bales tow, and 10 tons sundries. Not a sack of oats, wheat, barley, flour, oatmeal, malt, seed, or hides is on board ; nor is there a ease, bale, or cask of tinned milk, hay,flax,hops, twine, skins or tallow. But for the potatoes there would have been only 62 tons of cargo in the ship's hold, instead of the usual 730 tons. I think that extract speaks for itself. I have no desire to occupy the time of the House at any greater length. Almost every honourable member has spoken, and we are all anxious to take a division upon the motion as soon as possible. I have no hesitation in declaring that I shall support the Government. A t the same time, I intend to take the fullest advantage when we get into committee of the opportunity which will be afforded for rectifj'ing the anomalies tliat I have pointed out, and for securing a reduction of many of the burdens which I think now rest upon the shoulders of the producers. had a very long sitting, and have now reached the early hours of the morning. In view of this fact, I should like to know if the Government can see their way to grant an adjournment till a later hour in the day 1 late that we cannot see our way to anything. cannot urge that I have been responsible for keeping the House late. I have sat through the debate of the past fortnight without contributing to its prolongation up to the present moment. Many honourable members have spoken, as indeed they had a perfect right to do on a matter of such vast importance. But the Government ought to have some little consideration for honourable members who have sat here so patiently for two or three weeks past. I do not think it is too much, at this hour of the morning, to ask for a short adjournment, so as to enable us to deal fairly and honestly with this question. I fully recognise that the Treasurer and the Minister for Trade and Customs had a unique task to perform in the preparation of this Tariff. They have had to deal with the diverse interests of the different States, and to endeavour to bring about uniformity by means of an acceptable piece of legislation. This was a gigantic task, no matter by whom it was undertaken, and I and others are prepared to sympathize with the Treasurer and the Minister for Trade and Customs. We are now dealing with Tariff proposals from a national stand-point but there is no doubt that in our discussions we have been tempted to look at the Government proposals from the stand-point of the States. That was to be expected, because we have uot yet obtained that more complete and wider knowledge which will be ours by-andby. The discussion has had a considerable colouring of State politics, and I must confess that I shall be compelled to look at the question very largely from the stand-point of my own State of New South Wales. I have been reminded that I had something to say on the fiscal question when the address in reply was before the House. If I remember rightly, I , on that occasion, indicated that I considered the issue which would be presented to us was much complicated by what are known as the Braddon or bookkeeping provisions in the Constitution. The Tariff proposals now submitted to us confirm the view that there (Canobolas) -We have would be the difficulties which I and others foresaw on that occasion. A great deal of the trouble that the Government now have in placing these Tariff proposals before the honourable members and the country arises from the provisions in the Constitution to which I have referred. During the discussions which took place on the question of the acceptance or rejection of a Constitution, and also in the brief remarks I made on the address in reply, I stated that I believed the Braddon sections introduced a bad and unsound principle into our Commonwealth finances. Whatever Government undertook the duty of formulating the first Tariff--it does not matter from which side that Government was formed-wa s bound by the Constitution to assist in financing the States. By the taking over of the Customs and Excise, the different States lose a certain amount of revenue, and the alternative is either that of economizing the expenditure of the States and making good the deficiency by means of other forms of direct taxation, or placing upon the Federal Government the obligation of providing the States Governments with",102,Shitment Of Fittv Six Cases Or Lamp Glasses

The obligation that has been imposed upon this Parliament, and upon the Commonwealth Treasurer, is to finance the Federation, plus the extra amount that the Braddon clause requires. But this Government, instead of adopting this sound polic)', and thereby gradually teaching the States to become self-reliant and to make good the amount they have lost hy the transference of their right to tax through customs and excise-instead of leading them to get upon a sound financial basis, and so prepare the way for the time when the people of Australia Mr Brown, the can legislatively eliminate the Braddon blot from the Constitution have taken the other course of making it the first principle of their Tariff proposals to tax for State purposes and to finance the States.

States would have entered the Federation if they had been told what the honourable member now advocates. part of their previous means of financing in consequence of the consummation' of federation, but the States still have large powers of taxation which they can exercise. My opposition to the Commonwealth Bill-a n opposition that was consistently carried right through the different referendumswas largely based upon the financial weakness that I saw in the Constitution, as well as upon the undemocratic methods adopted for bringing about alterations of the Constitution, and allowing the people to adjust the Constitution to their own requirements. I placed those issues clearly before my electors, making no secret of my opposition. I believe that had others who are now singing out about the system been as faithful to their trust to the people as I and a fewothers were, the Constitution would have been rid of those blots that are found in it to-day. My complaint against the Government is that they have adopted this wrong basis. They are intensifying and perpetuating the evil by constituting themselves taxgatherers for the States, and making the States dependent upon the Commonwealth for their ways and means of finance in years to come. I simply wish to indicate the foundation principles upon which I took exception to the methods of taxation adopted by the Government in the formulation of their Tariff proposals. I thoroughly believe that the functions of government are to bring about the best social and moral conditions for the community. I do not believe that the Government is constituted merely to collect taxes, to expend money on public works, ancl to maintain law and order in a community. I believe that where the functions of government can be used to make the condition of the people better and more humane, and to elevate the community, they should be so used. I know that 7 in the great political struggles that have taken I thoroughly believe place, and are taking place to-day, there is a difference of opinion as to the extent to which governmental interference should be carried, and as to the extent to which it is possible for the functions of government to assist in improving social conditions. have taken WhilstI recognise that the welfare and prosperity of tlie community are largely affected by questions of taxation and Not one of the methods of government, I believe that the powers of government can be advantageous]}' used in other directions, and that if they are not used in the direction of bringing about better social conditions, the Government are responsible for the unsatisfactory conditions which remain. I consider tliat the fact that we have in the community an increasing wealthy few on the one hand, whilst on the other hand we have those who toil from daylight to dark under conditions tliat are as hard sis it is possible for conditions to be, is the outcome of bad legislation in the past, and. of the operation of our form of government. Where we find that the legislation passed has failed to bring about, proper social conditions it is our duty, if we are loyal to our humanity, to remedy its defects. This is where I differ to some extent from some of my protectionist friends and from some of my free-trade friends. My protectionist friends seem to think that we shall have reached the millenium if we get an ideal form of protection ; and some free-traders think that all that is desired is an ideal form of free-trade, and that then everything will be just as it ought to be. I do not believe that. I believe there are other matters we shall have to deal with in our legislation ancl in our administration of the government with which we are charged, and that we must deal with them upon proper lines before we can bring about the improved social conditions we aim at. I have to make my choice as to which of two systems will be most conducive to the reforms in the direction I consider legislation should take in order to attain that ideal -whethe r a system of freedom of commerce or trade, or a system of restricted commerce and restricted trade. I have no hesitation in arriving at a decision, and as the outcome of the best intelligence I can bring to bear upon the question my decision is that while I will not say that advancement or good -social legislation is not possible under a system of protection, I do say that the experience of the past is that protection is the mother of monopoly, and",104,Shitment Of Fittv Six Cases Or Lamp Glasses

On the other hand, a system of freedom of commerce assists in bringing about reforms, ancl placing them on a sound basis, and that is why I favour that system. Any one who has supported any line of reform, will know by experience that he has to meet the opposition of those whose interests are against reform. Adam Smith says thatA Member of Parliament who supports every proposal for strengthening monoply is sure to acquire, not only the reputation of understanding trade, but great popularity and influence with the order of men whose numbers and works renders them of great importance. If he abuses them, and still more if he have authority enough to be able to thwart them, neither the most acknowledged probity, nor the highest rank, nor the greatest public services can protect him from the most infamous abuse and detraction and personal insult, and sometimes from a real danger, tlieir share of the new expenditure. arising from the insolent outrage of furious and disappointed monopolists.

Men's hats, costing 7s. 6d., are taxed to the extent of 40 per cent., and men's dress hats at 28£ per cent. I wonder how the Treasurer can explain the great difference between the hats that are used by the ordinary working men and those which are commonly patronized by the wealthy.

W it h the advance of education and science, which are deadly enemies of the narrow restricted spirit that underlies protectionist ideas, protection will gradually disappear. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports laughs at that. trades unionist talking about restriction. does not know what trades unionism is. When the House met first, the honourable member interjected from the opposite corner that he could not understand how a man could be a free-trader and a representative of labour. In this debate the honourable member followed the honourable member for West Sj'dney, as true a labour representative as ever stood upon the floor of a legislative chamber, and as able a man as the labour ranks of New South Wales have produced; and though on the first occasion he doubted how a man could espouse democratic legislation in the labour interest, and claim to be a trades unionist and a free-trader, on this occasion he claimed for himself the same disinterested sincerity that he was prepared to concede to his fellow member. a time the education of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports proceeded so far, I have yet hope that he will learn what trades unionism really means, and that it does not necessarily mean the placing of burdens upon the shoulders of trades unionists. BeforeI leave the argument, that because of the antiquity of the protectionist theory and doctrines, aud the extent to which they have dominated the world, the Federal Parliament cannot go very far wrong in accepting this form of taxation as a policy for the Commonwealth, I would like to remind honourable members of the comparisons which have been suggested between England and America. The honourable member for Gippsland seems to think that because England is importing a great deal of the wealth of the world she must very quickly go into the Bankruptcy Court. 19 s 2 tion ; he also introduced the factors of Dr. and Cr. nations. honourable member laid it down, and certainly protectionist theorists lay it down as a cardinal principle, that the exports of a nation should exceed its imports, and that the country which imports more than it exports is becoming a debtor nation. If that contention is correct, a number of the great nations of Europe are gradually drifting towards the Bankruptcy Court. While the imports of Great Britain are £178,000,000; I laugh at the idea of a those of Germany amount to £56,000,000, and are gradually mounting higher; France, £40,000,000; Holland, £21,000,000; Switzerland, £17,000,000; Belgium, £11,000,000; Denmark, £7,000,000; and Sweden, £6,000,000. They are all gradually going along thissupposed road to bankruptcy. If we come to compare New South Wales and Victoria in this respect, we shall see the way in which their policies have been operating. We find that in 1881, according to Coghlan's statistics, the internal trade of New South Wales was £20,683,445 ; and of Victoria £22,284,415 . The principle of protection was brought into operation, and we see its effects. In 1S99 the New South Wales trade amounted to £32,402,14S. or an increase of £11,718,667 between the years 1881 and 1899. Victoria's volume of external trade in 1899 was £22,930,572, or Seeing that in so short an increase during the same period of £646,121 .

438,Mr Brown,"He did not use thoseunderlies the idea of a wage fund. It is one of those economic fallacies which obtained currency in the distant past, and on which the protectionist doctrine was largely founded. of the fathers of it ? the existence of the wage fund theory. Later inquiries and research by equally competent economic writers and thinkers have disproved the wage fund theory in its generally accepted sense. One of the modern writers upon this question, Professor F. A . Walker-a n American-in his work entitled "" The Wages Question,"" deals with the matter in Chapter VIII . in this wayThe popular theory of wages is based upon the assumption that wages are paid out of capital, the saved results of tlie industry of the past. Hencei t is argued capital must furnish the measure of wages. On the contrary, I hold that wages are, in a philosophical View of the subject, principle does not work out in America, as paid out of the product of present industry, and hence that production furnishes the true measure of wages. . . . The employer purchases labour with a view to the product of labour, and the kind and amount of that product determine what wages he can afford to pay. I do not agree with the theory that a wage fund is provided out of the money that holders of capital invest in an industry, and that their interests must be conserved, even if it is to the detriment of those who have to labour. If it is sound, then protection member think that that bears upon the is sound. If that theory is correct, then question before the Chair? the only way in which we can advance the interests of the workers and improve their ing the argument that it is necessary to condition is by making the conservation adopt a Tariff of protectionist incidence in and protection of accumulated capital our order to keep money in the country. If primary consideration. understood the Treasurer had in view when be simpler to enact that no money should be he referred to this principle. I hold tliat allowed to go out of the country, and see the working man makes his own wages. what I want to give him a chance of doing. that expression of opinion from the ing. The only exception I feel disposed to Treasurer. All that I ask in addition is take to his address is that it was largely in that the working people shall not by legisthe nature of a special pleading, and if his lation be placed under the heel of capital, arguments were carried to their logical but that they shall be given as free access conclusion, the deductions would as possible to the forces of nature. That have been those which were drawn will enable them to produce their own by him. One of tlie reasons for which wages, and to obtain the greatest amount this Tariff commended itself to him was from tliat production. contract or competition about that. Competition comes in where, by legislation and Governmental enactment, we shut out the great mass of humanity from their natural opportunities, and give the right to a few individuals to say whether or not a man shall live on God's earth. In that way we set him in competition with his fellow man. In that way we create the wage fund and the iron law of wages, which is not a natural economic fact, but the outcome of our unnatural social and legislative conditions. There is another theory, that the imposition of customs duties is necessary, in order to keep money in the country. I think the Treasurer used that expression in the course of his speech. It is a most extraordinary thing that, notwithstanding tlie taxation, imposed by countries which have, adopted the principle avowedly for that purpose, they do not succeed in retaining the money within their boundaries. I find that this those who espouse the protectionist policy for that purpose would lead us to believe. Whilst there was a low Tariffi n America the exports of money were less than under tlie high Tariff which obtains there. Victoria has produced as much gold as any other place in the world of corresponding size. Its total ""gold production amounts to about £250,000,000. That is what I that is a desirable thing to do, would it not how that would operate.

446,Mr Brown,"Yes. I am answerthat under some of the conditions under which factories are being conducted in Victoria. The honourable member for South Australia, Mr Poynton, quoted from a Government report respecting the manufacture of matches in this State. Tliat report shows that in 1894 the importation of matches was, 190,000 gross, and the Customs revenue £14,500. decided to provide a further avenue for employment in Victoria, and duties were imposed to encourage the establishment of a match factory here, with the result that Messrs. R. Bell and Co. commenced operations. matches has fallen to 5S,300 gross, and the Customs revenue to £2,915, while the local production is put down at 231,700 gross. Now, in Sydney the price of matches is 2s. per gross, while R. Bell and Co. sell tlieir matches at 2s. lOd. and 2s. l i d . per gross, so that they obtain from the consumers of matches in this State l i d . upon every gross, or £10,620. The factory employs eight males, whose wages average ISs. 8d. per week, and 41 females, whose wages average 14s. l i d . per week, while the total amount paid in wages per annum is about £1,750. Therefore, the result of the duties is to give 49 employees £1,750, and the manufacturer who employs them £8,870. The honourable member for Bland made reference to this industry as a hot-house industry, and spoke of its insanitary conditions. No doubt those who are not acquainted with the methods which obtain there are apt to ' associate it with the unhealthy factoriesof the old world, where phosphorous poisoning is so greatly complained of ; but from personal observation I am able to say that all the arrangements are highly creditable to those who conduct it. The process of phosphori/.ing is conducted in the open air, and the work is performed by competent men, not women or girls, and I have been told that the danger of phosphorous poisoning is not nearly so great as in the factories of the old world. But I agree with the honourable member for the Bland that it is a hot-house industry, and that there is no reason why it should be fostered at the expense of the community. member does not think the figures quoted are connect ? Inspector of Factories in Victoria. wrong. ber assures me that I am wrong, I can only say that I did not see the return on which they are supposed to be made. I took the information from a quotation which appears In that year it was in the address of the honourable member for South Australia. There are a number of other matters which might be considered at length. I listened hist night to the address of the Minister for Home Affairs, in which he laid down another protectionist theory, Since then the importation of that the man over the water pays the duties. That is a very comfortable theory. either. any means. many cases. honourable member say "" in many cases,"" because it is true in only those cases where the manufacturer exports at a loss. Mi-.

If , as the Minister for Home Affairs contended, the exporter paid the duty on the goods consumed here, we should be very glad to encourage him to export, in order to get from him the sinews of war for financing the Commonwealth and the States. production to produce that result. the theory which has been strongly put forward by a friend or a supporter of the Minister for Home AffairsMr J. P. Wright, a large boot manufacturer in Sydney. A t a meeting of the boot manufacturers held in Sydney on the 11th October, this gentleman moved this motion, which was earnedThat in the opinion of this meeting it is advisable that the price of boots and shoes should be immediately advanced in proportion to the extra cost of production consequent on the imposition of the Federal Tariff. As soon as this Tariff was submitted, these manufacturers held a meeting and decided amongst themselves that they must advance the price of their boots to compensate them for the extra money which they had to pay",114,Shitment Of Fittv Six Cases Or Lamp Glasses

459,Mr Brown,"I notice that this is notfor their raw material which comes into the countiy. Home Affairs is correct, then this taxation is not paid by the boot manufacturers, and should not be passed on by them to the consumer, but is paid by the producer of the export. ButT think that, as in a good many other cases, when it comes to the working out of the theory, it must give way before actual, practice. I shall leave the different theories which have been advanced by the previous speakers with these brief criticisms. of figures quoted here about the relative positions of New South Wales and Victoria, to show the advantages of one Tariff as against another. If certain figures can be produced which tell in favour of Victoria it is claimed that it demonstrates the Tariff superior to that which obtained in New South Wales, and viae versd. There may be some truth in this contention, but I freely admit that the mere setting opposite each other of tabulated sets of figures, and attempting to prove from them a theory is very unreliable ground to work upon. There are other factors which play an important part in determining any conclusions which may be arrived at, and unless weight and consideration be given to those factors there is the possibility that figures used lo prove a certain thing do not do so at all. But on both sides it is generally admitted that fair deductions may be drawn from a comparison of the increase of population, and making certain allowance from the relative increase and prosperity of the manufactures in the States, the wages which are paid and the conditions under which labour operates, I find from Mr Coghlan's invaluable statistical work, The Haven Colonies, that the increase of population between 1851 and 1860 was 123,097 in New South Wales, and 398,753 in Victoria; that between 1861 ancl 1870 New South Wales showed an increase of 45,539, and Victoria an increase of 38,935; and that between 1871 and 1880 New South Wales showed an increase of 109,341, and A iotoria a decrease of 12,672."" 7 The table from which I am quoting shows distinctly the excess of immigration over emigration, or the reverse, as the case may be. Whilst Victoria started with a lead of something like 200,000 in the shape of an increase during the decade from 1851 to 1S60, she showed a decrease, during the ATr. Brown. decade from 1871 to 1880, of 12,672. New If the theory of the Minister for South Wales, during the same period, showed an increase of 109,341. Therefore, whatever advantages may be claimed for the system of protection, it must be admitted that in the case of Victoriai t did not operate to increase the population at anything like the same rate as in previous years ; whilst the opposite principle of free trade did not operate against New South Wales, inasmuch as the increase of population in that State during these decades was There has been a great number substantial. Prom 1881 to 1890, New South Wales showed an increase of 164,205, and Victoria gained in population to the extent of 112,097. Coming to the last decade, from 1891 to 1899, New South Wales exhibited an increase of 30,225, but the that population of Victoria decreased by 127,2*21. which obtained here was Coglilan sums up tlie 2x>sition thus :IE the results for the last nine years be compared, it will be found that Victoria lost 127,221. by excess of emigration, while on the other hand Western Australia gained 112,689 persons during the same period. South Australia also lost to the extent of 1,983. The remaining colonies all gained slightly. Dealing with the year 1899, the exodus from \ ietoria was sufficient to more than r counterbalance the arrivals in all the other colonies, so that for the first time in the history of Australasia there was displayed the remarkable fact of the departures exceeding the arrivals. Notwithstanding the fact that from the very foundation of the colonies up to 1899, there had been a gradual increase in all the States, and the population of the Commonwealth had been considerably added to by excess of immigration over emigration, in 1899 the tables were reversed, and the Commonwealth showed an excess of emigration over immigration. That is to say, it lost a proportion of its population, and was on the down grade. This retrograde movement in population was almost wholly attributable to the State of Victoria. Victoria more completely than any other State had adopted the protectionist policy of taxing out the goods of the foreigner for the purpose of finding increased work for her population; and it must be a matter of very grave concern to staunch protectionists in Victoria to find that in spite of all their efforts their State is almost entirely responsible for this retrograde movement. On the other hand, New South Wales, notwithstanding her free-trade policy, contributed her fair share towards the increase of the population of the Commonwealth. In the year 1899, according to Coghlan, Alctoria had 3,027 separate factories, whereas in New South Wales there were 2,912 ; or a difference in favour of ""Victoria of over 100. There were employed in Victorian factories 44,041 males, and in New South Wales factories 47.063. In the Victorian factories there were .16,000 females employed, against 8,000 in New South Wales. Coghlan sums up the figures relating to this subject as follows:Compared, with other colonies the proportion of factory hands who are women is larger in Victoria. There, out of 57,433 hands in 1889, 8,327, or 14'o0 per cent, were females, while in 1899, of 06,070 hands, 16,029, or 26 7 per cent., were females. In 1S89, prior to the great financial crisis, when things were prosperous throughout the whole of Australia, Victoria had 3,000 factories, and New South Wales had the same number. Victoria had 49,000 males employed, or 7,000 more than New South Wales, and she had S,000 females working in her with ""4,000 in New South Wales. Her factory hands numbered ll,S64 in excess of those employed in the New South Wales factories. In 1893, when the financial crisis occurred, and when the true stability of the factories of the two States was thoroughly tested, the results disclosed, according to Coghla/n, are very much to the disadvantage of Victoria. A t that time the number of factories in Victoria was reduced to 2,673, as against 2,052 in New South Wales, thus leaving an excess of 625 in favour of Victoria. The males then employed in Victorian factories numbered '32,000, as against 36,000 in New South Wales. There was thus an excess of 4,000 males in favour of New South Wales. Altogther, 39,473 hands were employed in Victorian factories, as against 38,918 in those of New South Wales. Thusi t will be seen that the number employed in Victorian factories between 1SS5 and 1899 was reduced from a surplus of 11,000 over that of New South Wales. to an excess of only 555. To put tlie matter in another way, the increase of male hands employed in New South Wales factories between the years mentioned was 10,673. The increase of males in Victorian factories during the same period was 2,499. New South Wales, therefore, under this condemned system of free-trade, which it is urged is inimical to industry, found an outlet for 10,600 of her surplus population, whilst Victoria, with all the artificial assistance which her industries had received through the medium of protection, could provide an outlet for only 2,499. The decrease of males in New South Wales between 1889 and 1893-that is, during the time of the financial crisis-wa s 6,546, whilst the decrease in Victoria was 17,956. Of the native-born population of the latter State, 120,000 had matured to manhood during the period indicated. Victoria had established her factories, had levied upon her people largely through customs and excise, and had called upon those who were engaged in her primary industries to specially subsidize these factories in order to open up avenues of employment for her boys. New South Wales, on the contrary, had worked out her progress upon sounder and more natural lines, with the result that she found an outlet for 10,600 of her population as against Victoria's 2,499. My friends, the Victorian protectionists, will have a very hard task to destroy the significance factories compared of these figures. If they could be quoted against New South Wales as they can be against Victoria, what a different tale we should have heard from honourable members of this House. How our ardent protectionist friends would have brought them forward as evidence of the superiority of their fiscal doctrine as against that which obtains in the sister State of New South Wales. I think that these facts disclose a state of affairs which must be of very grave concern to those who believe in protection, and who hold that that fiscal policy is really intended to develop our resources by opening up remunerative avenues of employment. It has been contended that the increase in the factories of New South Wales has been chiefly in the primary avenues of production rather than in the complicated avenues of manufacture. I have a set of figures here compiled from the same source which show the increases that have taken place in New South Wales in industries which in Victoria are supposed to have been specially assisted by the Tariff. Comparing the year 1896 with that of 1900, I find that in biscuit manufactories there was an increase of hands from 485 to 830a substantial advance. In confectionery manufactories the employees increased from 475 to 706 ; in jam and f r u it factories, from 452 to 713 ; in boot and shoe factories, from 3,526 to 3,953 ; in hat and cap factories, from 73 to 280 ; in furniture and bedding manufactures, from 1,039 to 1,773 ; in coach and waggon factories, from 1,230 to 1,574 ; in glassware factories, clothing factories, from 2,724 to 5,568. These are industries which have been specially fostered by the protectionist Similar industries receive no special assistance in New South ""Wales, and yet in that State they have contributed very largely, as I have shown, to the increase in the avenues of employment. wages paid and the conditions which obtain in these industries, the difference between the two States is not very marked when all things are taken into consideration. Victoria there is special legislation providing for wages boards, of which there are something like 24 in operation. ""Wales there is no special legislation for the regulation of wages. piled recently we learn tliat in the industries I have mentioned Victoria 13,000 males over eighteen years of age employed of £2 0s. 5d., while the total number of persons engaged is 17,286, at an average wage of £1 13s. lOd. In similar industries in New South ""Wales there are employed 10,755 males over eighteen years of age, at an average wage of £""1 18s. lid., while the total number employed is 13,297, at an average wage of £1 13s. 6d. This shows an advantage to Victoria of Is. 6d. or 2s. in the case of adult males, and of 4d. in the case of those under the age of eighteen. females the difference is more marked. Victoria there are 6,614 females over eighteen years of age employed at an average wage of 18s. 4d., while the total number employed is 9,274, with an average wage of 15s. 3d. are 2,486 average wage of 14s. lid., while the total number employed is 4,455 at an average wage of lis. od. In this class of labour Victoria shows ah advantage of 2s. 8d. for adults, and of 3s. lOd. for those under eighteen years of age. These differences have been created largely by the operations of the wages boards, which have no doubt had a good effect in this particular direction. absolutely necessary in order to deal with the question of wages and of the social condition of the working people in Victoria. That the hoards have been successful to the extent I have shown every one must be pleased to know. I am glad that these boards have resulted in obtaining Mr Brown. conditions in the factories, better payfrom 190 to 369 ; and in ment for work, and in the suppression to a large degree of the sweating which previously obtained. ""We can policy. see very readily how these reforms have been resisted by manufacturers who are supposed to be advantaged by protection, but who complain that if the boards are allowed to continue they will be compelled, ""With reference to the to close their establishments, because they cannot compete under the wage system which is insisted on. If the Victorian industries cannot compete with those of In New South ""Wales under the circumstances,, there must be something radically wrong, and whatever the cause of that may be, In New South it is something which the system, of customs taxation cannot remedy. A t the present Erom a return comtime I understand that there is a committee of inquiry investigating tlie comthere are in plaints of the manufacturers, and is eliciting evidence primarily for the purpose at an average wage of showing that the conditions which are insisted on by the wages boards, are too stringent, and so much to the advantage of the workers a3 against the manufacturers as to render the latter unable to successfully compete with the manufacturers in tlie sister States, particularly in New South ""Wales. ""Whilei t may be difficult to draw these deductions from the mere statement of figures, the latter indicate what is beingcontended ; and I should like to read In a quotation showing the need there was In for wages boards in Victoria. The quotation, which describes the conditions which obtained amongst the factory hands of Victoria under the protectionist system before these boards were established, is from an In New South ""Wales there address by Senator Barrett in the Carlton females employed at an Orderly Room, on 6th March, 1895, during the agitation for tlie reform legislation. Senator Barrett, a gentleman well known, who ought to be an authority on these matters because of his connection with tlie labour movement, statedThe conditions were such that the worse forms of 'sweating existed in tlie colony to-day, and were worse than in Great Britain. Kngland was immeasurably superior to Victoria in that But these boards were called for as respect just now. Senator Barrett, who is an ardent protectionist and a strong believer in the efficacy of assisting labour aud promoting industries under that system, was compelled to confess that in Victoria, at tliat time, the conditions better were worse than in free-trade England, where there is a greater pressureof population, unci where, according to him, there is a wrong fiscal policy. matter, in dealing with which I do not wish to be understood as saying anything derogatory to the Victorian working men. J. have seen the Victorian working man in New South Wales. He has assisted wonderfully to develop the productive resources of that State, despite the supposed disadvantages of free-trade under which he had to work. Victorian working man has been that whenever it became a question of an industrial dispute, and of pitting against inert metal on the part of capital against hunger and need on the part of labour, we have been compelled to continue the struggle on very unequal terms, because the Victorian working man was prepared to accept conditions to which our workmen refused to submit. I do not wish to be misunderstood on this point. We have in New South Wales men who will blackleg on their fellow men, but these are the parasites of labour. The squatter or mine-owner who recruits his surplus labour from amongst that class of men finds one experience of them sufficient. It is a much more costly form of labour, and much more unsatisfactory than the labour against which he is fighting. The Victorian working man, however, is no parasite. He is a real worker, but he has been shoved out of employment in his own State, and his need has compelled him to become a blackleg in New South Wales. When he has obtained a position in our State that gave him greater independence than he had previously, he has become amongst our staunchest unionists. If the Lucknow mine-owners were compelled to get sufficient men to replace those obtained them from the parasite class I have described, they would find that they would be better without them. But, instead of that, they came over here and engaged Bendigo miners, practical men, to replace New South Wales miners. The same has been the case when we have had strikes of printers, bootmakers, shearers, and other workmen. This matter appeals practically to our New South Wales working men. It is better than a bushel of statistics to them. They ask, "" If the working man in Victoria is so well off under a high Tariff, how is it that he is willing to come to our State to work for lower wages than satisfy us?"" We have also had a similar experince in regard to working men from New Zealand. There is another In 1890, men from New Zealand were brought to New South Wales to take theplace of our own men in the .shearing sheds in connection with a dispute which took jjlace. But from 1895, or thereabouts, since New Zealand has married her protective Tariff toan enlightened progressive policy, and hasdeveloped her natural resources, we have been relieved of that trouble so far as she But our complaint against the has been concerned. In our recent strikesand labour troubles we have not been called upon to pit our working men against working men from New Zealand. tionist. something more than protectionist. W h a t I am saying is that the Victorian working man has been educated to suppose that protection is a panacea for all his evils, with the result that the reforms that would have tended to his betterment have been neglected. Those reforms have been taken up in New Zealand by the progressive democratic spirit there, which is responsible for the improvement in the condition of the workmen. There is another matter I should like to deal with, and that is the agricultural developments that have taken place. In the year 1S81 we in New South Wales had 2S1,8SS acres of land under Crop. In Victoria there were 926,729 acres under crop. In 1891, ten year's later-, New South Wales had an area of 365,366 acres under crop. In Victoria the area was 1,332,683 acres. In 1899 the area in New South Wales had increased to 1,426,166 acres, and in Victoria to 2,165,693 acres. In 1891 tlie wheat returns of New South who went on strike, ancl Wales showed a yield of 3,966,668 bushels, and in Victoria 13,629,370 bushels. In 1899 the yield in New South Wales was 13,604,166 bushels, and in ""Victoriai t was 15,237,948 bushels. Mr Coghlani n a paragraph dealing with this table of statistics says that;The greatest increase in production is shown by New South Wales, which in 1809 produced nearly 10,000,000 bushels more than in 1891, and from the following statement, which gives the proportion of tlie total crop produced by each colony between 1891 and 1899, the progress made by New South Wales will be evident, for whereas in .1881 and 1891 it only produced 11 per cent. Victoria and New Zealand show the largest declines, the proportions falling from 38 per cent, and 28 6 per cent, in 1891 to 31 4 per cent, and 17 '7 per cent, respectively in 1899.",115,Shitment Of Fittv Six Cases Or Lamp Glasses

461,Mr Brown,"But New Zealand isWe are led to believe that the duty on wheat is of great benefit to the farmers by shutting out the external competition against which they are supposed to have to contend, but Mr Coglilan points out that instead of the duty being a benefit to the farmer, it is simply a make-believe, one of those things which look well on paper, but which in practice confers no benefit at all. A t page -515 of his Seven Colonies, there will be found tin's important paragraph relating to this matterTlie reeoi-ds offcliesix States forming the Comone of those who have taken a leading monwealth show that since 1.879 there were only four years during which they were forced to import wheat from places outside their boundaries. Those years were 1880, 1889, 1896, and 1897. In the first year the wheat crop was a partial failure in Victoria and South Australia, and almost a complete failure in New South Wales and Queensland. In 18S!) there was ngeneral failure in New South Wales and Victoria. In 1896 the crop failed in A'ictoriu, and in the following year that colony, for thefirsbtime in 22 years, was compelled visited America, and who, being of an to import wheat. The neb import, however, being only 61,160 bushels. Mr Coglilan there clearly demonstrates that the wheat production of the Commonwealth is such that, except in times of drought, WQ can not only pro videfor our own needs, but must find an outlet for surplus production. So that the farmer of Victoria, who is bearing the burdens of this Tariff, which have been described by members of the A ictorian State Legislature in the way I have id ready referred to, has to find a market for his produce, the price for which is regulated by what can be obtained in Mark-lane, which regulates the wheat markets of the world. The latest statistics I can find show a decrease in the area under wheat in New South Wales and Victoria, due to drought and other causes ; but while the decrease in area in Victoria amounts to 200,000 acres, in New South AValesi t amounts to only between 60,000 and SO.OOO acres. the fact that the value of the return per acre has decreased from £ 2 in 1891 to £ 1 5s. in 1899. that the New South Wales farmer has had to compete with an open market and with the A^ictorian farmer, though he was not on' the same footing with him to the extent to which the Victorian farmer was protected. Still, despite that disadvantage, with the other advantages he possesses he has been able to make headway, and the returns I have quoted indicate the relative positions in which the farmers of the two States stand to day. Two or three speakers have discussed tlie price paid for reapers and binders, and it has been stated that, because of protection, the farmer in Victoria can obtain a reaper and binder much cheaper than can the farmer in New South Wales, who, it is said, is under the iron heel of an importers' ring, from which the Victorian farmer is able to escape. Iknow a little about this particular matter, as 1 can claim to be part in the farmers' movement in New South AA-ales. I can claim to be one of those who assisted in the formation of the' valuable representative organization known as the Farmers and Settlers' Association of New South Wales. Among the delegates to our conference about four years ago was one who had inquiring turn of mind, had made exhaustive inquiries into the conditions under which farming was carried on there. He discovered that these machines for which we were paying from £ 5 5 to £ 6 5 each could be purchased in America at prices ranging between JL'IS and £ 2 6 . AVe were told that the importers were responsible for the difference, and we believed that statement. r Eventually we decided to do our own work. AVe formed a Settlers' Co-operative Association, and such a body, worked on sound financial lines, can do more for the farmers than any protective policy could do. AVe resolved to import the reapers and binders for ourselves, and communicated with a firm doing a large trade in Australia with a popular make of machine. AVe discovered that it could not be obtained at the reduced price because of the existence of a combination, but we were advised that another machine, built for the South American fields, and differing only slightly from that to which we were accustomed, was not within this combination, and could be landed here at a price more in accord with the cost of production in America. AVhen we entered into negotiations for its It must be remembered purchase, however, we were informed by the representative of the manufacturer's agent in Australia that the undertaking which he had made with us was not approved by the American and Canadian manufacturers. They had formed a ring to control the Australian trade, and had an understanding among themselves that they would not sell",119,Shitment Of Fittv Six Cases Or Lamp Glasses
462,Mr Kennkdv,That is accounted for by,120,Shitment Of Fittv Six Cases Or Lamp Glasses
463,Mr Brown,"under a certain price. Our efforts were thus defeated for the time being. As the result of further negotiations, we got in touch with a manufacturing firm in America which was outside that ring, and obtained from it a number of machines. We were able to sell them at a profit of £ 3 5 each, as against the ±'55 and ±'65 which we had been paying previously. The Minister for Trade and Customs had something to say about wheat-growing in South Australia, .and he may be interested to learn that we -came to the assistance of farmers there by selling them a number of our machines. As soon as we introduced them, the syndicate in Now South Wales considerably reduced its prices. A much larger reduction was made in Victoria, but that was due to the fact that the agents here got at loggerheads. . As soon as the parties come to terms, however, we may be sure that the prices will. rise. This fact serves to show that the high prices, instead of being the work of the importers, have been due primarily to the manufacturers' combination. They refused to deal with us when we were prepared to do business with them direct. This incident shows also that the fanners and settlers, under a sound system of co-operation, can do more for themselves than under any protectionist system that could be devised. I have occupied considerably more time than I had intended at the outset. I want to say, in conclusion, that I am a poor man. I had the misfortune to be bred and born in the back parts of New South Wales. in being born in any part of Australia. honourable gentleman who interrupted me before I had completed my sentence. I was bred and born in the back parts of New South Wales when pioneer conditions prevailed. I had to bear the burdens of the pioneer, and shared none of the advantages of those who live in the city. I have had to work hard to cut out a home in the forest of Australia, and I had to commence work at a time when most young people are pursuing their educational studies. Despite that fact, the electors out there, believing in my sincerity of purpose, and in my desire to advance the democracy of this country, have placed me in the high and honourable position that I hold as a Member of the Parliament of the Commonwealth. WhilstI occupy a seat in this HouseI do not want to do anything that would be to the detriment of the democracy that I represent, or to the working people from whom I come. It is because I view the matter earnestly and seriously in that light that I intend to vote against the Government proposals. I do not claim a monopoly of experience or of brains, nor do I wish to insinuate anything against my fellow countrymen. I give honourable members on the Government side of the House the credit that I take for the Opposition ; but. viewing the issue from the stand-point which I have endeavoured to put forward, I should regret the fact all my life if, at the outset of this new nation, in the moulding of which I hope to have a part, I gave my vote for a piece of legislation such as a Tariff, placing the burdens of taxation upon the working people of Australia. lengthy debate on a question which has been already worn threadbare, an honourable member who rises at this juncture to address the House is placed somewhat at a disadvantage. It is only because I have had a little experience in countries other than that which is my native land, and particularly in connection with an industry which has come under the lash, that I desire to say a few words before the vote is taken. I am at one with the honourable member for Canobolas iu wanting to do my utmost to improve the position of the workers, not only here but in other lands, and it is because I believe we can do that better under tlie fiscal system supposed to be set forth in this Tariff that I support it , I agree with the right not that I believe it goes far enough in the direction of protection. It is well known to many honourable members that I am a Victorian who had the good fortune, which does not fall to tlie lot of every one, to work at my trade for a number of years in England, and for about a year in the United States. The conditions I found as a workman were not those which have been quoted by many honourable members on the other side from a book, circulated from one to the other, in which Mr John Burns, whom I respect, and Mr Keir Haidie put forward their impressions of the United States. 1 admit that my impressions of that country are not the result of a visit of a week.

466,Mr Tudor (Yarra),"Afte r such aknowledge. I have worked there, and what I am about to state is my practical experience gained in different parts of England, and in different parts of the United States. I was told by one gentleman that even if I proved that my wages were higher in the United States or Victoria than in Englandi t would mean nothing, that these were representative men, and, therefore, better qualified than I am to speak upon the question. who has taken an interest in labour politics is not so well known all over the world as is that of Mr John Burns or Mr Clarke. He is speaking of the cotton Keir Hardie. But I have held, if I may say so withont egotism, the highest position which a trade unionist can occupy here. I have also held high official positions in my own trade union in England and the United States, so that I can speak with some degree of authority as a representative of the workers in those countries. America? Connecticut and New Jersey. In Victoria my wages had been Is. 3d. per hour; but in England they were 7d. per hour, and that is the rate ruling there to-day. Honourable members may say tliat that condition might be owing to the trade unions not being so well organized in one place as in the other. But we pride ourselves that our trade union is pretty well organized, and in several districts in England, the United States and Victoria, we can say what perhaps no other society can say, that every man who is eligible is a member of the union. I do not think that even the strongest trade union, the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, can say that in regard to any district in Australia, England, or the United States. Honourable members on both sides have compared the conditions in Australia with those in England or those in the United States. For a number of years I lived in a manufacturing town in the north of England. I find that the standard of life in a manufacturing village is not so high to-day as it is either in Victoria or in the United States. 1 am comparing the workers in the same trade, and not a worker in one trade in one place with a worker in another trade in another place. I am comparing men with whom I lived and worked, not for a few days, but for nearly a year in one case, and for a number of years in another. A little work I hold in my hand describes the conditions in a manufacturing town in England to-day. I visited most of the manufacturing towns in the North of England-cotto n towns, woollen tradetowns, and others, aud the conditions are set forth more clearly in this book than I could describe tliem. I am about to quote from ""The Effects of the Factory System,"" My name as a man written by the editor of a newspaper in a manufacturing town in the North of England. I refer to Mr Allen trade, which, perhaps, is one of the most representative of all the free-trade trades in England, and it was practically as much for the cotton trade as for any other that England adopted free-trade. He draws a picture of Bolton, although he could draw a similar picture of nearly every manufacturing town in the north. ""We have been told hy honourable members on "" WILLIS In what part of tlie other side of the House that if we had protection we should get shoddy. I worked in the States of Taking the number of factories in England aud tabulating them, I find tliat there are no less than 125 doing nothing but manufacturing shoddy to-day. Out of 1,184,4-31 persons employed in factories of all kinds in England, no fewer than 52S,795 are employed in cotton mills, so that nearly one-half are employed in cotton mills of which he draws this pictureEverywhere you will find steam hissing and smoke scowling; factories, forges, furnaces, chimneys, coal pit-heads, streams fouled by chemical works-thes e are the bulk of the scenery in the Shire of Smoke. That is the general aspect of the county. Now, let us take a typical cotton manufacturingtown. WewilltakeBolton, because I know it best (and as I said before, I only intend to write about what I know). Let us stand in Bolton Park, which is like an isle of dingy green in a black sea, the charm of the place being utterly obscured by the fact that, from whatever part of ityou raise your eyes you meet a prospect of smoking towers. .Looking south we can count nearly 200 tall chimneys rising ugly over a mass of briek buildings thab look as if they had stood for years in a climate where it rained ink every day. There are 152 cotton-spinning firms in Bolton at the present time employing 12,000 cotton operatives. AVe have been told by honourable members opposite that in protectionist countries the tendency is to displace males with females, and adults with children. AVe find that out of the 12,000 operatives who are employed in the cotton mills of Bolton",121,Shitment Of Fittv Six Cases Or Lamp Glasses
467,Mr Henby,,122,Shitment Of Fittv Six Cases Or Lamp Glasses
468,Mr Tudor,"to-day there are no fewer than 2,400 halftimers. I feel confident that if honourable members had seen the children going to the mills in the way that I have seen them, and had realized that the employment of child labour had been one of the factors in bringing about England's greatness, they would not be so fond of preaching about the good that free-trade has done for her. that sort in America? across anything of that kind in America. Although we have had continental countries held up to us as terrible examples so far as the workers were concerned, I may mention that the age at which children are allowed to go to work in England is lower than in any of the continental countries. conferences of workers from different countries have been held, complaints have been made that England is one of the most backward of nations with regard to the employment of child labour. It has been said by some honourable members that if wages arc high in any particular trade, the purchasing power of the money received by the workers is relatively not so great. It has been argued that a man receiving 32s. or 33s. a week in England would be as well off as if he were getting £ 3 a week here. My experience does not bear out any such idea. I find that I can make 20s. go just as far in Melbourne as I could in Manchester. I admit that in some instances articles would be cheaper in Manchester than in Melbourne, but food products and articles of daily consumption would, on the whole, be much cheaper in Melbourne than in England. Clothes and boots might be a little cheaper in England, but not so very much. Referring to the half-timers in England, I can draw upon the experience gained in the county in which I was working for the greater part of my time in England. Abstract for 1894, there are 48,133 boys and girls working half time in the cotton industry. We are told that it is only in protectionist countries that females are replacing males in the factories, but out of 48,133 half-timers there are 25,432 girls as compared with something less than 23,000 boys. In tlie woollen trade there are 19,000 half-timers employed, and in the worsted trade 37,000, making a total of 101,000 half-timers engaged in the cotton, woollen, and worsted trades alone. The writer from whom I have quoted these figures saysFigures can give no idea of the hideous truths that we can see in the pale faces and thin weary heads. These cannot be put into statistics. This gentleman, prior to becoming an editor on a newspaper, was a teacher in a school. He saysFor eight years I taught in public elementary day schools in a cotton town, and iu all the schools in which I was a teacher there was a great proportion of half-timers, and I speak from experience when I say that I often pity the half-timers unci excuse their lessons. I have seen these children going to the factories in the early morning when I have been going to work at half-past five. They start before breakfast, and work for about When two hours in the morning, and then, after getting some breakfast, they work four hours, and having had a small meal at the mill, rush off for their books and go to school for the afternoon. The writer continuesI have seen them fall asleep over their lesson books or tasks, after they have been in the factory all tlie morning (six hours). They were generally dull and sleepy, and it was often downright cruelty to force them along tlie curriculum fixed by the education code : but the schoolmaster, no matter how tender his heart, was forced to prick them to the pace, or risk censure, and perhaps loss of place, for not keeping the school up to the standard and getting the expected amount of Government grants ab the annual examination. In spite of bhe alleged sharpness of half-timers, no schoolmaster likes them. The testimony of all the teachers in Lancashire is with me on this point, that halE-timers, as a rule, hamper and hinder the progress of the vest of the class. Archdeacon Wilson, of Rochdale, in an article on ""Half-timers,"" writes:-""There is the physical health point of view. Now, from this point it is perfectly clear that the children, especially from the neglected homes, suffer. I caused all the boys in my boys' school to be weighed and measured in the autumn of 1891, before the halftime age was raised from ten to eleveu."" I was there during that year, and I know According to the Statistical the outcry that was raised by the parents against what they considered to be the uncalled for legislative interference by Parliament with their sending their children to work when they liked. It is further statedThe results were disputed, and the Rochdale School Board of that date willingly took the matter up, and made similar measures in their schools. Their figures confirm mine, and showed that while children who are not half-timers grow uniformly in height and weight from the age of eight to that of twelve, our Rochdale children, many of whom were half-timers, received a sudden check in the rate of growth at ten, and the lower",122,Shitment Of Fittv Six Cases Or Lamp Glasses

470,Mr Tudor,"No, I did not comerate was continued till the age of twelve. Our children are below the average size, even at eight, nine, and ten, from many causes, chiefly improper food and early neglect; but the disparity was even greater at eleven and twelve. These measures were repeated at the end of 1.894 in my school (the newly-elected school .board refused), and, since the half-time age had been raised in the meantime to eleven, the measures were of much interest. It became quite plain that the check in the growth at ten had disappeared, and that a much slighter check was apparent at eleven. In other words, these measures, so far ns they went, proved that tlie work of these children iu the mills from ten to eleven stunted their growth. We have been told by tlie leader of the Opposition that in England the trades unions are so strong that practically they have only to ask in order to receive what they want from their employers. As one who has had a little experience in that matter, I am sorry to say that the honourable member is not exactly correct in his statements. I went through a very long strike in England in 1892, when the society of which I had the honour of being assistant secretary-on e of the strongest societies in England-wen t down before the employers in one of the midland districts. We only asked for one penny farthing per dozen ; but gentleman will take the trouble to read The White Skvr.es of England, he will see that many societies have been crushed by the employers when they only asked what I consider were fair terms and improved conditions to which they were entitled. The leader of the Opposition has declared that the trades unions of England are practically in a position to secure compliance with their demands. That has not been my experience of trades unions in the old country. In reference to the effects of the factory system of England upon children who have to work half-time, I wish to read a quotation from Dr. Torrop, of Heywood, one of the largest manufacturing centres in Lancashire. Speaking of that system, the writer saysThe promising child of ten degenerates into the lean and sallow young person of thirteen ; and this process is continued until a whole population becomes stunted ; and thus the conditions of life in factory towns become a real source of danger to England's future. After 25 years' observation of factory life, I have no doubt tliat the height, weight, and physique of Lancashire factory hands is below the average of England. The deficiency is greater iu full-timers than in half-timers, and is not made up iu adult life, but goes on in accelerated ratio. Mr Tudor. Further On he statesI t must be borne in mind that the medium average of Lancashire factory children is nob equal to the average elsewhere. Tho latter standard is hardly reached by the 341 children described as superior (out of 2,000 examined), while the medium division (1,10(5 of the 2,000) is greatly below the standard of good health. This is much more distinctly marked amongst children of thirteen-""full-timers "" who have passed, some years in the factory-bha n it is in bhose of ten years of age. Of (iO healthy children, averaging thirteen and a half years, and taken as they came (31 girls and 29 boys), the average weight was 74 lbs., pr 14 lbs. below the average of good health elsewhere. It will be seen, therefore, that the children who worked half-time in the mills were 12 per cent, smaller than were tlie average children all over England. This result is. not creditable to a countiy which boasts of the position it has attained under free trade. against factory work altogether"" knows we have been told that the children in protected countries go to work at an earlier age than they do in free-trade countries. Figures have been set before us. with a view of proving that factory children we lost. If the right honourable go to work earlier in protectionist Victoria, than they do in free-trade New South Wales. I am attempting to prove that in England they go to work at a more tender age than they do in any protected country throughout the whole of Europe. The right honourable and learned member for East Sydney says that the trades unions of England are strong enough to get exactly what they want. I will show what one of the strongest unions in that countiy-the Bolton operative spinners said in their annual report, which was issued in April, 1891, of the disadvantageous conditions under which the adult spinner has to labour. That report statesHe has to work in a temperature ranging from SO to 110 degrees Fahrenheit, and in a vitiated atmosphere, which is not completely changed even once a week. These conditions render him peculiarly liable to contracting chest complaints, and rheumatic affections. Mr Allen Clarke, speaking of the statements contained in the document from which I have just quoted, saysThat is true, as medical evidence testifies. Now, read what the very same body of men, the Bolton operative spinners, said at a meeting held to consider the half-time question only a month after they had issued the report containing the preceding statement.

472,Mr Tudor,"The honourable memberconsiclerecl the proposal to raise the age of halftimers from ten to twelve, we are strongly of opinion that such a step is entirely uncalled for, in the interests of the child itself, as, speaking wibh a full knowledge of the question, we do hereby assert bhab a child does not suffer, either physically or intellectually, as a result of becoming a half-timer, and we would, therefore, respectfully urge upon the Government not to accede to any demand for raising the age."" It should he remembered that this is the same body of spinners who a year later declared tliatEight hours a day was sufficient for adults under such trying conditions. Mr Allen Clarke continuesI am reluctant to write it, but it is a sad fact that the majority of parents in Lancashire regard children only as commercial speculations, to be turned into wage-earning machines as soon as the child's age and tlie law will permit. For this they oppose the raising of the age of half-timers ; for this resent all legislative interference, either educational or hygenic, in the matter of bheir children. Instead of fighbing for wages to keep their, children they are cowardly enough to let the children be forced to keep them. That is the position o£ one of the strongest trades unions in England to-day. An Honorable MEMBER -Who is writer ? the Northern Weeklya man who worked iu the mills himself, and who was schoolmaster in the Bolton district for eight years. In England there are 172,000 children labouring under this system-the most abominable system in existence in any part of the world. As we all know, Manchester is practically the home of the free-trade school. It is, in reality though not nominally, the capital of Lancashire. Out of that 172,000 employed in the factories of England, 93,969 of the ""half-timers"" belong to Lancashire. We have been told that many children there go about minus a linger or a limb. During my stay in that county I saw more cripples and deformities amongst children than I have seen elsewhere in all my life. Mr O'MALLEY -Was member ever in America? twelve months. 1 am notlike some peoplewho remain in a place for a very brief period, and get themselves interviewed by some smart journalist, with the result that an extract from their observations is quoted time after time by various speakers in this Parliament. I resided and worked in Lancashire, and I claim to know more about average, the wages paid to the alkali workers the conditions of its people than a person to-day are 50 per cent lower than they were five who sojourns there for a few days only can possibly know. We are told that in free trade England the trades unions can win their strikes. Did the strongest organization in that country win in ISS7 '( 1 refer to theAmalgamated Society of Engineers. No;. they went down. I was in Lancashire at the time of the coal miners look-out in 1S93, when the employers demanded a 25 per cent, reduction in the wages, and I know that upon that occasion workmen had to submit to a reduction of 12^ per cent, after they had been locked out for four months. The cotton operatives were locked out in 1892 in connection with a proposed 12 percent, reduction of wages, when the operative spinners held meetings to protest against the machinery of manufacturersbeing sent to India to be used against them. Yet honourable members tell us that protection is not heard of in England. I did not go as a visitor for a couple of days, and then write a book about theplace; but I worked there, and I found throughout the working classes of England,, especial!}' amongst the manufacturing the classes, an anxiety to obtain protection for tlieir industries. Hundreds employed in my own trade have said to me, "" We believe in free-trade for the stuff we cannot producehere, but we do not like to sne German and Italian hats being imported."" When I worked in London and in the Lancashire district, I found hundreds of people expressing the same sentiment. Instead of being dead, as many honourable members would have us believe, the feeling in favourof protection is very much alive, and I think there is likely to be an awakening in Englandi n tliat direction. We know thatstrong trades unions in many trades have had to be disbanded. What was the case with the Alkali Workers' Union in Lancashire after that trade had been absorbed by a trust 1 There was a large trust in the alkali industry in Lancashire before therethe honourable were many trusts in America, and I learn from the secretary of the union that the I worked there for about wages were reduced after the trust was formed, although the price of the commodity was raised. The employees are now receiving about 4s. a day; and this is the information given by Mr Healey, the secretary to the union, when speaking to the gentleman who wrote the book from which I have quotedMr Healey declared to me that, taking an",124,Shitment Of Fittv Six Cases Or Lamp Glasses

On 28th December, 1889, bi-carbonate of soda was quoted at £5 5s. per ton. During my visit to Widnesi t was quoted at £7 per ton. Salt-cake has advanced from Is. to 2s., caustic soda from 2s. fid. to 5s., while bleaching-powder, packed in hardwood barrels, which was quoted in 1889 at £5 10s. per ton, has advanced to £7 5s. And yet tlie wages have not been advanced. There are trusts in England just as in America. These are not the results of any fiscal system, but are amongst the growths of our civilization, and it is because the people in America are more advanced that they are taking advantage of the method of syndicating interests. As we all know, the English manufacturer is very -conservative, and loth to give up the idea that he can do better by himself than when .amalgamated with others. We have been told that women are not allowed to work in the coal mines of England to-day, and I do not think they are ; but 1 know that they work on the pit bank, where I have seen them in Lancashire, pushing the trucks. I -do not know tliat the practice is confined to that county. -of Staffordshire, from which the honourable member for Parramatta comes, women work in the brickyards, and carry 100 lbs. of bricks at a time to and from the heap. That is what may be seen in England to-day, and that is what some honourable members wish to see in Australia. They desire to reduce our school age, and have our children working half-time as in England after 50 years of free-trade, and they would like to see women working on pit banks and in brickyards. I for one am prepared in the interests of the worker to fight for improved conditions. If we manufacture the goods here I am convinced that either this Parliament or the State Parliaments will be able to enforce such terms as will materially improve the condition of the workers, whereas, if our goods are manufactured 12,000 or 15,000 miles away, we can have no knowledge of or control over the circumstances under which the work is done.

Perhaps the honourable member has forgotten the occasion when the military were drafted iuto the district as the police were on duty elsewhere-Lord Masham's were the mines concerned-in order to protect the present King of England, who was visiting Doncaster races. There was fear of a riot, and two miners, who were walking along the road, nearly three-quarters of a mile away, were shot down. America is not the only place where workers are shot down when striving for their rights.

483,Mr Tudor,"I thank the honorablemade for overtime, which is not the case in Sydney. We have been told that whenever a strike or lock-out occurs in any of the other States blacklegs from ""Victoria take the places of those on strike. I should be sorry if that were the case, and I trust it is not so; but if it were, we are no worse in that respect than they are in any of the other States. There has been a strike in an engineering firm in Melbourne, and the men who came to take the place of the unionists were blacklegs from Sydney, who are working here to-day. It will be seen that Victoria is not the only place which furnishes blacklegs when a strike occurs ; and what I have stated is on the authority of the secretary of the Engineers' Society. If things are so much worse in Victoria than they are in New South Wales, how is it that the iron workers of Mort's Dock struck to get the same terms as the Victorian iron workers ? How is it that the tailoresses struck to get the same wages as tailoresses were receiving in Melbourne? We have heard a great deal about the boot trade. It has been stated that this trade is in a worse condition in Victoria than in New South Wales-o r at any rate in no better condition-althoug h there are no wages boards in Sydney. Unfortunately, I have left at home two letters which I had intended to read bearing upon this question. One is from a manufacturer who employs the largest number of hands in Australia in the manufacture of boots. He manufactures in Melbourne as well as in Sydney, and in this letter he gives me the information which I shall quote later on, when the items of the Tariff are under consideration in committee. The wages he mentions as paid in Sydney are absolutely the same as the rates furnished by the secretary of the Sydney Boot Operatives Union. One of the representatives of the trade on the Trades Hall Council of Sydney told me that one cannot find 300 bootmakers in that city who have earned 25s. per week for the last six months. That is the position as stated by a man who is in a position to know, and it is borne out by the manufacturer's letter. The wages received in Melbourne are set forth in the report of the Victorian Factories Inspector. undertaken to show his books to prove the ago, there was an advertisement in the proopposite. Mr TU.DOBI hope it can be shown with master bakers who employed workmen by Mv. McMurtrie that the men are receiving 19 T good wages in Sydney. I desire that the workers should receive good wages throughout every State in the Commonwealth, and it is because I wish them to have good wages that I am advocating the fiscal system I do now. AlthoughI was born and brought up in Victoria, my views on fiscalism were not shaken by my four years' residence in England, but were rather increased in strength. I came back more firmly of the opinion than ever that protec? tion, if rightly applied in the interests of the worker as well as of the employer, is for the ad vantage of both. I am no believer, in a one-sided system. I believe in theworker getting his share under protection, and I would secure that by means of Factories Acts, such as we hiive in Victoria. But; it is to be remarked that the very newspaper which is leading the free-trade cause in this city has been persistently opposing the Factories Act, and recently was asking for its suspension. I find from the report of the Factory Inspector, that in the period dealt with by that document there were 1,564 bootmakers who were entitled to receive theminimumwage of £ 2 2s. per week but who received 44s. 9d. per week, or anavei> ageof 2s. 9d. per week more than the minimunr. It has been stated that the minimum in A""""ictoria as fixed by law becomes the maximum, but if honourable members will examine these figures they will see that what I have stated is correct. I know, of course, that the minir mum wage of £ 2 2s. is not given to boys of.. 13, 14, or up to 19 years of age, nor is thewage set down for workmen received by similar persons in New South Wales. I have his books, will eliminate those cases. The highest wages paid for the same workers in< New South Wales are 42s. 6d., and they godown to 42s. Those figures are based upon information supplied by employers. Leti t be remembered, also, tliat the Victorian minimum is not only paid in Melbourne, but likewise in Ballarat and Bendigo. I am aware that in Sydney bakers have received, after consultation with their employers, a wage of £ 2 10s. per week. I am very glad of that, but the bakers in Victoria obtained the same wage twelve months ago.

Some figures have been quoted in the course'of the debate from an honourable member of the Senate, showing that in the ease of hats and boots the duties in this Tariff range from between 30 to something like 400 per cent. I claim to know a little about the hat trade, and I can state this-tlia t the. duty in Victoria on the lower and medium class of goods has never been operative. Hats have been sold in Melbourne for Is. l i d . each, and they were far better hats than could be obtained in Sydney for the same money. While I was in that city, I took the trouble to go into eight shops, making purchases for myself in the way of handkerchiefs, neckties, and so on, but really for the purpose of examining thequality and price of the goods sold there. I as well as the United Statesi n order was able to satisfy myself from that inquiry that one can buy better value for the money in Victoria than in Sydney. I have fought for years as a trades unionist, and I have no doubt that if any fellow employee of mine were in this House he would tell honourable members that on numerous occasions I have been on deputations claiming the improvement of the condition of my fellow workmen. One of the principal advantages of protection to my mind is that it enables us to see that the workers who make the goods get their fair share of the advantage from the duty that is imposed. honourable members opposite have complained of the high duties under the Tariff, I have not heard any one of them say anything about the duty placed upon rice for the manufacture of starch. A good deal has been said about starch in general, but nothing on rice imported for its manufacture, although that duty amounts to 105 per cent. it. opposite have had their eyes glued to the question of starch, to such an extent that they have not been able to pay attention to the duty on rice. If the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Poynton, claims to be an exception, I hope he will vote for a decrease in this direction. trade in which I worked for a number of years, I wish to explain that I have not the slightest interest in it at the present time, except in so far as I wish to improve the lot of those with whom I have worked. The manufacture of hats cannot be called an exotic industry. We produce here the raw material for the manufacture of hats. We grow the wool which is the staple product of the cheaper class of hats, and also the rabbit skins which are the principal product for the finer class of felt hats. On no ground, therefore, can the pursuit of this trade be said to be like ""breeding polar bears at the equator."" It may, however, be said that the rate of duty is too high. There has been a duty of 25 per cent, in Queensland for a number of years, though they have not yet manufactured a hat there. They have a 30 per cent, duty on hats in Canada, and there are not twenty men engaged in their manufacture throughout the whole of the Dominion. I happen to know, because I was anxious to go to Canada to get work there. The duties proposed here are entirely moderate compared with the duties in the United States. We were told by some honourable members, and notably by the right honourable member for Tasmania, Sir Edward Braddon, that hats cost more in the United States than in any other part of the world, and that the manufacturer practically puts the difference in the price into his pocket. I know that that is incorrect. The honourable member was probably quoting from Rudyard Kipling, who may aim at the truth, but Although who, like some members of this House, is a remarkably bad shot. Nearly all the hats used in America are manufactured there, and the workers obtain more than twice the wages paid in England. I may say that when I was in the United StatesI obtained three times the amount of wages that I was paid in England. MrO ' MALLEY And they are 25 per cent, higher now. have from the secretary of our union in the United States does not bear out that statement. When I was in England the wages were not half as high as the wages paid in the United States, and less than half the wages paid in Victoria. chasing power compare ? that I could purchase as much for 20s. here as in Manchester or London, and I could purchase as much for five dollars in America as for £ 1 in England.

I went there for the purpose of studying the question on the spot, and remained there sufficiently long, I think, to bring away an intelligent idea of what I observed in that country. I worked in England for 56 hours a week, and for half the wages for which I worked 48 hours here. ber is making a one-sided statement all the same. ditions just as I found them in England. I know there are men in this State who worked with me, and if they saw a statement from me in Hansa/rd which they could refute, they would be only too pleased to correct it . I regret that I have to speak in this way of England, for I love the country, and, during my stay there, I made many friends. I would rather speak well of England than of America, if the truth lay tliat way, but I have been anxious to speak of the conditions exactly as I found -them. Some honourable members have said during the debate that they think the Tariff duties might be gradually reduced from time to time as industries become established. I do not believe they can. I believe that whilst the conditions of labour are different here from what they are in England, whilst hours of labour are less and the wages are higher, we cannot possibly continue the industry unless we have a reasonable measure of protection. Do honourable members think that Australians cannot produce as much in a week of 48 hours as the workers can in England or any other place? To say so would be to libel the Australians. I believe that man, for man, we can produce as much as any other people in the world. But we need the duty in order to make the conditions which the manufacturers here have to observe equal to the conditions observed in other States. We work only eight hours per day here, and they work longer hours elsewhere, and the wages are lower in England and in other countries. I know that in Italy, where we are likely to have great competition in some lines, the wages 19 T 2 are lower than they are in England. We were told by the right honourable leader of the Opposition that he was sorry to see the amount of duty placed upon tobacco, as it went entirely into the pockets of an American firm, and half was taken away to NewI believe I have been in York every year. I was surprised at the statement, because, believing in free-trade as he does, the right honourable gentleman should have been pleased if the whole went away. How can he complain about half going away? Personally, l a m in favour of the nationalization of the tobacco industry, so that the whole community might reap the benefit now being secured by a few individuals. I do not intend to delay the House longer. I think it is right that in the interests of the workers of Australia we should have a fiscal system under which they will I am stating the conbe able to reap some advantage as compared with the other nations of the world. confidence motion we have had a lot of discussion about the rights and wrongs of free trade and protection. I want to set myself right before I go any further. I am a labour man, and whether it is free-trade or protection that is going to give labour something I shall vote for it . That is my fiscal faith. Although a free-trader, if I could see that the worker would be benefited by any protective measure I should vote for it. We have heard a lot of talk about ""my country,"" but I may say that if the Victorians and New South Welshmen love their country, I love mine as much as they do theirs. I do not forget the country that gave me birth and infant nurture. I have heard my countrymen and women being run down and spoken of as being treated in the same way as white slaves; but there are proportionally just as many white slaves in Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, and the other States as ever there were in Great Britain. What was the condition of affairs in this State of Victoria only two years ago ? We know that the Attorney-General and the honourable member for Melbourne Ports have taken an active part in the suppression of sweating. All honour to them, and I hope that the day is not far distant when the same men will take up the banner for the Commonwealth of Australia, and give us a Shops and Factories Act throughout the Commonwealth.

That is how I feel in regard to fiscalism. Nevertheless, I gave my pledge to I have not yet met the electors that I would vote for free-trade. I said also that I would not vote one pennyThere worth of protection to any individual industry that could get along without it. If industries, such as are to be found in Victoria, which have been in existence for years, and have been protected up to 35 and 40 per cent, are unable to get along without further assistance, the sooner they are allowed to go to the wall Mr Poynton, has the better it will be.

I recognise, however, that had I declared myself a follower of the Prime MinisterI should still have been returned. I do not think, however, that the Government have treated us fairly and squarely.

If an honourable member has to hump the reports round with him during his electioneering tour, he will need a special conveyance. My constituents are pretty well versed in Hansard, and they will be questioning me very keenly when I return, and unless I have all these books of reference with me I do not know how I shall get on. I shall have to get them photographed, and put in a condensed form, so that they will be handy for reference. I shall not say that all this time has been wasted, though, perhaps, some honourable members may think so. I hope that we shall finish the debate to-day, and let us know the position we are in, and get on with business. Some Ministers have said that the time has been wasted. But I do not look at the debate in that light. I consider that the speeches on this, motion will be taken as part of the debate on the second reading of the Tariff Bill, and when the figures come to be analyzed, it will be found that the speeches in the two debates will have been very short ones indeed. able member going to vote ?

506,Mr Crouch (Corio),"I feel that it isdo so. The motion was moved, as he announced, and as honourable members on his side have announced, purely for educational and advertising purposes-no t that there was tlie slightest hope that it would succeed, but articles had not been taxed sufficiently-h e purely to demonstrate their principles to the people of Victoria, with the hope, as he said, of letting in fresh air. I only regret that he did not follow a rule which he recently adopted at two great meetings, representing, as he says, the voice of Melbourne and the voice of Sydney. A t those meetings, before he indulged in any funny speeches, he announced to his audience that he would take a vote. My regret is that a division was not taken on the motion immediately it was moved before any of the speeches which have wasted three weeks of good time here were made. A t the time. I interjected tliat it was a shocking waste of time. Considering that the Kanaka Bill, the Public Service Bill, the Post and Telegraph Bill, in regard to which certain legal difficulties exist in New South Wales, and other measures, are waiting for Parliament to take up, and that the whole Commonwealth is expecting this Tariff to be debated and some finality arrived at, I think that those who have listened during the last three weeks to good time being wasted will, when the season conies to judge of these things fairly, put tlie cause of the delay, and tlie blame for the waste of time, on the shoulders of the leader of the Opposition. On the night the motion was moved we were charged by the whip of the Opposition, the honourable member for Macquarie, with a conspiracy of silence. It was known then that the numbers were up. I did not know of any conspiracy of silence, but certainly it was an act of wisdom on our part not to speak, because I think, as everybody must acknowledge, that it is no good to waste good shot on a dead dog, and that is really what this motion has been from the very first. sense, because they spoke ? . interjection of the speech which the right honourable and learned member delivered two or three weeks ago. A very large amount of his indignation was bottled up because large duties were not put on silks, velvets, furs, plushes, pianos, and diamonds. Duties on such articles are really not protecdiamonds-the low imposts on which have tiveduties; this State does not want them, and it has never desired them. When the right honourable and learned member chose those duties for his especial attack, and caused the press throughout Australia to make attacks on the Government because the should have remembered that he was attacking, not protectionist, but revenue duties. Taking the Tariff which he introduced into New South Wales, what do I find ? I find that, instead of the enthusiasm and sympathy for the workers which he at the present time expresses, his revenue duties were imposed in nearly every ease upon the necessaries of life. treacle, biscuits, lollies, fruits, vegetables, currants, raisins, jams, liquorice, tea, and sheep washes. The things which the workers, the farmers, and the miners use most he taxed when he was Premier of New South Wales duties 1 right honourable and learned member did not put any duty on silks, velvets, furs, plushes or pianos. He did not weep then, and perhaps he does not weep now-h e is too deep for tears-ove r those different articles not being taxed. But he put all the taxes he possibly could upon what wrre necessaries of life to the three classes he mentioned in this motion of censure, and following as he does largely on the lines of the British Tariff, his motion shows the amount of class legislation there is in the free-trade policy of the British Government. An examination of the English Tariff shows that it includes a number of articles which are among the absolute necessaries of life. There is no such thing as a free breakfast table in England. Among the articles taxed are beer, ale, playing cards, chicory, chloroform, cocoa, coffee, confectionery, fruit, patent medicines, dried f r u it and raisins, soap, tea, tobacco, and varnish. These are the articles that are chosen for taxation by free-traders, or by revenue tariffists, to show how much regard they have for the workers. In addition to this, under the English revenue system, there is a duty on every farm house of from 2d. to 9d. in the £ 1 .

512,Mr Crouch,"In his Customs Act, thewhilst the necessaries of life are taxed to the fullest extent. Then we come to another member of the Opposition who has tried his hand at constructing a fiscal policy, and that is the honourable member for North Sydney. The honourable member says that the necessaries of life should be free, but he proposes to put a duty on sugar, treacle, lollies, currants, jams, kerosene, clothing, boots, and hats. Evidently he does not regard these as the necessaries of life for the working-man. He said in one breath that he would admit the necessaries of life free of d u t y ; but in the next breath put duties on hats, boots, and clothing. Then we come to the Tariff that has been proposed by the Sydney Daily Telegraph. It is by this newspaper that the leader of the Opposition and the members of the free-trade party in New South Wales live, move, and have their being. It is really only through this journal that tlie leader of the Opposition is in this House, or that he has any following behind him. The Daily Telegraph proposes a high duty on tea, and upon all the necessaries of life that are in daily use by the working classes find by the farmers and miners-by all those people who have received so much sham consideration at the hands of tine mover of this motion. In the Daily Telegraph list, jewellery, watches, musical instruments, and plated ware are taxed exactly to the same degree as boots, hats, clothing, and blankets, and thus we find the necessaries of life subjected to just as much duty as luxuries. The Daily Telegraph also proposes to place a tax upon agricultural implements. Tlie honourable member for Wentworth proposed to put a 5 per cent, duty upon everything. proposes to raise £8,009,000; and the honourable member for North Sydney suggests a Tariff which he says will yield £S,048,000. The Daily Telegraph proposes a Tariff that would give us £9,000,000, and the Argus proposal would provide a revenue of £8,750,000. The leader of tlie Opposition, however, has no suggestion to make at all, but contents himself with adversely criticising the Government proposal. Then, in addition to these proposals, we have that of the honourable member for Parramatta, who says that although he was once a protectionist, he is now a free-trader. He says that he was simple when he was a protectionist, and that the scales had not fallen from his eyes when he wrote tlie extraordinary letter which has been already quoted from in this House. I would ask the honourable member if he was simple when he made this statementI have seen with mine own eyes men with pretty constant work die like rats from sheer starvation, and all because of the decline of the tea, export trade, and the increase of the imported article. I should like to know how far the honourable member's simplicity affected his vision. I think it is very deplorable that attemptsshould have been made by the leader of the he proposed to Opposition, and by a large number of members sitting behind him, to arouse throughout New South Wales and other States a large amount of prejudice against the State of Victoria. The Victorian protectionists and manufacturers have been held up to general opprobrium, and I find that at the great free-trade meeting that was recently held in Sydney, Mr J. H . Carruthers, a leading light in the great free trade firmament, who was a member of the Reid Ministry, saidThis is not a Federal Tariff. Make no mistake about that. (Cheers.) It's a Victorian Tariff, look, stock, and barrel ; made in Victoria by Vietorians, and for Victorians. Sir William ton is one of those self-sacrificing statesmen who has always been prepared to let his own State carry the full burdens of federation that the others might enjoy whatever profits weie to be obtained from it. (Renewed cheers.) I would not be surprised if Mr Barton offers the federal Chief Justiceship to a Victorian, and the High Commissionership to some South Australian federalist, leaving to New South Wales the sole comfort of having a Federal Premier a New South Welshman. I venture to say that if a statement of that kind were made by a responsible public man The Treasurer in any other capital, with the intention of provoking provincial strife, the speaker would be hissed off the platform. This statement was made in the presence of the leader of the Opposition and other members of this House who offered no protest against it, but who apparently countenanced such utterances, irrespective of the extent to which they may be destructive of good feeling between the States, simply because there is a fear in the hearts of some Sydney importers that they may lose a certain amount of tlieir import trade. That is really what is at tlie root of this agitation. Yet we are told that the voice of Sydney approves of the position which the leader of the Opposition has taken up",132,Shitment Of Fittv Six Cases Or Lamp Glasses
513,"Lyne Was Always A Victorian Inheart, And Mr Bar","The right honourable and learned member has declared that the reason why Victorian honourable members are protectionist is because protection is popular. That is a charge which he made in this House. These sort of statements go down in New South Wales, but I do not think they will be tolerated in any other part of the Commonwealth. learned member who utters these sentiments aspires to be the leader of the Federal Government, and to guide the destinies of a united Australia. Yet not many months have elapsed since he told a New South Wales audience that the other States desired federation only because they wished to exploit New South Wales. He declared that the other States were almost insolvent. That is the sort of man for whom we are asked to upset the present Ministry, in order tliat he may cross the floor of this House and become the leader of the Government. I have not previously referred to the honourable and learned member for Parkes, who has written a book containing 685 pages upon Liberty and Liberalism. I have read that book, with instruction to myself. It is just as well that one should come to understand what is regarded as liberalism by free traders. in reply to the Governor General's opening speech, I was not able to deal with the question of free-trade versus protection, but I expressed surprise that great radicals and democrats were amongst the free-traders upon the other side of the House.

A lot of others pretend to be free-traders, but are afraid to follow that doctrine out to the logical conclusion to which the author of Liberty and Liberalism has carried it. If those who speak against protection, against interference with the liberty of the subject, and, indeed, against anything but individualism, follow free trade to its logical conclusion they must oppose all progressive legislation. But the honourable and learned member for Parkes has already found a disciple in the present leader of the Opposition. In this debate the right honourable and learned member for East Sydney said Then our democratic friends had to go one better and pass another Act to establish wages boards to bring wages up.

The direct taxation of New South Wales amounted to £761,000, as against £655,000 in Victoria, which represents, as I have said, l is . 3d. per head in each State. These figures show that Victoria had need of customs duties, and tliat New South Wales tried to get along without them, but did so only by spending £3,000,000 a year of capital in order to keep afloat. The end must come to such a course as that. learned member's statement be correct, when the customs revenue of New South Wales was only £400,000 short of that of Victoria? AVhy should New South Wales -spend £3,000,000 a year in order to make up the deficiency in Customs revenue ? £3,600,000 of capital recklessly used in making up the deficiency caused by extravagance, whereas we diture, and, in consequence, lost a large part of our population. That is the real reason for the loss of population which Victoria has suffered since 1891. The Government of New South Wales were able to spend on an average £2,600,000 a year daring the five years the right honorable member for East Sydney was Premier, in order to keep the men who were unemployed in that State, and attract others from Victoria. That is the real explanation of the population question, which it is not necessary to enter upon further. Last year New South Wales received £2,820,989 of land revenue,as against a land revenue in Victoria of £353,000. That shows that New South Wales had, in this respect, an advantage of over £2,000,000 of land revenue, which was applied to her needs simply because she had not dared to face the position in the past. Free-trade was adopted, but was not successful.

I do not think there is another newspaper in Australia which would print such stuff as in any sense an expression of public opinion. No other city and no other State except Sydney and New South Wales would wildly cheer such references. The fight on this occasion is not for free-trade or protection. There is no need to go into the principles which are involved in such a discussion, and the honourable and learned member for North ernMelbournewiselyavoidedthatissue.

530,Mr Crouch,"greatest success, in opposing it , by taunting some old gentleman at a public meeting about his artificial teeth ! For myself, I believe in protection and I think I have a reason to do so. Protection has been a magnificent thing for Victoria, as it will be for the Commonwealth of Australia. I am, therefore, heart and soul a protectionist. I believe in this policy, because it means prosperity for our workers, prosperity for our farmers, prosperity for our miners, who, if not directly benefited by a protective Tariff, are certainly benefited by the general prosperity of the community which follows from it . Every class of tlie community is benefited directly or indirectly by protection. I venture to assert that a large part of the prosperity of Australia is due to the protective policy that has been adopted in most of the 'States. In fact, a good deal of it is due to Victoria and Victorians. May I quote a well known line, with a variationWhat do they know of Victoria, who only Victoria know? Some years ago an attempt was made to give the then colony of New South Wales the name of "" Australia."" If any State should be called ""Australia "" it is Victoria. Victoria has sent her best men, her energy, her enterprise, her brains, her money to all parts of the Commonwealth, and to the advantage of all the States. Even some members of the Opposition originally came from Victoria, and they are in themselves the best evidence that wherever Victorians go they almost always succeed. For the reasons I have given, I think that those who want to serve the Commonwealth best will advocate this policy, and do their utmost to enable the Commonwealth to prosper under a Tariff which, if not exactly on the lines of the Tariff now before us in all its details, will be generally upon those lines, and in accordance with the policy of the Government. ister for Trade and Customs) -It is not a very easy task to address the House on a subject of great importance, after the very long sitting in which we have been engaged, and which has necessitated my constant attendance in the chamber, and my abstinence from that nightly repose which is so neeessaiy to weary men. However, I am confident that I shall have, in my attempt to do my duty in summing up a few of the matters which ought to be put before the House on behalf of the Government, the assistance of the goodwill and consideration of honourable members. First, I should like to clear up one or two matters on which-unwittingly , no doubtI have been misrepresented by prominent members of the Opposition. The first to which I would refer is the statement made, in the plainest possible terms, by tlie right honourable member for Tasmania, Sir Edward Braddon, that in declaring the Tariff proposals of the Government, I had said that this was a protectionist Tariff, with revenue incidental to protection. Sir, I never said anything of the sort, nor anything like it . I said precisely the reverse. I put the matter so that it was impossible of misconception if the right honourable member had listened to what I said, and had not taken his information on the subject second hand. I used these wordsWe recognise fully that at this time in our history neither free-trader nor protectionist can have his way entirely. The Tariff is a compromise Tariff, but at the same time it gives effect to our policy. . . . as declared at Maitland, which required that our Tariff should be framed so as to produce an amount sufficient to allow of there being returned to the States their ordinary receipts plus their share of the Federal expenditure. I said that our policy was furthermoderate protection, parti cularly avoiding tlie unnecessary destruction of existing industries. AndI emphasized my position again in these wordsThe objects of the Tariff were of varying importance. They were, above all. to obtain revenue, to preserve the solvency of the States, and to keep faith with them, because the}' entered into federation on the understanding that they would be so protected,and their right to bhe redemption of that promise continues unabated bo-day. I venture to think that our opponents must have a bad case, indeed, when they rely for the substantiation of their indictment against the Government-levelle d chiefly at their Tariff proposals-o n a complete misrepresentation in the most specific terms, of what the position of the Government was, and put words into my mouth which I not only never uttered, but never thought of uttering. Then, sir, the leader of the Opposition took it upon himself to sneer, amongst other things, at my reference to intercolonial free-trade, as if I had no sympathy with it . He said that the words in which I ""proclaimed""-that was the word he himself used-intercolonia l",136,Shitment Of Fittv Six Cases Or Lamp Glasses
531,Mr Kingston (South Australia,"Minfree-trade, came "" slowly and heavily"" from my lips. Sir, the right honourable and learned member knows, and every honourable member of this House knows, as the public of Australia know, that I have never wavered in my advocacy of federation, intercolonial free-trade, and protection against the outside world ; and I say that a suggestion of that sort made concerning me is altogether unwarranted, as no one knew better than he did. I say that for various reasons. One of these is that I had the honour of being associated with him in the federal movement right through the piece. Further, I was engaged in the movement and doing my best to foster it, when he was opposed to it in 1891, and when his attitude in connection with federation subjected him to the criticisms which have been levelled against me, and to which I need not refer. I , at least, was steadfast in the faith. I go further, and tell the right honourable member that when he sneered at my advocacy colonial free-trade, he might well have remembered that when he first formed a Government in New South Wales-before , in fact, it had been formed-the moment he was sent for by the Governor-h e received a suggesting action in connection with intercolonial free-trade. I corresponding with the previous New South Wales Government tlie Dibbs Government. I had not been successful. The Dibbs Government was overthrown in August, 1894, and on the 1st August, 1894, this right honourable gentleman, who sneered at my advocacy of intercolonial free trade, received from meI having then the honour to be the Premier of South Australia-the following wire:Shall be very pleased, when your Ministry is lormed, to negotiate for intercolonial free-trade. tempting to put a view of the matter before Under these circumstances, I ask how is this sneer in the slightest degree justified 1 I received an answer from him on the 3rd AugustJust sworn in. My wire was sent before the right honourable gentleman was sworn in Hasten to reply to yours of 1st referring to intercolonial free-trade, and to assure you of deamongst them may be, it is a very sire of this Government to promote more friendly intercourse between tlie Australian Colonies. Inof intercourse and exchange between those vite further communication. Mr Kingston. And the very same day my reply wentRe intercolonial free-trade. Very pleased to receive your assurances of desire to promote intercolonial free-trade. Would you be disposed to arrange for free interchange of local products and manufactures of New South Wales and South Australia ? If so, we would lose no time in sending a Ministerial representative to Sydney to endeavour to negotiate for this or any larger scheme which mighb be thought desirable. The negotiations which followed led to the larger proposals of federation, with intercolonial free-trade. Under these circumstances I think I have a right to complain of the terras in which the right honourable gentleman referred to me in this connection. I further take credit for this, that the Government of which I had the honour to be the head was the first to negotiate a reciprocal agreement with a sister State, the colony of New Zealand. I had the honour to fight for that in the South Australian Legislature, though I am sorry to say I failed in effecting it . The right of interhonorable gentleman went on to comment on my reference to free-trade between those who subscribed to the same conditions of life and of labour, referring, of course, to the sister States. The right honourable gentleman suggests communication from me that the conditions of life and labour are not the same amongst all classes of the had been Australian community. I never suggested that they were. But I say that no State is peculiar in that respect. We in South Australia have our pioneers, as they have in New South Wales-ou r wealthier classes and our poorer classes. The bushman is as well known to us in South Australia as he is in New South Wales, and to suggest that I was speaking of a dead level of all Australian society throughout the length and breadth of the continent, when I was only referring to equality of conditions between various States, is at the House which the right honourable gentleman knew, or ought to have known, that I never attempted to put, and which he had no right to endeavour to put in the way he did. As regards these conditions of life and labour, I hold that, whilst we can, and will, admit to the freest commercial intercourse, people like those who inhabit the States of the Commonwealth, whatever the relative ranks different thing to provide for that freedom who live under entirely different conditions, who work under conditions which are foreign to the conditions which we have done our best to establish, and which at length we have secured, but which I venture to say would be threatened in their very existence by the establishment of free-trade of the character to which the right honourable gentleman alluded. I will give a few illustrations. I refer honourable members to the teeming millions of the East. Can the Australian worker enter into free competition with them 1 Ought he to be thrown into competition with them ? No, I say; a thousand times, No ! do the work that one Englishman will do. of ourminimum wageandof all our benevolent arrangements established here for the good of our industries and .of our Australian workers ?

What are their hours 1 What are their wages 1 I do not desire to dilate unnecessarily upon particulars, but I want honourable members to realize what free-trade means, free-trade as proposed by honourable members opposite, free-trade with' the whole of the world, not only civilized but it might be even barbarous or worse ! I am not referring to the Japanese in the term I have just applied, but I ask what are the rates of daily wages paid to Japanese? Here are some of them :Carpenters, Is. If d . ; plasterers, Is.

I venture to consider that Majesty's Opposition, the honourable memwe do not. We want English money, and ' ber for Parramatta, the fact is that the plenty of it, and Australian food, and plenty of it , and I say that at rates like those I have quoted we could not get it. If we throw our workers into competition with men who work at these wages, and under these conditions, where shall we be? We shall be hopelessly out of it . I wonder if there are many here who desire to throw us into competition with paupers working under the conditions to which I refer. I got these figures, I am glad to be able to say, from official sources. There is no room whatever to doubt their accuracy. The wages are higher than they were some time ago, much higher. We can judge what they were It will take ten of them to some time ago, when these are the liighest to which they have reached. I give them to honourable members for what they are worth, and I venture to say that a consideration of figures of this sort will let honourable members know what free trade will mean for Australia if she be thrown into unrestricted competition with the whole of the world. Here are some more of the rates paid in Japan:-Clog makers, lOd. ; dyers, 8d. ; blacksmiths, Is. 2 | d . ; founders, Is.

A t present, however, the New Zealand barrier is up. Ours also is up. No doubt, proposals for the mutual benefit of the Commonwealth and New Zealand would receive the most serious consideration on the part of this Government. The interruption almost drew me away from my intention of quoting from the speech made by the honourable member for Parramatta, for the purpose of establishing the differences in the conditions between the United States labourer and the worker in Australia. We have received a lot of wonderful and most valuable information from the honourable member. I never met a gentleman who had a happier capacity, when he opened his mouth, of putting his foot into it, and still worse, of supplying the most valuable information for the destruction of his own proposals, when he had recourse to the ink-stand. I do not want to say anything unkind. I am sure that the happy relations which exist, not only between the honourable member and myself, but I am happy to say, between myself and all honourable members, will not be disturbed by anything we have to say in the course of debate. I do say, however, that whether the honourable member for Parramatta is advocating what he has seen with "" mine own eyes,"" or quoting some newspaper writer, who he tells us is not anonymous, but who hides his identity under the aweinspiring nom de plume of "" Mother Jones,"" or whether the honourable member is relating what happened between himself and some one else, he always gives himself away completely to his political adversaries. Therefore, I quote him with delight for the purpose of answering the honourable member for North Sydney. He told us that he had a conversation with a gentleman whom he does the right met in a train, and who informed him that when business men in America made a contract in Australia they had to put on 20 per cent, for the reason that the American worker worked at a much greater strain than his Australian brother. But here are the honourable member's wordsBecause the American workmen bustle so the Minister much more than the workman anywhere else. They do not work only eight hours a dayHonorable members should note the result. If we have free-trade with America our eight hours' system vanishes. They do not enjoy it there, and how can we live against them when our workers toil a lesser time at the same wage ?

Then, said the honourable member with that emphasis which he uses so often, but mostly misappliesThey work at a tension and strain that no workman anywhere else approaches.

I shall be very happy to lend the honourable member a book of tables. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -What about the imports of woollen goods to Australia ? are to Australia what the cotton goods are to America. Tliat is as simple as simple can be, and the honourable member ought to be able to see it with his eyes shut. WhatI venture to argue is, that we ought to manufacture our woollens here in the same way as they are able to -manufacture their cotton goods in America, wherethey produce theraw material. Even if America does, as has been stated, send away £66,000,000 worth of cotton to England, that is exported after manufacturing practically every ha'porth of clothing that she wants, and if we can do anything like that -regarding our wool as well as in regard to our wheat and flour, we shall arrive at a far 19 TJ happier condition of things in Australia than we have hitherto experienced. Asto the statements that have been made with reference to American trade with England, I say at once that next to Australia, I look upon England as the nearest and dearest to us, and I do not quote these figures for the purpose of gloating over any decay or decline in her commerce. We all have the best wishes towards England, God knows, and we all wish good speed to her. But the cotton trade of England with America has fallen off-ther e is no doubt about that. From 1870 to 1874-fiv e years-the cotton manufactures sent by Great Britain to the United States amounted to 5S1,000,000 yards. On the other hand in the four years from 18S5 to 1889 the British exports of cotton goods to the States fell to 224,000,000 yardsa loss of 357,000,000 yards, or three-fifths of the whole. I think that figures of that sort go to establish the position for which I so strongly contend, and justify me in what I have said. goods from England have not fallen off. with that question. Of course England has opened up fresh markets for her cotton goods, but naturally, as the result of protection in America and other countries, her trade with them has been restricted. I It is still an absurdshould like to say something further with reference to the remarks of the honourable and learned member for Parkes.

He knows perfectly well that there was not a word of disloyalty to the Prime Minister or his policy in what I said, and it would be idle to suggest the contrary. The honourable and learned member went further into figures, and I invite the serious attention of the House to the views he put forward. He discovered, after some period of incubation over the figures, that the amounts that we were putting before the House-particularl y the Treasurer's figures -were not correct, and that, as a matter of fact, instead of taking £34,000,000 imports as we had done, £41,000,000 was the total shown by the figures for 1900. taking the figures for 1900, but taking half the rise. honourable and learned member assumed that the correct figures were £41,000,000, and with this astonishing result, that instead of our receiving what we are asking£9,000,000-w e shouldreceive £12,000,000. Treasurer's calculations are correct. If £21,000,000 would produce £9,000,000, then £12,000,000. honourable and learned member's it is simply the application of the rule of three. and learned member is well up in the rule of three in this instance-h e was not in regard to the other matter. rule of one. we shall not be compelled to submit to the rule of the Opposition. I do not think anything of that sort is in contemplation at The Ministers present. If our calculations are correct the honourable and learned member for Parkes assumes tliat the extra £7,000,000 is to produce an additional £3,000,000. Now, £7,000,000 according to the honourable and not say in every learned member's style of reckoning-seeing that the amount was shown as imports in the figures, for 1900-that we did not have a vast increase of revenue 1 Treasurer's sum was right. I think the revenue was over-calculated. this additional £7,000,000 did not bring in a quarter of a million excess of revenue for 1900 as compared with 1899. Minister's calculations were wrong. honourable and learned member does not understand the figures.

628,Mr Kingston,"And with one accordtbat description as the basis of the calculations of subsequent years ? I tell honourable members, further, that as regards this loading up, the more we look into it, the more do we see how extensive it has been. There is one fact of importance which has been lately brought under our notice in this connection. As a rule, as we have 'to pay £12,000,000 of interest annually, our imports are less than our exports by that amount. £13,000,000. But last year they were only £3,000,000 less. The figures for 1899 and 1900 thus showed that in the latter year we had only over-traded to the extent of £9,000,000. If honourable members taket he trouble to acquire local information on the subject, there can be no room for doubt as to what are the facts. So far from inflating these estimates, what is the natural disposition of colonies in relation to imports as they grow and become self-contained ! The1 imports per head diminish. We see that in the following figures, as regards Australia : In 1881 the imports per head represented a value of £ 1 2 3s.. 9d.; in 1891 they equalled £ 1 1 4s. I d . ; and in 1899, £ 8 16s. 3d. In this connection it is very interesting to note the figures winch are given in the Sydney Daily Telegraph. These show that in 1899 the imports represented a value of £34,000,000, although until 1891 they did not reach that amount, the figures for that year being £37,000,000, and for 1890 £35,000,000. slightest disposition either to unduly reduce or inflate our estimate. We have made an estimate which, we believe, will be regarded as fair and satisfactory by impartial men. A very good year may give better results, and undoubtedly a large influx of foreign capital would give them. But we have attempted to give what we consider is a fair estimate under ordinary circumstances, and that estimate we have submitted for the consideration of this House. In this connection it occurs to me that the greatest financial authority in Australian journalism, who is known in the senior State as the commercial editor of the Sydney Daily 1'elegraph, has made a computation of what is a fair amount of imports to set down for a normal year. He estimates that amount at £34,300,000. Of course I admit that it is a difficult thing to fix what will be the precise results of the Tariff. But when honourable members complain of the higher rate they willsee 19 u 2 that we have more revenue to get and less to get it from. Instead of having £03,000,000 worth of goods upon which to levy taxation, £29,000,000 worth have, by the establishment of Inter-State free-trade, been withdrawn from tlie 'taxation area. £500,000 upon sugar. the question of the total value of the imI n 1899 they were less by ported goods. that at all. I am addressing myself to the question of whether or not our estimate of £34,000,000 as the annual value of our imported goods is a right one. I should like further to put it to honourable members that in our difficult task at this moment we are entitled to some degree of sympathy and assistance. I believe that we shall get that sympathy and assistance from many honourable members, irrespective of the side of the House upon which they may sit. I am sure that when our difficulties are fully explained we shall have the best wishes of the Australian public in striving to surmount this trouble. I feel that on an important occasion such as is involved in the framing of the first Federal Tariff, we have at least a right to expect absolute fair play from all sides, and I ' do not hesitate to say that in many respects we are not getting that fair play. I have only to refer to the way in which every We have not the trifle in connection with the Tariff is magnified; how every representation is madefor the purpose of inducing a feeling against the Tariff; how business men are, in some cases, imposing upon the general public by making the Tariff an excuse for raising prices when they ought not to be so raised. Let honourable members consider the extent of our difficulties. There was not a very large majority in New South Wales in favour of federation. The minority, or many of them, and the opponents of federation elsewhere, are in some cases only too glad to take advantage of any excuse to justify them in exclaiming-"" I told you so."" We cannot complain of the public. No one likes to be taxed. Customs taxation may not be so direct as other forms of taxation, but at the same time it comes home in a variety of ways to the household, and especially any alteration of it. Those who feel that where they were formerly free they are now taxed, or tliat where they were previously taxed they I are now taxed to a higher degree, naturally",144,Smith Tha T Is If The Result We Have Not Got It Why First

632,Mr Kingston,"I am not discussingwish that it were otherwise. So we find the criticisms to which I allude. . But I do claim that at a time like this, when revenue is an absolute necessity, each and all of us should do what we can for the purpose of letting tlie public appreciate what is the true position. It is not a question of their entire freedom from taxation. They cannot have that. The money must be had. If it is not obtained in this way it must be obtained in some other. It is idle to attempt to shift it from one to the other. All must bear their fair share. I venture to affirm that if this subject were considered .by the general public .in that aspect there would be a disposition to recognise the necessities of the case, and to make the best they could of the obligations which they are called upon to discharge in the interests of I especially sympathize with the people of New South Wales. It would be idle to do otherwise. They have been brought up recently under a fiscal system which imposes little of these burdens upon them. Consequently, they feel the change more than others. Speaking roughly, tlieir taxation is almost doubled. A million and a half we may sayI propose generally to speak in round numbers-is to be taken from them. But not only the Government, but all the members of this House, and the Opposition in particular, should join i u pointing out that this was the' inevitable result, and was what was .contemplated and intended ; tliat whilst we require this money from the people of New South Wales, it does not go into the pockets of others; that they are not charged one penny per head more than is charged per head to the inhabitants of the smaller States; that they get the money back subject to their fair contribution of federal cost on the basis of population-ever y penny of it ; and I venture to consider that they can make very good use of it. If these things are pointed out there will be a very different disposition exhibited than has been shown in this connection hitherto. Was this taxation necessary ? Was this high Tariff necessary ? member say "" no."" If we are proposing to indulge in taxation that is unnecessary, all I can say is that we are sorry to hear it , and shall be glad at the earliest possible moment to set the matter right. What was the policy promulgated at Maitland? Not to exact one penny of taxation more than was necessary. What is the policy to-day ? The same ! terjection, I say that if an honourable member talks about this Government being false to their pledges, he libels us. We are accused of treachery! The Prime Minister -the man who has been the trusted leader of Australia in this great unifying movement, and who also enjoys his position with the goodwill of the people of this countiy-he , is a traitor! From whom does this charge come? What is the line that divides us from the men who are arrayed against us, and who drew that line? The line is that between free-trade and protection to existing industries. and as the price of federation. Mr V. L . SOLOMON -Hear, hear, that is it. tection to existing industries. What was the fight about at the election ? Why, sir, the battle cry went forth-raise d by those who rallied round tlie standard of the leader of the Opposition-that we were to be opposed by the free-traders. He waved the free trade flag, and they followed him. Our policy was revenue and protection to existing industries. policy which we put forward to-day. Yet, forsooth, those who drew the dividing line say that this is not tlie Tariff we advocated. Wasi t not? Look at the reports of the electoral campaign. What was the cry ? member's own State. himself said, "" Elect the best men."" Minister raised the question of the Tariff. .Did he ever abandon his Maitland speech ?

But now they say we are going for protection ; now the flag is up mast-high, and they accuse us of being false to our promises. after revenue. The cry that we have been false to our pledges is too preposterous to be seriously considered. Any excuse on the part of these gentlemen, these partisans, is used for the purpose of attacking and of criticising the Government. Let the flag be low or let it be high, it is all the same to them-it is either not high enough or the reverse. We came here with certain support. When I mentioned the subject before the electors, I referred to the Maitland speech, and said-""This is our programme-re venue, and, after that, protection-moderat e protection."" We invited the people to try it, and they are trying it now. We believe that the verdict will leave no room for doubt. As to the question of revenue, let me put this consideration to any honourable member who had a seat in the Convention. I might even put it to the leader of the Opposition himself. What was contemplated at the time we framed the Commonwealth Bill, a high or a low Tariff? MrO ' MALLEY the leader of the Opposition, and I say that his proposal-no t expressed in the Convention itself, but afterwards-wa s that we should have a very high Tariff. A very high Tariff means protection incidental to the imposition of revenue duties. I go further. I say that the amount even was contemplated. But before I proceed to deal with that part of the argument, I should like to put the matter thus: Wasi t not clearly stated within the walls of the Convention that the financial necessities of the States could only be met by a high Tariff? I could quote from many speakers in that great gathering, but it will be more important to quote from the utterances of the leader of the Opposition himself. Out of his own mouth I shall be able to prove that he promised a very high Tariff, that he contemplated the raising of a sum closely approximating to that which we are proposing to raise, and that lie made it as clear as the noon day sun that the honor and credit, not the first Federal Parliament, was pledged to meet the necessities of the States. If that is so, what is our duty ? Our duty is to do that as nearly as practicable. MrV . L . SOLOMON -But not innate the figures. even suggested that we desire to inflate the figures for the purpose, I suppose, of imposing protection. We know perfectly, well that the duties chiefly objected to are not the protective, but the revenue duties; and the suggestion now made is all too preposterous. Those honourable members who were at the Federal Convention will be able to corroborate every word I say. If there is any necessity for confirmation, the passages are to be found in the pages of the Federal Hansard; and by these passages we are pledged to do our best in the interests of the financial necessities of the States. An attempt was made at tlie Convention to insert a clause or clauses for the purpose of having within the four corners of the B i ll an express declaration that these necessities would be met, but objection was taken to the form. The leader of the Opposition, with all that eloquence and force of which he is capable, said"" Do not put it as a hard-and-fast line; but I tell you this, that I believe, as a man of honour, that we in the Federal ParliaA righteous Tariff. ment will be bound to do whatever we can I use the words of for the purpose of meeting those necessities."" In the Federal Hansard for November, 1897, the right honourable gentleman is reported to have saidThe Federal Parliament takes from each of the five colonies its almost sole source of revenue No stronger obligation under such circumstances could rest on any body of honourable gentlemen. . . . than that of not exposing the constituent parts of the Federation to insolvency, for it will be nothing less than that. Words of that sort, spoken with the force and vigour which the right honourable gentleman generally gives to his utterances, carried conviction to the hearts of those who listened to him, and we, believing that the Federal Parliament would rise to a f u l l appreciation of the obligation which would rest upon them, were content not to further press the matter. But the right honourable gentleman continuedWe must believe that the Federal Government may be safely trusted to maintain the financial position of each of the States as one of the most only of the Convention, but of sacred things committed to their charge.

It is proposed, so far a& regards the present necessities of tlie States, to take away their almost sole source of revenue, and to refuse them right which is theirs. The States want not a penny of our money, but they say to us"" You have the power of customs taxation; so exercise that power that we may be able to maintain our credit and to pay our debts-you r honour isour honour, and we rely on the promise you made to do what you could for the purpose of sustaining it .

The situation, I think, is inconceivable. If we are not prepared to believe that the outcome of the movement w ill be a Parliament which w ill protect the colonies against such obvious dangers, then I say we cannot believe in the thing itself. There is a sacred trust-a n obligation declared in the plainest terms-and the leader of the Opposition thought it inconceivable that it should not be fully recognised. But now the scene changes. be provided with the same means it at present possesses for maintaining its credit, is that one State, tlie requirements of which are the least. treated in the way to which I have referred. are incorrect. of the leader of the Opposition, they can be regarded in two ways. Talking to his Parliament in 1899 on the address in reply, he spoke practically as the Australian Prime Minister designate, or, at least, as a gentleman who fully recognised the responsibilities of. his position. He spoke, not as a that party leader, but as an Australian statesman whom we are all proud to know. I have reckoned it amongst the greatest of my pleasures to be associated in various movements with the leader of the Opposition, but I say that he has his varying, moodsi. He is at his best with responsibility on his shoulders, and at his worse as the party leader he is to-day. In the one case he recognises to the f u l l the national responsibility which rests on him, and in the other case, he is apparently careless, at least for a moment, of the solemn obligation to which he himself has referred in the most picturesque terms. In the New South Wales Parliament in 1899 he spoke thusDo not let any one think for a moment that high . Tariff in New South Wales. We all know that whatever Government is in and said anything else, I should simply be sinning against my own knowledge. I admit it, and give it to every one for what it is worth, that there must be a high Customs Tariff under federation, and that is one of the sacrifices that some of us are prepared to make for federation.

On the one hand the State would pay its way if only by a small margin of £16,000, and on the other its surplus would be reduced by something like £70,000, so that it would be turned iuto a deficit of £60,000. I claim to know something of the necessities of the State from which I come, and I venture to think that would be a very heavy burden upon her. It would be one which she never contemplated. If she had been told when she was invited to federate that she would have to bear such a burden, then tlie efforts we put forward to induce her to join in that beneficent movement, would have had to be redoubled in order to secure success. What about Victoria? Under existing circumstances that State would have a surplus of £175,000. member's proposal, however, would convert that surplus into a deficit of £100,000. Thus we should have five States with a deficiency.

She would impose terms which she had no right to impose. She forced the hand of the other States in their love for federation. She got her bargain. The capital is hers. Let me ray in this connection, and let me not be misunderstood, that no member of the Federal Ministry knows either one State or another in his official capacity, save to do his best for that which is right to all. New South Wales, however, has in my opinion more to gain. What has she gained? She has gained access to our markets. free access to her markets. her own interests? We believe she gave it, not for love of the other States, but because it suited her to do so. of the other States. terests of the other States, but because the leader of the Opposition in this House as Premier of New South Wales believed it was a right thing to do in the interests of that State. She had more to gain from federation in that respect than we had. She gains access to our markets ; we had access to hers previously. As regards the benefits we derive from federation, who reaps the golden harvest as to manufactures, industries, and increased development of trade and resources? The leader of the Opposition tells us that it is the State from which he comes, and we do not grudge it . She has advantages given her by nature, which in the struggle between the traders of different States gives her the command by right, as it were, of coal and iron. In none of those respects do we envy The honourable her aught. But we do say that in a matter of this sort the credit of each State is to be considered. AVhen the State honour is to some extent implicated; when, to use the language of the right honourable and learned In order to please New member, our almost sole source of revenue has been transferred to a United Australia -* in trust to be exercised for the benefit of all, I can hardly think that that trust would be fairly and fully discharged if the interests of one State were to be altogether considered in this connection, if tlie words which were spoken in the Convention We have had the were to be forgotten, and we were left shorn of our resources and of our power to I do not hesitate to say maintain our corporate honour. Sir, it would be a staggering blow, an unexpected blow, a great disappointment; it would come as a shock. I know how tempting it is in a time like this to consider that if we do our duty in this respect we get no thanks from the States. Such is the selfishness of men, they will take the money, gladly spend it, cast upon us the odium of its collection as regards both the amount and the way in which it is recovered. Things of that sort, patent as they are, should not stand between us and the discharge of our duty. Let us strive to learn where our duty lies. If it lies, as I believe, in the direction of making the necessary provision, even if we incur opprobrium we shall retain the approval of our own consciences by doing that which we ought, and which I am sure this House will be prepared, to do.

Those who did not like federation, those who do hot like this Government, those who are honestly wedded to free-trade, those who make free-trade an excuse for making a party attack, foment and stimulate agitation by to be taxed so unfairly, No! no! the idea is preposterous."" The honest way of looking at it and dealing with it is to say to all of them that the thing must be faced. If a lesser sum will suffice well and good, but the money must be had. It is the price to be paid for federation, and all we ought to strive here to do is to find out what tlie amount is, and what is the best way in which it can be raised. He would be a poor debater indeed who, having such a fertile theme on which to raise public discord, were unable to raise, as it were, a storm of indignation as regards the Tariff, which must tax where taxation did not previously exist, and which in the great senior state of all doubles the taxation on each man and -woman of that great community, but doubles it onlyinaccordance with tlie necessity which had to be faced. Was not this predicted by all who previously considered the matter ?

707,Mr Reid,"Let us go up there.I have not got an invitation yet. I understand tliat there is no proposal on the part of the Opposition. What do they intend to do-d o they intend to let the States go short, or to do as the leader of the Opposition did when he introduced his free-trade policy in New South Wales, namely, propose a land and income tax. Here let me say this to the leader of the Opposition. Of course I do not know so much about New South Wales politics as he does, but if I can read history in this connection, so far as the free trade movement was concerned, I believe that its strength lay in the land tax. If the light honourable gentleman had not advocated the land tax the free-trade policy in his State would not have been so far advanced as it is to-day. thing to have it here. idea of the right honourable gentleman is to propose something in the shape of a further land tax, but it seems to me that as land taxes are already in operation in some of the States, it would be alittle hard if any double-banking were proposed. A t the same time, I do not hesitate to declare my personal regard for a land tax. It is one of: the proudest recollections of my life that I had the honour to draft the first Bill unimproved land values-the first B ill for the continent of Australia. Government of which I had the honour to be a member succeeded in passing that Bill into law in 1S84, and on that Billi t seems to me the land tax legislation of the right honourable the leader of the Opposition was based. To deal more closely with the terms of the motion which tlie right honourable gentleman has moved, it seems to me to be a sort of drag net. It is supported by an appeal to class and local prejudices, and it serves to fan the expiring embers-a t least by the way in which it was movedof State jealousies. The speech, of the-right honourable member in moving the motion, appeared to be an apostrophe to libertythe liberty to suffer and starve the usual hackneyed appeal that is indulged in by those who clamour for freedom of trade, very frequently in utter disregard of its necessary consequences. The motion is a proposal to hold above everything the survival of the fittest, to make no provision for yes; but the protection of the weak, to reject-as far as we have had any indication of what is really intended-al l that could really tend to the prevention of tlie injui y of the weak by the strong. It is an apostrophe to the liberty which renders local industrial benevolent legislation worthless, in. that the worker loses his work in competition with the goods of the sweated worker in foreign countries. It is an appeal to the craze for cheapness) for low wages, and cheap men. It is an advocacy of the policy which keeps out cheap labour, but lets in the wares produced by cheap labour. To my mind It is infinitely better that we should let in the cheap worker himself, rather than his wares. If the cheap worker comes here, we can at least hold him within the area of our jurisdiction, and can legislate regarding the conditions under which he shall work. Themotion is the outcome of a policy which will deprive Australians-if amended in the direction suggested by the honourable member for North Sydney-of markets for tlieir labour and for tlieir produce to the extent of at least £2,500,000 annually. To my mind, the chief consideration in tlie settlement of the issues between free-trade and protection is this-whethe r it is better that we should have a market for our labour and our produce in our midst, or that we should send our money outside of Australia to better the markets of the foreigner, and to employ the providing for a tax on labour of tlie foreign worker-to employ the foreign worker in making up our raw The material to the displacement of the opportunities for employment of our own workers at good wages which s are among the chief necessities of man. The poor have been frequently referred to dining this debate-w e always have them with us. If we read any page in the early history of any State on the Australian continent, what do we find there-the curse of the time, the cry of the weak, the cry for employment, for an opportunity to earn the daily bread. In my own StateI have heard it time and again, and in the other States they have had the same condition of affairs in equal, or in even greater intensity. I know of no sadder sight than that of an honest and industrious man going about seeking work and unable to obtain it ; returning, as it were, heartbroken to his little home at night, with his wife, and aye, it may be, his children, greedily rushing to meet his approaching footsteps, only to be met with the one old",152,Smith Tha T Is If The Result We Have Not Got It Why First

Are wish well to the labourer ? What are we 1 to dp ? It seems to me that the point is this. Shall we struggle to keep available for Australian labour and Australian producer such markets as we can reasonably control ? Do we not know and feel that it is right that the work should go to our own people ? Do we not know and feel that they have the first claim upon us ? And yet, as far as our legislation in this connection is concerned, the point that has occupied public attention, and the issue that is now laised is whether or not, in connection with our fiscal policy, we shall do aught to promote local production and the employment of local labour, and greater general happiness and comfort than has been previously attained -There are obvious reasons which will induce me to curtail my remarks in order that there shall be every opportunity afforded to the mover of tlie motion to reply, aud that we may proceed to a division without unduly trespassing on the time of this House. But I should like to say, while speaking of the importance of giving employment to our own people, whether they be workers or producers, that it does seem to me an almost self-evident truth that no pains should be spared by statesmen to secure to their own people all the means of profitable employment and production Avhich are possible. In this connection I note Avith interest that the leader of the Opposition himself refers to the immense advantage of producing or manufacturing all that Ave possibly caiiAvithin the borders of the Commonwealth. We cannot lay too much stress on the importance of promoting internal trade. terna] trade has been variously refeired to by political economists of the highest repute as the most important of all trades. It employs the two capitals-the the person that produces,' and that of the Mr Kingston. person AVIIO manufactures. Emphasis has repeatedly been laid on the fact that trade of this description is twice as valuable as is foreign trade. I Avant, so far as I possibly Is the day always to with Avhomi t has been my pleasure to co-operate for so many years--the Avorkers necessity and the friends of the Avorkers-o n the we simply to give importance of ' stimulating our internal trade. I wish to contrast Avith the importance of a matter of this sort the much less importance of cheapness-cheapnes s Avhich is the craze of the free-trader, and to Avhich we to discountenance all who he is prepared to sacrifice all, rather than lose the paltriest coin of the realm by indulging in the exercise of a patriotic sentiment. I cannot help thinking that the free-trader in his heart must feel, when he looks at the question of IIOAV much better, more patriotic and advantageous to the community it is, that all should be working together-the one making and the other manufacturing-that the internal trade and the home market should be stimulated rather than that through a beggarly craze for cheapness the interests of his felloAv worker and citizen should be discarded, and the employment and profits sent abroad. I want to put it, if possible, into so many figures. Let us take, for instance, a consideration for the poor like the folloAving :-Manufacture d goods are Avanted. They can be obtained Avithin the realm of the Commonwealth for £1,050. They can be obtained in foreign countries for £1,000. HOAV much better a tiling is it that the £1,050 should be paid to the manufacturer Avithin the community than that the £1,000 should be sent abroad 1 Let ns look at the result. If the manufactured goods are purchased Avithin the CommonAvealth, Avhat is the result for the expenditure of the £1,050? There is a loss to the purchaser of £ 5 0 . But, on the other hand, what is. the gain to the CommonAvealth? There is a gain of £1,000. That money may be equally distributed amongst 50 men, Avho Avould thus receive £20 each.

711,Mr Kingston,"I am pleased, indeed,a moment's notice from one source of occupation to another. We know how difficult it is very often for men to obtain employment in their own particular trade or occupation. Take them away from their own trades, and send the money out of the country to purchase imported goods from elsewhere, and what is the result ? Instead of the £1,000 being spent within the four corners of the Commonwealth in the way of wages, or of reward to the producer to be expended by him in supplying his various wants, in supporting local tradesmen, in giving revenue to the Commonwealth through the Customs, and thus recouping much more than the original loss, if we come to examine the matter, it is as plain as is the noon-day sun that these considerations eloquently in favour of the smaller sacrifice in the difference of the prices for the -good of all. Adam Smith. spoken with no uncertain sound as to. the importance of stimulating the home market. As regards this question of cheapness-wha t does it amount to ? Cheapness think -what it means! Unprotected competition with all the capital, skill, cheap labour, and unrestricted conditions of labour and employment in the old world, and in every Country. What is the good of Early Closing Acts, the eight hours system, and wages boards, conciliation or otherwise? How can we, if we admit these goods free into our markets, impose our benevolent conditions upon those who manufacture them ? What is the object of striving to do all we can within our borders to regulate the employment and conditions of labour, when by the free admission of goods, which may have been produced under the most horrible unrestricted sweating, we force our workers to undersell or to suffer by going unemployed and starving. What is the good of cheapness if the people have not the money to take advantage of it? What is the good of having boots sold at 10s. per pair instead of 12s. 6d., if the people have not the 10s. to pay for them? Isi t not far better that the people should have to pay the larger sum, and have the money with which to pay ? What is the prospect of men, who insist on decent conditions of life and labour, being able to compete with those who subscribe to no such conditions ? Whetheri t be increased capital or better machinery, we should set our standard of life and labour as free and high as may be. Do not go to extremes, but, having set that standard, recognise what are the conditions of the world, and do not hesitate to impose, by a fiscal policy, such terms on the importations of goods as shall insure effect being given to our will. That cannot be done except by protection, without which our laws are as idle as idle may be. What are we told here time and again ? Wo are told that because wages boards exist here, and wages under the circumstances are higher and the conditions of labour better, Victorian workers must go to the wall. If that be the case with regard to competition should undoubtedly speak all with our neighbours of the other States, how much more so must it be the case in regard to lower conditions of life and labour ? Let us look the matter fairly in the face. Are we going to tackle this question as we ought to ? If we are content to pass legislation for the purpose of protecting against competition within the prescribed circle of Australian jurisdiction, what is the good of it if at the same time we admit free goods, which are not produced under similar conditions of life and labour, to compete with, oust, and render unemployed our workers. right honourable gentleman proposes to protect the primary producer and his worker against cheap labour ? have the inquiry made by the honourable member for Wannon. I know perfectly well that a question from him comes with the simple desire not to throw me in the slightest way off my course, but to direct my attention to some matter which is troubling him. How do I propose to protect the primary producer and his workman? What is protection? It is assistance given by the inhabitants of a State or Cheapness! Commonwealth through the public purse, in order to protect industries for the good of the community. It niay be that we cannot give protection in that way to the primary producer, but so long as the assistance comes to him from the same public-from ' the same purse, same pocket, and from the community of the Commonwealth-it matters little how it comes. We ought to protect and assist the primary producer in every way possible, and that is, and has been, our policy",154,Smith Tha T Is If The Result We Have Not Got It Why First

715,Mr Kingston,"I am delighted tofor years. laboured in that behalf ? We have given cheap land, and where in tliat connection did we hear of the doctrine"" Buyi n the cheapest market and sell in the dearest."" If we chose we could sell the State lands for cash to capitalists who would let them out to the primary producer and charge the latter exhorbitant rent. But that is not what has been done. Hadi t been a simple question of cheapest and dearest, the State might, so far as direct results are concerned, have done much better. Buti n the long run would it have been better? AndI similarly ask whether in the long run it would be better if the workers and manufacturers were unemployed and our purpose of fostering the enterprise of foreign manufacturers and foreign -workers ? The primary producer has been given not only cheap land, but also cheap money through State banks and other similar institutions, and cheap access to and from the farm and market by means of State railways, roads, jetties, bridges, and in every conceivable way in which money could be expended 'for the public good. water supply, bonuses, and aids to prospecting and mining. All these and other means are directly employed for the purpose of giving aid to the primary producer; and long may that state of things continue ! It was the policy in the past to assist the farmer by means of protection. We are told that because the Inter-State barriers have been thrown down, the opportunity for tliat aid no longer remains, and that in regard to foreign markets, there is not the same advantage in the way of granting protection. But does that alter the case ? W ill honourable members tell me that protection, which was admitted to be a good thing while it assisted the farmers directly, is no longer to be considered a good thing because it cannot now apply to their interests to the same extent ? The mode is nothing; the question is whence the assistance comes, and it comes from the public purse. Whether by protection-whethe r by indirect methods or direct methods-le t each and all be fairly treated. Under these circumstances the farmer, who has hitherto enjoyed the advantages of protection, will not, I am sure, simply because he can no longer be helped or greatly helped in that way, insist at this W it h what effect have we moment that the mode which has been used to help him shall no longer be available to others. Let one and all, and every industry, be the peculiar care of the State. We help in one way or the other each manufacturer and each industiy, primary or otherwise; and to the greater extent these industries are created the better for the country. Honourable members will not fail to recollect that the Government are seeking to do what they can by means of bonuses for the more direct encouragement of those industries which will operate to the benefit of the farmer. Although the farmer may not be aided to the same extent as his brother Australian, he is aided against outside competition, and capital sent elsewhere for the we see evidence of that aid every day. New Zealand's loss is our gain. I do not wish or hope to produce anything in the shape of jealousy between the Commonwealth and the great colony of New Zealand; but that colony has her barriers raised against us, and we naturally raise our barriers which operate against her. Let the matter be made the subject of reciprocal arrangement, if honourable members like, but do not sacrifice our farmers for the benefit of those outside the Commonwealth, who do not at this moment throw their markets open to us, but insist on levying taxes on Australian goods. I venture to think that the acceptance of this policy is of all importance to us. What was said by Lord Salisbury some time ago, in reference to the foreign trader? He said that in matters of this sort the other countries oppress you, but we have thrown away our weapons. Eree-trade gives them the command of our markets and we can insist on nothing in the shape of a similar Tariff for the advantage of our land. I believe that by the continuance of the barriers which we here propose to maintain, there will be at least a considerable direct advantage to our farmers; and I know further, in this connection, that we can assist them in the future as we have done in the past in other ways. Perhaps the very raising of these barriers will give us an opportunity of entering into reciprocal arrangements which will be for the benefit of the Commonwealth and of other communities with which we trade. I should like to quote, on 'this doctrine of cheapness-the doctrine of buying in the cheapest market and selling in the dearest-fro m the utterances of one who years ago spoke on this",155,Smith Tha T Is If The Result We Have Not Got It Why First

717,Mr Kingston,"And by means ofsubject of free-trade. cheapness if the articles are not accessible to the community t Sir John Byles put the matter in this wayFor the benefit of the musses, it is not enough to make things cheap, even in the best sense of the word. What is wanted is, to make them accessible, attainable, by the multitude. By makingthings cheap, you do not necessarily make them accessible. Nay, there are some modes of making things cheap which, as we have seen, will make them less accessible to the multitude than they were before. What the masses want is the means of purchase. If the means of purchase be wholly absent, it is a matter of supreme indifference to them whether things be dear or cheap. The only means of purchase which they possess are the wages of their labour. In a word, employment is their means of purchase. You may have cheapness without full and various employment for the masses, that is cheapness but without plenty. You may have full employment for the masses at good wages, without the cheapness; that may be competency, or even plenty, without cheapness. The aim of all good legislation should be to unite the two blessings-cheap ness and plenty. But if, as often happens, in the imperfection of human affairs, you have to choose not only between two evils, but sometimes also between two good things, inconsitent with each other, which of the two is to be chosen-cheapnes s for the benefit of a few, or plenty for the benefit of all? Undoubtedly, plenty. Then the study of every Government, in order to produce plenty, permanent plenty, plenty widely diffused and extending to the masses, should be the full and various productive employment of the people. The test of every measure ought to be, and used to be this-""Will it promote the productive employment of the people ?"" It has been already shown, and on the authority of Adam Smith himself, that the production of articles at home which can be made or grown somewhat cheaper abroad, though.it should not produce cheapness, does promote the productive employment of the people-doe s give them the means of purchase-doe s produce plenty, permanent plenty, plenty widely diffused, plenty extending everywhere to the masses of the population; and that tlie opposite policy, even under the most favourable circumstances, though it should and will create cheapness, will destroy the means of purchase, and introduce a real and spreading want. Under those circumstances how long should we halt between two opinions ? What is it to be-cheapnes s without accessibility, or accessibility to plenty, which it ought to be and can be ? There is another reason .for adopting this policy, for the benefit of the worker, in this fair land of Australia, a land whose nation we are now inaugurating. Sir, the motion of the leader of the Opposition is somewhat in the nature of a drag-net. It is an endeavour to tickle the squatters, to please the farmers, to tempt the miners, What is the good of and to flatter the pioneers.

China eggs ? I am onlj' too delighted to hear a remark of that sort from the right honourable gentleman, for it only shows how ignorant he is of the history of his own State. The right honourable and learned member does not know that a protection of that sort is very necessary, as regards his own particular State, and for this reason: She cannot provide at present, owing to a want of encouragement of the agricultural egg supply, for her own necessities; and she has to have recourse to the Celestial Empire for the purpose of procuring what is wanted. It is just a typical case. Here is this great State, with her unlimited resources, her large area of country, everything-bu t wise statesmen. for the ordinary, matutinal, innocent egg, she is short, and she has to have recourse to a heathen empire for the necessary supply. that's the worse of it ! ported in large quantities into New South Wales.

Just see the difference in New South Wales; they cannot produce their own eggs! Contrast that with what Obtains in South Australia. South Australia not only produces all the eggs that she wants herself, but she sends many to New South Wales, and exports it is a very interesting item--upward s of £80,00 0 worth of eggs annually.

749,Mr Kingston,"There is nothingthe means of existence are concerned, the food of the people should go untaxed. But they know f u l l well that the greatest outcry has been provoked against this Tariff on account of therevenne duties which, owing to financial conditions, are imposed upon the food supplies of the people. If we get a chance of reducing the duties, our first thought, I venture to think, will be to turn iu the direction of the freedom of the necessaries of life. I say, further, that we feel also that as regards a good many of these items, we have provided taxation upon raw materials for manufactures, which we should be glad, indeed, to relax.. We think that the margin is often too little between the manufactured article and the raw material. It is not our will, but the national poverty which consents. If, in the future, we can see an opportunity of providing for further freedom of necessaries or raw materials, rely upon our heartiest wishes being with proposals to that effect, which, if we could, we should have been only too glad to have introduced in the first instance. The national necessity is to make both ends meet. Our necessities in the way of revenue production compels proposals of this sort, and I say here, lest it be thought that ray enthusiasm in this respect is lately born, tliat fourteen years ago I was a member of the Playford Government, who introduced a Tariff to South Australia, in which provision was made for the freedom of the articles of the breakfast table, tea, coffee, cocoa, sugarI am not sure about kerosene. I would that circumstances had permitted tlie introduction of relaxations of such taxation into this Tariff. In America, how do they know the difference between the protectionists and the free-trader and therevenue tariffist? The free trader has a defined policy, approved by Henry George; but what is Henry George's attitude as regards a revenue Tariff? He scoff's at it ; he tells us practically that a Customs Tariff can only be justified on grounds of protection, We are protectionists ! AVe are not Henry Georges; but we believe that it is a good thing that the food of tlie people should be free, especially if not produced here. Tariff, tea comes in untaxed. If we were here to provide for a simple relaxation, honourable members can well imagine what would be our delight. They may talk, and sneer, and scoff' at the members of the 19 x Government, but look at our records! Look at what our proposals have been. AVe have been on the stage of public life in Australia for no inconsiderable time. Do honourable members think that it is a pleasure for us to impose taxation ? It is not a pleasure-it is a regret, but at the same time it is a duty, and where duty points we propose to go. AVe are told by one honourable member that the necessaries of life are to come in free; that the squatters are to go free; that the farmers are to go free ; that the miners are to go free, and lastly, we have had the manufacturers named. If all these are to go free, where in the name of fortune can we find any subject for taxation, for the purpose of discharging our national duty in the way of collecting the revenue neeessaiy for the maintenance of the national credit and honour. The honourable member for North Sydney has said that he is in favour of the encouragement of manufactures, except in the case of exotic industries. duties. ber said that in Australia, in all except exotic industries, which were not worthy of encouragement, it was desirable that we should have manufactures. How are we going to get them? a free-trade Tariff. I shall talk to the honourable member about that in a moment. What is the meaning of an exotic industry ? It means an industry which is not largely wanted, an industry which is not natural to our soil and climate. Can the industries connected with our primary productions, and natural to our soil and climate, be called exotics ? Surely not! It seems to me that our pastoralists, farmers, miners, and manufacturers all constitute industries which are connected with the production of the raw material, and which are of a character that can by no means be called exotic. They deserve encouragement They are all industries which are of particular worth and value to Australia. Whatsuccess, what assistance do they not render to In America, under a protectionist Australia ? Should we not struggle to do all we can to foster manufactures of that description.

There are times when an Australian population can take things very easily. there is one thing which Australians are not complacency, betrayal. compromise; revenue without destruction ; but now we are getting the candid transparent The way in which to destroy a people is to impose a revenue Tariff. the Prime Minister gave, as the key-word of his whole policy-revenue truction-he the people that revenue meant destruction ; that all the. mainsprings of national prosperity, everything that lay at the root of our industrial humanity called out with one voice-for what !-for 1 a policy of protection. told that if tire people are well employed they can afford to paj^ taxes, and that the only means of securing them employment is by protection-that destoying some protectionists who are hardy enough to consider that these two principles are in absolute harmony, men without any great pretensions to political eminence, but who have at least a certain degree of common sense, know that if there are two things which are absolutely they are the principle of a revenue Tariff, and the principle of a protective Tariff.

The Prime Minister would not have been sent here, and several other honourable gentlemen would not have been sent here. I come now to a phase of this subject which strikes me with considerable pain. There has been, I regret to say, a most palpable attempt to conceal the real -operation of this Tariff. Who ever thought, when the Customs .Bill was being passed, that this sort of monstrous treatment was to be practised under an Australian Tariff? We read in the misleading schedules of the Tariff that there are certain duties on the articles that are mentioned there, but we find that in the administration of the Custom-house these duties of 30 per cent, or 20 per cent, become lOpercent. higher. And why ? Because the packing charges abroad, the cost of the cases, the cost of the transit from the manufactory to the port of shipment, and ii thousand other charges, are added to the value of the goods; 10 per cent, is added on to these charges, and a 20 or 30 per cent, duty is levied on the total. AVhen the Minister for Trade and Customs was indulging in cheap and carefully prepared orations about large questions of human feeling, I thought he would have done greater service to the community if he had replied tosomeof themoreseriouscharges against this Tariff which now fill the whole atmosphere of Australia. I have before me an invoice for bottles, which are necessary for use in our great colonial wine industr}'. I suppose that that is an industry for which we all have some regard. Now, the charges on this shipment of bottles, which is worth £96, amount to £217. That is to say that there is protection of over 200 per cent, in favour of the colonial bottle industry. What do the Customs authorities do? It is true that the)' do not charge on the freight now, but they charge on the packing and so on, and the £ 9 6 becomes £ 1 8 8 by the addition to the prime cost of the article of £ 9 2 for charges. Ten per cent, is added to that, which makes £206 16s., and then 20 per cent, duty on the bottles is added to the £206 16s., making a duty of £ 4 1 7s. upon a shipment worth £ 9 6 . gentleman say that that was done under the Customs Act? the man who has to pay the money whether We the charges are made under the Customs Act or by any other authority. Here we have an imported article upon which we were told a duty of 20 per cent, was to be charged, whereas the impost practically amounts to 40 per cent. I say that these are frauds, and that if a private individual were to do such a thing as is now being done by the Customs authorities he would be convicted of imposition. It is an imposition on the people of Australia that such frauds should be concealed beneath the Tariff. the old Tariff. Mr B.EID -Indeed it is not. Then there is the case of bedsteads. able and learned member tell me the date of the documents from which he gets his information ? to the Minister later on. Under this Tariff the duty upon bedsteads, which was formerly 25 per cent, becomes 30 per cent., the duty upon American chairs, instead of being 20 per cent., becomes 30 per cent. That reminds me that when the Minister for Trade and Customs invites the House and the people to turn their eyes to the degraded coloured centres of the East, we know well enough that the labour which protectionists most fear is that of the highly paid workers of the United States. It is not the labour of China, Peru, or Siam, that Victorian protectionists are afraid of, but that of the people whose wages they say are the highest in the world, and of the country where they say the standard of comfort is the highest. Why should the Minister for Trade and Customs employ his great gifts in order to obscure the true issue ?

The father of the present Lord Brassey was, I suppose, one of the greatest employers of labour in the world. thousands of men in different countries, and he gave it as his opinion there was no difference in point of fact between paying a superior man high wages and an inferior man low wages. His experience, he said, was that from the varying rates which he paid in various countries and to different workmen, the actual result wasaboutthe same. Por low wages he got little work, for high wages he got much work. That is the great secret of American supremacy to-day. It is not because the people there are weak, degraded, or effeminate that wages are high in the United States, but because the people represent the cream of human ingenuity and industry. Alas too, it is because the physical strength of the American in the factory is put to a pace of cruel pressure which is unknown even in miserable England. The man has become entangled in the machine and the vast machine must go round with lightning speed crushing him by the way. Let us get rid of these pretences. The honourable member for New England spoke like a man, as he always does. I may differ from that honourable member and from the Minister for Trade and Customs, but I always have a large amount of respect for them, because they invariably give themselves away. The honourable member for New England comes down to this Parliament, a real representative of the old English tory landlord. He hates cheapness. He goes along the shop fronts of Sydney and sees the commoner articles which must be bought by the poorer classes. He says, ""These commoner articles in the window are too cheap,"" and his heart rebels against it, just as did the heart of the tory landlord against the idea of cheap food for the British people 50 years ago. What a horrid thing cheapness was when it would put a loaf of bread upon the table of a family which was starving. commences to sweat others, he puts a ring his colleague, Mr O'Malley, out of the fence round the people he is going to sweat. House, because he has gone straight upon What are the protectionists doing now ? this question from the beginning. I respect They are toying to erect a vast ring fence a straight opponent, but I cannot sufficiently all round this continent, so that they can sweat Australians as other people are sweated in the various protectionist countries of the world. But I wish to come back to my right honourable friend's horror of cheapness. The Minister for Trade and Customs is essentially reproducing the old He employed tens of tory principles of 50 years ago. His horror of cheapness is a fearful and wonderf u l thing. 1 have never found an Australian manufacturer display any horror of cheapness. Can the Minister point toone man engaged in manufacturing in Australia who does not run after cheapness ? Why should we not attack the thing at the very core ? Sincei t is the poor man whoworks that we want to help, why not apply this heaven-sent principle to him direct ? Why not put a ring fence around human beings? Why allow men to be brought here from England, if they like to come from that half-starved miserable country ? Why not put a 20 per cent, ad valorem duty upon them? That would be protecting labourWhy not cure the unemployed distress by preventing any one from coming into the country until every one who is already here is employed. It is the sort of talk we have had to-day that almost turns the stomach of a man. Does any one who knows anything about the conditions of America not know that the one class of man who is not to be found in the American factories is the American himself ? Did not the people of America, in erecting a stately fabric of prosperity for the American people, incur enormous burdens in order to fill their grand factories with Hungarians, and with the derelicts of Europe, who were brought over by the million ? When there was a strike in an American factory, what was the cure? A ship-load of these people from the South of Europe! What is the use of talking about protection for labour? member for Tasmania lost his billet, or at least he told us so the other night. for Tasmania?

772,Mr Reid,"Which honourable memberexpress my contempt for a crooked friend. I want to come back to another matter of great importance. Here is tlie great Republic of the United States. Surely, with the marvellous resources which it possesses, under the heaven-sent policy of protection prosperity should be assured to the masses there. The United States possesses vast natural resources, a politically free constitution, and no long or highly descended aristocratic families, who monopolize the lands as they do in England. In this connection we ought not to forget that free-trade England has ever been labouring under the curse oflocked-up lands. If the principles underlying the holding of the lands of the mother-country were as free as those underlying our commercial policy, many of thedark blots upon her fame would disappear. What is the glory of France? Isi t her protection ? No ; it is her peasant proprietary, which has given millions to the fanning industry of that great country. When my honourable friends talk about Germany and the great progress Germany is making, do they' know the position in which the unskilled workmen of that country have been placed in consequence of the great increase in the price of food there ! Germany, we are told, has been made a highly protectionist paradise owing to the transcendent genius of Bismarck. Bismarck and protection ! Bismarck wanted to sweat the German people for money with which to keep up his army. What did the man of ""blood and iron"" care about protection? The man of ""blood and iron"" wanted money, and he could get it only by taxing the people under the name of protection. Germany is a great nation, with a gifted, thorough, and manly race, but what can these manly, well-educated Germans earn ? Two shillings for a day's work of eleven and twelve hours. They have the finest type of manhood in Europe, and are surrounded by the heaven-sent bulwark of distressed humanity, and yet a man with a wife and three children in Germany to-day has to work for days in order to pay the duty on his bread, before a penny comes in for tbe support of the family. The Minister for Trade and Customs drew tliat picture of distress which has so often been drawn, of the hungry children greedily running to greet the father as he comes from his unsuccessful quest for work. Among all the absurdities of the absurd principle of protection is there one greater than the proposition, as a remedy for distress, of the taxation of the poor 1 What a queer remedy for distress taxation is. If a rich man is in trouble, do we help him with a land tax? No ; he knows that a land tax is no help to him, because he has the common sense which has enabled him to grow rich. It is a monstrous absurdity not to see that if the margin in a country is so narrow between starvation and idleness and employment, how cruel it is to make the cost of living artificially dear. The Minister for Trade and Customs is manly, and he admits that protection docs make living dear; but he says that the slight difference is recouped in some marvellous way. It is astonishing how we can recoup the loss of others by scientific deduction. It is the easiest thing in the world, while one is all right oneself, to explain to another man tliat if lie pays out a sovereign he will get it back some other time in some other way. I can quite understand lawyers, like the Minister for Trade and Customs and myself, having an inborn horror of cheapness, to which we are not accustomed in any way; but when labour is struggling with hardship and distress, in tlie name of 1 heaven relieve it in some other way than by putting burdens on every rag which the wife and child wear, and every morsel which they eat. The Minister for Trade and Customs has taken up high ground, and practically impugns our humanity. He, in effect, says that whereas starving people are coming piteously to him, we are the cruel monsters who wish to stand between him and the relief he offers-that we wish to fasten on to the country a policy which will multiply misery and distress. If . I believed that to be true, I should throw a thousand policies to the wind. I am not one who holds theories of political economy in that way. It is because I have traced the history of the protectionist policy in other countries that I have such a deep detestation of it. I always find that, if a nation descends to artifice, tlie men who gain by the artifice are not the masses of the people. What avails it for one great capitalist to outwit another ? What avails it to artificially add to the price of a thing which only a rich man needs? What money is there in that ? Hencei t is that the Minister for Trade and Customs scorns to put more than 15 per. cent, on satins, silks, and velvets. It is, I suppose, unworthy of notice, but boots and shoes and hats, which are cheap, have to bear duties of 130 per cent, and 61 per cent. the policy which is to enable the poor man to put shoes on his children's feet; that is tlie policy which is to enable a starving man to keep his family in decency arid comfort. The fact is that it is because the cheapest things are used by the masses, that the burden of this protectionist system is especially brought to bear on them ; it is only out of the multitude of buyers that sellers can make their fortunes. Trade and Customs had explained those broad principles of philanthropy, it would have us. would incite enthusiastic if perorations some humble workman had said-"" Mr Kingston, figure that out with reference to satins and cheap boots and shoes ? ""-the would have replied-"" Oh, that means I have put 15 per cent, on satins, and 61 per cent, on the cheapest kinds of boots and shoes."" When that answer was given, tlie man would look at the Minister as if he thought he had gone stark, staring mad. Every man can talk in that magnificent way, but a man with a Tariff like tliat is a curse to any country. Now that the Government are awa} from r their masters they have become a very select body-a look on great national meetings as discord and vulgar agitation. a politician who fear that they are about to be robbed. But let the Minister for Trade and Customs go to Sydney and try to soothe the housewives of that citv : let him tell them that pattering feet will come home with shoes on at 61 per cent. ad valorem. Even the grave which is to hide the misery of the taxed people does not escape, and we have 80 per cent, ad valorem on cheap tombstones. grand policy which is to make Australia smile with exuberant prosperity. heaven the Tariff has electrified intelligence of the masses right through Australia. to come along ; he has not yet been signalled at the heads of any Australian port. Let me impugn the statesmanship of the Minister for Trade and Customs on a very simple matter. was so carried away by the fervour of his Mr Reid. feelings in the interests of distressed That is humanity that he made tlie most destructive confession a Treasurer ever made who had a protective Tariff on his hands. What did he say ? There is only one yearning desire which is disturbing the rest of this Eederal Minister, and that is how to get rid of the duties upon all the necessaries of life. Does the right honourable gentleman know what the necessaries of life mean to those who have not If the Minister for much to pay for them ? It is nothing to us, perhaps, to be asked to pay 10 per cent., 50 per cent., or even 1,000 per cent, on our been better for him and for boots and shoes. But what does it mean to They were perfect, and they the masses, who have to keep us going? cheers. But Boots and shoes are necessaries of life. at the end of his magnificent They are taxed 61 per cent, ad valorem. Buti f we are prepared to pay a guinea for how do you our boots we get off with 30 per cent. Minister through the manufacture being done in tlie country. member would make them for himself, being a thorough protectionist, and then he would keep the money in the family as well as in the countiy ! I should suppose that butter was a necessary of life. If honourable members go over the Tariff they will find that This is said to be clap-trap. out of thousands of items there are hundreds and hundreds which in any decent community are considered necessaries of life. very superior body. They Many of these necessaries of life are produced by the farmer. That reminds me of The province of a remark made by my honourable friend the is to soothe the people member for Gippsland. He told us very candidly that about twelve or fifteen years ago he called a number of country members together. He had discovered that the system of protection in Victoria was doing nothing for the farmers, and was doing everything for the manufacturers. So that we find that for twenty years the protective system has been a burden upon tlie farmers of Victoria, who has That is the utterly neglected their own interests. The honourable member for Gippsland had to Thank come to the rescue, and get a stock tax the imposed. And, by the way, when that stock tax of 2s. a head on sheep, and 30s. The ""foreigner"" does not seem a head on bullocks, was taken off, within two weeks the price of sheep went down 2s. a head, and the price of bullocks 30s. a head. So that the foreigner does not seem to have been paying the stock tax. I got those My right honourable friend facts from the best authorities-stoc k and station agents, and men dealing in meat in a",164,Smith Tha T Is If The Result We Have Not Got It Why First
773,Mr Sawebs,They get them very cheaply,166,Smith Tha T Is If The Result We Have Not Got It Why First
774,Mr Reid,"No doubt the honorablelarge way. There was one person who was nearly swindled by a tradesman in Melbourne, and sympathy must be felt for a lady who went into a boot shop in this -city to buy a pair of boots, of a kind for which she had been accustomed to pay 25s. She was asked 32s. .an exposure, and she got them for 25s. I do not think that any honourable member on this side of the House has said that people who buy the higher quality of boots ancl shoes have anything to complain -of. Ou the contrary, we have pointed out that the higher the value of the article, the less the tax upon it . Nowi t appears that there is no duty upon best ladies' boots, for which this lady expected to pay 25s.: or the duty is reduced-probabl y that is the -explanation. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports, however, bewails the reduction of these duties in some respects. What do you think, Mr Speaker, is the reduction that the Melbourne artisan -cannot stand? A reduction from about 150 per cent, to about 70 per cent! He -cannot live with that amount of protection, -even with wages boards ! What a state of things industry must have come to in Victoria, when men can produce a larger -quantity of boots and shoes in New South Wales without a penny of -duty, whilst the poor Victorian must have 70 per cent., and will starve at that. Does not that show that we can offer to our people two choices ? We can surround them T with every inducement to relax their energies, and not to keep pace with every growing improvement of the age; or we can leave them under tlie stimulus, which niy honourable friend, the member for Melbourne Ports, would call a cruel stimulus of unrestricted competition, and by so doing develop their energies so that they may hold their own against the world. This ""curse"" of unrestricted competition was exposed on Eight Hours' Day in Sydney. It was .shown then what sort of workmen this -""curse"" makes. We saw what starved, -down-trodden, miserable, decrepit, workmen there were in Sydney. I believe that about 16,000 trades unionists inarched through .the streets of that city a month ago.

But there were always great demonstrations, even before this year. to have been. notoriously a sleepy fellow as compared There was with the Melbourne workman, and yet he can live against the competition of Japanese and Chinese labour. How is it? It is not that the Victorian stock is not as good as that of the British stock in any part of the world. It is not that the workmen here are not the descendants of some of the finest men in the world, who came here from all quarters of the globe. It is because if you lower the manliness of men you will get a crop that is not manly. Mi-. HUGHES -What degeneracy from the days of the Eureka Stockade, to the days of men who will fill other people's billets for lower wages ! I want to show my gratitude for the forbearance which honourable members on both sides of the House have shown ine by condensing my remarks as much as I can. I will throw away mountains of notes which I made in reference to different speeches. I wish particularly to concentrate my remarks upon the speeches delivered by the honourable member for Gippsland and the honourable and learned member for Indi. Without being invidious-becaus e I think that the tone of the debate has been extremely high-if I may take two speeches from among a number of very excellent ones on the other side, I venture to select those two as presenting between them about as strong a statement of the protectionist case as I have heard. Even in the case of those speeches I shall refer to only one or two of the salient points. I feel tliat I cannot at this time venture to do more than that. I wiint to refer to one or two remarkable expressions in the speech of my honourable friend the member for Gippsland, in which he described the commercial enterprise of Great Britain, which carries half the commerce of the world under the British flag, as a species of blackmail levied on the producers and distributers of the world. The honourable member used the word "" blackmail."" Great Britain. I said that the nation that contented itself with distributing instead of producing did that. I did not apply it to Great Britain.",166,Smith Tha T Is If The Result We Have Not Got It Why First

780,Mr A. Mclean,"No t in connection withfriend will see that the work of the British fleet is a work of distributing; consequently, according to the honourable member, the work of the British mercantile fleet is blackmail. I do not know that any answer is necessary for an honourable member who uses such arguments. Isi t not clear that one of the greatest services which can be rendered to the producers of the world is the cheap transit of their productions all over the oceans of the globe? Surely that is an advantage ? This service is rendered by the British fleet, because other nations cannot build their ships as cheaply as the British can. Here is this principle of cheapness again ! What an awful curse it is that enables Great Britain to earn £80,000,000 a year in freights all over the world ? Why cannot tlie Great Republic, with its vast stores of metals, compete with this little Island in the Seas? Here is Great Britain with her 12,000,000 tonnage against the United States with her 2,000,000 tonnage, Germany with her 2,000,000 tonnage, and France with her 1,000,000 tonnage orsometliingmore. I look uponthework of theBritish mercantilefleets,evenfroraaprotectionist point of view, in carrying j>roduce from the producer to the buyer, as one of the most magnificent services which the producers of the world can get. Where would our producers be if freights from Australia were 50 per cent, higher .than they are today 1 Where would the farmer be ? Where would the pastoralist be? Cannot we see that when we come to separate a cluster of nerves, which combine to produce a perfect harmony of energy, we begin to interfere with things that are beyond our control ? What goes to make up the full strength of any nation 1a thousand different forces, a thousand different factors. I think one of the best tests in the world when we go abroad is, not so much to compare one county with another, as to compare the same country under the two different policies. I think that is a far fairer test. I do not look upon any of these tests as conclusive; they are interesting but not conclusive. But let us take the one country in the world where this cruel policy of free-trade has been in force for 50 years. They had the tender, humane, benevolent policy once; they had that humaneand benevolent policy of protection once; they had that policy which greeted theunemployed father so tenderly when he came home every day, and his children ran out greedily to I think my honourable meet him. I can sum up the climax of that humane policy after centuries of application to one of the grandest subjects for the experiment the world has ever seen, in this way : In the agricultural districts, agricultural labourers were so degraded that they could not pass from one English parish to another without a permit. And why a permit ? Because nearly every one of them was on the pauper list, and a parish would not have a man coming from the books of another parish on to its books. They would not allow them to move from one parish to another, because of the enormous burden of the agricultural labourer upon the poor-rates. We go to the factories, and what do we find ? We find our great manufacturing centres in England seething with sedition. Why% Because of their indigence and abject misery. We go to the mines of England, and we find the mother and the child working down in those dark mines to keep the home even in food. We find the manufacturers in a state of misery and sedition. The labourers in the counties were in the same state, and all over Great Britain they had a paralyzed community. My honourable friend tlie member for Gippsland says that stagnation set in with free-trade. Again, I say that an honourable gentleman who can make such a statement does not really call for serious notice. Stagnation \ Stagnation for this grand old mother countiy of ours ! Now, I shall show my honourable friend the sort of stagnation there is in disputes between employer and workmen. I suppose that in this land f u l l of paupers the employer has all the best of it . He has starving men running after him for work; yet taking the last two years for which I have the figures, 1898 and 1899, I find that in 1898 labour disputes between master and man increased the wages of 1,015,000 workers on an average of Is. 7d. per week each in a. fight between cruel capital and starving labour. In the next year there were 1,453 changes in the labour rates of England, 1,436 of which wereincreasesandseventeen weredecreases, and that affected 1,100,000 workers, and they got increases amounting to Is. 6-^d. per week each. There are 2,000,000 workers, whose wages have gone up Is. 6d. per week each in two successive years. Now, is not that worth a thousand of the experiences of my honourable friend the member for Gippsland ? I forgive the honourable member for",167,Smith Tha T Is If The Result We Have Not Got It Why First
781,Mr Reid,"this reason : Every man who changes his religion or his political principles is sure to be more red-hot than any man who has never changed them. other nations make? the world. My honourable friend, having changed, is like the man-and I say it without any disrespect-wh o always gets further away from the principle than the man who has never changed, and I say that my honourable friend has out-Heroded Herod in the remarks he has made in reference to this question. MrA . McLEAN in protectionist countries as well as in England. quote those 2,000,0001 have referred to 1 MrA .

McLEAN with France, Germany, and America. the pauperism in England. That was a strong point with the honourable member. Does the honourable member for Gippsland know that there are only half as many able-bodied paupers in England now as there were 50 years ago ? Does he know that the latest returns show that in this great countiy with 17,000,000adultsexposed to tlie cruel competition of the world, there are only 99,000 able-bodied men in receipt of relief ? What an awful state of destitution! According to the last census, Victoria alone had 23,000 out of a total population of 1,100,000. the Opposition quoting from ? Mail Year Booh. There are a number of children and others, who arc not able bodied, and a number of insane, but here comes in what I conceive to be the glory of England, although she is supposed to be in uch a miserable state. She has a system of poor rates for the benefit of the poor. If other countries carried on. their system of relief in that way, we should have a tale that would stagger us. Where is there another country that has a poor rate on property as a national system ? England is rich enough to afford it, but America is not yet able to do so. Of the world's commerce of 18,000;000,000 dollars, Great Britain has 18 per cent., Germany has 10' per cent., and the United States9 per cent. England has nearly as much as the other It is the same all through two. My honourable friend says that hedoes not believe in the square mile theory, but Victorian protectionists use it freely when it suits their purpose. I neverthought much of the system until I saw itused a good deal down here. There isanother theory which the honourable gentleman put forward, to which I shall referbriefly. He committed himself to the I quoted the increases statement that if the imports and exports of a country did not agree, they would be balanced by coin. During the ten the honourable member years, 1889 to 1898, the goods imported by Great Britain amounted to £1,334,000,000 I quoted 37 per cent, in excess of imports. That was a big bulk to pay in sovereigns. During the same period she exported gold and bullion and silver specie amounting to £356,000,000, while she im1 ported £401,000,000 worth. There were £1,334,000,000 excess of imports of merI compared England chandise, and £45,000,000 more of imports of gold and silver. There is something else I am going now to deal with there. What is it? The policy of Great Britain is not that of the Minister for Trade and Customs, who would follow a coin round the borders of Australia to see that it did not get out, lest it should be lost. That is not tlie maxim of British merchants, and capitalists. They lend their money all over the world. They do not want it back. They bring back their ships laden with raw material and cheap food, and they make up most of this raw material and send it out in a manufactured state to the markets of the world. The honourable ancl learned member for Indi referred to the marvellous progress of America. May I instance one little fact, which in itself is sufficient to dispose of a great deal of what he said. They grow an I am quoting from the Daily enormous quantity of raw cotton in the United States. Where do they send it ? It is taken by the British merchant in his ships . to Liverpool and up to Manchester. The British people import £34,000,000 worth of. cotton from America and other parts of the world. They clothe themselves with it, so far as cotton articles of clothing are concerned, and send away €67,000,00 0 worth in the finished state. They supply the whole population of the British Isles with cotton goods, and yet they are able to sell in the world's market £67,000,000 worth",168,Smith Tha T Is If The Result We Have Not Got It Why First

I do not refer to all our manufactories. I am not alluding to a large number The country of Australian industries, which, are bound to come soon, and be a source of prosperity is a marvellous thing, but it is to us. But I cannot come to the level of the honourable member for Echuca,, who The seems to think that the people who develop our internal industries are hewers of wood and drawers of water, and that wo should bring higher industries into Victoria. AVhat true political snobbishness that is. Is the labour of the farmer something inferior ? Isi t not at the heart of all national progress and strength ? The -honourable member represents an agricultural constituency, but Are these gigantic industries, he is guilty, actually, of the ineffable snobbishness of drawing a distinction between industries of the town, which live upon the people, and industries which have to live politicians? upon the people in countries abroad. It seems to me that this policy of industrial favouritism reaches an inhuman point when it b.urdens the machinery of our agricultural industries. Where do they sell ? It is not a case of coming to us aud trying to push into our markets. They have to take their chance at the other end of the world, and How are we to manufacture push into markets thousands of miles away from the producing centres. They have to enter into competition with this terrible cheapness, this accursed abundance. That is appliances the lot of our pioneer industries, and forsooth, in this great struggle in the cheap markets of the world, our farmers are to be taxed on their machinery. If you will favour industries, favour the How are great and natural industries of the soil. And may I suggest to my gifted friend, the Minister for Trade and Customs, that if the Government believe in what he It seems to me said to-day, they have a simple method of making us all rich in the right way. What is the right way % For the Government themselves to establish these industries, if they are light. Why, if this is a national policy, should the burden rest only on tlie people who buy the article that is made ? They are encouraging an industry. manufactures. Why, if it is a national policy, should not the burden of it be distributed over the nation? The inherent fatal fallacy of the protectionist doctrine is that it handicaps the wrong man. It makes a man who is encouraging an industry, and buying what it makes, pay the burden, whereas the nation ought to pay it, and when the nation pays it the sweating and wages evils will disappear. did tlie honourable member for Melbourne Ports discover in Victoria before the wages boards were established ? When they had this policy of dearness all round Victoria, before the three wages boards were established, what did .the secretary of the Anti-Sweating League say ? He said that universal sweating was going on in Melbourne in all the industries. There was protection! The Victorians are a first-class people. If it runs to sweating honourable and Isaacs, with their eagle eyes looking on, what will it do in other countries? There is the acknowledgment of the league, of which the Attorney-General and the honourable member for Melbourne Ports are officials, that protection in Victoria ran to universal sweating. There are people here to-day as badly sweated as are any people in the world. Let the benevolent gentlemen who are interested in down-trodden Victorian labour, take an interest in the position of the milkmen of Melbourne. Let them inquire into the circumstances of the milkmen, and they willfind a pictureof misery and sweating equal to that in any place out of Australia. Let them look on these sores that come upon this policy of theirs. It was all covered with sores until a further device was planned. the policy they had to runafter the manufacturer to make him disgorge. We had none of these troubles in New South Wales. The men managed pretty well to get fair wages without them. If you take the wages of the wages boards of Victoria, and those of our people, you will find a difference of i d . per week between them-£ 1 13s. lOd. in Victoria, and £ 1 13s. Gd. in New South Wales. But there is that accursed cheapness for the man with the £ 1 13s. 6d., and that beneficent scarcity for the man with the £ 1 13s. .10d. Fourpence more and scarcity versus fourpence less and abundance! is the use of arguing about Europe, and America, and Great Britain, when we have this stark, staring fact before us, that one-tenth of the population of this blessed countiy has cleared out Ofi t in ten years ? Could you have a truer demonstration that the labour condition!! are better somewhere else than when men leave here by the hundred thousand? If one-tenth of the people of What England went away in ten years would yous not fill the air with your semi-gratification at the decadence of the mother country?

I learned friend, Mr am not talking about Ireland; I am talking about one of the most progressive and enlightened communities on God's earth Victoria. Now, one-tenth of the manhood of this protectionist paradise had to emigrate like the Irish emigrant of 40 years ago. Did he emigrate from high wages, and dignified and comfortablesurroundings, to rough it again in the world ?' That one fact ought to talk to labour w i th a trumpet tongue. A country which drivesforth labour out of it is in a bad way. A country like Victoria, which cannot keep1,200,000 people in it, has been in bad hands. It is a wonderful thing to give old-age pensions, but a thousand times better to keep your men in the countiy. That one fact cast a black band over Victoria, and is it wonderful that the people of the State feel Having got at last the pressure of this policy which is. driving men away ? Every man who goesis a customer lost to 50 industries of Victoria. A man can work in only one line, but he is a customer in 50 lir.es. Every man who leaves is a loss to the country, not a gain, unless you carry the protectionist theory down to the Robinson Crusoe extreme. He was a perfect protectionist in spite of himself. No breath of sweated labour could be wafted towards his free and independent home. No foreigners, no importations, perfect solitude, and perfect wealth ! What -hi s man Friday. Mi'. REID -But Friday he treated like a man, and that is more than the politicians have done with Victorians.

Honourable members will see that from .a selfish, party point of view it would suit us to leave this Tariff just as it is, with all its imperfections on its head; but I think that my honourable friends and myself have a higher conception of our duty than to take such a course. Although we may be defeated with regard to the motion, I hope we -shall set aside party interests, and fight as great a fight as we can in endeavouring, as the Minister for Home Affairs has said, to knock the rough edges off the Tariff. The Minister says that it has any number of rough edges, and it will have a number more before it is finished, if my honourable friends have their way. I shall strive with might and main to reduce this Tariff to reasonable proportions ; but it is really impossible to reasonably amend a Tariff framed as this is. A Tariff is a most complicated thing to work -out, and when you begin to pick out this piece and the other piece, there is very great danger of the whole thing being reduced to confusion. Therefore, as far as I am concerned, I do not look forward with any satisfaction to the task of endeavouring to improve this Tariff. I believe it will be reduced by improvement to utter confusion. -do our best. Whatever doubts honourable members opposite may have as to their duty to their constituents, there is no manner of doubt in our minds as to -our duty. I think I can safely say that our duty will be to make this Tariff as far as possible a genuine revenue Tariff; to reduce those duties which rest upon the great natural industries of the country, and upon the necessaries of life' as much as possible. I see insuperable difficulties in the way, because protection comes right across the path, and if it is to prevail in committee it will practically pre vent us from doing what we desire. The two principles are utterly and hopelessly antagonistic, and the project of the Government is so imperfect that it will be impossible to make anything like a creditable job of tlie Tariff. I may be allowed to allude to some remarks which have been made with regard to the policy of the Opposition, and it will save time if I ring to individual speakers. Certain honourable gentlemen have bitterly complained that I have not outlined a Tariff for the Ministry. I do not know why they should. Tlie Ministry never asked me to do it . If they had honestly desired me to assist them to frame a Tariff they ought to have told me so before they submitted it to the House. Itseems to me to be the silliest thing in the world to complain now. If they had come to me and said, "" Mr Beid, this is a great national matter, affecting the daily life of the people ; will you help us or give us your best advice?"" I should probably have said"" Yes"" ; but when the job is finished they complain that I did not help them. That is the silliest talk in the world. What my honourable friends really wanted was that I should set out an irresponsible policy which would have enabled them to distract the public mind from their policy by attacking mine. I do not, however, intend to confuse the issues in that way. It is enough for the public to digest what they have before them now without having another Tariff submitted to them. W it h reference to this particular matter of policy I do not hold myself responsible to any man in this House. I have stated my views openly to thousands of people in my own electorate, where I was at home. I told the people without any hesitationI could not be expected to Still, it will be our. duty to go into details-that my policy broadly was this : In the fir3t instance, I am in accord with the Government in not making a direct taxation a part of the Federal finance. That, however, is no new decision, as I announced it when I was before the people. It is my unmistakable decision that matters of direct taxation had better be worked out by the States for themselves, and in that respect the Government and myself are on the same ground. As to customs duties, I say that the amount the Government are proposing to raise through the Customs is exorbitant. I make it out to be exorbitant in two ways, and I think both of my arguments are thoroughly sound. It is perfectly clear to me that the Government have enormously under-estimated their revenue from the Tariff. Take the Tariff as it stands. If it were passed to-morrow, the Treasurer says that in a normal year it would produce £8,900,000. I say that the estimate is altogether wrong. refrain from referMy right honourable friends had an interest in doing this, although I do not urge for a moment that it swayed them in their action.

The bulk of their debts is for railways, which are an absolutely safe asset* All the States are absolutely sound, and accepting assistance will not affect their solvency or insolvency. 1 am prepared to go a reasonable way in the direction of putting fresh taxation on the people of New South Wales for this purpose; but when the Prime Minister, the Minister for Trade and Customs, and almost every other honourable member who has spoken on the Government side, have drawn attention to remarks of mine to the effect that the people of the mother State must be prepared for a very high Tariff, I think the least candour should surely be sufficient to protect me from such an interpretation as that I meant a highly protective Tariff. Such a construction of my words is absolutely tortuous. I was addressing tomed to a phenomenally low Tariff, and .1 was bound in honour and I orable obligation as fully-to let the people know of the great change that must come. A sound revenue Tariff of £8,000,000 would involve a great change in taxation in New South Wales, where it would be regarded as very high; and I erred on the side of candour in putting before the people what the result would probably be. But to endeavour to trap me into a shred of approval of the particular Tariff now under review, as a means of raising a large revenue, is altogether too silly and too unfair. A fte r the all-night sitting which the House has had, I think I ought in fairness to abandon a number of the observations which I should have made had the House been fresh. I feel very much indebted to honourable members for the courteous patience with which they have listened to me, and I feel I shall have a number of other opportunities of dealing with some of the matters to which it would now be convenient to refer. made to which I attach a great deal of importance. The Treasurer impressed on us how wise it would be to give this Tariff the element of permanence; thoroughly agree with the right honourable gentleman that that would be the greatest service that we could render to the people of Australia. It is one of the greatest objects au Australian statesman can set before h i m ; but there is a great difference 19 Y between agreement on a point of that kind, and tlie acceptance, as permanent, of a Tariff by men who absolutely protest against it as unrepresentative of the feelings and principles of the people of Australia. We can do nothing as yet, but I hope we shall be able to arrive at some way of putting the Tariff before the people of Australia. There was a time when the plebiscite was ridiculed by a number of politicians in Australia, but fche plan has been often used, and I thiru* with great advantage. I admit that it would not be a fair thing to lay before the public the Tariff which the Government have placed upon the table of the House, and ask them the question"" A r e you in favour of thia Tariff?"" That would be an unfair tiling, because it would be inviting every one who had a complaint to vote against the Tariff. people who were accusI am not one to ask for an issue of that sort; but we might solve the matter in perhaps a very happy way if, amongst wish others had fulfilled the honourselves, we were to consider whether we could not, in some form fair to the Government, send the Tariff to a plebiscite. I have considered the matter a little, and I think there is a fanissue which, put in proper language, might be referred to the people of Australia. I want to put the question in a way fair to the Government as well as fair to ourselves, because it is only in such a way that the proposal I am making can be successfully carried out. I am prepared to take up the invitation of the Treasurer. I am prepared, so far as I am concernedand I believe I may speak for the party I represent, although we have not consulted-to accept the Tariff of the Government, with such amendments as we may make in Committee, as a permanent Tariff for ten years at least-and even for fifteen years if the following issue, which, I think, would be fair to the Government, were placed before the people"" Is this, the GovernBut one remark has been ment Tariff, a fair basis for the Commonwealth Tariff?"" I think that is a fair issue. The people would not be asked to vote for the Tariff, but, to say whether, in their and I opinion, it is a fair basis for tlie Commonwealth Tariff. That issue involves the question of principle. Every man in favour of the Government policy-that is, the protective-cum-revenue policy, would say ""yes;"" and every one in favour of a revenue Tariff without protection, would Say, ""no.""

It is all very well for those the Hansard staff were given a holiday for honourable members who live in Melbourne, but surely they should have some consideration for those of us who live in more distant parts. It is impossible for the Tariff to be finished before Christmas. The result will be a short adjournment, and it is more than probable that during that adjournment a number of honourable members who live in the far north of Queensland will be unable to reach their homes ; probably they will be kept here until March. The Government should take this matter seriously into consideration.

Can the right honourable and learned gentleman inform the House whether any representation has been made to the Secretary of State for the Colonies with regard to the withdrawal of Queensland from the Commonwealth, and if he can get that information, will he be so good as to lay it before the House? External Affairs) in reply -With regard to Major McKnight's report, I explained before that he had furnished certain direct statements with regard to the Wilmansrust disaster which worebased upon his own knowledge, but, with respect to the question which arose as to certain courts-martial, and the circumstances leading up to them, he furnished no information that was not hearsay. I considered that it was certainly not my duty to lay this information upon the table unless the House particularly wished it-havin g in view not only what I have stated, but the fact that the incident has been closed by the release of the men, and by the supercession of the general, who was deemed to have treated them in a manner which, if correctly reported, certainly no one could approve of. ter think that that statement reflects upon the officer? these subjects are not of much value, but, as I said before, I shall be pleased to. hand the report for inspection and perusal to any honourable member wbo wishes it , but I am hot prepared to lay it upon the table. I said, however, that if it were the general desire of honourable members, I would lay it upon the table, because I would not resist the will of Parliament in a matter of this sort. If, however, honourable members will look at the report, and see the extent to which it depends upon hearsay evidence, they will not, I am sure, insist upon its being laid before the House. of securing direct information on the subject ? cabled for the fullest information, and I think we may very well let the matter rest until we get it , because honourable members may safely assume that the particulars we shall receive will be more reliable than any report founded upon hearsay. I do not say. this with the object of suppressing information. It is only fair to say that, provided that facts are as have been stated, public sympathy can only be in the one direction, and I do not wish to dissociate-myself from the public in my sympathy. W it h regard to the question of the honourable member for Dalley, respecting the military commandant, I may inform him that no commandant has yet been appointed. There have been lengthy communications on the subject, and as these are secret it is not within my power to lay them on the table at present. I can assure the honourable member that the Government is not delaying the matter in anyway, but on'the contrary is urging it as much as possible. The honourable member will see with me that the whole matter has been necessarily hung up for three weeks owing to the debate which we have just passed through. W it h reference to the question about leather raised by the honourable member for Parramatta, the statement he has referred to apparently appeared in a Victorian Government Gazette notice. It was notaaadvertisementof this Government, and' it has not been published in the Commonwealth Gazette. I will, however, make inquiries as he desires. I understand that some of the leather is described as' "" such leather as may be required by the Victorian or Federal' Government.""
