Mr WTrllTLAMI ask the Prime Minister a question. Now that all members of Cabinet's Defence and Foreign Affairs Committee are back in Australia for the first time since the beginning of September, will he be able, as he has often stated that he hoped, to present his promised triennial defence review before the House rises? I point out that the last triennial review was to his statements over the last few months given by Sir Robert Menzies over 4 years regarding the preservation of our fishing ago, and that the right honourable gentlegrounds and the Great Barrier Reef. Can man himself defined the purpose of the he inform me when we can expect the intropending review on 15th August as: . . a review of the kinds of equipment and hardware that various services in Australia need and require and will buy in the course of a year or order to be paid for in future years. Not least, will he give an indication of the personal representations to me to have role which Australian companies will hencesomething done to protect the natural l'iving forth be allowed to play in research and species of our continental shelf. I am pleased production for the defence Services? begin by pointing out to the Leader of the enactment of this new legislation dealing Opposition that the 3-year programme of with natural living species on the continental which he speaks, and indeed of which most shelf will mean that such things as giant members generally speak, is not a 3-year clams and our Great Barrier Reef, even programme which has begun at thc beginthough they may be outside the exclusive ning of a period of 3 years and which runs 12-mile fishing zone over which we exercise through to the third year. It is in fact a protection at the moment, will also be prorolling programme. There is a 3-ycar protected. This legislation will be in conformity gramme and when one year passes there are with the international Convention on the 2 years left and there is a consideration of Continental Shelf and should ensure the prethe following year. This is the way in which servation of the valuable species such as we this matter has always been treated. SoI am have on the Great Barrier Reef. not quite sure of the triennial review to which he has referred. I think that we indicated last night in this House the general AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY matter of what Australia is going to do up until the end of 1971, which is indeed a period of 3 years, and also pointed out the for the Interior: Is it a fact that there is no irresponsibility of endeavouring to make avenue of appeal to a court of superior finite statements of what would be done in jurisdiction for a police sergeant who, after the far future. I believe that this matter has 20 years of unblemished service, was today been generally covered in this House. But I dismissed on the order of the Minister would add this: I understand that my colfollowing a secret inquiry into charges made league the Minister for Defence is engaged by the Commissioner of Police and the in endeavouring to make a close study of receipt of a report furnished to the Minister how we can provide more of our defence by the magistrate who presided over that requirements from Australian sources, in inquiry?

6,Mr Anthonyi Am Aware Of Tbe Very,"will the Minister consider tabling all the papers in this matter, including the minutes of evidence, reports to the Minister from the Commissioner of Police and the report from the magistrate? Alternatively, will the Minister consider making all these documents available to members of this Parliament who are Queen's Counsel and who have some regard for the due processes of law and tbe administration of justice? Will the Minister permit me to say here, from my place in this House, that I believe that there has been in this case a grave miscarriage of justice. honourable gentleman that there is no court of appeal available to the detective sergeant whom I unfortunately had to dismiss from the Police Force of the Australian Capital Territory this morning. The detective sergeant was charged with disgraceful conduct in that he was allegedly associated with gambling schools at the Corin Dam. There were two charges laid against him. I shall read tlie charges to the honourable member. The first charge was one of disgraceful conduct in that he was knowingly concerned in an attempt to organise unlawful gaming at the camp at Corin Dam in the Australian Capital Territory. The second charge was one of disgraceful conduct in that he was improperly connected with unlawful gaming and betting at Corin Dam. The situation is that he was found guilty on the first charge and not guilty on thc second. I should make it clear to the House that in the hearing I protected the detective sergeant's position as much as I could, in thc hope that he would have been proven innocent, by holding the hearing in camera. He was able to use counsel at the hearing. In the event he was found guilty. As his responsibility in the police force included thc control of illegal gaming, I had no real alternative but to dismiss him from the police force. I will have a look at the substance of the matter raised in the other part of the honourable member's question, in which he asked me to table the documents or allow him to see them, and I will let him know my decision in due course. question. Is he aware that all newspaper tankers with Australian shipyards before coverage of parliamentary proceedings the end of the year. As only 6 weeks remain from the Press gallery is now organised on a syndicated basis known as AAP, which I understand is owned by the proprietors of all major Australian newspapers except the 'Australian'? Does this mean that a common lead and viewpoint will thereby be circulated to the public throughout Australia and that the presentation of differing points of view will be restricted? Does the Attorney-General not consider that this is dangerous as the interpretation of parliamentary debates and actions is placed in the hands of a single organisation which could, if wrongly used, be a danger lo the impartial reporting of the country's affairs? Does this syndication offend the Trade Practices Act in any way? any information that would enable me to verify the facts given by the honourable member. Honourable members will be aware that the Trade Practices Act draws a clear distinction between the supply of goods and services and the supply of pure services. Agreements relating to the former must be registered but agreements relating to pure services do not have to be registered, although what is done under them may constitute an examinable practice. There does not seem to be anything in the information contained in the honourable member's question to suggest that the trade practices law has been infringed. So far as the balance of the honourable member's question is concerned, it does not appear that there would be any breach of the privileges of this House unless the procedure, if it does exist, led to reporting that was inaccurate. The mere fact of uniformity would not appear to be any breach of privilege. question to the Minister for Shipping and Transport. On 6th June, by way of a question, I drew the attention of the Minister to the fact that there were approximately 150,000 dead weight tons of foreign owned tankers operating on the Australian coast and that since 1963 only three replacement tankers have been built in Australian shipyards for coastal operations. In reply the Minister informed me that two",14,Police Force

10,Mr Charles Jonesi Direct My,"before the end of the year ancl as tenders have not yet been invited, can the Minister say when tenders are to be called and orders placed for the tankers referred to by him in reply to my question on 6th June last? have been given for foreign owned tankers to operate on the Australian coast. As honourable members will be aware, in the past 6 months there has been a substantial change in the nature of the product that it is necessary to carry round the Australian coast. There are two particular types of cargo, the crude and the refined product, each of which has a slightly different need. At a time when it has been difficult to assess what the long term need will be, each of the operators of tankers around the Australian coast has been making a reassessment. It is essential from the point of view of the Australian users of fuel, motor spirit and so on that the freight rate tivity will be dealt with when the statement charged on the movement of both the crude and the refined product should be as low as possible. For this reason, it is necessary that the tankers be of the size most suited to the nature of the cargo to be shipped to the ports to which the products are to be carried. The assessment has taken into account each of these factors. Since the honourable gentleman last directed a question to me, discussions have taken place wilh the operators of the vessels for which permits have been given. They are still not in a position to place their order finally, but it is expected that before too long the undertaking which they have given to build in Australia the replacement tankers will be carried out. However, I bring to the attention of the honourable member the necessity for all products carried around the Australian coast to be carried at the minimum freight rate necessary to ensure adequate ancl efficient cartage. I think it is essential, in working out the type of tanker that is to be built, that this should be taken into account. It is certainly in the long term interest of the Australian public that this should be so. Postmaster-General is in anticipation of a statement that he said recently he would make regarding the many representations that have been made objecting to the high cost to rural telephone subscribers when converting from manual to automatic service. Will the Postmaster-General give urgent consideration to making whatever relief is given, retrospective over a period so that it will encompass those rural telephone subscribers who have been adversely affected by the high cost of the progressive policy of the Postmaster-General's Department to convert from manual to automatic telephone services? by the honourable member for Wimmera last week I indicated that decisions had been taken in relation to matters of substance in this area but that certain matters of detail were still receiving consideration. I cannot at this stage make any other comment than was given in answer to that question. I will make a statement to the Parliament and the question of retrospecis made. addressed to the Minister for External Aflairs. In view of his speech last Monday to the Royal Institute of Public Administration and his subsequent denial that any of his criticism was directed specifically at any present Minister, I ask: Do all present Ministers, including the Prime Minister, give clear, prompt and firm decisions? Do all present Ministers work with and not shelter behind the Public Service? Are all present Ministers free of the charge of involving public servants too deeply in their ministerial or constituency affairs? Has any present Minister fallen flat on his face in a public place? Does the Minister hold that the present Ministry is free of all the faults which he has noticed in his 40 years experience with the Public Service and the Parliament? If so, can he give the House an idea of what previous Ministers and what incidents were the basis for his comments? honourable gentleman that I am very proud to be associated with the Ministry with which I am now working and that I am very proud to be associated with my colleagues in it.

15,Mr Haslucki Wish To Assure The,"my utmost loyalty from the commencement but, I am very glad to say, I have found il possible to work in the closest cooperation and in a constructive partnership with him. 1 think that he feels towards me in the same way as that. I am very glad that the honourable member raised this question because it gives me an opportunity to make some clarification. The address to which he referred was delivered to what might rightly be called a learned society, an institute devoted to public adminpoint I should like to clear up with your istration. The address itself was constructed in what I thought was a thoughtful and perhaps academic way. It has been misinterpreted. If the honourable gentleman will read the address as il was deliveredand 1 will have much pleasure in furnishing him with a copy of it-h e will find that these references to Ministers, which have been taken out of context, were only incidental to the main theme. The main theme concerned the place of the public servant in the whole structure of government. The two points that were being stressed were the independence of the public servant and the distinctive role of the public servant, and the fact that the public servant, as distinct from the politician, had continuity of service. I was saying that these things were in the custody of the public servant himself ancl thai it was very important fhat the public servant and the whole of the Public Service should preserve their independence and should take advantage of this opportunity presented by their continuity of service. Among the illustrations I gave was a reference to some of the attempts ihat are sometimes made to break down that independence or to impair the continuity of service. All the references to Ministers except one were in general terms and could not by any fair mind be interpreted as applying to a particular Minismembers will cease interjecting. ter of this Government or any previous government. They were in general terms and were drawn from a long experience. 1 think the House will realise that my association with matters of government goes back over a long period of years in various activities-as a journalist, as a university lecturer in this field, as a public servant, as a research student working on the history of administration, as a parliamentarian and as a Minister. Drawing on a very long period of experience covering many governments of many political complexions I made some general references to Ministers. The only particular reference I madeI did not name the Minister-wa s a specific reference to the fact that I had seen a particular department brought to a state of confusion because a particular Minister had not observed the sort of rules which I was suggesting that Ministers should observe. That particular Minister was not on this side of politics and was not a member of this Government. There is another permission, Mr Speaker. Statements that have been made in the Press about the displeasure of my colleagues are quite false because although several of them have expressed agreement with what I have said, none has expressed disagreement. Leader of the Opposition stated that the address given by the Minisler for External Affairs, which has just been the subject of a question, was discussed in Cabinet in a critical way. It is unusual lo make any reference in this House to what happens in Cabinet but because the Minister is under attack in respect, of this matter I want to make it perfectly clear that at no stage was the matter brought up in Cabinet in a critical or other way. It is perfectly untrue to say that it was. statement made by the Prime Minister because I Inter learned that in fact this matter was not raised in Cabinet; it was raised by the right honourable gentleman with the Minister for External AfTairs, according to my information. I am told that the Prime Minister got in touch with the Minisler for External AfTairs. the Minister for External Affairs issued a memorandum to the Press.

I believe this will be of great value. Mr Legge is an expert on rehabilitation and, as the House would know, my Department is at present endeavouring to find ways and means of further improving the very excellent Commonwealth rehabilitation service. The House may not know that amendments to the Commonwealth Employees' Compensation Act will make some reference to this expanded rehabilitation service. In these circumstances it was a very valuable suggestion on the part of the honourable member that this extremely distinguished man should be asked to visit Australia on the occasion of his visit to New Zealand in May of next year. I am not certain how long Mr Legge will remain in Australia if he is able to accept our invitation, but he will be a very welcome guest and, in the best sense of the term, will be a very useful guest in enabling us to improve our Commonwealth rehabilitation service which at present is doing excellent work. Dr PATTERSONI address a question general in London money that is more to the Minister for Primary Industry.

Indeed, it is being looked at by the Minister for External Affairs and myself at the moment because I believe we need an External Affairs oflicer in the United Kingdom ranking much higher than that particular ranking in order to have the entree to his counterparts in the diplomatic service in the United Kingdom. 1 do not have the figures on thc cost of running the High Commission but I will obtain them for the honourable member. I think we should bear in mind that there are more immigrants from the United Kingdom than from any other area and therefore the immigraiion officers in that country are much larger in number than in any other country; that we still have very great trade links with the United Kingdom, both for selling and for capital purposes; and that there are perhaps reasons which are sui generis to our representation in London. But1 will let the honourable member have a more detailed explanation in writing. The last part of the honourable member's question was: Why do the sovereign States of Australia maintain Agents-General in London? This is not directly within my own province. It is probably something which should be asked of the various Premiers of the sovereign States. But one must assume that they regard this activity as being more worthy of expenditure than some of the matters which tbey say they want more money for.

The existing practice in the Royal Australian Air Force is to award double wings to a pilot ancl a single wing to other air crew members. This follows the British practice. In view of the statement by the honourable gentleman that the practice of awarding double wings to members of air crews is creeping in in other parts of the world I will have a look at the situation. However, I think there is some merit in preserving a very fine tradition. directed to the Minister for Primary Industry. I refer to tbe proposed dairy farms consolidation scheme. In view of the Minister's statement in this House yesterday that not all Stale governments had yet responded to the Commonwealth's proposal for the implementation of this important scheme, can further efforts be made with a view to implementing the scheme before the end of the current financial year? intention to have legislation introduced to enable an amalgamation of small dairy farms to take place. The implementation of this scheme will require the co-operation of the State governments, and negotiations have been taking place over the last 9 months to formulate a scheme which will be acceptable to all States. Because of difHas notice of termination of employment ferent land laws and a duplication of partial been given recently to a rather substantial schemes that might be operating in the States the Commonwealth had to arrive at something that was acceptable to all States. Officers of my Department did negotiate ancl they arrived at conclusions which we believed would be acceptable to the various State governments. The Prime Minister wrote to the State Premiers on 30th September and submitted to them these proposals, which I believe arc very generous. Up to this point of time we have had only two replies from State governments. If we do not hear from the others I will certainly ask the Prime Miniseffect in the field of employment? ter if he would mind writing to them again to find out what their intentions are. I am anxious for this scheme to become operative. I have had between 50 and 100 letters from interested dairy farmers who want to participate in this scheme. Such a scheme would enable the small dairy farmer who is anxious to leave his property, in order to retire or to take up some other occupation, to obtain a reasonable price for that property. Another advantage is that amalgamations could take place, units of larger size being more viable. The third advantage is that it may allow certain farmers to indulge in other forms of production than dairying. One of the Government's objectives is to reduce, if possible, dairy production in areas which are not truly dairying areas. I am quite sure the honourable member for Cowper is conscious of the great advantages this scheme could bring to farmers in his area, and indeed to farmers in other areas of Australia. It is a pity that we have not been getting more spontaneous response from the State governments. However, I believe that after they examine our second proposals we will get their co-operation. I am pleased to say that at a meeting recently of the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation there was unanimous agreement of all the representatives that this scheme had great virtues and that it is one with which we should press forward as quickly as possible. addressed to either the Minister for Defence or the Minister for Labour and National Service, whoever is the more appropriate. number of members of the Australian work force at the United States naval communications base in Western Australia? Have a number of others been demoted? If this is so, is it correct that the positions left vacant by those dismissed and demoted will be filled by American navy personnel? What is the reason for the reduction of the Australian work force and is it likely to be reduced still further? Finally, does Article5 of the agreement between the Australian and American Governments regarding maximum use of Australian resources have any information on the matter raised by the honourable gentleman, but I will bave an examination made and give him an answer to his question.

Has the United Nations taken any steps to make sure that the people of West Irian will in fact be able to determine their political future when the plebiscite on this matter is held in that country next year? If not, will the right honourable gentleman instruct Australia's representative at the United Nations immediately to take all possible steps to endeavour to ensure that the people of West Irian are fully informed of the issues at stake and are able to cast their votes without any fear of reprisals? which devolves upon the Secretary-General of the United Nations under the terms upon which the administration of West New Guinea was transferred from the Netherlands to Indonesia.

I prepolicy and is a matter on which the Governsent thc following paper: ment has not made any decision. If a decision is made it will be announced at a later stage. The honourable member spoke of the availability in Victoria of hydro-electric power and the possibifity of generating power with natural gas. I point out to him that in normal circumstances it is more expensive to generate power with natural gas than with the other conventional fuels such as coal and fuel oil. There is not an availability of hydro-electric power in Victoria but, as I have pointed out, it is a matter of policy, on which the Government has not come to any decision, as to where any nuclear power station should be built. examine the impact of the present tax structure and system of concessional dedications on those family units where the age and/or number of children actually prevents or should prevent the wife and mother from supplementing family income by obtaining full-time or part-time employment? If such examination reveals that the social objectives of the tax system are not being achieved, will the Treasurer at the time of the preparation of the next Budget give consideration to making appropriate changes in the tax structure? there is a likelihood of injustices or anomalies being created, I will make certain that the recommendation or advice I receive from my Department is presented to Cabinet in the context of the next Budget discussions. paper: Audit Act-Supplementar y Report of the Auditor-General upon, other accounts, for year 1967-68.

But the fact is that we ment-Motion to take note of PaperResumption of debate upon the motion, 'That the House take note of the Paper'. Aboriginal policy, with all the attention of 1 draw attention to the fact that soine of these items of business, particularly the ones relating to foreign affairs, have been on the notice paper for S, 6 and more months. Very few occasions have been available to the Parliament to have what might be called a full scale debate on such subjects. On the other hand, item 24, which is being left on the notice paper, which relates to the bombing halt in Vietnam, and which was discussed about a fortnight ago, has been listed for only a very short time. At one stage during the last 12 or 13 years it became customary for us to have what might be called full scale debates in the Parliament on matters such as these. It is very important that such debates be held, particularly on foreign affairs. Neither that subject or any other is a matter just for the Ministry, those who occupy the front benches on either side of the Parliament or those members who happen to get an opportunity for the time being to take part in a debate. It is very important that the Parliament as a whole be able to discuss these matters. It is not a question even of repetition. Each one of us here speaks for and on behalf of anything from 40,000 to 80,000 or more voters. It is important that their point of view be put. I regret that at this time of the year we are rushing through the programme and that we are clearing the notice paper in this way. Instead of doing this we should before the end of thc sessional period discuss a subject such as international affairs. A good way in which to end the year's activities would be for the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Hasluck) to make another statement on international affairs and to permit us to have a full scale debate upon it. Another item relates to a ministerial statement on Aboriginal policy. I recall that when this statement was made we were given to understand that a reasonable time for discussion would be allowed. No discussion has taken place. We now have several Bills relating to Aboriginal affairs before us and we will discuss them this should have had a full scale debate on the House turned upon it. Instead this item is being scrubbed from the notice paper, and that is not good enough. I place on record my disappointment at very few opportunities having been given to honourable members to debate effectively large areas of public policy. want to protest about the adoption of this procedure of simply wiping items from the notice paper in the dying stages of a sessional period. It has become habitual to take no notice of what happens in the Parliament. Anything that happens here is just dismissed as not being important. The items that are being wiped off have all at some time been so important that it has been essential for discussions to be held on them. Some have gone past the stage at which it may have been possible to have a useful discussion. One item relates to malpractices in connection with the importation of motor vehicles from Japan. A statement was made and everything was settled. But that does not alter the fact that honourable members are being denied an opportunity to express their views as to what should be done in the future or what was done in the past. Is it right that we should be deprived of a proper opportunity to express some views on behalf of the people we represent? A ministerial statement was made on the national water resources development programme. This is a most fertile area for discussion and many views could be expressed on it. These views should be expressed. They should be put into Hansard so that the people who frame legislation and the departmental officers who have the task of getting material together for future consideration will have some guidance from the House. But1 go a little further than simply protesting at this action to clear the notice paper so that the Ministry can get rid of the Parliament as soon as it possibly can, instead of rising for next week and then sitting again for another 2 or 3 weeks. One or two items have not been wiped off and",22,Acciden T Tennant Creek No 23 Fisherie S Bill 1968 Secon D Reading

72,Mr Whitlam,"The honourable memsubject of litigationI refer to the motor industry matter-o r on which the Government has changed its mind, as in the case of the Fisheries Bill. I have agreed to the removal from the notice paper of all matters referred to in the motion because they have been superseded by legislation, will be superbefore them will disclose that it was inseded by legislation or would be out of order because there is current litigation.

It is quite clear that the honourable memCharles Jones) about order of the day 37 ber for Angas( Mr Giles) will have an opportunity to debate Chowilla Dam, which the South Australian legislature has called on all South Australian members of Parliament to support. In the view of my Party, matters on the notice paper not the subject of the motion are still current and still urgent. They should be debated. With the sole exception of the statement about drought relief, since there should be no doubt in this matter, the other matters are no longer relevant. We have had an opportunity to debate them. I certainly yield to no one in the assertion of Parliament's rights to debate Government policy. I lament that there are so few opportunities to debate ministerial statements. However, those that are to be removed from the notice paper have in fact been superseded. SoI shall support thc motion but I shall give to the honourable member for Eden-Monaro that support on drought relief which has been denied him by bis colleagues. House) [3.42]-It is an ordinary process in this House to go through the notice paper at about this stage of the sessional period to see what items have been overtaken by the passage of events. The normal method by which this is done is for the Leader of the House to consult the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, those two members having the management functions in the House, and to go through the notice paper to see which matters may be removed. The Leader of thc Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) has correctly submitted that all the matters which are proposed to be removed1 would be glad if the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Munro) would listen to this point House now speaking to the amendment? sions did take place with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and it was agreed that certain orders of the day should be removed from the notice paper. The blue sheet which honourable members have tended to remove from the notice paper a further four items that were not referred to in my motion. This is because certain proposals were submitted to me by the Leader of the Opposition. Having regard to representations made by the honourable member for Perth( Mr Chaney) and the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr it is not proposed to remove it from the notice paper. It was agreed that two or three other items should remain on the notice paper. The purpose of removing items from the notice paper is to contract the notice paper so that it contains only current issues. The matter to which the honourable member for Eden-Monaro has referred is a statement about drought relief made on 27th MarchA subsequent statement about drought relief was made by the Prime Minister( Mr Gorton) on 26th September. In other words, the statement of 26th September had overtaken the statement of 27th March. The removal from the notice paper of order of the day 27-the statement of 27th March -doe s not in any way detract from the capacity of this House to debate the subject if and when time for a debate can be made available. 1 understand very well the motives of thc honourable member for Eden Monaro. He feels very seriously concerned about a circumstance in which he finds people in his electorate placed. Having become concerned he unfortunately, I think, came to the conclusion that the removal of order of the day 27 from the notice paper would diminish his capacity to deal with the matter. Unfortunately what he did conscientiously and sincerely has been taken up by the Leader of the Opposition for political purposes. I will not have any part in allowing the Leader of the Opposition to take advantage politically of the sincerely held belief of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro. I have made it clear why order of the day 27 is being removed from the notice paper.

The motor vehicle industry is in no better position now than it was when the statement was made, and I believe that honourable members should have an opportunity to debate it. lf this item is deleted from the notice paper, then the Minister should make an urgent statement on the matter in this House so that the situation can be debated.

121,Mr Speaker,"Order! Is it the wish ofcontainerisation of sea ancl air cargo, the use of jet aircraft, the speed of modern transport facilities and computerised collective accounting systems. These factors have made it necessary for the Department of Customs and Excise and other departments to change their methods of checking to ensure that public revenue is not lost and of containerisation, increased speed of to meet the convenience of those who are importing and otherwise dealing in goods. The Minister for the Interior said that the main purpose of the Bill was to provide for the introduction of new streamlined procedures. He said that the present system has three main elements, namely, detailed supersome relationship to an inquiry by the vision by an officer of all operations, mainJoint Committee of Public Accounts, tenance of independent records by the Department, which are in some respects similar to the importers' bookkeeping records, and the obligation on business enterprises to present individual customs entries and/or specific requests for approval forward five principles for commodity confor each operation. ln the past a fairly detailed check was made by departmental officers, the Department kept its own records and business organisations were required to present indisame way, regardless of their origin or vidual Customs entries in respect to particular items on which duty had to be paid. This amounted to a very detailed and complicated system. For quite a long time many who have observed the system in operation have felt that it could be considerably simplified. This was even before some of the modern developments that the Minister referred to came into operation. It has been clearly demonstrated for quite a number of years in similar fields that supervision can properly be maintained by spot checks and the use of statistical techniques and that it of an excise officer acted as a deterrent to is not necessary to use the old policing system of endeavouring to supervise every particular transaction to determine whether certain obligations are being avoided. The Minister has informed the House that a new system of control, known as commodity control, is to be implemented. This requires a planned checking by officers of normal commercial records and accounts maintained by those engaged in the business. Apparently the Department will not maintain its own independent records from now on but will check the ordinary commerical records and accounts maintained by those engaged in the business. There will also be planned random checks of associated physical operation. Apparently it is proposed to abandon the full-time, detailed supervision by officers of all operations and the maintenance of unnecessary independent records. The House and everyone affected will welcome this change, which has apparently come into existence only as a result operation, computerised activities and so forth. But it seems to me that a change may have been possible even before these developments took place. The proposed changes appear lo have although that factor is not apparent from what the Minister or anyone else has s-aicl. It would be strange if the Committee's inquiry was not a causal factor. It appears that the Public Accounts Committee put trol. This legislation seems to follow fairly closely those five principles. I understand that the principles developed by the Public Accounts Committee were, firstly, that all excisable commodities be controlled in the situation. Presumably the fact that these articles are crossing international frontiers docs not create a different situation. The Committee also said that the Department did not believe that it was necessary for its records of the activities of a particular organisation to be maintained, as distinct from the licencees records, providing the latter were satisfactory. Apparently the Department believed that the full-time attendance of excise officers at each factory was not necessary, even though the presence any irregular practice. It seems that this view has intluenced the situation. The Committee expressed as a third principle of the system that licencees should be required to furnish to the Department an operational return at specified intervals, subject to the size of the enterprise. Existing legislation already required various factories to render returns, but the Department proposed to seek a return of activities in a preceding period, which would be compared with the transactions revealed in the company's own books, to ensure accuracy. The fourth principle, which was stated to be embodied in the three principles I have mentioned, was that of random checks. The Department hoped to adopt the technique of random checks of random samplings in the manner of an auditor in ordinary audit operations. The last of the five principles of commodity control related to procedures adopted in respect of the under-bond removal of excisable products. So, the inquiiy conducted by ihe Public Accounts Committee seems to have had some considerable influence on the adoption of these changes. I think that those are the main points 1 wish to make about the Customs Bill (No. 2) 1968, which is the first of the six Bills that thc House is debating. The Opposition supports this legislation. The second Bill under consideration is the Excise Bill (No. 2) 1968. This legislation is necessary because of the procedural changes that we have already seen in the Customs Bill. The House was told that this legislation will permit the full application of easier to obtain; it will not change the commodity control methods in the excise area and will allow the acceptance of the normal commercial records kept by persons producing or dealing in excisable goods as an accounting medium for those goods instead of prescribing in legisation that separate forms of records shall be kept for departmental purposes. Other features of the Bill relate to ihe commodity control system. The provisions of this legislation will mean a more simplified arrangement for the removal of excisable goods, subject to the control of Customs, from one place to another by permitting a collector of Customs to dispense with currently used prescribed documents known as entries where, for example, a commercial document adequately records such a transaction. There are a number of other features of the Bill which deal with certain excise transactions, such as the calling up of refunds or drawbacks of excise duty incorrectly paid. The Bill also provides for duty free treatment for certain ships' and aircraft's stores, and permits a manufacturer duty free access to small samples of excisable goods for purposes such as quality control. The Opposition has no objection to this Bill. The third Bill is the Distillation Bill (No. almost completely by steel containers. The 2) 1968. Perhaps the main clause of this Bill is clause 5, which extends the existing incorporation of parts of the Excise Act by including PartsV and VI of the Excise Act. Those parts of the Excise Act relate to excise supervision and control of factories and excisable goods, the payment of duty, and records to be kept by manufacturers. The provisions relating to stills have been redrafted to state more precisely the circumstances in which it is unlawful for a person to have, for example, possession, custody or control of a still. The Bill provides a fine of $1,000 for such a breach. Proposed section 73A (2.) provides: A distiller or vigneron shall not, without permission, have any still in his possession or custody or under his control elsewhere than at his distillery or at the premises to which his vigneron's licence relates . . . The penalty provided for a breach of this provision is $1,000. The Opposition supports this Bill. The fourth Bill is the Beer Excise Act Repeal Bill 1968. This Bill will not make beer any cheaper; it will not make it any flavour of beer or anything of that sort. It merely relates to the control over beer that may remain on brewery premises in respect of which a licence is cancelled prior to the provisions of this Bill becoming operative. Apparently the Public Accounts Committee was interested in this matter. It seems that that Committee drew attention to the fact that vessels containing beer could be of 54-gallon, 36-gallon, 27-gallon or 18-gallon capacity-althoug h I have seen beer in smaller containers than those. The Beer Excise Act provided an allowance, for duty purposes, of 2 gallons in respect of the largest container, and 1 gallon in respect of the three smallest containers. It was stated that this was a traditional allowance, the origin of which was not clear. One view as to its origin was that it was derived from the days when beer was brewed mainly in wooden containers, and the allowance was made for the brewing and sedimentation. Another idea was that it originated in the days when wooden vessels varied in capacity. The Act stated that this allowance would be permitted while the use of wooden vessels continued. Of course wooden casks are pretty rare these days, having been replaced traditional allowance, with a margin of 2 gallons and 1 gallon depending on the size of the container, is now to be altered and the full duty will be imposed and collected on the full quantity that the new metal cask contains. This Bill registers another of the changes that have taken place in the way in which beer is brewed and transported. The Opposition supports the Bill. The next Bill is the Canned Fruit Excise Act Repeal Bill 1968. The purpose of this Bill is to repeal the Canned Fruit Excise Act 1963 and the Canned Fruit Excise Act 1968 for the same reasons that applied in the case of the Beer Excise Act Repeal Bill. The Opposition supports this Bill as well. The fifth Bill is the Sales Tax Assessment Bill (No. 5) 1968. This Bill will enable Australia to accede to the European Convention of Customs Treatment of Pallets used in International Transport which was signed in Geneva in December I960. The Bill deals with the collection of sales tax on pallets. As the law stands at the moment the collection of this sales tax would be in contravention of the Convention, which states that no sales tax is payable on pallets as well. One of its main functions is the used in international transport. The Opposition supports this measure. In my view there is no necessity to go beyond the particular technical requirements of these Bills in this debate. It may be possible to extend tbe debate, but it does not appear to me that this is an appropriate occasion for that kind of exercise. Therefore I have nothing more to say. As I have indicated, the Opposition supports the Bills. is not my purpose to cover the ground which the honourable member for Yarra (Dr. J. F. Cairns) has already covered. 1 will confine my contribution to this debate to the Customs Bill (No. 2) 1968 and the Excise Bill (No. 2) 1968. Each of these pieces of legislation was introduced in the Senate on 19th September last, and the first reading of each of them was made in this chamber on 17th October. So honourable members on both sides of the House have had an opportunity to study the legislation and to realise its possible repercussions. At the outset I should say that the Departknown as the Department of Trade and ment of Customs and Excise is charged with the collection of customs and excise for the Commonwealth. These two basic functions are of considerable importance but different in activity so far as the Department is concerned. Each function assists the Government, and in particular the Treasury, in the collection of revenue in accordance with Government policy. Customs duty as such is imposed on goods imported into Australia, thereby protecting Australian manufacturers in terms of Government policy. The term 'customs' could be said to have originated in the Domesday Book, in which h was laid down that it was the 'custom' to pay levies to the King. Excise is quite different, lt is a duty imposed on commodities manufactured or produced in Australia itself. The origin of the term goes back also a very long way. In 1643 in the British Long Parliament it was stipulated that an impost would be charged on goods manufactured in the country for the benefit of the King. In the original legislation in 1643 an impost was placed on spirits, beer, ale and cider. As the House can readily see, the Department of Customs and Excise has two main functions, although it has other functions protection of revenue in terms of Government policy. The customs tariff has 500 items which are subdivided into about 3,500 items in all. This gives an indication of the ramifications of the customs side of this Commonwealth Department. As I have said, it is used predominantly as an instrument to protect local manufacturing and producing industries. At the same time it produces substantial revenue for the Commonwealth. In the Budget of 1968-69 it has been estimated that some $330m will be received into revenue from the customs side of this Department. The excise side of the Department is quite different. It is purely a revenue producing instrument for the Government, and this year some $900m will be received by the Treasury from this side of the Department of Customs and Excise, even though excise is imposed on about twenty-one items only. Prior to federation each State had the right to impose its own customs and excise duties. At the time of federation these powers were transferred to the Commonwealth and the Department, which was then Customs, was established. Over the years it has been split into two departments, the one about which we are now talking being known as the Department of Customs and Excise. The Department in Australia has had a longer history than any otber Commonwealth Department and, as 1 have said, its",29,Customs Bill No 2 1968

The evidence collected by lishment of the Commonwealth of Austhe Committee ran to 261 pages. Many of tralia. The methods originally used for conthe questions were pertinent to the debate trol date back to those earlier times of we are now conducting. One of the queswhich I have spoken, but many of them tions of real importance to the Department's were quite good methods for those days and commodity control procedures is to bc found have remained good methods until even at page 33 of thc Minutes of Evidence of recent tims. Reviews have been continually the Public Accounts Committee on which carried out by the Department. In recent the Committee based its SOth report. The years, of course, with the advent of much answer was given by Mr Keogh. He said in heavier production and more activity in reply to question 84: industry and commerce, other methods have had to be adopted by the Department. degree Until 1959 very few major changes in methods of control were adopted by the Department, but all manufacturing industries and all people connected with commerce in Australia and elsewhere were turning to advanced methods of administration and control, so that the Department of Customs and Excise also had to do a lot about its own control methods and administration. As1 have said, the initial investigation of comprinciples involved, can diversify their attention. modity control commenced in about 1959 and the report that followed was considered by the conference of collectors in 1964. I found it interesting to read the report submitted to the collectors. In 1959 the Department had introduced the method of commodity control mentioned by the honourable member for Yarra. It was introduced in the petroleum industry because it was a difficult indusiry to handle, particularly from the point of view of the admission of petroleum into Auslralia. The Department evaluated the success of the use of this method in the petroleum industry and found it an emcient means of protecting the revenue accruing to the Commonwealth from that industry. Most of the information regarding commodity control ean be found in the evidence that was taken from the Department by the Public Accounts Committee during 1965. The report submitted to this Parliament by that Conimittee in 1966 is very illuminating. Interior says 'hear, hear'. He was extension one of Ihe members of the Public Accounts Committee which took This is just what the Department is now evidence about commodity control from lhe doing. It is extending its commodity control Department of Customs and Excise between system to other products. The Department May and November 1965. The Committee reported to the Public Accounts Committee submitted 1.300 questions to the Department that there were so many primary pieces of The principles of commodity control require a of specialisation. But we consider that it is only in thc formative years of a particular commodity. As the principles on which we are working, and which 1 can outline for you in a moment, become uniform in the various situations, they will allow a wider rotation of officers, for example, between customs and excise than occurs at the moment. If your system and principles for handling excisable tobacco and cigarettes are the same as those for imported tobacco, you have a common achievement there. If you turn from that sort of commodity to. say, a purely imported commodity, such as timber, then your officers, knowing ihe This is particularly important in the smaller State* where the quantity of work on any one commodity is not sufficient to keep an officer occupied full time. PerhapsI should also say at this stage that we are not introducing anything magical in what we term this system of commodity control. The sorts of things we are doing are no more than what modern audit practice carries out in the Public Service and in industry. At this point I want to congratulate Mr Keogh on that off the cuff answer lo the question that was put to him. To my mind it sums up many of thc things that the commodity control procedure endeavours to do so far as the Department is concerned on the one hand, and so far as industry is concerned on the other. As a result of this and other evidence taken by the Public Accounts Commitlee. the Committee presented to the Parliament its 80th report, of which I would like to mention one or two small paragraphs. On pace 29 the Committee said, amongst other things: We were informed that the commodity control the petroleum products industry, is capable of to other products.",32,Customs Bill No 2 1968
123,Mr Nixon,"Hear, hear!",33,Customs Bill No 2 1968
124,Mr Whittorn,"Thc Minister for the system, which has been successfully established inlegislation involved in customs control that efforts had been made to minimise the amount of legislation covering the Department's control procedures. It said that each of the numerous pieces of legislation covers a different commodity whereas in fact the fundamentals are the same so far as control of the goods is concerned. So the Department, in good sense, approached the Attorney-General's Department, and between them they have produced for presentation to this House the 4 or 5 pieces of legislation which are now before us. This was a step towards consolidating many of the Acts that have governed the activities of the Department of Customs and Excise over many years. As a result of the hearing of the Public Accounts Committee, the Committee, on page 45 of its report, finally stated: In respect of the broader aspects of excise control which have been exercising the minds of senior departmental officers, we would reiterate that a sufficient period would appear to have elapsed to allow the Department to determine its final policy in respect of the commodity control system, and we trust that a more decisive attitude will govern future thinking within the Department. So from 1965 until the present time the Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Customs and Excise have, as a result of their own thinking and the thinking of the Public Accounts Committee, brought to us the legislation which we are considering today. In other words, there were pressures within the Department itself from departmental officers and there were pressures from the outside as well-fro m manufacturers, producers and the Parliament, to streamline the procedures of the Department. So much so that in 1966-67 the then Minister for Customs and Excise, Senator Anderson, said that the decision had been made to implement this new system known as 'commodity control'. The Department has told honourable method of commodity control' is to be intromembers on this side of the House, and duced, simply because of the increased no doubt honourable members on the other side of the House as well, that commodity volume of transactions, the scope and speed control commenced in the warehouse, in the of modern transport, the demands of comdraw back system and in the excise areas. merce which require rapid movement of So the Bills now before us contain not only goods and the availability of goods to these amendments, but also other amendsuppliers and customers. ments, most of which are related to commodity control. The Customs Bill (No. 2) as discretion is concerned, and these Bills 1968 will enable commodity control to be will allow departmental officers to use their covered by legislation in four main areas, discretion. At the same time there was namely, the manufacture of excisable goods, under bond storage of excisable and imported goods, under bond movement of excisable and imported goods, and export of goods under draw back. In the old traditional method of control it was necessary for the Department to maintain day to day records of the operations of licensees and manufacturers. Therefore, it is obvious to all honourable members that there was a duplication of recording by producers, licensees, manufacturers and the Department. In many instances the Department also had to carry out a continuous, physical oversight of the operations of a company, the movement of goods into or from a company and the storage of goods in the stores of the company itself. Thus a company, in many cases, had to give prior notice to officers of the Department of any of these individual transactions. Obviously it was necessary for the company to await an officer from the Department to arrive at the factory or distillery to observe or carry out an oversight of these operations, and this was a slow and tedious process. The Department had to carry out detailed checking of all documents with the licensee, 1 the producer and the manufacturer. So for all these years records were maintained and supervision was exercised over the receipt of most of the information to which I have referred. In fact, the position can be summarised in a few words by saying that the Department supervised the maintenance of day to day records of the company, the licensee and the Department itself. It maintained a continuous, physical oversight of production itself. As I said earlier, a company had to give prior notice to the Department when it was fo make a change in its production procedures. These methods of control, as shown by the Department and by the Public Accounts Committee, are obsolete and inadequate. So this new The present law is quite restrictive so far difficulty in providing adequate staff to carry commerce. In other words, these oflieers out these long and tedious operations. By contrast, commodity control follows the principles of audit practice, that is, there will be a spot check of the operations of companies, particularly those that are in good standing with the Department. Officers will no longer bc engaged in routine attendance. They no longer will keep detailed records. Where the volume of business is high the Department will approve of the activities of fhe company or licensee on a continuous basis. This applies particularly to thc beer producing companies. Periodic accounts will be available, if necessary, because the new legislation will insist that a company should keep these accounts and that they should be open to check by departmental officers. Departmental officers will carry out random, selective examination of the paper work and tbe accounts kept by a company. These random checks will vary because of the knowledge of departmental officers regarding the reliability of the companies concerned. In other words, spot checks may bc made daily or weekly, depending on the reliability of the company. So it is obvious that the Department has been preparing for a change, and 1 am told that it now has a mobile, flexible, better qualified work force that can be deployed where the risk is obvious. Commodity control has many advantages for merchants, too. I have not heard from any of them, even though this legislation was introduced into the Senate for debate on 19lh September 1968. There is no need for merchants to time their operations to suit departmental officers. There will be periodic returns from the merchants or manufacturers in lieu of individual entries. Obviously this will result in a reduction of paper work, and it should result in the lowering of operational costs. I am told, too, that the Department will have savings in staff and particularly in salaries, although million gallons, was exempt from Commonthere will be no dismissal of staff because of redundancy. It will be more economic and efficient to deploy staff to the various operations than is the case at present. There is now a standardisation of control procedures over a wide range of activities covered by the Department. It must be better for industry and commerce to have knowledge of the fact that officers now trained by the Department have some indication of what goes on in industry and will not bc just checkers or clerks. They will be specialists. Commodity control was implemented in the canned fruit area in 1963, after it had been tried out in the petroleum indusiry in 1959. Feasibility studies in the canned fruit area then indicated that commodity control procedures would give benefits to industry and would provide more effective control within the Department. I am told on good authority that the Department will save 300 positions within the Department itself. Savings in salary will be approximately $700,000 a year. As I said earlier, all the employees who may be taken from the various jobs within the old traditional control method will be absorbed in the Department. There is no question in my mind that the Department has carried out a really good operation, and the introduction of commodity control into the customs and excise field should be welcomed by all members of this Parliament. There is very little I can add on the subject of procedures with which Excise Bill (No. 2) 1968 is concerned, except to say that it seems to me that there will be smaller operators on commodity control in the excise field than there will be in the customs field. In other words, there could be one-man businesses and it may be difficult for them to keep the records to which I referred earlier. I also said earlier that the excise contributes $900m to the Treasury and of this amount over $340m comes from the excise on beer. In fact, last year, the excise on beer contributed to the Federal Treasury $338,956,000. To my mind this is a considerable contribution to the Treasury. One point I would like to make is that last year also there was sold or consumed 18.5 million gallons of wine, of which only 40% was fortified and over 60%, or 11 wealth excise. In other words, there was no tax on 11 million gallons of wine produced or consumed last year. I cannot understand why the beer drinker-the little man-ha s to pay excise on his beer to the extent of over 14c a pint and the fellow who drinks table wine pays no tax, provided, of course, that the table wine is not fortified. It is my reasoning that generally the beer drinker is the little man who cannot afford to drink wine. On the other hand, the man who drinks wine is usually-bu t not alwaysmore affluent tban the man who drinks beer. Therefore. 1 think there is a good case for the Government, as a matter of policy, to impose some form of excise on the 11 million gallons of unfortified wine (hat are consumed. I think the rate of excise on wine at the moment is about 40c a gallon. I believe it is technically possible for the Government to impose an excise duty on the wine consumed in Australia. AsT have said, it is usually the little people who drink beer and the more affluent people who drink wine. The excise on beer is SI.1375 a gallon, or more than 14c a pint, and the contribution to the revenue of the Commonwealth last year was almost $339m. My other point concerns the possibility of control of the adulteration of beer. Some articles in various newspapers in Melbourne recently have dealt with the possibility of the adulteration of beer and the difficulties of customs officers in checking the practice. The newspapers said that the practice of pulling water in beer is perhaps more prevalent in Victoria than in any other State. This claim is possibly clue to the fact that investigators from some of the newspapers have made checks in various hotels and found a water content in the beer. It is difficult to gauge the extent of the practice of adulterating beer. I believe that this legisremarks seemed to indicate that the Public lation, al least, or perhaps future legislation, Accounts Commilleee report to which my should tighten the control and eliminate this practice. I am sure that the Minisler for Customs and Excise (Senator Scott) has seen thc newspaper reports to which I refer. I am sure also that some breweries have been in touch with him about this matter. Adding water to beer has two major ancl obvious effects. First of all, the gallonage is increased above that supplied by the brewery. Secondly, Ihe payment of Commonweallh excise is avoided. Both the consumer ancl the Commonwealth Treasury are penalised. 1 believe that this practice should be checked by the Department. Also, the law should be strengthened to ensure (hat the Department makes regular checks on the hotelier himself. I am toldI have not read past legislation-that the adulteration of beer in a hotel is not the fault of the hotelier; it is the fault of the person who carried the beer from the brewery to the hotel, or the fault of the brewery itself. I believe that there should 24711 / 6f>-H| t08J be a responsibility on the part of the licensee to check thc strength of beer received from the brewery and to make sure that all beer sold over the counter in hotels is unadulterated and suitable for human consumption. I support these Bills and 1 commend the Department and its offioers on ihe tremendous work that they have done since 1959 in making sure that this legislation meets the needs of the Parliament and the people of Australia. of Bills being debated together has been listed on the notice paper for some time. We have been anxious to discuss them because inherent in them are some principles, the importance of which I wish to underline as strongly as possible. The honourable member for Yarra (Dr. J. F. Cairns), speaking for the Opposition, correctly pointed out that these Bills in the main are administrative measures. Bui1 would impress on honourable members the fact that legislative foundation for thc proposed procedures is necessary. It is for Ihis reason that these Bills have come before us. This legislation indicates the traditional background lo the collection of customs and excise down the years. I listened carefully to the honourable member for Yarra. I had felt that his colleague, the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Whittorn), has referred in some detail, and the conclusions set out in thai report, had not been studied by the honourable member for Yarra. He expressed the thought that perhaps Ihe Committee's investigations in the excise field may have had some impact in respect to the legislation that we are now considering. I want to bring out the point ihat. us a member of the Committee, I am quite convinced that what we had to say early in 1966 as a result of our investigations in the preceding year must surely have added some strength to the thinking of some senior officers of the Department of Customs and Excise. But I shall deal with that in some detail later. The Bills covered by this debate result from a number of Government decisions with very wide ramifications indeed. These measures are concerned with the administrative field. Many of us are interested in",33,Customs Bill No 2 1968
125,Mr Cleaver (Swan) |4.46|,"-The seriesseeing that government administration keeps pace with private enterprise. Indeed, we would like to see it ahead of private enterprise, as it often is. If this is to be achieved, the Department. A work simplification proit is important that we do not allow long delays. 1 want to refer in a moment or two to the fact that what is being done has not been achieved overnight. As a matter of fact, some people say that it took about 7 years from the initial experience to bring to fruition the broadly based application of commodity control, as we see it on this occasion. The example in the distillation and excise legislation that is before the House at the moment should be recognised, I suggest, as a preliminary move towards a single excise Act. One would hope that steady progress towards such a desirable objective might result. It is generally recognised in the Department now-and I think the Minister for the Interior( Mr Nixon) has given expression to this in his second reading speech-that one excise Act will be far more acceptable than a whole series of Acts that have to be reconciled. In the course of my review of the activities of the Department of Customs and Excise, it will be my intention to show that these decisions certainly were not taken hurriedly. Indeed, conservatism was possibly a little too pronounced, and the significant advantages that will flow from these decisions from day to day might have been available some years earlier. From my point of view-and I note with interest also from the point of view of my colleague from Balaclava-commodit y control is the core of this legislation. That is not to discount the value of the adjustment of anomalies and other desirable changes that became necessary after the long passage of years, but commodity control is the core of the legislation. The purpose of it is to institute new streamlined customs and excise procedures. May I suggest to the House that because Western Australia. According to that history, thi.s Department has such a close operating his visit to Western Australia in 1891 revolurelationship with industry and commerce it tionised the procedures in that State. is somewhat surprising that the transformaBecause so many changes were then instition effected by the modernisation of propattern for excise collections commenced cedures and methods in private enterprise from that time and many of the methods did not find a ready counterpart in the then established remained substantially established systems of the Commonwealth unaltered until now when a system of comDepartment of Customs and Excise. I modity control is to be generally remember in an earlier speech, not on this implemented. aspect but related to the Department, I paid tribute to what was done in 1956 through the enterprise of the Minister of that day and with the co-operation of the leaders of gramme was instituted then and from top to bottom in the Department of Customs and Excise there was a planned review of all the documentation and the numerous forms that were in use at the time and the multiplicity of copies of documents that had been required down through the years. This work simplification programme was reported to the House by the Minister of the day when it was brought to fruition, and we noted with approval that this had been done. Some honourable members who took part in the debate said: 'This is the hallmark of efficiency throughout the Public Service. This is the sort of review that should be undertaken from time to time in every Commonwealth department.' So, whilst I will be more emphatic, as the Parliament's Committee was more emphatic, about delays, 1 do not discount that some officers in the Department and some Ministers throughout the year have said: 'Let us review what we are doing. Let us cut off with a very sharp pair of scissors any unnecessary administration.' In the excise field alone, a study of pre-federation and post-federation history reveals that tradition has probably played too significant a part in the operations of the Department. My colleague from Balaclava referred to the Eightieth Report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. If we turn to Appendix No. 2 of that report we see that it provides an interesting brief history of customs and excise collections in the Australian Colonies before federation and afterwards. It shows that in 1891 Dr H. N. P. Wollaston, who was then the Chief Clerk in the Department of Trade and Custonis in Victoria, was invited to investigate the current procedures in tuted, it is possible that the traditional Changes and updating of methods has been long overdue and this is confirmed, I suggest to the House, by the number of amendments that correct anomalies and delete Long-standing requirements contained in this series of Bills. But as I have said the core of the legislation now before us is the general introduction of the system of commodity control. Without doubt the decision to introduce this system was accelerated by the Parliament's own Committee of Public Accounts. As I have said, in 1965 the Committee decided not to look at the whole of this Department with all its wide ramifications but to concentrate upon that section which dealt with the collection of excise. In this financial year I note from the Estimates passed by the Parliament that excise revenue alone is estimated to reach $900m. It is therefore apparent that the interest taken by the Parliament's Committee was fully justified. In the contact with industry in the collection of course, continued to be required. of no less than $900m, if tradition had become the general pattern and if methods had not been regularly reviewed, there would be every opportunity to needle industry, to require too much from industry and to interfere too much in normal operations perhaps or on the other hand, as did eventuate, the officers of the Department might do too much within the industries themselves-providin g too much assistance and too much documentation and thus relieving industry of a burden and a responsibility that it could well carry. Paragraph 218 of the Committee's report tions of the Department's operations, we refers to the Department being steeped in note thut, according to the evidence that tradition. There is reference here to the was received by the Parliament's Committee, retention of such terms as 'jerquer' for an there was conference after conference, officer performing interna] audit functions, reference after reference and discussion 'collectors' for the chief officers in each after discussion amongst the senior officers State branch of the administration and and those connected with the collection of 'comptroller' for the officer who is in effect excise in that section of the Department. At the director-general of the Department. the time when we took evidence in 1965 There was an assertion in evidence that the excise officer had become a traditional figure in the wine and spirit industries. I behalf of the Parliament, to say: want to avoid repetition, so I merely point out in passing that my colleague from Department has a substantial responsibility in forBalaclava said that back in 1958 a promulating any alternative procedures and that the posal was brought forward within the excisable commodities have proved over many years Department that a new system be introto bc adequate. We are also conscious, however, duced in relation to petroleum installations, that although the proposals concerning the extenso that officers of the Department need not sion of a system of commodity control were implebe stationed at the installations constantly, mented that their time might be better employed back in the Department and that their visits to the petroleum installations might be sporadic and in the form of checks or audit visits. In 1959 that preliminary recommendation was brought into effect. The Committee of which I was pleased to be a member took evidence in Western Australia, South Australia, Melbourne and Sydney. In some of those States we were able to visit petroleum installations to take evidence and to inspect the work relating to the collection of excise. We were pleased to find that what had been done in 1959 had brought the results that were expected. The removal of the excise oflicer placed a responsibility upon the officers in the petroleum establishments to perform a task along the lines required by the Commonwealth Department. They became responsible for the returns that were necessary in the past and, The report of the Committee, after dealing with this traditional aspect and the introduction in 1959 of these control measures within the petroleum industry, suggested in paragraph 219 that this tempo of work simplification review to which we have paid our just tribute, as we pay our tribute to the introduction of the new system of commodity control, began to falter. From 1962, when there was a review within the Department amongst senior officers to determine Whether commodity control might be extended into other secit seemed pertinent for the Committee, on Your Committee is conscious of the fact that the procedures currently employed in respect of various in the petroleum products industry some 7 years ago, the Department had, at the time of our hearing, only recently extended the system to the part of the Department, placing the onus an additional industry and then only on a trial on that industry to declare its activities? basis.

I refer to this matter to show that certify its own liability for the payment of quite soundly and justifiably the Comduty and customs.

J support all the Bills that are being considered at the moment, but I wish to deal with this one only. The Bill proposes to incorporate the Canned Fruit Excise Act in the main Excise Act. The benefits requested by the industry are to be retained. The canned fruit industry makes a particularly valuable contribution to decentralisation. Fruit growers are, with few exceptions, small growers who produce mainly a variety of products. The processing of these products must generally, by its very nature, take place adjacent to the areas where they are grown. Horticulture, which includes, besides fruit Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

So any trouble in the canning industry is reflected in the debt structure of the modern factory. 1 would support the views expressed by the honourable member for Riverina. A factory such as the Riverland cannery is in very real difficulties by virtue of its debt structure and the outgoing each year to service that structure. 1 realise that this is not a debate on the canned fruit industry but one of the Bills before the House is a Bill to repeal thc Canned Fruit Excise Act.

For instance, nobody in that area would agree with the honourable member's contention that there will be less paper work of barley, water and sugar, with other in a small family unit in which records and methods of audit have not been as extensive as they might have been. I assure the honourable member that commodity control in these areas has meant considerably more book work for the small winery. The honourable member rightly referred to the great increase in efficiency that commodity control brings. The Distillation Act is a rather unspectacular piece of technical legislation but it is essential to the proper functioning of government. 1 give credit to the Department of Customs and Excise for its reorganisation of industries in relation to the application of commodity control. For example, the day to day keeping of records of wineries and refineries by an excise official is an outmoded concept. Rightly the Government has come to grips with the problem, resulting in a saving of §700,000 a year in respect of the wages of excise officials supervising the daily production of factories in order to protect the excise revenue. This is an excellent idea. I notice that there is no possibility of redundancy. Although on the one hand there is a saving and an increase in efficiency, nevertheless any redundant staff can be absorbed within the Department quite functionally, efficiently and quickly. So there is no problem there. I would like fo deal with the remarks made by the honourable member for Balaclava in respect of the Excise Bill (No. 2), because this Bill directly affects my electorate. I would suggest that some of his basic thoughts may have been astray. He suggested that a form of sales tax should be applied to table wines. No nation has applied an excise duty to pure juice that has no alternative sales outlet. Historically I think it is true to say that where possible no country taxes wines as the direct product of the grape. But possibly the important thing is not to worry about this notion but to look at the basic ingredients of brandy and wine and to realise that they are entirely the product of the vineyardentirely the by-product of the grape. Tf you compare the basic ingredients of beer with that of wine, and bear in mind the total excise earnings each year of S900m, you surely find that different considerations apply. The honourable member will be aware that beer is fundamentally a product things playing their part. I accept the honourable member's submission that beer is the basic drink of many hard working characters, including members of Parliament, and that on the face of it there is some burden on the ordinary metropolitan consumer of beer by virtue of the high proportion of excise paid on that commodity. But beer is a manufacturing process primarily, using barley and water. Dr. J. F. CairnsI rise to order. In what way is this argument relevant to the legislation now before us? honourable members have discussed this subject. [ feel that I must allow some latitude to the honourable member for Angas to reply to the honourable member for Balaclava who raised this matter in his speech. I do not think the honourable member for Yarra was in the chamber at the time. Deputy Speaker, is true. All I am doing is debating the merits of an excise on wine and an excise on beer.

Clause7 of the Distillation Bill (No. 2) 1968 appears to be simple, as it simply repeals section 15 of the principal Act. There is a story behind this; it relates to the licensing laws of South Australia and to a royal commission on licensing in that State moved forthwith. about 2 years ago.

Unfortunately, permanency has not been introduced so far. I believe that it is in the workers process of being introduced and that period.

I hope that the Minister estimate for Labour and National Service( Mr Bury), National Stevedoring Industry Conference prothe unions concerned and the employers posals include provisions for meeting a redundancy will be able to reach agreement at an early situation. date.

141,Mr Charles Jonesi Have Just Honourable Members Should Be Advised Of,"container ships start to operate along the coast redundancy will occur, yet at the same time the Authority is building up the labour force. Is this fair to those men on the waterfront who know that their jobs are in jeopardy? They will not be adequately compensated for their loss of employment and yet the Authority is endeavouring to recruit labour. about it. The trade union movement is very concerned, too. So much so that the interstate executive of the Australian Council of Trade Unions last week carried a resolution to thc effect that there must be no further recruitment to the stevedoring industry unless by agreement with the ACTU and the Waterside Workers Federation. Should the Authority continue with its recruiting programme without the agreement of the ACTU the Executive reserves the right to consider whether it should, under the terms of the previous resolution, declare that workers should not accept such jobs. On behalf of the workers in the waterfront industry I make the plea that this campaign of labour recruitment be discontinued and suggest that the Authority should seek to find the best way in which the present labour force can be employed. Men are being transported from the port of Newcastle to Sydney. In this way employment is being provided for these men; otherwise they would have to exist on the appearance money of $3.10 per day. These are the sort of things that should be examined by this Government, lf additional recruitment is introduced in the port of Sydney, the waterside workers at the port of Newcastle will receive less work. As I have already said, the trade union brought them in. It is your responsibility movement as a whole is greatly concerned to find employment for them.' The upshot about the present state of affairs. It is time of this is that overtime embargoes are that the Minister made a clear statement imposed, there are strikes, unions arc taken to the effect that the recruiting programme to court, and on many occasions penal will cease and that the Government will clauses are used against them. I repeat that find other ways in which to meet the when the time comes to dispose of men problems which exist in our ports. Is it who have been brought in on a temporary possible for men to work additional hours basis industrial unrest is immediately so that work can be provided for them? If created. This will be the situation if the need he. men could be brought from other Government continues its recruitment proports and employed on a casual basis in gramme on the waterfront. In any case this those ports where there is a shortage of labour. This is one of the issues to which the Government has to find an answer. With the recruitment of labour, for how long will these men hold their jobs? Will they be retained as permanent employees? When the Government talks about redundancy, it is obvious that it is not the intention of the Government to retain these men in permanent employment. The Government is using these men as a convenience. It will bring them in only for a short period, perhaps for 1 year or 2 years. I am not in a position to say how long the Government proposes to retain these men in the employment of the Stevedoring Industry Authority. This will create additional problems. I have seen this sort of thing occur in industry, particularly in the shipbuilding industry. That is a fluctuating industry. As Australian Stevedoring Industry different types of ships have to be fitted out, it is sometimes necessary to bring in electricians, sheet metal workers and other people in allied trades. 1 can see a Government supporter at the back of the chamber who knows quite a deal about this particular industry; he knows the situations that arise when casual labour is brought in to finish off the fitting out of a ship. difiicult to plan. I have spoken to the unions concerned in this sort of thing. The point I am making-the honourable member for Kooyong knows this full well-is that, even though the men realise that the work is only temporary, when an industry brings in men and a ship is fitted out the men are told: AVe no longer have any work for you.' VVhat is the result? The result is industrial trouble. The men on the job immediately say: 'You are not going to lay off any of our fellow workers. You",44,Stevedoring Industry

145,Mr Charles Jonesi Know It Is,"problem will arise with the men already 1 employed in the industry when redundancy occurs. J cannot imagine for one second that any group of workers will stand by and agree to the displacement of their workmates, particularly when their compensation is so inadequate. 1 ask the Minister and the Stevedoring Industry Authority to discontinue the recruitment programme and thus minimise the degree of industrial trouble that will inevitably flow as a result of 1 redundancy. EarlierI said that there should not be any laying off of men and that natural wastage should be accepted as the means of reducing the labour force. In the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority report of 30th June 1967 the following statement appears at page 37: Thc overall net decrease in ihe number of regular waterside workers, that is those on PartA of the registers, totalled 1,104. The gain of 233 men from new registrations and re-registrations was more than offset by a loss to the industry of 1,217 men, of whom 833 left voluntarily or because of ill-health, 223 were deregistered for disciplinary reasons and 161 died, and also by the transfer of 120 men to the irregular classification. Government does not proceed with its If the stevedoring industry can lose 1,217 men in one year for the reasons I have outlined, surely the position should be closely examined to ensure that men will not bc displaced. We know that containerisation is being introduced for one purpose-as a more economic form of transporting goods from one port to another. If the industry as a whole will derive financial benefit from the introduction of containerisation, it mu.st be prepared to accept some of the disadvantages and losses resulting therefrom. A capital outlay is required to build the 1 ships, the containers and the ports, and to re-build ports. In the same way, the cost of maintaining surplus labour for two or three years should be one of the financial commitments for which the industry should accept some responsibility. I am quite opposed to men being laid off as a result of this new and improved method of stevedoring. Let me refer to the question of redundancy and the paltry amount that is being offered as compensation. Honourable members should have a look at what other countries are doing in this field. When I say that the amount is paltry, I have in mind the astronomical payments that are made to redundant workers on the waterfront in the United States. These small amounts that are offered here do not compensate a worker in any way whatsoever. These men went on to the waterfront with one object in mind-that it was to be a job for life. Now, as a result of new methods, they find they will be displaced. On behalf of the waterside workers 1 make a strong plea to the Government not to proceed with its plans for redundancy and not to lay men off but rather to allow natural wastage in the industry to reduce the labour force over a period of years. 1 know that it will cost money. But, at the same time, there will be a tremendous saving to industry and commerce as a result of the introduction of containerisation. The same can be said about the recruitment of additional labour. Once again I draw the Minister's attention to the hazards associated with additional recruitment. What will be the result if the Government proceeds with its redundancy plans? If the redundancy plans but allows the natural wastage to operate as I have suggested, then it can go ahead and recruit all the labour it wants. But if it is the intention of industry to dispose of the surplus labour which will be in existence when containerisation becomes operative, then by all means let it discontinue the recruitment campaign. The Opposition accepts the amendments and supports them. It believes that because there are anomalies, particularly in the changeover relating to levies, it is essential that this legislation be passed. We support the legislation, but at the same time we hope that when the problems associated with redundancy do arise, considerate legislation will be introduced equally promptly in this place and that it likewise will be supported by Government as well as Opposition members. almost, trite to say that this amending Bill deals with one of the most important industries in Australia today. Australia is a trading nation of some consequence, and practically everything that comes into it or goes out of it moves via the waterfront.",45,Stevedoring Industry
146,Mr Chipp (Higinbotham) [5.50],"It isThis Bill, which provides for the control of activities on the waterfront, will have a fundamental effect on the social and economic pattern and behaviour of thc nation. As the economy of Australia grows even more in the future we will depend more and more on trade and shipping, and therefore the stevedoring industry will become even more important. One thing that is sometimes forgotten by our friends on the other side of the House when discussing this question is that costs in the stevedoring industry are shared by the whole community. They are not met by a few shipowners or a few importers: they are shared by the community at large, and increases in costs on the waterfront have an important effect on the standards of living of working men in thc community who can ill afford to pay the extra lc or 2c or 5c on individual consumer items the prices of which arc increased because of increased costs in the stevedoring industry. It is for this reason that I rise today to problem by adopting a method which, make some criticisms of the industry. This gives me no pleasure whatsoever. It causes me a great deal of disquiet to say what I have to say about the industry at thc present time. I shall deal first with one point macle by thc honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Charles Jones) about shortages of labour at ports. J have a great deal of sympathy with the honourable member in regard to this matter, and I know that his sentiments are shared by the decent men on the waterfront who entertain fears about increased labour being brought to the waterfront and subsequently having to bc put off. But the honourable member did not give us any solution to the stark factual problem facing the Sydney waterfront today, where I am informed that the labour force is 1,000 men short. I believe thc Melbourne waterfront is also about 1,000 men short. This means that there are ships in Sydney Harbour and in Port Phillip Bay lying idle for days on end because there are not enough waterside workers to unload and reload them. It has been put to the Waterside Workers Federation that temporary labour should be recruited, and the Federation has said: in no circumstances will we permit the recruitment of additional labour'. That is the first point I want to make tonight. Here we have an extraordinarily important industry affecting the economy and the welfare of this nation, being virtually dictated to by a trade union. 1 do not imagine that the honourable member for Newcastle, who is known for his responsible attitude towards matters of national significance, would agree that this is a good thing for thc nation, but it is a stark fact. The employers have said: ""Let us recruit on a temporary basis 1,000 new workers for the Sydney waterfront, even if only for 6 months. Let us have them there to get rid of this surplus of shipping. After the 6 months they will bc dismissed. The permanent rights of the present waterside workers who are mcmbers of the union will not be affected in any way whatsoever.' But thc union has said: 'No, you must not recruit one more man.' They are holding this threat over the stevedoring industry. The honourable member for Newcastle suggests quite properly that the Australian stevedoring industry authority or some other responsible body should get over the superficially, appears to be sound. He suggests that when there is a surplus of labour at one port1 think he gave as an example the port of Newcastle-w e could take the surplus men to some adjacent port-in that case Sydney-to overcome a shortage there. I do not know whether the honourable member for Newcastle knows it, but this in fact was suggested some time ago to the Federation, and the Federation placed such outrageous conditions on the transfer of such labour that it became completely uneconomic and impracticable to follow that course. 1 have not in my mind the details of the actual conditions, but 1 remember that thc demands for travelling allowances, daily living away allowances, return fares and so on were quite extraordinary. They made the scheme quite impossible. One tends, therefore, to doubt thc bona fides of the Federation in this matter. I can well understand the inbuilt fear of members of the Federation that if too many men are admitted to the industry their jobs will be threatened. But surely in the light of the guarantees given to them that the temporary employees would be the first to be dismissed, their refusal to co-operate calls for some sort of investigation. Sitting suspended from 5.57 to 8 p.m. ing Bill to the stevedoring industry legislation. The amendments contained in the Bill apply specifically to a scheme known as the Woodward scheme which has been introduced on the Australian waterfront. Before the suspension of the sitting I said that it gives me no great pleasure tonight to criticise this scheme which deals with a vital section of the Australian economy. I shall briefly trace the history that led up to the introduction of the Woodward scheme. In the years before 1965 chaos reigned on the Australian waterfront. In 1965, 1.2 million man hours were lost through waterfront stoppages. The industry had in fact reached the stage of crisis. If the honourable member for Kingsford Smith( Mr Curtin), who is trying to interject, will restrain himself he will find that at no stage during my speech will I be critical only of the waterside workers. I will be equally critical of the employers and in fact of my own Government for the situaiion that has developed on the Australian waterfront. The 1965 legislation, notwithstanding the bitter, vigorous opposition from the Opposition, was, in my view, one of the most courageous pieces of industrial legislation ever brought down in this House. It had a salutary effect on the waterfront situation. I remind the House that at the time of the introduction of the 1965 legislation, the Minister then in charge of the Bill, the for improved efficiency on the part of employers. As soon as the 1965 legislation became law the Australian Council of Trade Unions appealed to the Government, through the then Prime Minister, to establish a national conference comprised of all parties in the industry, including the Waterside Workers Federation, to see whether the problems besetting the industry could be resolved around the conference table. Mr A. E. Woodward, QC, was appointed to chair the conference. His charter was to bring the parties together, but it was at no time intended-in fact, it was spelled out scheme would evolve which resulted in increased costs on the waterfront without a relative increase in efficiency, so that freight rates, including stevedoring costs, might not be expected to rise without an equivalent increase in throughput. The conference is now history. The parties discussed matters at length and eventually a package deal covering a wide range of subjects was approved and accepted by this Government. Amongst other things, perhaps the most significant part of the package deal was that permanent employment should be a feature of waterside employment; that permanent assigning of waterside workers to individual stevedores should be arranged for the first time; and that a residual pool of men to meet day to day peaks should be established. There is no need for me to stress the obvious advantages that should flow to both employer and employee from a closer and permanent relationship. Time does not permit me lo traverse all the gains made by waterside workers out of the Woodward agreement and since it was signed. Suffice it to say that regular registered waterside workers now contribute to a pension fund on a ratio of 40% as against a 60% contribution by the employer. If a waterside worker becomes redundant he receives $50 for each year of service. I would like honourable members to note the weekly wage of waterside workers at the present time. For an ordinary day shift, whether a waterside worker is required to work or not, he receives a weekly wage of $53. That is on ordinary time. Penalty rates of 50% above that rate are payable for the shift from 3.30 p.m. to 11 p.m. Penalty rates of 100% apply to the shift from midnight to 7.30 a.m. Sunday work still attracts a rate of two and a half times the ordinary rate. Kingsford-Smith says that it is not enough. T ask the honourable gentleman, who belongs to a Party which allegedly represents the workers, whether the wage rate which is paid to a waterside worker for unskilled or, at best, semi-skilled labourand I know that through you, Mr Speaker, I am addressing an honourable member who was skilled in his own trade-is unfair when compared with the wage rate paid to the rest of the work pool. 1 shall briefly quote what the average wages of waterside workers were before permanency was introduced-befor e the Woodward scheme came down-and what they are at the present",46,Stevedoring Industry

151,Mr Chipp,"The honourable member fortime. In Port Kembla, for example, before permanency a waterside worker who worked 23.7 hours a week-and I suggest that he would not be over-straining himself to work 23.7 hours a week-receive d $60. Today a waterside worker at Port Kembla, working 28.4 hours a week, receives $75.87. To take this matter to the ridiculous stage, I am sure that the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith, who is one of the hardest working members of this Parliament, would work a minimum of 56 hours a week, which is double the number of hours which a waterside worker at Port Kembla works. The honourable member for Kingsford Smith is being paid at an hourly rate which is less than that paid to a waterside worker at Port Kembla. When honourable members opposite say that waterside workers are not being paid enough, I think that these matters should be looked at in perspective. It can be said that as a result of the Woodward scheme, the Australian waterside workers today receive a fair or more than a fair remuneration for their labour. When one examines rates paid in industry generally one finds that waterside workers, to say the least, are not ungenerously treated. Thc package deal to which I have Sydney, in 2 years before permanency was referred was entered into only last year introduced, 14,000 man-hours were lost. In and was expected and understood to run the 12 months since permanency was introfor 5 years.

The same sort of is working either for the decent man on the thing has happened at Port Kembla, waterfront, the decent union official, the Adelaide and Fremantle. employer, or this nation which depends so heavily on the waterfront for its social and economic welfare. I go further. As I see were caused by campaigns for wage init-and I sincerely hope that the Minister creases. But the Waterside Workers Federafor Labour and National Service( Mr Bury) tion had entered into an agreementa so will reply to my statement and tell me that called package deal. Why should time be I am wrong-the net results of Mr lost when the way was open to it to go to Woodward's scheme are that there have the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbibeen substantial monetary gains for some tration Commission to present a case, as it waterside workers but there has been no ultimately did? This gives me, for one, no improved efficiency on the Australian cause to accept with confidence the proposiwaterfront. Perhaps one of the most worrying features is that there has been a classic reduction in the number of Australian owned stevedoring companies on the Australian waterfront. We are stampeding towards a situation in which the stevedoring operations of this country are being controlled by overseas shipping companies, mainly from the United Kingdom. If any honourable member opposite believes that that is a good thing for Australia, let him get up and say so. I believe that another result of the Woodward scheme is that costs on the Australian waterfront have risen. Because the costs of handling cargo-bot h the loading and unloading of cargo-hav e risen, it means that the costs which face the working man, which the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith champions, have risen accordingly. The number of stoppages on the waterfront is approaching the number which occurred in the j'ear of chaos-1965 . This is soon after permanency was introduced. May I very briefly quote from the monthly reports of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority in regard to stoppages on the waterfront? ln the port of lt might be argued that these stoppages tion that relations on the waterfront are different today from what they have always been. It seems to me that this Government showed a rare act of courage in 1965 in introducing sanity and stability to the waterinterest in the waterfront, tremendous confront. Because it has adopted Mr cern. First of all 1 marvelled at the naivete Woodward's report, the waterfront has now drifted back into the chaos which prevailed in 1965. It was only in mid 1967 that all the organisations represented at the National Stevedoring Industry Conference, including the Federation, endorsed the package deal. The Government gave its blessing in July 1967. The package deal was to have a life of 5 years. Yet today, after the scheme has run for less than l i years of its 5-year life, the Federation has decided that many of the major items must be rewritten. It is asking for more wages and for the retention and development of the equalisation of wages by the iniquitous points system. May I pause here to illustrate one aspect of the Woodward report which is causing great concern to decent men on the waterfront and to the employers. I refer here to the points system for the equalisation of wages, which was never intended when the scheme was introduced. The Federation has asked for this system and has been granted it by weak-kneed employers though il is outside the recommendations in the report. Some specialised gangs were earning more money than others. The gangs that were not earning as much money sought the aid of the union and the union said: 'We must have equalisation of wages'. So the employers then gave the less efficient and less reliable gangs weekend or Sunday work. This means that they received the same amount of money although they worked less time. This has led to a ridiculous situation on the Australian waterfront in which honest, sincere waterside workers who work harder, better, more efficiently and for longer hours, receive the same pay as, or even less than, the loafers and no-hopers who, because they complained and the union backed them up, work for fewer hours. One wonders why there is dissension on the Australian waterfront! One wonders why the decent men on the waterfront are complaining! There is a whole list of additional things that the union now wants written into the package deal. The watersiders in the ports of Sydney and Melbourne, in which half of the waterside work force is employed, are supporting the Federal Council of the union. There are three features of the Woodward scheme that have caused me, and I think any honourable member who has taken any of Mr Woodward in accepting, and I sometimes marvel at the naivete of the Government in accepting, the complete absence of any guarantee by the Federation of better rates of handling cargo. On lhe information available to me, it seems that in ports where pemanency has been introduced rates of work and throughput of important cargoes such as wool, wheat, timber and general cargoes are at best no better than they were in pre-permanency days. This is notwithstanding the millions of dollars that have been spent on technological improvements on wharf and ship facilities. I wish to cite an incident that must disturb any thinking member of this House. A few days ago, wool-whic h interests many honourable members-wa s being loaded at the port of Newcastle. In a shift, the gang concerned loaded only 240 bales of wool. In desperation, the employer said that on the next shift they could load the wool in their own time and that when they had filled a certain quota they could go home. I repeat that in a full shift the gang had loaded 240 bales of wool. In the next day, the same gang, working the same ship with the same equipment, loaded 480 bales in half the time, and the men then went home. I do not blame the men, the union or, necessarily, the employers. I am blaming the system. But for making a deal such as this, the employers have a lot to answer for to the community. They allow this sort of thing to go on without supervision on a cost-plus basis, and they pass the costs on to the community. Another disturbing feature of the Woodward scheme is that the foreman, who, before the scheme commenced, had immediate control over, and power to discipline, the labour under his charge, is not now allowed to discharge men. The foreman no longer has the right to fire or discipline. member for Kingsford-Smith said: 'Hear, hear!'

Perhaps the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith thinks that also is a good thing.

The balance of 53 square miles is State Crown Land, which the Army has used under tenure granted by the New South Wales government from time to time. Jn addition, an area to the south of about 32 square miles, known as the 'O'Hare's Creek' area, has been used for training under the authority of a proclamation made under section 69 of the Defence Act. Presently, the major portion of the Australian Army Field Force is located at Holsworthy, and the strength of units in the general area is now about 7,000. In addition, the area is used by about 8,000 CMF personnel in the Sydney area. Its accessibility and the Minister for the Army, and officials, for CMF training is of enormous importance, as is also its proximity to the amenities of city life for the dependants of servicemen who live in the district. Over the years of Army occupation, very considerable expenditure has been incurred in developing depot and training establishments, the entire concept of the whole Holsworthy complex having been based on the assumption that State Crown Lands, which have been used for so long and for a purpose so important, vvould continue to be available. All told, the Army's capital investment in Holsworthy is of the order of $65m. The bulk of these improvements is on Commonwealth-owned land, but on the rest are extensive ranges and facilities for training and exercises. For the past 15 years, efforts have been made by the Commonwealth to obtain a more secure tenure of the State Crown Lands, without success.

However, despite this unilateral State action, the CommonweaUh has continued to seek an accommodation with the State. In August last, accompanied by my Ministerial colleagues, the Attorney-General we met the State Ministers concerned, but failed to reach agreement as to the relative priorities of need. Later, by arrangement with the State Ministers, there were further discussions between Commonweallh and Slate officials, but again thc Statu remained obdurate. The Commonwealth has sought to go as far as it possibly can in finding some sensible accommodation with State wishes. We have agreed to provide access for road ancl rail links across the area. We have agreed that an area suitable for residential development, known as the 'Little Forest', will not be acquired, although it forms part of the lands covered by this Bill, although we asked Ihat the Army should be allowed to use this area until the State actually needed the land for development. Wc also informed thc State that the Commonwealth would be prepared to transfer part of the Commonwealth lands to the State (o allow for some residential development.

Here, happily, the State has been more understanding but, as yet, we have no final agreement which would ensure this essential provision, so that in this Bill we have sought to protect the position of the Army, with respect to the use of the Holsworthy training complex, and at the same time to provide public safety and protect the investment of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission. In neither case can we risk any peremptory demand to vacate all State lands.

Bill-by leave-presente d by Mr Swartz, and read a first time. Second Reading Thai the Bill be now read a second lime. This is a Bill for an Act to introduce charges payable by air service passengers for the use of facilities provided by the Commonwealth at certain Commonwealth aerodromes. On a number of occasions, reference has been made to the widening gap between the amount that it costs the Commonwealth annually to provide facilities for the civil aviation industry, and the amount of revenue received from the aviation facilities should be availed of as soon as possible. In 1967-68, the total cost of",51,Lands Acquisition Defence

It will be seen that, not be penalised financially under the proalthough the proportion of costs being recovered is increasing each year, the deficit in monetary terms is still substantial. The Bill imposes charges on certain air from anomalies as possible. In simple terms, passengers who use or enjoy the benefit of a domestic passenger will pay a charge of facilities provided by the Commonwealth 50c, if he or she embarks on a journey al a number of Commonwealth aerodromes, which commences at one of the specified such as runways and taxiways used by the Commonwealth aerodromes.

At first sight, some provisions of the Bill the complete journey before commencing may appear to be complicated, but this is the journey. It is considered that serious largely due to the involved nature of the practical difficulties would arise if the domestic airline network and the journeys scheme were macle any more liberal in this which some passengers make, and the respect. Government's belief that travellers should posed scheme of charges simply because the airline system is organised in a particular way. In itself, the proposed scheme of charges has been kept as simple and as free end of a journey. No charge will be payable for embarkation or disembarkation Some examples of charges applicable to From Canberra to Sydney, the charge will be $1. From Canberra to Brisbane via Sydney, the charge will be SI. The charge for a journey CanberraSydney-Canberra will be $2. From Canberra to Cooma, which has not a Commonwealth airport, the charge will be 50c. From Canberra to Gladstone, a nonCommonwealth airport, via Sydney and Brisbane, the charge will be SOc. These arc merely illustrations of the charges one flight to another, this concession applies only if the passenger makes a booking for The charges for children under 15 years of age and full-time students of primary and secondary schools under 19 years of age are to be 50% of the adult rates. Passengers on commuter services and on charter services operated by the airlines will the Government has received numerous be charged on a similar basis to airline passengers. For the time being, passengers on other charter flights will be exempt. International passengers will be charged $2 on departure from Australia but will be exempt from a charge on arrival in this country. No charge will be applicable to embarkation or disembarkation on a domestic Might on which the international passenger travels to or from the point of departure or arrival in Australia, provided the bookings for all travel are made at the one time. The charge for children under 12 years of age travelling on international services will be 50% of the adult rate. The charges for the use of aerodromes on domestic journeys will, in normal circumstances, be payable by the passengers when they make their reservations with the operators. As this procedure will not always be convenient where international journeys are concerned, arrangements will be made so that passengers can pay at the airport before departing for overseas. It is intended that the operators will be responsible for 1 all collections, whatever method is used. Detailed instructions will, of course, be issued to the operators explaining the practical application of the charging scheme and these should help in avoiding delays to passengers when they are making their reservations or checking in at airport traffic counters. The Government realises that the standard charges will be more significant in relation to journeys for which the airline fare is low, and, as a result, some passengers for some travellers would have to be met will feel they are being required to bear a disproportionate burden. This is not so, of course, because the charges are imposed for the use of the aerodrome facilities at the commencement and end of a journey, and the benefits so enjoyed are simitar whether the journey is a short one or a long one. It would not be reasonable, therefore, to have different charges in such cases, ment of charges already paid when the pasbut the decision to apply charges only at the busiest airports will minimise, if not elimition, and the making of regulations, and nate completely, the instances where they might seem high in comparison with the air fare. This leads me to the general question of 1 concessions and exemptions, about which representations. As indicated above, the charges have been halved for children and students who normally pay half fare. Similarly, no charges will be imposed for infants who are carried by the airlines free of charge, or for employees of the carriers travelling on duty. Military personnel travelling on aircraft operated or chartered by defence authorities will also be exempt from the charges. The Government has concluded that exemptions should not be extended to any other general class of 1 passengers. Consideration has also been given to the claims of particular areas where requests for special treatment have been made. In addition to the general exemption for aerodromes having fewer passenger movements than the annual level mentioned earlier, it has been decided not to apply the charges in respect of embarkation or disembarkation on flights within the Territories of Papua and New Guinea, between those Territories and West Irian or the British Solomon Islands Protectorate, between Australia and Cocos Islands or Norfolk Island, and between the latter island and New Zealand. While recognising the extent to which some other places and areas depend on the speed and convenience of air transport, the Government does not feel it would be appropriate to exempt them from the proposed charges. In reaching these decisions, the Government has had to be mindful of the effect of too generous an approach on concessions and exemptions. Clearly, any shortfall in revenue brought about by reduced charges by the general taxpayer or by increasing the charges payable by other passengers, and, in the light of the costly facilities provided at Commonwealth expense, the proposed charges are quite modest.

158,Mr Connor (Cunningham) [8.47],"1 got a roster system where men werechance of securing employment. A little later we reached the stage where appearance money was rightly paid. The basis of appearance money was that if men chose to make themselves available for working a ship if, when and as it arrived at the port they were entitled to a small daily pittance. There have been many times when the men They were registered and under discipline and in return they took their chances. We now have the Woodward report, and 1 give great credit to the goodwill and 1 intentions of the man who presented it. There is a chance for us to have an era of peace on the waterfront, but we have individuals like the honourable member for Higinbotham throwing a dead cat into the ring. The waterfront, of course, has always been a political cockshy. Let us have a look at the other side of the picture. Let us conare 13 days lost each year for a start. sider the working conditions at Port Kembla where there are 700 men on the roster, 130 of whom are due to be declared redundant. Daily, to meet the short fall of employment in Sydney, 100 or more of these men travel to Sydney to work in the hope that somehow wastage will ultimately correct the situation. I have discussed this matter with the Minister who has given me his answer. He said that the finding is that the men are redundant. Let us consider this other side of the picture. In the main, on the basis of seniority, these are young men. They are men with families, with houses and, generally, with heavy financial commitments. They are prepared to give up their lives to this industry but their serverance pay will be limited and their chances of local employment will be equally limited. What are these men to do? What has this Government attempted in the way of a redundancy Act, of which there is a model example in Britain? What prospects have these men of retraining for the industry? It is alt very well to talk about their transferring to another port; they will not be able to do it. The men in Port Kembla work in pretty know them for what they are. 1 know the vile conditions. I live on the crown of a contempt in which they hold the honourable hill in Wollongong 4 mites from Port member. There is a special case for these Kembla, and I know that 3 miles out to men, and in my opinion the Government sea there is a navigation hazard because of would be well advised to go slowly. There the westerly wind whipping up iron ore is great apprehension on the waterfront from the ore dumps. Navigation visibility is today because of the advent of containerisareduced to an absolute minimum. About4 tion, which will have a very serious impact, months ago the Senate Select Committee on and the Government is going the right way Air Pollution visited the area. One of the prime examples of industrial air pollution that 1 showed the Committee was the Port Kembla waterfront, which adjoins a sulphuric acid plant at a fertiliser industry. This, in itself, is a positive menace to health. have had to cease work because of the nature of the fumes that have crept over there. The Committee was shown examples of actual erosion of chrome plating on motor vehicles which have been parked there daily. Special consideration is given to the men because of these conditions. For 13 days each year, because the Port Kembla outer harbour is an artificial harbour, there is one certainty and that is that ships will not be able to enter the harbour because of the surge of the ground swell. So there I would invite the honourable member for Higinbotham to go to Port Kembla and to get right down into the hold of a sulphur ship or a superphosphate ship, to come out choking, and then to address this House in fine rhetorical terms as to the amount of work that is being done there. As to the general efficiency of the industry, let us consider the port of Sydney where at my last count there were 129 wharves only 25 of which have rail links and rail communications. It is notorious that Sydney is one of the most inefficient ports in the world, the reason being that it was designed and its transit sheds and wharfage were built in the days of the sailing ships. In many cases it is quite a feat if a lorry can discharge two loads at some of these wharves because of the narrowness of the entrances and the poorness of the handling facilities. I regret to say that Sydney is still a hook and trolley port. Port Kembla is primarily a bulk cargo port. I suggest to the honourable member for Higinbotham that he might well get right back into his shell. Throughout the waterfront there are decent, honest men. I know them, and I about getting a first class industrial upheaval. 1 urge the Government to take it quietly and, to let wastage take its course. If, in the fullness of time, there is some measure of redundancy it can be corrected; but contributions such as that from the honourable member for Higinbotham will do nothing to correct the situation. [8.57]J intend to refer to reports of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority and specifically to the report of what the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Bury) said at the time of the introduction of the new scheme. On that occasion the Minister said: This whole episode bas surely disposed once and Tor all and in the clearest possible way of the give the honourable member for Cunningold notion that used to be so freely canvassed that industrial trouble was inseparable from the stevedoring industry. There is absolutely no reason why the peace of the last 18 months should not continue indefinitely. That statement in itself carried a vital tolerate the old bull system, which was message for the nation. The report of the referred to by the honourable member for Minister's statement continued: The introduction of the new labour arrangewho speaks against the present system should ments gave ail concerned the opportunity to be condemned as a labour hater or a union develop a highly efficient stevedoring industry hater. That is not so. He may be well and geared to meet Australia's requirements. The Gotruly concerned with the welfare of the vernmeni would be concerned, particularly during nation as a whole.

159,Mr Donal D Cameron (Griffith),,58,Stevedoring Industry
160,Mr Donald Cameron,"Certainly . Iheld up by a move such as this. Some honourable members may stand up and champion the cause of the Waterside Workers Federation but they should remember that a lot of other trade unionists who live in their electorates receive the backlash of the condonation of acts which may not be described as completely responsible. I refer to such people as those who work with their hands in factories producing materials for export overseas. Whether they like it or not, every member of the WWF and every other union in Australia, white collar or blue collar workers, have an important part to play in the development of this nation. We are all cogs in the wheel of development. I have great sympathy for the individual who has spent 30 or 40 years on the waterfront and whose employment is soon to come to an end. Figures have been produced tonight which indicate that about 1,200 waterside workers have left the industry in recent times. This is a natural decrease and is something which has been advocated tonight. As much as people may believe that containerisation will cause huge redundancy problems, overall I do not think-and even the employers have used this subject as a lever-that it will be quite unions demand and receive what they want. as drastic as many people fear. There are many examples of fears of redundancy in other industries that one can give. The mining industry is one such industry. But even in industries which cannot exactly be compared-suc h as industries where computers are being installed-fear s of redundancy have proved to be overstated. Although it may have taken a long time in many instances, the job opportunities have increased. I do not think that every ship coming to Australia in the future will be a container vessel. Although pressure is being brought to bear by those who have an interest in only the container type of vessel, as a nation which is so dependent upon shipping we will have the conventional and Skandia type of vessel's plying our coast for many years to come. We have seen peace on the waterfront. front is basically a place where men arc I think I should refer to some figures men and in any big gathering of men are regarding man hours lost. As I mentioned those who wish to lead. And if a man can Sydney earlier when giving somefigures,I prove his worth by leading the men and again refer to that port. In 1964, 220,000 getting better conditions for them he man hours were lost. In 1965, which was almost certainly will do so. I make a the year that the Government announced genuine plea tonight to employers and the setting up of the Woodward inquiry, 347,000 man hours were lost. But in 1966 we saw a dramatic fall to 4,684 man hours lost. In the following year, 9,600 man hours were lost. Already this year the figure is well up over 140,000 man hours lost. In fact, that figure was reached at the end of September, which is almost 2 months ago. Surely this must give each and every one of us reason for concern. I should imagine that the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith( Mr Curtin), who is a genuine, staunch and constant defender of waterside labour, would not condone a situation where men are out of work so often. Mr Curtin1 blame the masters. ourable member blames the bosses. I fear that the honourable member for Kingsford Smith has a closed mind on this matter. If he were really looking he would see that there is trouble on both sides. But there are occasions when the employer is so keen to get a ship turned round that he will concede almost anything. Normally a union would not make certain requests but the employers are so weak and unprepared to stand up for themselves that the And who can blame them for doing so? Following the Woodward inquiry we have also seen instances where the union had agreed to specialists being used in the port of Sydney and to the right of the employer to transfer a midnight shift gang, one night a week, to an evening shift and where three 8 hour shifts a day were to be worked. Already these things have gone by the board, although they were introduced with such high hopes. 1 do not blame any trade union official for continually attempting to win better conditions for his men. Many times we have seen people who, not knowing better, have looked at the trouble on the waterfront and wiped it all off as a Communist conspiracy. 1 do not agree with that-fa r from it.

The honourable member for Higinbotham spoke about the wages paid to unskilled men, and he tried to draw a comment from the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith( Mr Curtin) by saying that these men were receiving so much, that the average wage was so much and that the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith, as a tradesman, would receive only so much. These men are required to present themselves for work when it is available, despite the vagaries associated with the arrival of ships and so forth. They are prevented from taking employment elsewhere, except in the B class ports, and then only for certain times of the year. The high wages which have been spoken about are not general in most ports in Australia. I was provoked into rising to speak in this debate by the two provocative speeches made by Government supporters. I want to say a few words on this subject. endeavouring to provide a decent living for My experience over the years has been that his family and a decent education for his at all times employers have been to blame for the trouble on the waterfront.

It is sickening to listen to the young member for Griffith( Mr Donald Cameron) talking about his experiences around the waterfront. He has a lot to learn, but he is employing the usual Liberal Party and Australian Country Party tactics of playing down the waterside worker, quietly discrediting him and his family in the interests of the policy of the Party to which he belongs. Mr Donald Cameron-The honourable member is talking rubbish. honourable member, lt would make one ill in the stomach to listen to the remarks of the honourable member and those of the honourable member for Higinbotham ( Mr Chipp). For how many years has the honourable member for Higinbotham been a member of a trade union?

167,Mr Bury (Wentworth,"Minister forexisiing legislation. First of all I wau: to remind the House that the present permanent employment arrangements in this industry are the result of an agreement between the employers, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Waterside Workers Federation, the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority and the Department of Labour and National Service. The agreement is set out in the April 1967 report of the National Stevedoring Industry Conference. This Conference is still very actively enpolicy followed in the various ports. One gaged in dealing with problems involved in introducing permanent employment into additional ports, including the port of Newof work that will be available, and vice castle, which the honourable member for Newcastle prominently in his speech. It is also competent-and this is important-for any of the parties involved in the stevedoring industry, either the employers, the Federation or the Government, to raise questions concerning recruitment or redundancy or any other problem that may arise. In fact this is the forum established for that purpose. It is the right place in which to hammer out differences and it has in fact been used extensively by all the parties for this purWhen it is suggested that these people pose. They have hammered out agreements in bargaining across the table although they have had a great deal of gratuitous help and hindrance from other parties outside the Conference. The National Stevedoring Industry Conference has agreed that permanency should be introduced in the port of Newcastle. DisNational Stevedoring Industry Conference cussions are now being held in Newcastle between the local stevedoring employers and the Waterside Workers Federation to secure agreement on shift hours, commencing and finishing times and all the other details which are important in the working of this port. The honourable member for Newcastle did stress redundancy, and of course the container age about which he spoke will bring vast changes on the waterfront. It becomes doubly important, therefore, that there be some forum in which the problems arising from these new arrangements, involving such extensive changes, may be continually and regularly the subject of discussion between the parties immediately concerned. As to redundancy, the arrangements so far made have emerged from a package deal. One cannot separate redundancy from the rest of the matters being dealt with and the working arrangements already agreed on by the Conference, because all these matters are interdependent. The honourable member mentioned recruitment. I am afraid I could not accept his view that a person who was once recruited for this task, particularly at the present time, would necessarily expect to work in the job for the rest of his life. Recruitment arrangements have to be varied and adjusted according to the existing situation and future prospects. This is the general does not want to have twice as many workers as are necessary for the amount versa. The decisions of the Australian Stevenaturally featured very doring Industry Authority on this aspect of waterfront activity may be reviewed at any time as the situation changes. The Woodward Conference has had continually under review various matters relating to redundancy. At the moment recruitment is necessary-recruitmen t of people who understand when they are recruited that the job for them must of necessity be of a fairly temporary nature. should be denied jobs just because there will be a change within a year or two and they will then be placed in other jobs elsewhere, all I can say is that this would constitute a great inconvenience and obstruction to trade and would take away opportunities for earning that would otherwise exist. The great advantage of the is that these problems and others which may arise can be hammered out by the parties in a sensible spirit, in many cases after close study and a careful and objective assessment of the facts. This is much better than attacking particular problems on the spot in the very heated atmosphere that is engendered from time to time and from place to place within the industry. The honourable member for Higinbotham directed attention to a number of matters which he believes cast doubt on the effectiveness of the Woodward Conference and its methods and the results so far achieved. Of course there are members of the Waterside Workers Federation, particularly in the port of Melbourne, who have similarly cast doubts, but from their own particular points of view, on the activities of the Conference. But despite those doubts, the majority of people on both sides of the industry-and all have an acute sense of responsibility in this regardhave so far decided to try to make the new scheme work. It is a very radical change to remove from the waterfront (he evils of casual employment and introduce, wherever practicable, a system of permanent employment. The achievement of this aim would be a great step forward. Jt could be said that lately man hours have been lost and there has been trouble on the waterfront because people on both sides disagree and, for various reasons, they regard themselves as being adversely affected by the present arrangements. But1 suggest that those people who criticise trenchantly should indicate their alternative. One has to be practical about these matters. One does not suddenly change, in the space of a year or two, the whole landscape of un industry in which the traditional attitudes which have developed over the years probably have been unfortunate for those people concerned with the industry and for Australia. J should point out that the much improved turnround in ships which had been achieved up to a short time ago is one of the main factors which has enabled a reduction to be made in freight rates. Only if the industry is efficient and prontable can the people engaged in the industry do better and earn more money. The people who are shipping goods will bc able to do so more efficiently and the whole nation will benefit from a reduction in costs. A harmonious situation can be reached if everyone pulls his weight. Although this might sound idealistic in view of the history of the Australian waterfront and what is liable to erupt on it at any time, a much better future can be had on the waterfront in the long run if all the parlies co-operate. I should emphasise that the Woodward scheme is an experiment. We introduced thc Stevedoring Industry Bill for a 2-year period. We have gone ahead with it. If, in the end, Ihe parties turn sour on it, we will have to think of something else. But at the present time. I suggest to the House that there is no practical alternative. In many ways the scheme has brought benefits to both sides of the industry and, as I say, it is the only way in which to cope with the very complex and difficult problems which lie immediately ahead including containerisation and all the other cargo handling economy measures which are being introduced. 1 know that there is general support for the Bill now before the House, but on these other matters I utter the plea that the House should be patient and continue with the experiment which is the most favourable development on the waterfront for many years. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to bo moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Bury) read a third time. BILL (No. 5) 1968 Second Reading Debate resumed from 7 November (vide page 2597), on motion by Mr Freeth: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Income Tax Assessment Bill (No. 5) contains the third set of amendments which deal with the structure of taxation rather than with the rating of taxation. I do not know why these measures have not been introduced together rather than separately. It seems as though someone just thinks of an amendment and a Bill is introduced to deal with that amendment. I think that all amendments to the income tax legislation ought to be dealt with in one Bill at Budget time. However, that is beside the point. The purpose of the Bill is stated clearly in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill, as follows: This Bill proposes amendments to the income tax law to provide deductions by equal annual instalments over a period of 10 years in respect of capital expenditure incurred on pipelines and other facilities, such as railways and roads, used primarily and principally for the transport of petroleum (which includes both crude oil and natural gas) produced in Auslralia or the Territory of Papua and New Guinea.",61,Stevedoring Industry
168,Mr Crean (Melbourne Ports) [9.34],"Apparently there are already provisions in the Income Tax Assessment Act which allow for expenditure on petroleum pipelines and ancillary plant, which were under construction at lst July 1968 and which were to be completed before lst January 1970, to be written off over a 5-year period. Apparently in the future this expenditure is to be written off over a 10-year period. It seems to me that this is another instance in which thc provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act are being used to achieve economic objectives not directly related to taxation. In some respects it is a legitimate enough sort of a process to follow but, nevertheless, it is one which, if it is followed, ought to be clearly understood for what it is. It seems to me that in some respects it is not always so understood. RecentlyI read an article in the June 1968 issue of the publication entitled 'Growth', which is issued by the Committee for Economic Development of Australia. It contains an article entitled 'Energy Development in Australia' by Mr J. G. Trimmer, who is a Bachelor of Science (Economics) and a member of the planning and supply section of the Shell Co. of Australia Ltd. He said: Australia is entering a new and exciting era of growth in which considerable thought needs to be given to such things as: the role of the Government, the effects of high cost energy upon growth and trade, the effects and desirability of imposing a cost situation. discrimination between one indigenous energy and another. It seems to me that the latter consideration which he mentioned is, in some respects, what is not being understood in framing this legislation. One of the difficulties in regard to the exploitation of what is described as natural gas seems to be the cost of transmitting gas from the point at which it is found to the point at which it will ultimately be used. It seems that Australia has a great abundance of natural gas, some of which is in areas quite remote from the capital cities, but there seems to be no great difficulty in building pipelines. The 'Australian Financial Review' of 18th March 1968 contained a special supplement on natural gas. It referred to pipelines which have been built in Europe. It described them as 'spectacular pipeline feats of recent years'. One is the trans-Alpine pipeline from Trieste on the Adriatic to Ingolstadt on the Danube in southern Germany. The article continued: Although it is only 285 miles long, the importance of the line lies in its crossing mountains nearly a mile high, carrying 300,000 barrels a day through its 40-inch pipeline. It is owned by a consortium of 13 oil companies. The second pipeline is described as follows: The Friendship pipeline, carrying oil 2,625 miles from the Tartar republic in Central Asia through Russia and the Comecom countries of Eastern Europe to the Swedt-Leuna petrochemical complex in East Germany. The article commenced by stating: Construction of pipelines is developing as a major 'by-product' industry of Australian oil and natural gas production, bringing new orders for steel and pipe makers and opportunities for Australians to learn new skills. I was also interested to note, from statistics that are supplied by the Petroleum Information Bureau (Australia), just how extensive has been the construction of pipelines by oil companies in Australia in recent years. According to the latest statistics available, on the refining side of the petroleum industry in Australia there has been an expenditure on pipelines of $69,532,000 to 30th June 1967. As the 'Australian Financial Review' points out, this gives some indication of the significance of this industry. It is for this sort of reason that I think one should occasionally take stock of the economic realities of the Of course, no-one needs to state the importance of the petroleum industry and the importance of energy production to Australia. I notice also that the 'Australian Automobile Trade Journal' for May 1968 contained an article on the mystery of petrol pricing. In a section headed 'A Matter of Arithmetic', it shows firstly that the average consumption of motor spirit per head of the Australian population is 156 gallons per annum. This represents 3 gallons every week for every person in Australia. The average annual consumption for every motor vehicle is 452.4 gallons. Calculated on the basis of 44c per gallon, the annual petroleum bill is about $200m. Most of our petroleum was imported previously. Now, fortunately, it seems that we have quite abundant supplies of this commodity. But, as usual, the movement of the commodity from its source to the place line charges. At the moment I do not quite where it is needed is one of the besetting know how charges are to be fixed. But problems of the nation. 1 suppose that anyone who knows the early economic history of Australia would realise what a mess this country would be in today if we had left the development of railways in the hands of private enterprise, lf this had been done the railways certainly would not; have been built where they were most needed. have handled the job. same sort of approach should be made to seems that the taxation system is being used the construction of pipelines. 1 mentioned to encourage certain kinds of concessions this matter in a debate in the House the other evening. Here is an issue which the and that this is causing some confusion in Americans, in accordance with their accounting. philosophy, would describe as being charged with public interest. In my view the movement of supplies of petroleum through pipeesting debate that has taken place in recent lines from refineries to capital cities is not times about the audit firm Cooper Bros a matter that should be subject entirely to and the question of how this firm thinks the determination by private individuals. 1 think accounts of Broken Hill South Ltd and the that if we learn this lesson soon rather than Western Mining Corporation Ltd should be late, the nation will be saved considerable treated for book-keeping rather than for tax expense. After all, under the existing legispurposes. To take a pipeline as an example, lation the capital cost of a pipeline can be this audit firm apparently recognises that written off over a 5-year period, notwitheven though one can write a pipeline off standing that a pipeline probably has a life over 10 years, the pipeline will last a lot of 100 years. For tax purposes, such an longer than 10 years and that profits will asset may now be written off the books at he understated the slower rate that is projected in this legislation-that is, over 10 years. But the capital cost of the asset still remains the than 10 years only if the reservoir lasts. same. Because the capital cost will have been allowed as a tax deduction, in most instances to a company paying company tax at the rate of 45c in the dollar, as at present, virtually half the cost will have been provided from the public purse anyway by reason of the tax that will have been forgone, lt is for this reason that I certainly would not waste at a rate at which suggest that there is a good case for the its life would be ended in 5 or 10 years, as pipeline system to be regarded as a public the existing tax system seems to indicate. utility. Even if the system is not nationalised, The mere fact that the period over which at least the prices that it is able to charge the capital cost may be written off has been should be regulated. It seems to us on this side of the House lot more fruitful than was originally that there is a case for the establishment in expected. I think that at the time the 5-year Australia of a body similar to that which provision applied there had not been the exists in the United States of America and discoveries that have now been revealed. to empower such a body to regulate pipeThis is fair enough. AllT am suggesting is certainly they are not to be fixed by public decision; they are to be fixed by private decision. I think we have here an example of a matter about which the Government ought to have second thoughts. It should look at some of the practices that are being allowed to develop. It is true that tax concessions can be used systematically to encourage development in one direction or in another. Indeed, tax concessions can even can he done by not allowing concessions in a certain direction but allowing them somewhere else.

With these pipelines, the exercise tonight. AllI suggest is that for example, construction costing about there are arguments amongst accountants $70m has already been undertaken and in and the honourable member for Evans has the next 5 or 10 years expenditure on pipesuggested that these are questions for lines will amount to hundreds of millions management.

It seems member for Evans (Dr Mackay), that to me that a 10-year write-off is certainly ultimately they are wasting assets.

I do not think the Government has given sufficient consideration lo this point in the past. 1 know that honourable members on the Government side have a Mining Committee and it has been responsible in some ways for some amendments that have been made to the income tax laws. But this problem should not always be examined merely from thc point of view of taxation, lt should also be examined from the point of view of national development and national conservation. This is an important aspect and it has not been as fully considered as it should have been. We do not offer any objection to the legislation. We believe it is better for these assets lo be written off over a 10-year period instead of a 5-year period, but nevertheless we draw attention to the need some day to place the pipelines under some sort of public control, f do not want to argue now about whether this should be done by direct ownership or indirectly by some federal regulatory body. But at least the matter is worthy of contemplation. FinallyI remind the House of the point made by Mr The Federal Treasurer. Mr William McMahon, Trimmer, who suggested that perhaps carelessly we are discriminating between one form of indigenous energy and another and that such discrimination may in the long run be detrimental to the proper conservation of the limited supplies of energy in the continent of Australia. May1 preface my contribution to this debate by quoting to the House from an editorial that appeared in the 'Australian' in 1966. It said that the finding of crude oil and natural gas would place strains on the economic and financial ability of the Government beyond anything experienced in Australia's history. The editorial likened the construction of the oil pipelines and the other media of transport of crude oil and natural gas to the importance of the construction of the major Australian railway system during the latter half of the last century. This Government lacks a fuel policy; the Opposition has one. The Government lacks a national fuel policy, and the Opposition has for many years prepared one, publicised it, and will in due course implement it. The measure itself, as the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) has said, is an improvement on the former legislation. It will reduce the actual amount that can be claimed by way of depreciation by the various producing companies in respect of the transmission of oil or natural gas by pipelines and also by road or rail, provided that their primary or principal use is for the transport of crude oil or gas produced within Australia. The extension of the period from 5 years to 10 years in which depreciation may be claimed means that, in broad percentages, in the future depreciation in company tax returns will be at the rate of 10% instead of 20%. That is all lo the good. But implicit in this measure is thc acceptance of the construction of pipelines ancl other media of transport for crude oil and gas by private industry. That is where we join issue with the Government. It is worthwhile to quote an article from the 'Australian Financial Review' of 17th March .1967 referring to a reply made by the Federal Treasurer for North Sydney( Mr Graham). The article reads: yesterday accused his oil company critics of concealing information vital for a comparison of tiie Australian Governnient 'take' of oil and ga.s production against other countries. The Treasurer is reported to have said: We pointed out that the oil companies had u>ed a very technical method of estimating future returns and dividends in what is called a discounted cash flow technique. But they had been at ureat care to conceal the two essential factors on which a judgment could be made. * # « « * 1 also pointed nut that thoy The oil producing companieshad made no allowance whuuoever for special taxation concessions with regard to depreciation which in this country are probably greater than in most other countries and compare favourably with the best. To the extent that the rate of depreciation has been reduced, we do not oppose the legislation. We note that it is not applicable to the construction of harbours, rolling stock and ships. There, of course, the Government obviously had in mind the way in which its fingers were burned in litigation in respect of the construction of a major railway",66,Income Tax Assessment

This is a matter of the utmost importance.

These railway lines toria will be paying for public roads and will not be able to claim the expenditure as a tax deduction. This surely is an anomaly which is being exaggerated by the Bill before us. Dr MACKAY (Evans) [10.28]-In what has been rightly described as a reasonably small and narrow Bill which the Opposition indicated to begin with that it did not intend to oppose-indeed , in the words of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean), the Opposition welcomed the measure because it extended from 5 to 10 years the period over which the cost of a pipeline would be written off-w e have heard a wide ranging discussion of the Australian Labor Party's intentions and hopes with regard to a national fuel policy and the nationalisation of pipelines and, most significantly of all, its attitude to income taxation and Income tax deductions in respect of the mining industry. Let us look at some of the statements that have been made. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports made, in my view, a specious analogy in stating that the railways in Australia would have failed if they had been left to private enterprise to develop. Any person who appreciates the size of Australia and the task of developing Australia could not possibly imagine that anyone in his right senses would like to put down railway lines over the entire area that is required for national development. But if the honourable member means by this that, when it eomes to a specific mining project and the carriage of a product, whether it is ore, gas or oil, private enterprise is not able to operate efficiently and therefore it should be left to a nationalised entity government in terms of capital input. The to carry out the operation, then I am afraid that be does not understand the facts. Indeed, if one examines the development that is occurring in Australia at the present moment one win appreciate that governments are unable to find the volume of capital required for the transportation of for Wills was very significant in that he the products of mining. Today it is necestook time out to deplore the use of tax sary for those engaged in the mining industry to put in their own transmission system, such as the railway lines linking the iron ore deposits at Mount Goldsworthy, Mount Newman and Mount Tom Price which are being laid in a highly efficient way in record time compare favourably with any similar system in the world. Whether it be the laying of railway lines or the construction of pipeline for oil and gas, private industry has to meet the cost of such work in Australia today. The old argument comes up that these installations should be national propertygreat assets belonging to the people. It is interesting to note that we hear this kind of argument only when significant success has been achieved by those who have pioneered in a field. There was no such argument about the pipeline linking Moonie with the coast because Moonie was a relatively small field and its economics were uncertain. There was no brouhaha then because it was understood at the time-and I was a member of this House then-that the profitability of the Moonie field was only marginal. Unhappily subsequent discoveries in the area have not lived up to the hopes that were originally expressed. But when it comes to a magnificent success which has changed the whole outlook of the nationI refer to the Bass Strait discoveries -the Opposition rises with the cynical attitude of sneering at the profitability of the enterprise. The honourable member for Wills( Mr Bryant) spoke of his heart bleeding and all the rest of it. But the situation is that Australia today is entering into a new era, an era which demands enormous quantities of capital-fa r more than the Government can provide. Only recently the Minister for Development in Western Australia described how $ 1,000m of private capital was to be expended on the development of just one area in that fast developing State. Such expenditure would far outstrip even the wildest imagination of a Socialist only way money can be obtained for the fast development of Australia is through private enterprise. The speech of the honourable member concessions. At first his remarks seemed to be irrelevant but later they became significant. He introduced his speech by referring to capital gains. Apparently he saw the word 'capital' written somewhere in the Bill and thought immediately of capital gain. He did not go on to discuss capital gain taxation but to talk about other aspects of income tax. He deplored the use of tax concessions for economic incentives. He deplored the way in which concessions are granted by governments to those who are prepared to invest the enormous amounts of capital required to develop our national resources. The question I want to pose lo the Opposition arising out of the speech of the honourable member for Wills is: Are we listening tonight to an intention of the Oppomates of the average person ancl indeed sition with regard to income lax legislation, and particularly to Division 10 of the Income Tax Act. section 77A regarding oil and gas mining, section 77AA regarding deductibility for expenditure of moneys paid by companies engaged in mineral exploration, or section 77c regarding one-third of the calls being deductible if the moneys are expended on exploration of mining interests? Are we listening tonight to a warning to ihe nation by the Opposition that if the time so we have this complementary legislation comes for it to move into a position of government-by the display that we have seen this week that is a very long way offwe will see the expression 'capital gain', which came to the lips of the honourable member for Wills so freely, brought into conjunction with a new attitude to income lax as a whole; a discontinuation of economic incentives to mining industries with regard to expenditure on the national development of Australia? Of course, when we listened further to the honourable member for Wills discussing private roads-bringin g in everything from water rights to the kitchen sink with regard to annually assessed rates being allowable deductions for income tax purposes-w e found that he deplored the fact that the private citizen was unable to get this kind of benefit whereas the great capitalistic comand giving the greatest possible benefit to the panies he referred to were. Unhappily for him the facts do not bear out even this argucannot agree. I commend this Bill which ment because section 77c of the Income Tax Act makes specific provision for double deduction. Private individuals are able to claim one-third of the money that they subscribe to a mining company and if that money is utilised by the company for exploration purposes-it can be expended in various ways in the mining fields-100 % of it is deductible in the hands of the company. So, there is just no substance to the suggestion that the private individual is cut out of this arrangement entirely. I reiurn to the point that although this Bill is a very narrow piece of legislation it does indicate that there has been a stepping up of the tempo of oil and gas discovery in Australia. This legislation arises out of a situation where the Government-certainl y in generosity-a t a time when the utmost in incentives was required and there was very little likelihood, according to the estiof the average expert, of a great quantity of oil and gas being found in Australia, made it possible for those who were going to spend money putting in a pipeline to write off the expenditure over a 5-year period, so hazardous was their investment. But now things have changed and the situation has become different. Just as the Prime Minister( Mr Gorton) was able to negotiate a new agreement with regard to incentives, relating to a lengthening of the period over which pipeline deductions are allowable. To suggest that all this is haphazard and that it is necessary because of the lack of a national fuel policy is to suggest that the Commonwealth Government could in a lordly way disregard the fact that Australia operates under a Federal system and that mining is the prerogative of the States. The Government is, in spite of the situation, bringing together the very necessary pieces of legislation that we have recently seen with regard to off-shore oil and gas. To say that there is no policy running through this would be right if what was meant was that we do not have a blueprint based on out of date Socialist doctrines. But if the Opposition suggests that there is no dynamic, progressive policy which is adapting itself to an exciting, changing Australia people of Australia, then I am afraid I the Opposition, for all its talk, also commends and I hope that it will pass with a minimum of delay.

Parliamentary allowances were last reviewed in 1964 when members' allowances, including their electorate allowances, and ministerial and other office holders' salaries and allowances were increased to take account of changes that had occurred since the 1959 review of parliamentary salaries by an independent committee. Since 1964 wages and salaries have increased generally. Average weekly earnings have increased by some 22%, and the allowances paid to members of State Parliaments have also been increased since those of the members of this Parliament were last reviewed. On some past occasions-in 1952, 1955 and 1959a committee of inquiry was established to review parliamentary salaries and allowances. On other occasions, most recently in 1964, Parliament itself dealt with these matters without an inquiry. In any case, Parliament is required by section 48 of the Constitution to decide the matter. On this occasion the Parliament will again be recommended to deal with the matter itself by bringing up to date the allowances and salaries which have remained unchanged since 1964. During the 4 years which have passed since parliamentary salaries were last raised many increases and improvements in conditions have been made for persons employed outside Parliament, and the Government has decided to recommend an increase in salaries and allowances payable to Ministers, other office holders and members of Parliament. It is proposed that these increases will take effect as from lst December 1968. With the concurrence of honourable members. I incorporate in Hansard a summary of the proposed changes in salaries and allowances. Present per annum 1.

Before deciding to recommend these increases the Government made a survey of salaries paid for positions of comparable responsibility, both in the Public Service and in other sectors of the community. We have particularly taken into account changes that have been made in payments to the Second Division of the Commonwealth Public Service. We have considered the fact that between the December quarter of 1964 and June quarter of 1968 average weekly earnings have risen, as 1",71,Income Tax Assessment
192,Mr Gorton (Higgins,"Prime Minister)said, by some 22%, and we have taken into consideration both the fact that that period covers only 3 i years of the 4-year period which has passed since the last parliamentary increase and also the fact that at least 3 years is likely to pass before there is any further review. There has always been criticism of rises in parliamentary salaries, and I suppose that there always will be. But if we are to attract people of the right calibre to enter Parliament they ought to be reasonably rewarded for what they do. As Sir Robert Menzies said 4 years ago: The salaries of a member should be fixed at an amouni which is not so low as to deter a man of good attainments and ability who has no the Senate: private income from entering or remaining in Parliament. 1 believe this to be true. The Government proposes also to introduce a Bill dealing with ministerial retiring allowances in order to make these allowances roughly in accord with the changes recommended for ministerial salaries themselves. My colleague the Treasurer ( Mr Bill 1968. McMahon) will be introducing such a Bill shortly, and I would hope that that Bill will be able to be debated concurrently with the two Bills which I am now bringing before the House. The Bill provides, amongst other things, for continuity in the payment of the allowances for the Chairman of Committees in the Senate and the Chairman of Committees in the House of Representatives. As1 said, my colleague the Treasurer will be introducing separate legislation to increase the rate of contribution by Ministers for a ministerial retiring allowin each year towards the end of the Budget ance fund. I. think that there is little more I can say. The document which has been presented to honourable members indicates the changes proposed in salaries for private members, in the allowances for private members and in the salaries and allowances for senior Ministers, junior Ministers and other office holders of the Parliament.

LOAN BILL (No. 2) 1968 Second Reading Debate resumed from 7 November (vide page 2600), on motion by Mr Freeth: That the Bill be now rend a second time. This is a Bill of the kind that is brought session. As the Minister assisting the Treasurer ( Mr Freeth) said in his second reading speech: Tlte purpose of this Bill is to obtain authority for any borrowing that it may be necessary to make from the Reserve Bank during 1968-69 to complete the financing of the Budget deficit. The Bill departs from the practice of seeking authority to borrow up to a specified upper limit. Tliat practice has proved unsatisfactory. The difficulty with specifying an upper limit is that such a limit needs to be set high enough to ensure that whatever our receipts and expenditures and our borrowings for the year might turn out lo be, it will be adequate to cover the final cash deficiency at lhe end of the year. The Minister went on to note that in statethe ultimate outcome of the Budget had been adjusted in the two financial years",74,Parliamentary Allowances
193,Mr Gorton (Higgins,-Prime Minister) ment No. 4 attached to the Budget speech,75,Bills Returned From The Senate
194,Mr Crean (Melbourne Ports) [10.50],"1966-67 and 1967-68, and I think he indicated that in this year there was to be an estimated deficit-that is the difference between projected revenue and projected expenditure-of $547m. in 1966-67 the deficiency had been $552m and in 1967-68 it had been $644m. Those deficiencies were financed from several sources-fro m borrowing overseas, mainly from the United States for defence purposes; by drawings from or repayments to the International Monetary Fund according to the circumstances of the year; by borrowing directly in Australia by the issue of new securities; by what are called 'Treasury notes': and finally, if there was still any deficiency, recourse was had directly to the Reserve Bank, which, of course, is the property of the Commonwealth anyway. In 1966-67 borrowings from the Reserve Bank were $165m. In 1967-68 they were $51m. At this stage of this financial year it is not possible, of course, to determine how much will need to be borrowed, if any, from the Reserve Bank. indicated that already there has been considerable borrowing overseas. We have had a number of measures in recent times dealing with borrowings of Deutsche marks, of Swiss francs, of American dollars directly from the Export-Import Bank and somelimes from otherfinancialinstitutions in the United States. Of course all of this shows, I suppose, how flexible are the devices that are available to this level of government. This contrasts somewhat with the difficulties that face State governments if they want fo bridge the difference between their expected expenditure and their anticipated revenues. Thc States have not the same ability to create credit, if I may use that phrase, or to make up the difference, as the Commonwealth Government has via the Reserve Bank. This raises a lot of rather interesting possibilities and I am sorry that market between what are called 'old' bonds at this time of night one does not feel, perhaps, like going fully into the depths of this kind of issue. I would have preferred this measure to be debated at some other time, because I think it is worthy of wider debate than it is likely to get this evening. that it warrants some further action on Nevertheless, I do want to direct attention to one or two aspects of the current situation, and particularly to one that concerns us at the moment so far as loan raisings are concerned. We recently had a measure in this House which took away, in respect of future loan raisings, a tax concession that had applied to institutions or individuals in the community who subscribed to Commonwealth Government securities. They were entitled, according to their tax position, to a rebate of 10c for every $1 of taxable income that they received from Commonwealth bonds. As we all know, this had the effect of enabling Commonwealth loans to be floated at a lower interest rate than otherwise might have applied. It had the result also that in the case of funds borrowed for semi-government and State government purposes -in which case there was no tax concession-the borrowing rate was something like i % higher than that which applied on Commonwealth securities. Around this tax concession there grew up the rather curious procedure that was described as 'bond washing' or 'rebate washing', which I think was the term applied in respect of Australian taxation. We have previously pointed this out in the House. It had been going on to such an extent that it involved a loss last year of some $5m to S6m from Commonwealth revenue. The Minister assisting the Treasurer estimated that if the practice were allowed to continue, the annual revenue loss to the Commonwealth would be as much as S30m. The change in this tax concession at least removes the possibility of this practice so far as new securities are concerned, but apparently the practice may still be indulged in with respect to existing bonds. I pointed out to thc House at the time that it seemed to me that the practice could still be applied in respect of bonds to a value of about S6,000m. I have observed in a couple of articles since then in the 'Financial Review', by Mr David Love, that already the distinction is being made in the security and 'new' bonds, the old bonds apparently still being open to the practice of rebate washing. 1 would think the situation is so serious the part of the Government, and I urge upon it the necessity to do something about removing opportunities for rebate washing in respect of what are called 'old' securities. I know that there are some difliculties",75,Bills Returned From The Senate
195,I Think The Treasurer ( Mr Mcmahon) Has,"attaching to what are regarded as contractual arrangements with these bonds, but it seems to me that what might be looked on as the sacredness of the contract has to some extent departed when the bond has been transferred from one holder to another in what is nothing less than a tax dodging device. In view of the volume of financial transactions in Australia-and in many ways we have one of the most advanced of the smaller economies-n o Government can afford to relinquish control of the bond markets. It seems to me that in some respeots responsibility is vacated by the existence of this device in the Australian law. I think I pointed out in an earlier debate the economy is going. As we said yesterday, that one of the principal lessons of the recent inquiry in Great Britain, which was known as the Radcliffe Committee, was the need to have what was called 'debt management' clearly in the hands of the Government. It seems to me that in Australia debt management is not in the hands of the Government at the present time, and I think that this is a serious omission so far as the overall regulation of monetary affairs in Australia is concerned. In a way, the partirecently about this bond washing or rebate cular measure that is before us is a kind of epitome of the whole financial transactions of the Government in a year. One judges the success or otherwise of the outcome of the Budget by how close one gets to the kind of estimate of deficit that was made at the beginning of the year. No longer does anybody think that a balanced budget is a sign of great financial prudence or that a deficit is a sign of financial squandering. No longer is that an arguable thesis in a modern economy. A budget deficit or surplus really determines whether or not so much of the initiative passes to the public hand as against the private hand in the economy. In a maximum economy it is necessary always to be able to exercise that control. This applies even to governments which do not claim by any sense of the imagination to be regarded as Socialist governments. Nevertheless, there is more and more manipulation, benevolent direction or control of the economy via the monetary and fiscal mechanisms. At least the documentation which accompanies the Budget is much more sophisticated in nature than it was many years ago. I have been a member of this House for approximately 17 years and even in that time. I have seen a considerable change in the way in whichfinancialstatements have been presented to the House. Now we have much more abundance of documentation and cross reference than was the case even in 1960. I think it is to the credit of the Treasurer and the Treasury that this sophisticated information is available to us. But equally I think that measures such as the kind which we are discussing at the present time ought not to be introduced at the fag end of a session. I think that they are the central part of any attempt to adjudicate whether the Government is successful or unsuccessful, well or ill, indicating the pace and the direction in which in some respects we believe that the pace and the direction in which the economy is going at the present time are not altogether satisfactory. I think that one of the reasons for this is the loss of control that has taken place in the economy by allowing manipulation outside of the proper levels of manipulation. One of the features that disturbed me washing was that it could be done only with the collusion of people who, in my view, should behave better. I think it ill became some of the trading banks to enter into the practice if it allowed them some temporary gain. AllI submit is that their responsibility for monetary affairs is greater than the short term gain that can be obtained by this rather reprehensible practice. 1 am sure that the Treasurer is keeping a watchful eye on this practice. I hope that some device will be introduced at the beginning of the next sessional period which will help to stamp out this practice.

It seems to me that there is still a bit of a cat and mouse game going on between the operators as to how far they can go in continuing with this rather reprehensible practice. As I have said, I hope that some early remedial action will be taken to stamp it out. I will leave it at that at this late hour.

Drought Relief-Singl e Engined AircraftRoyal Life Saving Society Motion (by Mr Swartz) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. wish to draw the attention of the House to a matter which concerns a number of my constituents in Bega and which concerns measures which have been taken there to fight the drought which is continuing in that area of Eden-Monaro and which has already reached completely unprecedented proportions. On 12th November 1968 the honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr have in the past supported, the Labor Party. Jeff Bate) addressed a series of questions material question which affects the reputations and standings of those of my constituents with whom I am concerned is as follows: Has the Eden-Monaro branch of the Australian Labor Pany promoted a committee whioh has intruded into a perfectly sound system and which, being inexperienced infinance,transport and the purchase of hay, has been unable to supply high quality fodder to tbe satisfaction of all fanners? The Treasurer answered that question in the following terms: As to the fourth question asked by the honourable gentleman, I believe he would have seen the statement made by Mr Crawford, the Minister for Agriculture in New South Wales, who was highly critical of the Bega Valley Drought Relief Committee. I think everyone should realise that the Committee appears to have made a political gesture, f again have no reason for doubting that the statement made by the honourable member that this action was initiated by the Australian Labor Party in the electorate of Eden-Monaro is in fact accurate. The Treasurer could have been basing his reply only on information that he had received from the honourable member for Macarthur. lt is simply not good enough for the honourable member to regard his question as simply an inquiry for information. The Treasurer, in making his answer, regarded what the honourable member had said as a statement, and to all intents and purposes it is a statementa statement alleging that this Committee was promoted and initiated by the Australian Labor Party in Eden-Monaro. The honourable member for Macarthur was present at the meeting at which the Committee was formed. He knows that it was not initiated or promoted by the Australian Labor Party. He knows that the Committee was established by people interested in helping farmers in the Bega Valley. These are people who wish to combine their efforts and the buying power of co-operatives in order to buy hay, and to obtain free hay and free agistment if possible. These people want to obtain fodder of one kind or another on the best possible basis. I do not know the political affiliations of all the members of the Committee. I do not think this matters. But it would be fair enough to say that at least a couple of them would normally support, or It would also be fair enough to say that at least three or four of them-possibl y more -in the past have normally supported the",76,Bills Returned From The Senate

The,"Liberal Parry, either as financial members of that Party er by making financial contributions from time to time to support campaigns of the Party. criticising the honourable member for Macarthur? the honourable member for Reid had been present a little earlier he would have heard what I have already said. If he listens now he will hear what I still have to say. The fact is that the honourable member for Macarthur cannot possibly say that this Committee is overloaded one way or the other with people representing any political party. I do not believe that he can seriously contest, although he has purported to do so, the motives expressed in the motion that set up the Committee-the intention to do whatever could be done to help drought stricken farmers. I want to make it perfectly clear to the honourable member for Macarthur that I am calling on him to withdraw those allegations. I want him to withdraw without any reservations the allegations that this Committee has been motivated or promoted by the Labor Party. I do not think it is any reasonable concession on bis part to have said, as he did in thc debate on the motion for the adjournment of the House on 14th November: The Bega Valley Drought Relief Committee is not officially affiliated with any political party, ing that the whole operation is now going but I believe that it has been used in a political sense by the Australian Labor Party. I say this because the honourable member went on to instance a number of what he described as coincidences and a number of statements that had been made by members of that Committee. In fact, he went on to say that although there was no official affiliation there would appear to be a very strong sympathy or other motivation from the Labor Party. This is completely wrong -ha y reaches most of them before their The only instance 1 know of in which a representative of the Labor Party actually approached a member of the Committeeand this was done on an individual basis and not as an approach to the Committee as a whole-wa s when the President of the Australian Labor Party Electorate Council in Eden-Monaro asked a member of the Committee for his support in a proposal to encourage five farmers to bring five starving cows to Canberra and to put them on the grass outside Parliament House. The member of the Committee rejected this political stunt out of hand and it was never put to the Committee itself. Honourable members know the result: The cows did not turn up. So the only political stunting that I know of has come from the Labor Party and not from the Bega Valley Drought Relief Committee. Unfortunately the Labor Party in Eden Monaro has tried to cash in politically on the extraordinary difficulties of the farmers in that area. But the blame should be sheeted home to those who deserve it and not to the members of the Committee. I repeat that I could not be satisfied by more than a complete withdrawal by the honourable member for Macarthur of his allegations as to political motivations and the initiation or promotion of this Committee. The Committee had troubles, which I mentioned in the adjournment debate on 14th November before the honourable member for Macarthur spoke. I outlined the formation of the Committee and its present operation. The State Government has now agreed to transport gift hay into the valley without cost to the farmers. Further it has subsidised at the rate of an additional 10c a bale hay coming from Nimmitabel. It has, in effect, taken over the transport of hav into the Bega Valley. Mr George Kent, the New South Wales Department of Agriculture officer in Bega, advised me this even'as smooth as silk', that there have oeen received some 644 or more orders for about 65,000 to 70,000 bales of hay, and that between 8,000 and 10,000 bales have so far been handled at the rate of up to 3,800 a day. Although some farmers have actually been right down to their last bale-and these people are receiving special attention last bale cuts out. Of course, bales are often bought as well as stored. There has been more agistment offered than has been taken up. It would appear at the moment that the saleyards, while values are holding fairly well, are providing an alternative preferred by most farmers to the alternative even of using free agistment.

It Munro) has certainly stood up the honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr Jeff Bate) and demanded a withdrawal of his allegation, but of course the honourable member for Macarthur is not here. One might also expect the honourable member for Eden Monaro to be a little concerned with the honourable member for Macarthur made his allegation, said: 'Yes, the honourable member is usually correct and I believe he is correct on this occasion.' He went ahead and made his full score of political capital out of answering the question by assuming that this committee was being manipulated politically by the Australian Labor Party. Perhaps the honourable member for Eden Monaro will also demand some redress from the Treasurer, who gave the allegation the full authority of a senior minister. Mr MunroI will do my own demanding. Dr. J. F. CAIRNS-Yes, and you will use your discretion, I am sure. It is strange to hear the honourable member talking about political capital being made out of the distress of farmers in a certain area, as though that is not what he is doing. If the Australian Labor Party speaks about this subject, it is making political capital. If the honourable member does so, he is being most conscientious and genuine. Anybody who knows anything of politics and anything of this House, as 1 am sure the honourable member for Higinbotham ( Mr where in the world, is the Cessna Agwagon, Chipp) does by now, will realise that this is a House in which politics feature fairly often. The honourable member for Eden Monaro has distinguished himself tonight by a political adventure. 1 want to speak about another matter. On 25th May 1967 the Acting Minister for Trade and Industry referred a matter to the Tariff Board. He asked the Tariff Board to inquire into whether single engined aeroplanes should be protected. On 21st June 1968, 13 months later, the Tariff Board reported and about 2 i months afterwards the report found its way into the House. We discovered then that the Board had reported that the production of single engined aeroplanes in Australia should not be protected. I ask the Minister for Trade report back to the Tariif Board, because has applied the principle that I have been talking about for several days and that is the principle that if some production in Australia needs protection of more than 50% it shall not get it. This is a specific case in which the Tariff Board has rejected the application and apparently the Minister for Trade and Industry is prepared to agree with the Board. But the 50% that tbe industry requires is arrived at only on the assumptions made by the Tariif Board. The application mainly concerned an investigation into the production of the Airtruk by Transavia Corporation. I have here a model of the Airtruk. It is a most efficient aircraft for its purpose and certainly one of the most efficient in the field on any standard. That is admitted by the Tariff Board and demonstrated in its report. The Airtruk is powered with an engine of 300 horsepower. It has an empty weight of 1,800 lb and a load of 1,940 lb. It can cruise at 90 knots. A comparison between this and other competing aircraft can be seen by an examination of the specifications of the Snow. The Snow has an engine of 600 horsepower, twice thc horsepower of the Airtruk, and an empty weight of 3,500 lb or twice the weight of the Airtruk. The Snow carries 2,030 lb or only 90 lb more than the Airtruk carries with half the horsepower and half the empty weight. The best competitor available in this part of the world, and probably anywhich has an engine of 300 horsepower, an empty weight of 1,955 lb, or 155 lb heavier than the Airtruk, and carries 1,790 lb as against the 1,940 lb carried by the Airtruk. Anyone who knows anything about aerodynamics will agree that the Airtruk is an extremely efficient and economic aircraft. Its design shows much imagination and it flies, which is something the F ill does not seem to do. The Tariff Board has investigated the matter and at page 9 of its report it said that is investigations showed that Transavia had used considerably ingenuity in introducing techniques which would reduce labour costs. The Board was satisfied that the Airtruk was of satisfactory quality and that it had performed efficiently in those areas of New South Wales and New",79,Adjournment
201,"Treasurer ( Mr Mcmahon), Who, When The",,80,Adjournment
202,And Industry ( Mr Mcewen) To Refer The,"Zealand where it had been operated commercially. So there is no question about the efficiency of the industry. The Board has said that it is efficient. We on this side of the able member would agree that something House have said that where an industry is efficient, even if it does require protection of more than 50%, it should not be refused that protection. But this argument about 50% is an argument that arises only as a result of the acceptance of the Tariff Board's assumptions, which may be wrong. The circumstances since the report was made show that the assumptions are likely to be wrong. The Board said that Transavia would require assistance equivalent to a bounty of $8,000 or $9,000 per aeroplane and that is a little more than 50% of the ad valorem value. But the company had applied only for a bounty of $310,460 on eighty-five aeroplanes, which is a much lower percentage. On the Tariff Board's assumptions it is a percentage of only about 30%. If an industry such as this can be started with a bounty of 30% or 40%, that is a satisfactory position. At present aircraft have only 17i% protection and I am amazed that aircraft have ever been produced in Australia with such protection. Transavia has produced further evidence since the Board made its report. The evidence shows that the Board's assessments of the market as an average of fifteen a year in Australia and ten a year in New Zealand are a considerable underestimate. Since the Airtruk has been marketed in New Zealand, the indications are that no other aircraft have been purchased there. The company says that the Airtruks are being absorbed by New Zealand operators as rapidly as they can be manufactured, because operators have found the Airtruk to be the most profitable aircraft available. The Tariif Board's conclusions regarding the large bounty required at an output of twenty-five a year are, aceording to the company, erroneous in view of the fact that the factory is now breaking even on current aircraft. So the bask assumption that the Tariff Board was prepared to make in a pessimistic way has been proved invalid in a few months of operation. The company says that, as regards the Australian market, a new marketing organisation is currently being established under new management and it expects further improvements as a result of this action. This seems to be a case where the matter could quite reasonably be referred back to the Board. I would think that every honourshould be done to establish an aircraft industry in Australia. Perhaps some of the larger companies could be expected to do this. But when a company uses the ingenuity, initiative and enterprise that Transavia has, it deserves some support. I think the Board is being very pessimistic, very narrow and is very wrong in applying the fifty and over principle of tariff making. This principle is that if a company at any stage requires more than 50% protection it will not get it. The fifty and over principle applied to an efficient industry will not be accepted by the Opposition, and for several weeks I have been challening the Minister for Trade and Industry and others on the Government side to say whether the Government will apply this principle. This is a clear example of the principle having been applied and I ask the Minister to refer this report on single engined aeroplanes back to the Tariff Board so that it can take into account the evidence that has accumulated since the report was made. member's time has expired. gives me a great deal of pleasure to support the honourable member for Yarra (Dr. J. F. Cairns) in his request that the matter of the production of single engined aircraft in Australia be referred back to the Tariff Board. As the honourable member for Yarra pointed out, the Airtruk aircraft has satisfied all the requirements laid down by the Department of Civil Aviation for an agricultural aircraft. It has also proved itself satisfactorily in the field. This is one of its greatest features. More of these aircraft are presently operating in New Zealand than in Australia. The company manufacturing the aircraft has taken upon itself to invest a considerable amount of its capital and to secure a loan from the Commonwealth Development Bank to establish an aircraft industry in Australia, knowing at the same time the history of aircraft production in Australia. Let us consider the recent tragic events concerning the company manufacturing the Victa aircraft. This company is now established in New Zealand",80,Adjournment

205,Mr Hansen,"That is right. I thinkposition is very much the same as it is with refrigerators. You sec a refrigerator listed at a certain price with trade-in, and no matter where or at what you look it is very hard to know the actual price of the article. Because of changed conditions since the report was presented on 22nd June and because of what has been further proved by the manufacturers, I have much pleasure in supporting the honourable member for Yarra in requesting that the Tariff Board conduct a second inquiry into this matter. Dr MACKAY (Evans) [11.39]-It is not often that I rise to support the honourable member for Yarra (Dr. J. F. Cairns), but I support him and also the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Hansen) in their request tonight that the Tariff Board take a second look at its recommendation with regard to single engined aircraft. It is obvious to anyone that agricultural aircraft play a major part in increasing primary production in Australia. Any reasonable thought about the future, therefore, would lead us to believe that there will be a growdanger of ingesting foreign bodies and thereing demand for this and other types of light aircraft in this eountry and that as a result there will be a quite considerable increase in export earnings from primary production. We find also that the Government obtains a duty of 1\% on the importation of aircraft. Surely some of the revenue derived from this duty could be spent lo assist local production to get off thc ground for the variety of reasons which I hope to outline in the few minutes at my disposal. Almost al) of the otber local manufacturers arc interested in military production in Australia and therefore are interested only in cost plus activities. There are no incentives in the aircraft manufacturing industry in Australia for productivity or efficiency. De Havilland is engaged mainly with an eye to military production, as is the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation, ft is unusual to find in Australia any outlet for young aeronautical engineers. If Australia is to develop an efficient and enterprising aircraft industry this is where it must start. It must start in the market place in an industry that is subject to normal economic pressures. It must encourage enterprise. It must encourage our bright young graduates. It must get to grips with the problems of space confronting this nation and must gear its activities accordingly. No manufacturer of light aircraft in the worldI have tried to get as much information as possible on tliis subject-develop s a new model without direct or indirect assistance from his government. Cessnas and Pipers, which are aircraft competing against the aircraft under discussion, have been developed by manufacturers who enjoy considerable support from their governments. Here we have an Australian manufacturer trying to compete with Piper and Rex, both of which have major government contracts to help them to develop their products. De Havilland wants the tariff removed and it opposes the granting of bounty assistance, not so as to corner the market but to enable the company to sell what has proved to be a liability. I refer to the Beaver turbo aircraft, which is too sophisticated and too expensive for small agricultural operations 1 in Australia even if it were suitable to our purposes. 1 believe that it is totally unsuitable for agricultural operations in Australia due to the vulnerability of the jet type engine. With this type of engine there is a fore as a consequence there is a high maintenance and repair bill attendant upon its use. De Havilland has virtually adopted the attitude that il will not try to build an aircraft for the local market. Having grown fat on the cost plus system the company may not have technical and production capabilities of a sufficiently high order in this country. It certainly has grown fat on government contracts and it has not tried to correct the situation. 1 am concerned tonight that the light aircraft industry in Auslralia is being seriously neglected. The Government will pay a lot more money for defence aircraft work as a result of this neglect. The cost to the Government will make the S300.000 odd mentioned in this report look like peanuts. The report refers not only to the particular aircraft that has been mentioned tonight but could relate to rotary wing aircraft as well. The enterprise of the Victa organisation has been mentioned. In addition to developing a light fixed wing aircraft, the young aeronautical engineers who were responsible for this development, two of whom I know personally, also developed a gyroplane in Australia. It has flown for about 10,000 hours and is most highly regarded by the Department of Civil Aviation, but has had no assistance to get off the ground as a commercial project. At present the young aeronautical engineers are trying to enter the field of commercialisation in order to give effect to their creation. Unhappily, the result could be that they, like the vast majority of graduates in aeronautical engineering from Australian universities, will have to make their way overseas to get jobs in which they ean use fully their enterprise, initiative and inventiveness. Our young aircraft engineers are fast losing heart with regard to their future in Australia. The majority of them are now in foreign employment. I have said rhat the de Havilland organisation grew fat on cost plus contracts. J would like several features looked into, either by the Public Accounts Committee or by some such responsible body. The first point to be inquired into is that, as 1 underable member for Evans (Dr Mackay) waa stand it, de Havilland 'rents', using the word in inverted commas, enormous facilities including great areas of factory space and amounts of equipment right down to such items as office chairs and work benches at what is really a very nominal figure, if thefigures1 have obtained are in any way accurate. If that is the true position, it warimports aircraft and parts from other parts rants examination. I would also like to know to what extent thc property and facilities are involved in manufactures of a private nature, in the production of aluminium boats, of which de Havilland is the largest manufacturer in Australia for commercial sale. 1 pose these questions: Is the de Havilland organisation using for the nautical purpose a large percentage of equipment which is installed for aircraft manufacture? Arc full and reasonable commercial lease and rental rates for such usage being paid? In other words, I believe that there is a situation inside the light aircraft manufacturing industry in Australia that needs examination. I believe that lhe Government should have another look af this matter. It should override, or at least send back to the Tariff Board for a new scrutiny, the report that has been made to the Parliament. We should do something to encourage the commercial and technical initiative that is to be found in Australia, capable of developing an aircraft like the gyroplane to which I have referred. It has a stalling speed of 5 knots. It can carry two people at almost stationary speeds-if that is not an Irishism-almos t in a stationary condition while an examination is made, for example, of outcrops of mineralisation for the mining industry or the condition of wells, fences and so on for the rural industry. It could be used to assist many other activities in which in the future imported aircraft will be used unless, happily, we are able to bring about a change of direction in the trend through local manufacture of aircraft. I support what has been said by the two speakers from the Opposition on this subject. proposition that the TarirT Board should reexamine the proposal with regard to the light aircraft industry. I believe that it is necessary to establish an aircraft manufacturing industry in Australia. The honourcritical of the de Havilland organisation. I have made an examination of the costs of imported aircraft and parts from the United States of America. In 1963-64 such imports totalled about $24m; last year lhe value of imported planes and parts from the United States had risen to about S90m. Australia of the world. From the angle of the balance of trade, we have a deficit on the current account of about $7,0Q0rh since 1950. It is clear that Australia must havo its own aircraft manufacturing industry. We were hesitant about establishing our own motor car industry 25 to 30 years ago. It was not an economic proposition in those days. HoweverI think we can say reasonably that in a country like Australia it is necessary to have a light aircraft industry. I support what was said by the honourable member for Yarra (Dr. J. F. Cairns). I know that the honourable member for Wida Bay( Mr Hansen) last weekend took several colleagues out to examine the factory in Sydney. They were impressed by tha enthusiasm and keenness of the company concerned. I think this matter is well worth examination by the Tariff Board. I also want to refer to the matter that was mentioned by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Munro) earlier this evening. He dissociated himself from the remarks made on Hth November by the honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr",82,Adjournment
206,Mr Uren (Reid) [11.48],"I support thaJeff Bate) on the motion that the House adjourn. The honourable member for Macarthur attacked the Bega Valley Drought Relief Committee as being a front for the Australian Labor Party. I quote from pages 2932 and 2933 of Hansard where the honourable member is reported as having said: . . . when it was thought that there might be a Federal general election this year the Bega Valley Drought Relief Committee suddenly appeared. The man who chaired the meeting at which the Committee was formed was heard over the Australian Broadcasting Commission radio station 2BA in Bega exhorting farmers to attend the meeting at the hotel. Mr Hills, the Leader of the Bega Valley Drought Relief Committee. 1 the Opposition in the New South Wales Parliament, the Labor candidate for the Federal seat of Eden-Monaro and the former President of the Federal and New South Wales organisations of the Australian Labor Party were present. This Committee is supposed to be non-political. The chairman of the meeting which formed thc Committee exhorted the people over the Australian Broadcasting Commission radio programme to attend the meeting. Of course, the ABC is one of the Labor Party organs in this country. Some of the farmers attended the meeting. The person who moved the resolution on the basis of which the Cominittee was formed is a strong supporter of the ALP in Bega. A few days later he was seen talking not to members of the Government Parties but to Labor members of the New South Wales Legislative Council in Parliament House in Macquarie Street, Sydney. Clearly, honourable members on this side in order to gain drought relief, they were of the House believe that there is a need trying to make political capital out of the for the Bega Valley Drought Relief Commatter. mittee and, I say frankly, we do not want to make political capital out of it.

We must all be associate himself from only the honourable aware of the tragedy that the people of member for Macarthur? He disassociates the South Coast of New South Wales have himself from the honourable member for suffered as a result of the drought. Surely Macarthur because he feels that the honourall honourable members in this House and able member is not too responsible in politics all members of the State Parliament should anyway and maytoeon the way out, whereas strive to assist these people who have he wants to remain on the inside. Why suffered so much. The honourable member does not he disassociate himself from the for Macarthur was not the only member of remarks made by the Treasurer, who is one the Liberal Party of Australia who jumped of the senior members of his Party in New on the bandwagon in trying to make poliSouth Wales and who joined in this gutter tical capital out of the situation and who type of politics with the honourable memtried to beat the political drum by suggestber for Macarthur in order to try to make ing that the evil people in this scheme were political capital out of the people who were members of the Labor Party. During quessuffering on the south coast of New South tion time on 12th November the honourable Wales? Why does not he disassociate himmember for Macarthur asked a question. self from the remarks made by the State He commenced it by saying: 1 ask the Treasurer a question about drought relief for the South Coast of New South Wales. incur the criticism of his Party. He concluded his question by saying: Did private contractors carry one load on Thursday and three on Friday last week? Did the 'Sydney Morning Herald' send to investigate the position a Mr Joe Glascott who was not seen by the co-operatives but went only to the ALP Committee, which was seeking political advantage and some publicity? I quote part of what the Treasurer ( Mr McMahon) said in answering that question, and this appears at page 2686 of Hansard, as follows: 1 believe he would have seen the statement made by Mr Crawford, the Minister for Agriculture in New South Wales, who was highly critical of think everyone should realise that the Committee appears to have made a political gesture. I again have no reason for doubting that the statement made by the honourable member that this action was initiated by tbe Australian Labor Party in the electorate of Eden-Monaro is in fact accurate. So the Treasurer not only condoned the remarks made by the honourable member for Macarthur but also endorsed the remarks of Mr Crawford, a Liberal-Country Party Minister of the New South Wales Government. These three responsible people, all members of the Liberal and Country Parties, were trying to make political capital out of this drought relief. While members of the Labor Party were working in support of the people on the south coast The honourable member for Eden-Monaro Minister, Mr Crawford? Of course, he does not do that because he does not want to I believe that all honourable members should join with the Labor candidate for Eden-Monaro, Allan Fraser, who has given great service. Tn his maiden speech the present honourable member for Eden Monaro gave credit to Allan Fraser for what he had done. Surely Allan Fraser and he should be united on this issue and should be trying to work in the interests of the people.

The Labor Party is trying to do a job for the people. Every member of this House should strive to do his best for these unfortunate farmers and other people on the south coast of New South Wales, who have experienced an unfortunate drought, which is practically unknown in the history of the area. to speak tonight in support of an appeal that the New South Wales Branch of the Royal Life Saving Society launched recently to raise $200,000 to make its work in New South Wales effective. The Branch was established in Sydney 75 years ago. In the year in which it was established twentytwo awards for life saving were granted by the Society in that State. Last year 103,054 awards were granted in the State. This was a world record for any life saving body on earth. Of this achievement the Society, which is a voluntary body, is justly proud. It is also proud of, among other things, distinct from that of the Surf Life Saving its pioneering role in tbe world when, less Association, whose area is the surf beaches. than a decade ago in Sydney, at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, twelve human guinea pigs drawn from the Society's ranks proud responsibility of teaching children at proved that the then new mouth to mouth the primary school level who are between the resuscitation was the safest and most reliable ages of 9 and 13, which is the danger area. method of artificial resuscitation known.

This could be called the point of no return. Last year thirty-two people at the point of death were revived in New South Wales by mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. They were the lucky ones. But not so lucky were the hundreds who perished because no-one there at the time was trained to act without medical help and without panic in a matter of stark emergency. Terribly unlucky were 153 children under thc age of 16 years who died in New South Wales iast year by misadventure. This is seven more than the number of children in this age group who died on the roads in that State. It is important to realise-althoug h it is not a pleasant realisation-that of the children who died on the roads, most were fatally injured before medical help arrived. But it was a different story for the 153 who died by misadventure. Many could and should be alive today. These children died by strangulation, poison, gas, electrocution, drowning or with their heads in plastic bags. Of the 153 children who died last year in New South Wales by misadventure, 56 were drowned, although only 4 were drowned in the surf or the sea. A total of 52 children were drowned in still water, in metropolitan swimming pools, country dams, suburban creeks, irrigation canals, reservoirs and household baths. These children died 'back of the beach', which is where the work of the Royal Life Saving Society begins, as The Society has been charged with the",84,Adjournment
207,Mr Arthur (Barton) [11.58],"! wishLast year these three men alone taught more than 12,000 children water safety and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation at school. The dream or ideal is that each school should be revisited by the instructors every fourth year. But unfortunately this is impossible at club at Brighton-le-Sands, another at present. At the moment statistics show that less than one out of every three children who should be taught these precious lessons can be taught. Children will be children and they do not see the dangers that the adult eye can see. The trouble with most children is that they behave like children. Speak to a child of danger and you will stir his sense of adventure. Say to a child: 'Do not do that' and it will stir him to find out why he should not do it. Children have been strangled when playing on swings or playing cowboys and Indians, smothered in a sandpit when playing miners, electrocuted when playing behind television sets and in kitchens, collapsed and stopped breathing when playing sports, or suffocated when playing firemen. Children at play can turn on the gas, take poison or swallow objects, sometimes while a helpless parent watches stricken with panic. But children usually play together. If just one child knows how to act properly in an emergency until help arrives another child's life may be saved. The Society's job, and that of its instructors, Ls to safeguard children by teachparticular company. Not long ago Australia ing them how to act. This instruction takes just 4 hours in every 4 years. That is all it takes. But it takes more than three instructors to cover the whole canvas of the State and the schools in the Australian Capital Territory and for the Society to cope with the cry from ever-awakening parents and teachers requesting that children be taught. The Society can teach all of the children at school in the age groups I have mentioned. But to do so it must at least double its instructional staff. ought to be prepared to make some sort of It must provide into perpetuity the money necessary to fill the gap between those children who can be taught and the great majority who cannot be taught at present. This is why for the first time in its 75-year denying them the opportunity to do so. If history the Society is asking for financial help from the New South Wales public. Never before has it asked the public for money. But it now pleads for help so that it can train all of the children, who have a right to be trained. Some say life is cheap, but we know that it is not. The protection of a child's life can be bought for the cost of 4 hours training in every fourth year at primary school level. This is being done also by the life saving clubs and the Society. In my own electorate there is a life saving Ramsgate and a third at Carrs Park. All three are members of the Royal Life Saving Society. They are joining with the Royal Life Saving Society in this campaign to teach this precious method of saving life. That is why I rise tonight to support the Royal Life Saving Society's appeal and to ask every citizen in New South Wales to do the same. Thursday, 21 November 1968 that the hour is late, and it is not my intention to delay the House for more than a few minutes. But I do want to take the opportunity to support those honourable members who have already suggested that the Tariff Board's report on the light aircraft industry ought to be referred back to it. I , too, have seen the Airtruk. I believe that the company has a very good product in this aircraft and that it is deserving of any support we can give it. The amount asked for is not much. I am concerned mainly with the principle involved rather than with the pursuit of a cause for any had three different companies manufacturing light aircraft. We lost one of themI think it was the Victa organisation-to New Zealand. Because of lack of support, another company sold its designs, jigs, tools and dies to the United States, and I believe we have since been in the ridiculous position of purchasing back from the United States Australian designed aircraft. If we wish to establish and maintain a light aircraft industry in Australia we sacrifice towards this end. Quite a considerable number of young Australians are anxious to embark on a career in the light aircraft industry but our present policy is we do not provide the opportunity for them to follow their wishes within an Australian light aircraft industry, we might find that in the future we shall lose not only our ideas but also our brains and skilled manpower to overseas companies. This is something we cannot afford.",86,Adjournment

With those other honourable instance. It might be able to justify its members who have already spoken on these decision with figures, but I think that inlines, I hope that the Government will take stead of looking at this as only a particular another look at the position and will refer case we ought to be giving thought to the the case back to the Tariff Board for principle and should be looking at least 20 reconsideration. years ahead. Who knows but that an Australian light aircraft industry firmly established now could be a very vital factor in Question resolved in the afiirmative. House adjourned at 12.8 a.m. (Thursday) The following answers to questions upon notice were circulated: Northern Fisheries (Question No. 786) Mr Whitlam asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice: 1. Did the Fisheries Development Conference at Canberra in February 1967 express the view that a development plan for northern fisheries, especially prawn resources, should make full use of facilities at local ports, especially of those established to facilitate the exploitation of mineral resources? 2. What facilities for the prawn industry existed at that time at Weipa, and what facilities have subsequently been developed there? 3. Did the conference express the view that the development plan should be based on resources surveys and that the actual development projects should in many cases be conducted by joint government and industry enterprises in which governments should have at least 50% interest? 4. If so, why did he and his predecessor reduce the total expenditure they approved from the Fisheries Development Trust Account from $67,368 in 1966-67 to $7,838 in 1967-68 and the expenditure on the prawn survey in the Gulf of Carpentaria from $14,000 in 1966-67 lo nil in 1967-68? 5. What steps have since been taken to implement the conference's views on northern fisheries with respect to (a) research publications, (b) training programmes, (c) shipbuilding subsidies, (d) importation of equipment, (e) taxation concessions, (0 development funds and (g) a development committee? honourable member's questions are as follows: 1. The report of the Fisheries Development Conference which was held in Canberra in February 1967 considered that the development plan for northern fisheries should 'make full use of facilities at local ports, especially of those established to facilitate the exploitation of mineral resources since, in general, these are located in the remote areas in which fishery prospects are important'. In another section of this report devoted to the prawn fishery, Conference drew attention to problems arising from the inadequacy of port facilities and navigational aids. The Conference considered governments should take steps to ensure the adequacy of these services to meet the needs of the fishing fleet for each fishery. 2. No facilities for the prawn industry existed at Weipa at the time of the Conference. The Queensland Government is taking steps to provide waterfront land on which prawn processing and wharf facilities can be erected. 3. Yes. 4. It is incorrect to deduce that I or my predecessor 'reduced' the total expenditure from the Fisheries Development Trust Account in 1966-67 to the figure shown in the annual report for 1967-68 under the Fishing Industry Act 1956. Expenditure must be compared over a longer period than 2 years, since there have been several instances where expenditure was approved but not incurred until the following year or even later. The reasons for the delays range from difficulty in recruiting suitable staff to carry out projects to nonavailability of equipment, etc. So far as the apparent reduction in expenditure on the Gulf of Carpentaria prawn survey is concerned, the project as approved was completed in 1966. 5. The recommendations of the 1967 Fisheries Development Conference on the matters listed by the honourable member are under constant review by the Commonwealth and State governments and by the Australian Fishing Industry Council. (a) Reports by CSIRO officers engaged on the survey are now being printed. (b) A fisheries education adviser has been appointed to my Department and he is at present studying the education needs of the industry and how existing education facilities may be adapted to meet those needs. (c) No action has been taken on shipbuilding subsidies since there appears to be no shortage of vessels to enter the northern prawn fishery. (d) There are apparently no problems being experienced in obtaining the necessary equipment for northern fisheries. (e) The question of taxation concessions for the the fishing industry is under constant review. (f) Proposals for the establishment of funds for research, education, extension and development are being developed and most States have established their funds. As soon as the total amount of the combined State funds is known an approach will be made to the Commonwealth Government for matching funds. (g) When this Commonwealth fund has been established an appropriate committee will be established to advise me on the expenditure from the fund.

Gulf of Carpentaria Fisheries (Question No. 859) Mr Whitlam asked the Minister Primary Industry, upon notice: 1. What Commonwealth, Queensland and Northern Territory laws relating to fisheries in the Gulf of Carpentaria? 2. What steps have been taken to resolve the dillerenccs? able member's questions are as follows: 1. The differences between the fisheries legislation of the Commonwealth, the Northern Territory and Queensland with regard to the fisheries in the Gulf of Carpentaria are differences of detail rather than of principle. Each law requires the holding of licences in respect of fishermen and fishing boats; each empowers the making of notices or orders in council to regulate such matters as closed seasons, minimum legal sizes, types of fishing gear, etc. The only difference of any significance is that there is no provision in the Queensland legislation for the licensing of fish processing plants and fish processing vessels. 2. Discussions between Commonwealth and Queensland officers are continuing with a view to developing a uniform policy and if this requires amendment to the legislation I have no doubt that the governments will take appropriate action. Bureau of Mineral Resources (Question No. 882) Mr Hansen asked the Minister National Development, upon notice: 1. How many survey parties are at present carrying out investigations for the Bureau of Mineral Resources? 2. Are members of these parlies engaged only for the period of tlie survey or are they all permanent Commonwealth employees? 3. What allowances such as board, camping allowance, fares, etc., are paid to these parties? 4. What was the cost of each of these parlies over the past 3 years? now supplied: 1. On 17th October 1968 there were twelve Bureau of Mineral Resources survey parties carrying out field investigations. In addition there were three surveys being carried out for the Bureau under contract. 2. The professional and sub-professional members of Bureau of Mineral Resources survey parlies are full-time Commonwealth employees. The majority are permanent officers but there are some temporary staff. Exempt seasonal staff, such as cooks and field assistants, are casual employees hired for the duration of a party's field operations. One Bureau officer is normally attached to contract survey parties either full or part time, to supervise the contract and ensure it is carried out satisfactorily. for 3. Allowances paid to Commonwealth employees engaged on survey operations for the Bureau of Mineral Resources arc as prescribed differences are there between by the Public Service Board. 4. The Bureau of Mineral Resources survey parties are not necessarily continuing parties from year to year but are set up lo carry out a specific project or part of a long term project. They are staffed, as required, by Ihe Bureau's permanent and temporary staff and exempt seasonal field hands. At any particular time many of the Bureau's staff will be engaged in laboratory work or report preparation following completed field surveys. Accounting procedures do not allow for an accurate breakdown of expenditure for individual parties. However the costs would range from approximately $1,500 a month for a small magnetic survey party of say two men to $30,000 a month for a large land based seismic parly of about thirty men. The cost of a contract marine seismic, magnetic and gravity survey is of the order of $180,000 a month. The estimated costs of geological mapping parties are approximately $5,000 a month. University Scholarships (Question No. 890) Mr Bryant asked the Ministerf o r Education and Science, upon notice: 1. How many Commonwealth mature age university scholarships were awarded in each State in 1967 and 1968? 2. How many applicants were there in each State in 1967 and 1968? 3. How many of these scholarships will be for awarded in 19697 Mr Malcolm Fraser: The answers lo the honourable member's questions are as follows: 1 and 2. The annual quota of mature age scholarships in recent years has been set at 120. However, it became possible lo grant substantially more of these awards for 1967 when changes in the structure of secondary education in New South Wales and South Australia led to reduced competition for open entrance scholarships.

The first stage development providing 134,700 square feet was completed in 1958 and a second stage providing 150,000 square feet was completed in 1966. Proposals are currently being developed for further office construction on the Commonwealth Centre site but bave not yet reached the stage where it is possible to say just when the next stage of construction will be undertaken.
