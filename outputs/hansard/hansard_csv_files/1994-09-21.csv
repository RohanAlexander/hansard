The member for Cowan mentioned people Honourable members opposite have spoken like David Parker. But I have to say that about the great tradition of debate in our student politics has produced a lot of different universities. Our universities do have a great graduates. A lot of people have come out of tradition of debate. Our position is that that the school of student politics-people like the debate should be done by students for stumember for Higgins( Mr Costello); people dents in students' own time and with students' like Michael Yabsley, a former minister in the own money and not with taxpayers' money. It should be done with money that the stuattended preponderantly by the children of the dents give voluntarily to these bodies, not middle class. As we know, the universities with money that is compulsorily levied and will produce the high income earners of certainly not with money from the taxpayer to tomorrow. As we know, the universities are fill the breach if students themselves are not mechanisms which basically benefit the better prepared to give. off sections of society. I am not criticising The legislation of the Kennett government that; I am just stating it as a fact. What is this provides that, if students want to be part of government doing? It is robbing the poor to these bodies and if they want to support their pay the rich. It is taking money out of the activities, they are perfectly free to do so. hands of the generality of taxpayers to subsiWhat is going to happen under this governdise these silly indulgences of the children of ment's legislation is that the more they opt the rich.

Second Reading That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) is to introduce amendments to the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980, Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Act 1993, Farm Household Support Act 1992, Fisheries Administration Act 1991, Fisheries Management Act 1991, National Residue Survey Administration Act 1992, Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989, Wheat Marketing Act 1989, Wool Legislation (Repeals and Consequential Provisions) Act 1993, Wool Tax Act (No.3) 1964 and the Sugar Cane Levy Act 1987. In addition, there are several acts that require a minor amendment relating to the change of name of the 'Australian Agricultural Council' to the 'Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand'. The amendments to the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980 concern levy payers to the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation. Small winemakers often forward grapes to another, usually larger, winemaker who converts the material into wine under instructions for a fee. This is called toll processing. The wine is then returned to the smaller winemaker for him or her to market. The smaller winemaker owns the wine throughout the process. Under the current legislation, the larger winemaker is the producer and is liable for levy on the wine. This cost is usually added to the fee charged to the smaller winemaker. The smaller winemaker is therefore the effective, but not the official, levy payer and accordingly is not entitled to attend, debate or vote in the industry annual general meeting of the corporation. The amendments proposed will permit small winemakers who toll process to pay levy directly and to accept the rights and obligations of levy payers. By redefining the term 'producer' for the purpose of the wine grapes levy under the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991 and replacing the term 'winemaker' with 'producer' in part IVB of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980, which relates to annual general",137,Notices

266,Mr Beddall (Rankin,"Minister for Resources) (10.01 a.m.)-I move:1314 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 21 September 1994 meetings of the industry, small winemakers will become the official levy payers in their own right and will be able to represent their own interests to the corporation. The amendments to the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Act 1993 are for two main purposes. Firstly, they wiII ensure that ecologically sustainable development principles are written into the charter of the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation and that the membership of the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation board will include, in future, expertise in environmental and ecological matters. The Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation will therefore need to take ecologically sustainable development principles into account in its corporate planning and annual reporting and in determining priorities for allocation of research and development funds. This provision is now a feature of all research and development statutory authorities in my portfolio and is in accordance with government policy on ecologically sustainable development. Secondly, the amendments will provide for the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation to allocate funds received from patents or trademarks associated with non-research and development activities to activities other than research and development. The most significant of these non-research and development activities will be the revenue from the commercialisation of the wool mark. The amendments to the Farm Household Support Act 1992 implement a range of measures to improve the delivery of farm household support to farmers experiencing financial difficulties and to improve the administration of farm household support. Farmers applying for farm household support will have a longer period to provide proof that they are unable to access further commercial finance. If farm household support recipients are dissatisfied with a decision in relation to the extension of their grant periods, they will have improved mechanisms to seek a review of such decisions. This will complement the current mechanism of an appeal direct to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. These amendments also allow for improved administration of farm household support by providing a power for the Secretary to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy to delegate his or her powers under the act. To assist with management of the loan portfolio, and to ensure that all eligible recipients receive the benefit of the conversion of nine months of their farm household support payments to a grant, all farm household support recipients will be required to notify the Secretary to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy of certain changes in their circumstances. There is currently no provision in the Farm Household Support Act 1992 to prevent a person who has received a lump sum farm household support payment upon the sale of their farm from receiving farm household support at a later stage and again selling a farm and receiving another such payment. These amendments ensure that a person may receive only one such payment. This will ensure that the funds available for this purpose are directed equitably to those who are committed to re-establishing their families outside the farm sector. The report on the adequacy of fisheries legislation, presented by the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science, Technology, Transport, Communications and Infrastructure in December 1993, recommended a number of amendments to fisheries legislation. A majority of the recommended changes will improve the operation of the legislation and it is opportune to include the technical amendments in this bill. During the inquiry, the Australian Fisheries Wednesday, 21 September 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 1315 Management Authority identified some further technical amendments to improve the effectiveness of the legislation. These have also been included in this bill. Technical amendments are proposed to the Fisheries Administration Act 1991 to clarify the sources of funds available to the Australian Fisheries Management Authority. Another amendment recognises the amalgamation of the ministerial councils responsible for fisheries and forestry. The amalgamation results from the decision of the Council of Australian Governments to reduce the number of ministerial councils. The amendments that are proposed to the Fisheries Management Act 1991 will allow fishing permit holders greater nexibility in nominating the boat to be used with their permit. In addition, this bill clarifies the emergency powers available to the Australian Fisheries Management Authority to manage fisheries and some powers and obligations of fisheries officers. The Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 is amended to eliminate an anomaly in funding arrangements for the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation. The amended provision will ensure that research contributions from state licensed fishermen that are paid directly to the corporation or to consolidated revenue can be matched by the Commonwealth as originally intended. The amendments to the National Residue Survey Administration Act 1992, which were at the request of the cattle industry, will broaden the scope of the survey to encompass animal feeds and fibre products. This will enable industries to have a wider picture of likely contaminants in the food chain and lead to earlier intervention if contaminants are detected. This will be supplemented by the national residue survey having the facilities, at industry's instigation, to fund educational and extension programs from the national residue survey's account. This will lead to a more efficient survey and give industry a stronger role in ensuring that its commodity is, indeed, clean and green, and far more competitive on domestic and international markets. The main amendment to the Wheat Marketing Act 1989 extends the definition of 'grain'. The amendment is necessary following the transfer to the Australian Wheat Board of the seed testing facilities of the Victorian Department of Agriculture. The transfer is beneficial to, and is supported by, the grains and seeds industries. The new definition of 'grain' extends the coverage from the common cereal grains to horticultural, pasture and tree seeds, but only for the purposes of seed testing and seed certification. The Australian Wheat Board will not be able to use its marketing and trading powers for horticultural, pasture and tree seeds as it does not wish to undertake such activities. The Wheat Marketing Act 1989 is also being amended to allow for regulations to be made which will make it mandatory, rather than voluntary as at present, for wheat levy payers and collectors to provide certain information conceming the levy payment. The information is used for the management of the wheat industry fund and the allocation to individual levy payers of equity in the fund. An administrative amendment to the act will remove the 65-year age limit restriction on persons appointed to the board of the Australian Wheat Board. The following amendments included in this bill are of a procedural nature directed to improving the administration of the issues dealt with in those acts. The amendment to the Wool Legislation (Repeals and Consequential Provisions) Act 1993 corrects an error in a date. 1316 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 21 September 1994 The amendments to the Wool Tax Act (No.3) 1964 are of a procedural nature and remove all references to 'registered' from the title of wool dealers because such a reference is now obsolete. The amendment to the definition of sugar industry organisations contained in the Sugar Cane Levy Act 1987 is necessary following the consolidation of the sugar industry organisations currently listed within the act. The amendments to the Australian Meat and Livestock Industry Policy Council Act 1984, Biological Control Act 1984, Rural Industries Research (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 1985, Rural Industries Research Act 1985, Pig Industry Act 1986, Horticultural Policy Council Act 1987, Exotic Animal Disease Control Act 1989 and the Primary Industries Council Act 1991 result from the amalgamation of the former ministerial councils that dealt with agriculture, water resources, soil conservation and rural adjustment issues into the Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand. Of these pre-existing ministerial councils, the Australian Agriculture Council was referred to in these acts. It is necessary, therefore, that these acts be amended. I commend the bill to honourable members. WINE GRAPES LEVY AMENDMENT BILL 1994 The purpose of the Wine Grapes Levy Amendment Bill is to revise the arrangements for levies paid under the Wine Grapes Levy Act 1979 as amended, 'the act'. The government is making these changes at the request of the winemaking industry. The act imposes a levy on winemakers. The 'marketing component' of the levy funds the operations of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation. The corporation's statutory responsibilities include wine promotion, wine export control, the wine label integrity program, and determining Australia's geographical indications for use in describing and presenting wine. The 'research component' of the levy supports the operations of the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation. This corporation has the statutory responsibility to coordinate and fund research and development undertaken on behalf of the grape and wine industry. The government provides matching funding for research and development expenditure on a dollar for dollar basis. It is worthwhile noting that to date levy rates have been set and altered at the request of industry. I do not anticipate that this will change. At present, the legislation specifies a complex range of levy rates for the marketing component. This makes for an unwieldy process when changing the levy rates for the marketing component. The bill instead provides that the levy rates will be set out in regulations, as is the usual case for horticultural levies. This will facilitate execution of industry requests to change the levy and bring it into line with normal practice. At the same time a maximum amount-0.5 per cent of the gross value of production-is set for the marketing component. The act already provides that the levy rates for the research component be specified by regulation. The research levy rate is at present $1.90 per tonne and the legislation sets a limit of $2 per tonne for this levy. The maximum was set in the original act of 1979 and needs to be raised to $3 per tonne to enable the industry to increase its funding of industry research and development, if it so desires. The bill also ends the exemption that smaller winemakers, those processing less than 10 tonnes of product, had from paying levy. As non-payers, those winemakers have no representation in the decisions and operations of the corporation and its regulatory functions. Wednesday, 21 September 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 1317 It is intended that these winemakers will pay the small annual fee that constitutes the minimum levy rate, in return for which they will have the right to represent their interests at annual general meetings of the corporation and to receive the services and information that the corporation provides to its levy payers. Honourable members will be aware that the corporation's role is of considerable importance in the Australian wine industry'S drive to reach an annual export level of $1 billion by the year 2000. Many small producers will not be exporters, but the changes in the domestic market directly affect them. Such changes include the effects of expanded trade on grape supplies and Australia's commitment to end the use of European geographical indications in labelling our wine. It is important that the small winemakers not be left out of consideration in the strategic development of the Australian wine industry. It is important that their voice be heard. Their present ineligibility to be members of the AWBC prevents them from having the opportunity. The bill is intended to redress this situation. I commend this bill to honourable members. The purpose of the Primary Industries Levies and Charges (Wine Grapes) Collection Amendment Bill is to amend the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991, the 'collection act', to allow small wine producers to pay levy in their own right and represent themselves at annual general meetings of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation. Small winemakers often forward grapes to another, usually larger, winemaker who converts the material into wine under instructions for a fee, known as 'toll processing'. The wine is then returned to the smaller winemaker for him or her to market. The smaller winemaker owns the wine throughout the process. Under the current legislation, the larger winemaker is the 'producer' and is liable for levy on the wine. This cost is usually added to the fee charged to the smaller winemaker. The smaller winemaker is therefore the effective, but not the official, levy payer and accordingly is not entitled to attend, debate or vote in the industry annual general meeting of the corporation. The amendments proposed will permit small winemakers who toll process to pay levy directly and to accept the rights and obligations of levy payers. Although the legislation will allow small winemakers who have their wines toll processed to be recognised as the official levy payers, the government has put forward the related Wine Grapes Levy Amendment Bill 1994 to ensure that product from small winemakers is leviable product. By redefining 'producer' for the purposes of the wine grapes levy under the collection act, small winemakers will become the official levy payers in their own right and will be able to represent their own interests to the corporation. I commend the bill to honourable members.

So whilst there is only one motion before us, that the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) be read a second time, all four bills can be referred to in debate. Subsequently, when we have dispensed with the motion for the second reading of the primary industries bill, we wiII then move formally the motions for the second readings of the other bi\ls. Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1994 is being debated here today in cognate. The other three bills are the National Residue Survey Administration (Meat Chickens) Amendment BiII 1994, the Wine Grapes Levy Amendment Bill 1994 and the Primary Industries Levies and Charges (Wine Grapes) Collection Amendment BiII1994. The four pieces of legislation cover an amazing array of primary industries. It is perhaps a timely reminder to us all that primary industry in Australia covers a most diverse and dynamic spectrum of products, people and markets. It is most heartening to observe a common theme running through these four bills. It is the strong desire within those who work in and for our primary industries to help themselves. The coalition will be moving an amendment to the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment BiII (No.2), and I will deal with it at the conclusion of my contribution to this debate. The National Residue Survey Administration (Meat Chickens) Amendment Bill 1994 provides for the maximum rate of the national residue survey levy to increase from 0.02 per cent per head to 0.06 per cent per head. Almost all primary industries in Australia contribute to a national residue survey in order to ensure the food they produce is free of harmful residues. The survey for each particular industry is now fully funded by the industry itself. It is an industry helping itself by ensuring it contributes to, in this case, the national residue survey. In this case, the Chicken Meat Federation sought the increase in order to incorporate greater flexibility into the industry'S long-term planning. The coalition supports this legislation. It is perhaps timely to consider the value of the chicken meat industry. So often we consider the primary industries legislation and the impact that it has on Australia very much in the context of the big ticket items such as wheat, wool, beef and other agricultural products; often we do not give the due importance that we should to the chicken meat industry because it is a very large and expanding industry. As I said, as an industry it receives little publicity but it has quietly transformed itself from its backyard status-most recently as late as the 196Os-to a modem, dynamic industry which places second only to beef in the meat production stakes.

268,Mr Bruce Scott (Maranoa) (10.19 A.m.),"The Primary Industries and EnergyWednesday, 21 September 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 1319 consumed about three miIlion birds annually, or less than half a kilogram of chicken meat each over the course of a year. The situation is -ow radically different. In 1993-94, we collectively munched our way through 325 million birds. That is a surprising figure: 325 million chickens includes 650 million drumsticks which equates to a consumption level of 27.4 kilograms of chicken meat per capita. It is quite easy from those figures to see how our diet in Australia is changing. Of course, because of the product and because of the value of chicken meat, the chicken meat industry is certainly taking a very large chunk out of the traditional meat industry'S per capita consumption. They are certainly surprising figures. To put that in perspective, each Austmlian consumed the equivalent of two Kentucky Fried Chicken snack packs or three McChickens or perhaps 13 bowls of chicken noodle soup each week for a whole year. Suffice to say, we Australians like our chicken. Not only do we enjoy the taste and health benefits of chicken meat; we gain substantially from the economic benefits of the industry. The chicken meat industry directly employs about 16,000 people and about 45,000 people are indirectly involved. The current value of sales at a retail level is approaching $1.7 billion. I think it is timely to point out that because this is an intensive animal feeding industry it is going to be affected by the drought. The cost of grain in Australia has been brought about and may be a direct result of the raging drought that we have seen across the eastern states of Australia over the last four years. Grain prices for the chicken meat industry are going to rise and they have already risen. That is going to place an increasing burden on the viability of the chicken meat industry. In tum, those costs have either got to be absorbed by the industry or passed on to the consumer. If they pass directly on to the consumer, we are going to see an inflationary impact on the Australian nation. This drought has wider ramifications than the plight of those who are directly involved who we see on a day-to-day basis in the rural electorates of Australia. It will impact on the national economy; it will impact on the CPI-the consumer price index, the cost of living in Australia. That is a direct result of the drought. That is why we do need to see from the government today a national response to this great tragedy that is out there in rural Australia. It does deserve, albeit too late for many, a national response. That national response must cover the impact that this drought is having on communities, families and industries because it is a national disaster. There is enormous potential for export development but the industry in Australia remains hamstrung by the high cost of capital, the high cost of labour and other inputs, and the subsidies provided to the chicken meat industry in competing countries. The United States and the European Union are particularly aggressive protectors of their domestic chicken meat industries. Thailand has rapidly assumed a prominent position amongst the world's chicken meat exporters by relying on tax incentives to lure foreign investment, and cheap labour, to build a most efficient industry in that country. The possible relaxation of Australian quarantine regulations relating to imported chicken meat is of great concern to the domestic industry. This concern is twofold. Naturally, there is concern for the impact on local producers, but just as important is the concern for the possible introduction of the world's most feared disease in the poultry industry, the Newcastle virus. I applaud the chicken meat industry for the high standards it supports and upholds-in particular, with regard to its approach to hygiene, disease eradication and quality control. I sincerely hope that the industry'S commitment to development and innovation is matched by 1320 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 21 September 1994 a similar level of commitment from the federal government to eliminate factors which impede the industry's growth, whilst maintaining secure quarantine restrictions. We all benefit from agricultural products in Australia which are clean and green and are the envy of many other countries in the world. The Wine Grapes Levy Amendment Bill 1994, the Primary Industries Levies and Charges (Wine Grapes) Collection Amendment Bill 1994 end the current levy exemption for wine producers producing less than 10 tonnes of fresh grapes, place a maximum limit on the amount of levy that is used to support marketing, and increase the limit on the research and development component. A proportion of the money raised through the wine grapes levy finances the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation. This body is responsible for wine promotion, administration of the wine label integrity program, export control and determining Australia's geographical indications for use in describing and presenting wine. The remainder funds the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation. Funding spent on research is matched by the government on a dollar for dollar basis. I understand that both the Australian Wine Makers Forum and the Independent Winemakers, both of which represent small winemakers, support the alteration proposed by this legislation. The coalition will be supporting the legislation. The Australian wine industry continues to be a primary industry of great success. As the reputation of our wine spreads throughout the world, our export trade continues to strengthen. In 1994-95, it is estimated we will export 162 million litres of wine. This amounts to an increase of almost 400 per cent since 1989-90. In value terms, the exports are expected to come close to $500 million. One of the most exciting developments in the wine industry is the agreement reached between Australia and the European Community, which was negotiated late in 1992 and signed in January this year. This agreement will result in the improved access of Australian wine to European markets and eliminate technical trade barriers, in return for the phasing out of the use of European geographical names as names for Australian wine. The search for new names to replace beaujolais, hock, madeira, chianti and, eventually, champagne, chablis, moselle and many others will be a challenge for Australian winemakers. It does, however, provide an enormous opportunity for Australian wines to further establish their particular market niche with distinctive and unique names. It will be a formidable task to educate the wine drinkers of the world to accept the new names. I do not underestimate that task, because people have for so long associated the variety of a wine with a region, and it is going to be extremely difficult and a great challenge, obviously, to the wine industry to develop new names which will be identifiable the world over. However, for an industry which has displayed enormous marketing and product development prowess, I feel that it is a challenge to which the wine industry is certainly capable of rising. I recently noticed an Australian wine selling under the name of 'Antarctic White'. That seemed to me to be an excellent example of a name which provides a clear impression of the wine's style whilst also establishing the wine's geographic origin. example of the wine industry's foresight and vision. I have no doubt that the industry will achieve its $1 billion annual exports target set for the year 2000. It is a wonderful example to us all to see that an industry out there has a target which it wants to achieve; it has a plan.",144,Representatives Main Committee

270,Mr Bruce Scott,"I am getting to my electorate very shortly. This agreement is a greatWednesday, 21 September 1994 MAIN COMMITIEE 1321 We can only wish the wine industry well, and let us hope that it does reach that target before the year 2000. It is very important that we consider the impact the drought is having on our Australian wine industry. In my electorate, in the granite belt, we have got an emerging wine industry. It has been there for a long time, but it is expanding. One of the limiting factors to the expansion of that wine industry is water. It is time that this nation looked more seriously at a national water strategy. We so often find that our agricultural potential is limited by the impact of drought. Whilst we look at the social issues, I do not think we have looked fully at trying to drought proof Australia through the implementation of a national water strategy. That is a debate that deserves the attention of all Australians. I will now address the final piece of legislation which we are considering in this cognate debate. The Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1994 covers a range of small changes to various primary industry acts. I wiII confine my comments this morning to the amendments proposed to the Farm Household Support Act 1992. This act governs the operation of the farm household support scheme, designed to provide assistance to farmers who are unable to meet day-to-day living expenses and who cannot access commercial finance. The scheme also provides a financial incentive for farmers wishing to leave the industry. To qualify for farm household support, the applicant must be an Australian farmer between 16 years of age and the pension age, with a certificate of inability to obtain finance. The assistance is provided for a period of nine months. If during that time the farmer leaves the farm, the assistance becomes a grant. If the farmer remains in the industry, the assistance must be repaid at commercial interest rates. Those who leave the industry within the nine-month period will receive the balance payable for the period as a lump sum, in addition to their re-establishment grant of $45,000. This bill makes a small but important change to the administrative arrangements for farm household support. It extends, from 14 to 30 days, the time allowed for farm household support applicants to obtain a certificate of inability to access finance. A great number of farmers have experienced difficulty in obtaining a certificate within 14 days, owing largely to the obvious problems they face in physically accessing financial institutions. I am pleased that the government has acknowledged this difficulty and acted in the manner that it has in this bill. Although the farm household support scheme is, in theory, a useful mode of assistance to farmers who face insurmountable financial difficulties, its practical application has proved to be thwarted by inconsistencies and anomalies. For example, the re-establishment payments are limited to one per farm, regardless of the number of people or families who work on that farm. In the event of two families running one farm in cooperation, only one can receive the re-establishment grant. One wonders what happens to the other family. It also strikes me as particularly counterproductive for farm household support to be converted to a loan for those who do not \eave farming. The assistance is provided, after alI, for those who cannot obtain commercial finance. It seems perfectly obvious that the last thing these people need is another loan. It is also important to remember that leaving farming is not such an easy task at the moment. Many producers right through the drought areas of Australia who make a decision to leave find it impossible to sell and liquidate their farm in order to move off that land within nine 1322 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 21 September 1994 months. They have assets which may have a paper value but have no resale value in the current circumstances. So the legislation is quite ludicrous in its application. Some drought-ravaged farmers literally cannot give their farms away. So despite their best efforts farmers will still find themselves unable to access further commercial finance and incurring another debt because they go over the nine-month limit for moving off their land. Their inability to access further finance is the reason they went onto farm household support in the first place but once they access farm household support they have their feet on the sticky paper and cannot get them off. Unable to access finance, they are caught in a trap, all of which demonstrates the government's insensitive treatment of farmers around Australia, particularly in these drought ravaged times. It is not surprising then that only 392 farmers are currently accessing farm household support. The government itself estimated that at least 1,200 would access this support. Government members were congratulating themselves because they were going to be giving household support to farmers in these very difficult times, but the farmers know that once they access that farm household support it is a one-way ticket off the farm and that if they do not go they have incurred another loan, which will incur commercial rates of interest after nine months. It is the policy of the coalition to allow farm household support to be provided as a grant for 12 months, irrespective of whether the farmer chooses to leave the industry. This clearly recognises the need to provide assistance to meet day-to-day needs without creating additional debts. I will be moving an amendment on behalf of the coalition which encourages the government to adopt our strategy for administering farm household support. I would hope that the government will accept our amendment. Any of those government members who have been out to the drought areas and have been in touch with the farmers, the farm industry leaders and church organisations such as Lifeline and the Salvation Army will know that farm household support as it applies under government legislation is failing. It is all very well to decide at a round table conference to give $25 million to ANL and to offer the people of Sydney $150 million overnight to remove the Cahill Expressway, but it is not good enough to support farm households with income support for 12 months without strings attached. This callous approach of the government must be changed. I hope the opposition's amendment will be accepted. The amendment also calls on the government to modify the assets test applied to other forms of assistance. There is no doubt that the assets tests applied to benefits such as jobsearch, family payment and Austudy are denying farmers access to assistance to which they and their families are clearly entitled. I sincerely hope that the government addresses this problem in the course of its cabinet deliberations today. The true tragedy is that whatever rabbit the Prime Minister( Mr Keating) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) are able to pull from the hat today, it will simply be too late for many farmers. It will certainly be too late for many students who have already been forced to interrupt their study program because their parents can no longer continue to keep them living away from home whilst they gain access to tertiary studies. It will be too late for those skilled and experienced farmers who have already left the industry. It will also be too late for the marriages and relationships which have endured unbearable Wednesday, 21 September 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 1323 strain over the past two, three and four years. The government must bear the fun brunt of the blame for these consequences, most of which are due entirely to its inaction. The Prime Minister made a statement that drought in this country is a normal occurrence and a part of rural life. I hope that, when he went to Central Queensland and the Darling Downs, what he saw there was not a normal part of rural life. The government's silence on this issue still indicates to the opposition that it does not understand the plight of those in rural Australia. We are not only talking about those on the land. We are also talking about the small businesses in the country towns and the workers who work for those small businesses. In the country town of Augathella the other day, a small business person rang me and said that he had just shut his small business and put off his worker because he could not continue running his business in that country town. He also said that, in the last four months, seven families had just walked out of their homes and left the town. They could not sell their house. They could not get a job in the area. They have just walked out. The ramifications of this drought go far beyond the farm gate. They are well into the small business sector of the nation, particularly in these drought areas. It is certainly impacting on many families, whether they own a small business or whether they have got a job working for someone in these rural drought areas. I think the full impact of this drought and the drift of population from rural areas will be measured for many years to come. All Australians are waiting to hear what the Prime Minister and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy say today in the package for rural families affected by drought. The package has to extend to assistance to small business. It has got to extend into the area of welfare and it has got to extend into the farmer's financial problems. It has to address those problems. It really took a television personality and Australia wide support for a farmhand appeal before we saw a government willing to move and to visit the drought areas of this nation. I think it is a great tragedy that a government and a Prime Minister could be so out of touch that it took a television personality and the Australian people's contribution to that farmhand appeal to drag in the Prime Minister, albeit in a damage control mode, to see first hand what was happening to families, small businesses and farmers in drought ravaged Australia. Whilst the coalition will not be denying this bi11 a second reading, I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the Main Committee, recognising the needs of individuals and families living in rural and regional Australia who face the ravages of severe drought, calls on the Government to make farm household support a grant for up to 12 months and to modify the assets test for other forms of assistance"". I hope the government will accept that amendment. If it does not, and if it does not address those issues in the package today, the opposition wi11 be pursuing the government relentlessly on this issue.

272,Mr Forrest,"I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.1324 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 21 September 1994 registered by the member for Maranoa. I do not believe his suggestion is the way to handle this problem, although I recognise that there are problems associated with the farm household support scheme. It should be noted that this was an attempt to provide for those families who need to be assisted to leave a primary industry. We do not do it in any other industrial sector. The speech by the honourable member for Maranoa, which we all suffered in silence, and the MPI in the House of Representatives yesterday are desperate attempts by those in the National Party to play catch-up. Once again, they have lost the initiative and they have dealt themselves out of the main game. I want to make some comments about the member for Maranoa and, to an extent, some media misrepresentation of comments by the Prime Minister( Mr Keating) in my electorate on 19 July in relation to drought. The Prime Minister has not changed his position. In response to a question on the drought, he said that drought is a continuing factor in this nation. I have spoken to primary producers in central and western Queensland about seasons, and they are the first to admit that this has been a major problem over 60 years on the one land-holding, that often properties are more in drought than out of it, and that across the country at some point in time, and even in the same regions, drought declarations happen very frequently. The Prime Minister's view is that this government will be about bringing in a systemic set of provisions to deal with a very complex issue in our agricultural sector. I think it would be useful to comment on the sort of policy on the run that the National Party is into. We should not look to the Queensland Country Life, which is the bible of most rural producers. It is not surprising to see that the constituency of the National Farmers Federation is sometimes behind its leaders. This was brought home to me during the Prime Minister's tour to central Queensland with representatives from the National Farmers Federation, the Queensland Grains Council and the United Graziers Association. We should not be surprised that peak leaders of organisations are often further advanced in their views because they have the bigger picture. Let me refer, Mr Deputy Speaker, to an article by the Australian's rural writer, Tim Stevens, on 9 September. I happened to be reading this while I was on a flight with the Attorney General( Mr Lavarch) out of Townsville to Charters Towers and to Clermont to visit droughted properties and to talk with local government and rural producers in central western Queensland. The aim of that visit was to further inform other cabinet members on the issues of the drought. It is simply not the case that this government is not interested or sensitive to drought issues. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Bob Collins, has been into my electorate-and, indeed, into the member for Maranoa's electorate-at least twice this year. Mr Bruce Scott-Twice with no action. when the cabinet brings down the results of its deliberations today. But let us see what a real critique of National Party policy on drought is all about. I quote from Tim Stevens's article, which I had the pleasure to show to the Attorney-General as we flew out of Townsville: It is not often that a conservative politician bearing $90 million in gifts is shown the door by farm leaders. Yet this was the reaction from Coalition backbenchers and the National Farmers Federation to the release of the Opposition's drought policy last week. The policy's key feature, a $90 million scheme to pay for fodder for livestock in ""severe"" drought areas, was interpreted as a blatant reversion by the Liberal and National parties to the days of unfunded promises, when policies were based overwhelmingly on populist agrarian notions rather than sounder economic rationales.",149,Represent Atives Main Committee
273,Ms Henzell,"That is not the case, and the proof of the pudding will be in the eatingWednesday, 21 September 1994 MAIN COMMITIEE 1325 I might add that when the Prime Minister visited and talked with farming families near Dingo he made the point that he was not going to be into cheap gestures and feel-good policies. What this government is about is sound, economically based policies that will provide significant assistance to farming families and to the agricultural sector. Why was this critique made? It was apparently decided on 22 August by a shadow cabinet meeting that drought was obviously going to be a key issue. I quote: It was decided that a comprehensive response was needed of the Government's policies and this was interpreted by John Anderson, the Coalition's primary industries spokesman, as a desire to have a detailed policy and off he went to find one. What the primary industries spokesman came up with was apparently the Fightback package plus this fodder subsidy scheme, which is really revisiting the Fraser government's 1982 scheme. Fodder subsidies have been criticised for the following reasons, and I once again quote Mr Stevens: They provide a disincentive for producers to prepare for drought, which includes the making and storing of hay. They tend to jolt demand, sending fodder prices through the roof. Fodder suppliers and users have rorted the system. I will go on quoting Mr Stevens: Curiously, Anderson mentioned his policies to no one. Despite the stated desire of Opposition Leader Alexander Downer to involve all of the Liberal and National party political processes in decision-making, The Australian has been unable to speak to anyone whose views were sought on drought issues prior to the announcement. The National Farmers Federation was not consulted. The shadow minister did not bother to go on and consult the peak organisation, and in public and in private-although not quoted in the Queensland Country Life-the peak farming bodies of this country were scathing in their criticism. I further quote Mr Stevens: The chairman of the Coalition parliamentary primary industries committee, Neil Andrewwho I see is in the Main Committee room todayfirst knew of the policy on the morning of its release. Embarrassingly, Andrew was later asked to sit next to Anderson during the press conference. Little time was spent debating the policy in the shadow Cabinet of August 29, despite the potential fiscal size of the package, although one proposal from Anderson for concessional loans-to help reconstruct the sector after the drought ends-was sent to a special shadow Cabinet sub-committee. The rest was ticked and sent to a joint meeting of the Liberal National parties the next day, before being released just over one week after shadow Cabinet first asked for a policy. Apparently, this is the way the Coalition's policy making process works these days. There were no offsets sought by shadow Cabinet to counterbalance the increased expenditure. They are all care and no responsibility in the opposition. Mr Stevens continues: The Nationals, it appears on the surface, have reverted to the good old days of pork barrelling and unfunded campaign promises, with the blessing of the Liberals. This, Mr Deputy Speaker, is the sorry state of opposition policy building. This is the policy you have when you try to have a policy.

274,Ms Henzell,"We are going to have an excellent policy. The Prime Minister's tour was1326 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 21 September 1994 representatives in this parliament than the National Party does, and we have a vested interest in making sure that the concerns of the rural and agricultural sector of this country are taken into account. But it will not be done by feel-good throwing money at the problem. It will be done by a systematic approach, to provide effective changes to the rural adjustment scheme and effective responses to the obvious needs and pressures on farm families. One of the factors that I have certainly put forward, apart from looking at an effective way to make sure that the children of farming families are able to access assistance with their schooling, is an issue that has not made the headlines but was put to us at a property south of Charters Towers. It is that we are not talking about only the education of older children, who will need to go away to boarding school to get an education. It is vital that those children do get that education, because it is very clear that many of those children will choose not to return to family properties. They will choose to go into other sectors of the economy. Like all other children in this country, they need to have access to educational opportunities, in order to either choose to go into other sectors or become effective farm managers. Gone are the days when people could go to year 10 and then just go back and learn the job from their parents. The farm sector, like every other industrial sector, has to change and become much more effective in terms of targeting niche markets and so on. It is now a highly skilled operation. But I want to make comment on those children who are being educated at home. The story I want to tell the members attending the Main Committee this morning is one of a young mother who came to the meeting with a lO-week-old baby, the fourth of her children; she had three other children at home. She was lucky enough to have her mother staying with her prior to the birth of this baby, and subsequent to its birth. This young mother is teaching the sevenyear-old at home. Nowadays, that is a full day's occupation. It is not just a matter of setting up some work and going away to do the housework; you are in the schoolroom all day. The second child has been classified as a gifted child, and will, therefore, need particular assistance if its abilities are going to be really provided for. The third child is a toddler. Now, a mother with a lO-week-old baby should be, basically, doing what she can in the house and then feeding that baby and looking after it. At the point in time when this mother came to this meeting with the Attorney-General and myself, her husband had cattle away on agistment, so the only support person she had to look after herself and her four children was her mother. Had her mother not been available, I do not know who would have washed the nappies. I have drawn to the attention of the Prime Minister and other members of the cabinet that we must make sure we are providing for support so that women in this kind of predicament can access assistance. Obviously, it is difficult for families with young children when they drive into town-which may be a twoor three-hour drive-to go to the doctor, just to arrange for occasional child care. At least in Charters Towers there are some doctors who bulk-bill. In many cases in country Queensland, and certainly in Rockhampton, there are almost no doctors who bulk-bill, causing further financial pressure on these families. I can assure members opposite that these family concerns are being addressed, and certainly were addressed by the Prime Minister. As I said yesterday in the caucus meeting, it was very interesting that what was said on the national media was very true during our visit to Timbaroo at Dingo. Farming families were really quite shocked by the fact that, in meeting the Prime Minister, they had to wrestle with their preconceptions about the sort of person he was. Of course, their preconceptions had been based on television media presentations of the Prime Minister, and articles in magazines such as the Queensland Country Life. What they found Wednesday, 21 September 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 1327 was a warm, caring, concerned person who spoke with feeling and was able to yarn on their level. That has been a very important experience for that group of people. I assure you that the Prime Minister is not someone who flourishes a bit of rhetoric just to provide a bit of popular grandstanding. The key point he made at that meeting was: just as we made a commitment not to leave the unemployed behind, we will not leave country people behind. We are aware of the concerns and we will respond to those concerns. We do not need the National Party to bleat here today and to play catch-up to tell this government what is required to provide for people through this drought. One of the issues that I have raised with the Prime Minister is that, as we look at the crisis and the tragedy that is happening to people in this drought, we will certainly have to look at issues about land care and environmental degradation. I will just quote from the minister's second reading speech. In connection with the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Act 1993, he stated: Firstly they wiJI ensure that ecologically sustainable development principles are written into the charter of the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation and that the membership of the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation will include, in future, expertise in environmental and ecological matters. This is going to be an issue that has certainly been brought into stark relief by the drought. What we see, following the extension of rural and agricultural pursuits into marginal country, particularly across northern Queensland, is that where we have drought conditions we have a major long-term impact on the environmental status of the land. An example would have been when Capella, which has had drought for six to eight seasons, got a deluge of rainseven inches in 24 hours. This is pretty typical; it is up the road from Emerald. In a good season, it is one of the most beautiful areas of this country. If we have a droughted area with extensive clearing and then there is a deluge of rain, we have a massive erosion problem. This is a factor that will have to be addressed and will be addressed by this government. We cannot simply allow extension of dry land farming into marginal areas if we expect to keep this country together, ecologically speaking. I will quote from an article by Wallace Brown in the Sunday Mail on 4 September. He was being critical that there was not an effective drought policy. He said: ... the latest survey by the National Farmers' Federation and the Australian Conservation Foundation, being joint sponsors of the Landcare program, shows increasing desertification due to clearing of trees and other native vegetation. It is alarming to read that 5000 square km of native vegetation is still being cleared each year in Australia, and that this is an amount comparable to the area cleared in the Amazon Basin, which environmentalists world-wide condemn. We have to face the fact that we have to get back to restoring this country to ecologically sustainable development. Now, belatedly I believe, farming organisations and the National Farmers Federation have come on board on this. This is a very important issue in the government's drought policy. It is not going to be more dams, more water. I have had well meaning and very caring people who want to train water into rural sectors. It is good to see, as unfortunate as it is, that at this time of drought there are very few cattle in the middle of my electorate because the land simply cannot sustain those cattle. We have to recognise that. Yes, indeed, we have to look after breeding stock, but we will not do it by the ill-thought out, ill-considered policies with which the National Party is desperately trying 1328 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 21 September 1994 to hold on to its constituency. I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, at the end of the day, the Labor government is increasingly going to take on board that rural constituency. In fact, one of the farmers at the Dingo meeting said to the Prime Minister that he may well be the Prime Minister who saves the bush. As the Prime Minister said in response, that is a very big ask but it will be this government which will put forward very positive policies that will be to the long-term benefit of the rural sector and ecologically sustainable development in this country. to be a decent person but it saddens me that she would stoop to such cheap politics as the contribution we have just heard from her. In fact, it has taken some constraint on my part to listen to her in silence. I think the member for Capricornia should go out and ask the people on the ground what they think of the initiative we are calling for. Go and ask the constituents of the member for Maranoa( Mr Bruce Scott). Go and ask the real people. If the member for Capricornia is so fond of quoting newspaper articles, let me quote to her this one from the Queensland Country Life. This is a newspaper from her own state. She should stay and hear this contribution. It says: A fodder subsidy for drought stricken graziers is one of the most positive and effective forms of assistance. Federal Primary Industries Minister, Bob Collins, is wrong to dismiss it out of hand because it would not work. This was on 8 September. It also states: So why is our national Government so out of step with the opinions of its citizens, choosing instead to fiddle while rural Australia withers? That is by the editor of the Queensland Country Life. If the member for Capricornia is genuine in her sentiments that the Labor Party is going to meet the needs of rural Australia, it ought to be a lot more in touch with what the people there think of its government. People are asking: why can decisions be made, on the run and outside cabinet, that can contribute $150 million to a so-called eyesore in Sydney? This decision was made on the run, outside the executive, by the Prime Minister( Mr Keating). How can sweetheart deals outside cabinet and outside the parliament be made on the run with the Maritime Union of Australia? How can those decisions be made on the run? There are desperate primary producers in the member for Maranoa's electorate. Sadly, the cancerous drought is spreading all the way through New South Wales. Now even in my own electorate of Mallee there will be grain growers who will not harvest wheat or grain of any sort this year because the drought is extending across Australia. They are asking: why do we have to wait three years for decent consideration? This drought has not suddenly arrived. These are the sorts of questions the constituency is asking. It is a pity the member for Capricornia has not stayed. I would suggest that she should get out there and ask the people what they think of the initiatives we announced. Rural Australia is not outer suburbia. Rural Australia is the people out there producing the wealth in the sparsely populated areas of Australia. I think the Labor Party has got a lot of work to do if it thinks it can sustain the confidence of rural Australia. I am not talking about urban suburbs. We are talking about rural Australia where there are 130,000 people in 70-odd thousand square kilometres that are sparsely populated but produce the nation's wealth. They want to know why the government",151,Representatives Main Committee
275,Mr Forrest (Mallee) (11.05 A.m.),"I know the member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell)Wednesday, 21 September 1994 MAIN COMMITIEE 1329 can be so hypocritical in its efforts to help its union mates and to preserve the aesthetics for the Prime Minister when they have to wait for decent consideration. They have been earning this nation's wealth for years-paying for the excessive income we have for imported goods-and they are asking for better consideration and a better deal. I would have expected a better contribution from the member for Capricornia. I will leave it to other members from our side who are present to talk more about the initiatives in our policy other than the fodder subsidy. We talk about reinstalling drought in the national disasters relief arrangements. For the Prime Minister to say that primary producers are expected to prepare for four years of drought indicates how out of touch he is. He has got a long way to go if he is going to save the bush, as the member for Maranoa has said. I will get back to the legislation that is before this Committee, and the motion that the member for Maranoa has put before it. It is true that the majority of the bills that we are considering, particularly those that relate to levies, have general industry support. For someone in a very strong horticultural producing electorate, and especially in regard to wineMr Bruce Scott-Great wine. who was in my electorate for two days last week. We did enjoy the fruit of the vine. The sad contrast was that, with the advantages and asset of the Murray River as an irrigation source, 50 kilometres to the south, we will see grain growers feeding their wheat to their sheep. This is the sad plight of the extension of this drought. I do not think that the Prime Minister-nor the members present, obviously, from the contribution we have just heard-has yet appreciated how insidiously the drought is extending right across Australia. In Swan Hill, my home city, we have a large agricultural machinery producer, producing disc ploughs and marketing right across Australia, to Western Australia, Queensland and indeed, recently, even expanding into exporting. Sadly, a fortnight ago, the firm had to put off five young people, including one apprentice, because of the impact of the drought. That is the extent of the national disaster. It is not just a problem for the Queenslanders. We have heard the stories from members representing those areas-but the drought does extend. There are now five families in Swan Hill upon which the drought has had a direct impact. Their income will be reduced to the extent that they will not be spending in Swan Hill, and so other businesses are impacted by the effects of the drought. It is a national disaster-we have said clearly that this should be recognised. Irrigation from the Murray River, as I have said, is one of the saving resources of an electorate like mine, which is so dependent on the elements. The member for Maranoa has spoken about a number of my industries. He has referred to chickens, and I would much rather focus on horticulture. No-one was more disappointed than me, when I arrived here as a new member of parliament, to listen to the government's August budget in 1993, and hear its proposals to tax the wine industry. The member for Maranoa has already spoken in glowing terms about the expansion that this industry is providing in wealth earning and job creation. The objective of this industry is, by the turn of the century, to triple its export development, which is the billion dollar program that the member for Maranoa has mentioned to the Committee. To see a government picking a winner here, and then choosing to tax it with a WST, instead of a GST-the wholesale sales tax on wine-disappoints me. This is a government that purports to want to initiate regional development and to have an interest in rural Australia.",154,Representatives Main Committee
276,Mr Forrest,"Great wine from the Mallee areas. Thank you to the member for Maranoa,1330 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 21 September 1994 Mr Bruce Scott-They said there would be no new taxes. taxes, and yet one of the first industries it seeks to tax with a broad base consumption tax-the very tax that it lied about to the electorate-is an industry that is so significant in my electorate. Those people out there will be a long time forgetting that lie. As I have said earlier, this government has got a long way to go before it can convince the people of my constituency that it is the government that can save the bush. In my home town of Red Cliffs, Lindemans wines some 20-odd years ago invested substantial amounts in infrastructure and can now boast one of the largest wineries in the southern hemisphere. Subsequent owners of that winery have continued to invest, because they see real opportunities in meeting the targets in the expansion of the wine industry generally. The employment base that that winery now provides to a small community like Red Cliffs, a small rural town which has a population of around about 1,500, is worth millions of dollars to that community. This is an example of real regional development in the most successful terms. I think the government needs to recognise this and encourage enterprises at every opportunity. That is real regional development, that is development that creates jobs. The prospect of a prosperous future in wine grape production gives the community some sense of optimism for the future. I therefore suggest to the government, and those of its members that are present here today, that on all occasions it should work very carefully, through its taxation policies, to ensure that bright, new, expansive industries are encouraged in every way. I would like to comment further on the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2). I know that other speakers following will probably do the subject more justice than I can, and the member for Maranoa has already commented on it, but I would like give my observations on how the farm household support scheme is not working. I continue to focus on horticulture. Around the Sunraysia region of my electorate, I have got two principal industries, citrus and dried vine fruit. Both these industries have been asked to bear the pain of being sacrificed on the great altar of free trade. I was annoyed last week, when there were negotiations in respect of the Australian National Line, to hear the union movement arguing its case, saying that its people could not be expected to compete with Third World labour rates. I feel that it is gross hypocrisy that the government has listened to this argument and invested substantial amounts of taxpayers' funds to preserve jobs in that industry. Yet my two industries, worth probably $200 to $250 million dollars per annum just in my electorate, are being asked to compete with cheap labour from Turkey in regard to dried vine fruit and extremely cheap labour and the benefits of critical mass out of Brazil in respect of citrus. I ask the government how it can tolerate this style of hypocrisy. Many of my constituents would say that, true, the ultimate goal must be world free trade and a level playing field and that we are going to have a considerable amount of pain in getting there. They would not mind bearing some of this pain, provided it is shared by all Australians. When an announcement is made outside the cabinet and outside the parliament in regard to the Australian National Line, they just see gross hypocrisy, given that for years now they have been asked to bear considerable pain, go without and even have to suffer the indignity of deciding which of their children will be able to pursue tertiary education. That is a terrible decision for parents to have to make.",155,Representatives Main Commitiee
277,Mr Forrest,"A government that went to an electorate and said there would be no newWednesday, 21 September 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 1331 Many of them, particularly in dried vine fruit, elected to take the option in regard to farm household support. Sadly, the situation is that, whilst they were genuine initially in their efforts to discharge their obligation in respect of the ownership of their property, the market is such that there are probably something like 1,000 dried vine fruit properties on the market in the Sunraysia district and properties just do not sell. We have now got a significant number of people who have taken farm household support, gone beyond their nine months, cannot sell their properties and now have to sustain what is being transferred as a commercial loan at commercial interest rates, rates well in excess of 10 per cent. This is an added financial burden on their ability to cope or even to consider how they can restructure and be part of a new industry and to take the opportunities that wine grapes are providing for them. In view of their significant debt as well as this additional debt to the rural finance corporation, I am very concerned about their ability to meet this exciting new initiative in wine grapes, so I put to the government that it should give greater consideration to the wealth producers of my electorate as well as consider the national disaster that this drought represents. I also suggest that when it makes its announcements it should defend itself with respect to the time it has taken to announce drought policy to meet the needs of hurting people, particularly Queenslanders and people from New South Wales, because those people can see hypocrisy in terms of the way the government assists its friends. I also remind members of the government of a number of problems with regard to salinity control and the sustaining of water reserves in the Murray-Darling Basin. In fact, this summer there is no doubt that the Darling River will have a blue-green algal burst that will see the last one in 1992 fade into insignificance. My horticulturalists are being asked to contribute to salinity mitigation from a variety of sources, but to do so while their financial circumstances are so fragile is an additional burden they cannot sustain. Some are being asked to contribute to modifications to their supply system where open channels are being converted to pipelines, which often requires a capital cost contribution. Others are being asked to make contributions through local government levies through their municipal rates. I put it to the government that the ability of the horticulturalists to meet these contributions has been substantially eroded by years of neglect and that it is time that the Minister for Resources, the honourable member for Rankin( Mr Beddall), and the government considered the dried vine fruit growers and citrus growers in my electorate. This Primary Industries Levies and Charges (Wine Grapes) Collection Amendment Bill is primarily designed to meet the needs of the drought stricken farmers but it also provides a basis on which we can meet the urgent needs of primary industry in general. We are talking about industries that are essential to the small communities they surround. Every retailer in a community where primary commodities are not doing well is also not doing well so we are speaking on behalf of small business across rural Australia as well as the primary producers themselves. I commend the amendment to the Committee. House, I would hope, in supporting the bills that are before the Main Committee this morning.

Let me sayMr L1oyd-A point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. That has actually been coalition policy since 1990. of them. The bills that have been introduced by the government and supported, I thought, by the opposition do allow some finetuning to various bills and bring them up to date with requirements of primary industries. The bills cover seemingly small amendments to achieve that finetuning in various areas. Some of them impact in my electorate; many of them do not. Nevertheless, as one of the many country Labor members of the government I appreciate their impact right across Australia. The Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991 has been slightly amended. I would like to add my words of support for this amendment. It changes the definition of 'winemaker' to ·producer'. It changes the words in the act from 'winemaker' to 'producer' and that small redefinition within the act does bring in many of the players in the industry who were previously barred from having a say. They can now have a say in the direction of that industry. The wine industry itself has been the subject of much debate, particularly in the last 18 months in regard to some of the changes that the government has proposed at different times. It is recognised as a very strong, vigorous industry of great benefit to Australia, particularly to the various electorates that honourable members on both sides of this chamber represent. No doubt the amount of money that comes in from export earnings through value adding and sales overseas has been a great boon to the economy of Australia. It is most important that the changes we have put in place ensure that that industry continues its vigorous growth into the future. The predictions of sales, both overseas and domestic, indicate that the industry is quite capable of achieving and maintaining its growth. The investment within the industry indicates that there are plenty of other people out there who have an opinion on where the industry can go. It is the same opinion that I have and my colleagues on both sides of the house no doubt share. Whilst my electorate does not have any of the wine grapes and brandy industries contained within it, grapes are grown not far away in the state of Queensland. Probably not too many people go into bat for that industry up there in the sunny hills of the Stanthorpe area. A couple of wineries that I am familiar with have certainly achieved great advancements in both their quality and their production techniques. Some of them have actually achieved national recognition albeit only very small. Nevertheless, through its educative and technical expertise, the industry is now exporting quite strongly offshore. We tend to think that Australia is a little bit too free and easy with its technical expertise in the sense that we are quite ready to share our expertise with overseas producers so that they become our competitors in some way. However, we seem to be holding our own with the quality and the value for quality wines that we are exporting.

282,Mr Newell,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for your deliberations and for the accuracyWednesday, 21 September 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 1333 available to rural industries and which, no doubt, will be further expanded in the announcements that I would expect to come from the government today. I am confident that some of the changes that are mooted wiII further extend the government's position as a government which is able to listen and to deliver policies of support to various industries that might be running into difficulty, particularly the workers and the employers in those industries. If there was anything which the honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) hinted at in her fine contribution to this debate this morning, it was the fact that the government already has in place many policies which are assisting farm families and workers in rural industries across Australia, particularly those that are affected by drought. The response from any government of any persuasion should never be a hip-pocket response to cast money towards the problem and simply to pretend that that is all it has to do. If there is one thing which has marked responses in the past, it has been that that sort of policy and something like the fodder subsidy which has been bandied about in the last few days, both within the House and in the media, have not produced productive responses or results in the long run. The member for Maranoa in his contribution this morning hinted at the effects of inflation that will be flowing through the Australian economy as a result of the drought and the subsequent increase in prices. A simple thing like a drought subsidy, when it is abused, does not necessarily reduce the price of fodder to a particular farmer or farming enterprise and, itself, if it is abused, has obviously contributed to the flow-on effects of inflation. When the member for Maranoa was waxing lyrical about the effects of inflation, flow-on effects and the containment of costs in that area, I really took a big breath and thought he was going to go all the way. But instead he took a little diversion and went back to the National Party's pet subject, the impact of what he perceives as the effects of work practices on costs of primary producers. In terms of the shortage of grain, particularly feed grain to industries, that flow-on effect is something which is very real. The reason I took a big breath is that I thought the member for Maranoa was going to go on and elaborate a little bit more on the effects of the increase in grain price on other industries. As the chicken meat industry is another industry that is affected by one of these bills, the National Residue Survey Administration (Meat Chickens) Amendment BiII, I thought the member for Maranoa may have said a little bit about the impost of that increase in grain price on the chicken meat industry. Whatever perceived inadequacies the member for Maranoa attempted to allude to in his contribution this morning with regard to work practices that he thought had to be changed, without his actually spelling out what they are, certainly the impost of the increased price of feed grain going into the chicken industry is something which that industry is most concerned about. The member for Fraser( Mr Langmore) is going to correct me because he is an expert on this, but the elasticity in the price of chicken meat means that, as the price of chicken meat goes up even a moderate amount, consumers will swing away to other meat products. prices, and that particular aspect is going to be felt in the demand from consumers. That is what the chicken industry is most concerned about. Perhaps the member for Maranoa shied away from it, but perhaps he was also alluding to the fact that if we were to import grain we might be able to keep that price down.",158,Representatives Main Committee

That particular industry is a substantial employer and supplier in the electorate, and I take exception to the member for Maranoa alluding in the way he did to the work practices which he saw as a threat. That industry has grown substantially with good work from the management and the employees. Just a few months ago the member for Page and I had the honour to have a meeting with the management of Sunnybrand ChickensMr Harry Woods-And a lovely lunch. chicken which they are selIing to the market. I do not know whether, under the present debate on some other laws, the honourable member for Page and I must declare that lunch. Nevertheless, I would like to point out that over our luncheon we were able to discuss with the management, and also with DEET officers who were present, the way in which the government employment schemes have been able to assist the business-through training and wage subsidies and so forth-to take on and reskill staff to step up into the new demands of that industry. The industry has changed substantially, particularly in the last 10 years, towards value adding. It is no longer simply selIing bodies of chickens in the different sizes that we might be familiar with and that were presented in the supermarket for many years. The business is actually deboning and doing all sorts of other things to the chicken meat to make it more presentable and much more attractive to the purchaser, and it is competing with the other meat industries which are also present in my electorate and that of the honourable member for Page and also in the electorates of the members on the other side. I refer, obviously, to the pork, lamb and beef industries. Nevertheless, the changes to the national residue survey administration for the meat chicken industry have been accepted by industry players across Australia. Obviously, with the support of the members on both sides of the House, these bills will go through and will, I hope, further add to the strength of the industry itself. There have been various comments made about the timeliness of the farm household support changes which are contained within these bills. As I mentioned earlier in my discussions here this morning, the changes add to what is already in place to assist farm families and employers across Australia in rural industries which are affected by the drought. I am fortunate, in the sense that mine is probably the only electorate in New South Wales which has not been drought declared.

I certainly appreciate the difficulties that the electorates of the honourable member for Page and the honourable member for New England( Mr Sinclair), and the industries in those areas, are facing. The various changes which are in place for farm household support are all about assisting farm families. The almost nigglingly small change which has been put forward in the amendment moved by the honourable member for Maranoa-without any explanation as to why he was tweaking it up that extra very small amount-is a bit of a kite flying exercise. The other part of the amendment which has been moved is something which has already been flagged very strongly in the media and through the Labor caucus as something that we were quite strongly prepared to do, and I look forward to seeing the announcements this afternoon. Why not accept these amendments? Because they do not actually relate to the bill which would require amendment in here, and hence they are a little out of place and are certainly out of keeping with the nature of the debate which is normally allowed for in this chamber.' The series of bills, as I said in my introduction, is simply some finetuning of aspects of various bills for the primary industries. Without doubt, members on both sides-despite what has been moved here this morning-will be supporting them, and I do so as well. comments made by the honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) and by my friend the honourable member for Richmond( Mr Newell). I particularly take umbrage at the member for Richmond's illustration of the opposition-a coalition, I hasten to remind him-as the Johnny-come-Iatelys who are running behind the bus and waving a ticket saying, 'We missed out.' I happen to think that it is almost indecent for anyone to rise in this Main Committee chamber or in the House, in the light of the present disaster of the drought, and claim to have some sort of monopoly on rural wisdom or on the way in which assistance should be offered. The cruel reality is that none of us has got anything to brag about. We have all responded belatedly to a desperate need in rural Australia. I think it is quite improper for the member for Capricornia to suggest there should be, in some sense, an apology from the opposition for having pursued the issues it pursued in order to get recognition of what was happening with the drought. It is equally improper, if I may say so, for the member for Richmond to suggest that in some way there is something superbly better about the government's package, and awfully inferior about the opposition's. I was having some difficulty in finding an appropriate analogy but it struck me that it was almost like both of us wandering around Rwanda with a bag full of rice, with one team saying to the other, 'We've got a more attractive ladle for doling out the rice than you.' Frankly, we have a nation with a real, acute, almost insurmountable problem that calls, in this instance, for a parliamentary reaction-not a government or an opposition reaction. I was not amused, though not entirely surprised, that the member for Capricornia-not uncharitably, I hasten to add, but nonetheless in a rather political exercise-read from an editorial by Tim Stevens referring to the coalition's drought policy. In it I was quoted by Mr Stevens as not having been adequately consulted-as the counterpart in the coalition, as it were, of the member for Page( Mr Harry Woods)-on the question of the coalition's drought policy. It is perfectly true for Mr Stevens to say that I was not consulted. In fact, he rang me after the drought policy had been announced and asked whether I or my committee had been consulted. He said that it had been intimated to him that we had not been. I indicated that, no, we had not been. But I was not offended by that. I recognised that the shadow minister",160,Representatives Main Committee
290,Mr Andrew (Wakefield) (11.39 A.m.),"I rise in this debate to take some umbrage at the1336 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 21 September 1994 for primary industry had a deadline to meet; that he had taken the policy to the shadow cabinet and it had met with shadow cabinet approval; that it had not been unfunded, as alleged by Mr Stevens or by the member for Capricornia, in that he had also sought and gained the approval of the shadow treasurer; and that it came to me prior to its release so that it could be reviewed. There simply was not a time to call the committee together and, as anyone from the coalition would attest, it has not been a matter of any tension between coalition members or between members of the Liberal and National parties independently. To suggest that I was sitting there uneasily alongside the shadow minister for primary industry at this press conference would be something of a misnomer, I have to confess. Those who know me well enough know I am sufficient of a politician not to be uneasy about any sort of publicity. I must add that there was some contest for the opportunity to be seated alongside the shadow minister for primary industry, a contest I am pleased to say I won. However, I want to pick up the point made by the member for Capricornia and run from time to time by members opposite, suggesting that in some way the National Farmers Federation and all farming bodies have suggested the coalition was way off course with its particular version of the way in which the desperate need facing Australian farmers should be met. CanI say that my experience, from conversations with the National Farmers Federation representatives of recent times, has been that they are regretting their rather outspoken criticism of only one sector of the coalition's proposal-the proposal for fodder subsidy. My own farmers organisation, the South Australian Farmers Federation, has from day one endorsed and embraced this entire package. LestI fall into the same trap as I am accusing my friends opposite of having entered, this is not a case of saying, 'Look how much better our policy is than yours.' This is a case of the coalition members standing here and saying that there is a desperate need. We recognise that the government is taking steps to address that need, and we believe that changes could be made to improve the way in which the need, which is currently felt by drought stricken farmers across Australia, is addressed. One of those changes has been addressed by the member for Richmond. In his closing remarks, I think he said it was 'niggardly small', meaning it was a very small change that the coalition was seeking. In the light of that debate, I simply ask: if that is the case, why is it that the government has so much trouble accepting this coalition amendment? The coalition does not seek a great deal. It seeks simply to improve the way in which farm household support is made available to farmers and to extend the period of availability, without strings attached, to 12 months instead of nine months. That is not an unreasonable request, but it is dismissed out of hand by the government as if anything proposed by the coalition was bound to be the wrong thing to do. I find that a difficult exercise to come to terms with because-rather like the land grant-here I am as part of the coalition saying, 'We accept that these things need to happen, so let us see if we can improve on them'; but I have a government not even entertaining my amendment. I must say I find that somewhat disappointing. The member for Capricornia was also very critical of what she saw as the coalition's reaction to the statement by the Prime Minister( Mr Keating) that he would not leave country people behind. Frankly, Mr Deputy Speaker, the problem is simply this: we are facing a drought that is now four years old. We would be failing in our role as the coalition if we had not been Wednesday, 21 September 1994 MAIN COMMIITEE 1337 prodding and poking the Prime Minister into taking action, and we would be failing today if we were simply observing that it took him longer than it should have taken him to be aware of what is happening, particularly in Queensland and in northern New South Wales. It was said by the member of Capricornia that when the people of Queensland met the Prime Minister face to face they found that the preconceptions they had of him were without foundation and that he was really quite a gregarious fellow. I am genuinely pleased that that is the case. It is a comment that after 11 years in this place as a member of the federal parliament I could have made, and have made from time to time, about the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke. I am sorry to say that it is a comment I find it more difficult to make about the present Prime Minister; not because I want to be critical, but because after 11 years in this place I have never had an opportunity to experience what I do not doubt is his capacity to be gregarious. It is but something he never extends in any sense to coalition members. The preconception that is abroad in the community is very much the result of the way the Prime' Minister deals with us, rather than something that we have sought deliberately to cultivate or foster. The changes that the coalition is seeking are, in the words of the member for Richmond, small changes. We believe they improve the way in which assistance will be delivered to people in drought stricken Queensland and New South Wales, and for that reason we are proposing these amendments and seeking government support for them. We are certainly not seeking to have them dismissed out of hand, as seems to have been the case to date. In addressing this debate the member for Maranoa( Mr Bruce Scott) touched on the crux of the matter: which is, as he said, that only 392 people are currently accessing farm household support. That tells its own story. Clearly, farm household support is not doing what the government intended it should do, and it needs to be amended. We seek to amend it by extending its availability and not making it such a one-way ticket off the farm for those who are dependent on it. We have also sought some changes to the re-establishment grant, because we feel there is a certain inflexibility in making the approximately $45,000 available to only one farming family, when in many instances the farm is managed by more than one farming family and some additional support is needed where additional families are being forced off the farm. I do not wish to spend much longer dealing with the question of drought, but everyone agrees-government and opposition-that drought is a seasonal matter and that it is reasonable to expect farmers to farm in an Australian climate anticipating that a drought will arrive. For example, there has not been any effort by the coalition to suggest to the government that it ought currently to be intervening in the drought stricken state of South Australia, because this is the first year in which South Australia has found itself in drought. As a coalition, we have endeavoured to be realistic about the way in which drought policy is delivered, recognising that Australian farmers must expect to face drought from time to time. There are, however, two difficulties. The first and more obvious one is that in the case of northern New South Wales and Queensland this is the fourth year of drought, so clearly any assistance is well and truly overdue. What is happening there, as both government and opposition recognise, is something that could not reasonably be budgeted for by anybody in any rural practice in Australia. The second difficulty is harder to come to terms with. I do not have an answer to it, but I feel I have a responsibility to alert the government to the fact that in the case of South 1338 MAIN COMMIITEE Wednesday, 21 September 1994 Australia, particularly on the west coast, there are those who this year face a drought from which they will not be able to recover any grain at all. In technical terms it is their first year in drought. Their financial difficulties are compounded by the fact that last year they lost much of their grain due to a mouse plague that consumed paddocks of grain and seemed to be very difficult to contain, and the year before-irony of ironies-they lost their grain because it rained persistently through November and December and the grain was destroyed. They have only had one year of drought, but they have had an unpredictable three years of low, minimal or almost non-existent income in some instances. This is an instance where it may not be appropriate to deliver any form of drought relief, but some form of farm household support is entirely appropriate. It would be much better if that farm household support did not carry with it the automatic obligation to leave the property. Also, the government ought to be aware, as it considers its response to the drought, of instances where small businesses in rural Australia have experienced marginally better years, particularly over the last two years, and where a reasonable rainfall has, in some cases, meant sensible crops of oil seeds at tolerable prices. Those machinery dealers in regional Australia and, in some cases, those farmers will very likely face a provisional tax bill this year which they will be unable to meet simply because they will not have sufficient income. Therein lies a bind that the government ought to be conscious of as it puts together its rural policy. There was some criticism levelled at farming generally by the member for Capricornia when she mentioned that one of the flow-on effects of drought is the erosion that occurs when large levels of rainfall follow a drought and soil is washed away. My experience with farmingwhich is now over 40 years-is that in almost all instances farmers are far more environmentally sensitive than ever they were. It is very rare for land to be cleared without good cause. In my own area of the mallee, where the rainfall may frequently be little more than nine inches, previous generations of farmers had an ongoing problem-it is a problem with which the member for Murray( Mr Lloyd) would be familiar-where the encroachment of sandhills became a problem simply because land had been cleared and then began to drift. Thanks to the farming techniques of the 1990s, those problems have all but disappeared. Farmers who are now deliberating sowing drought tolerant crops, oats particularly, have been able to retrieve these sandhills. Far from drought causing additional soil erosion, although that is a possibility, the generation of farmers that we now represent as a parliament is a generation much less likely to get into trouble than their forefathers. Their forefathers simply lacked the techniques that are now in place to ensure that land erosion is a minimal problem. I conclude by moving from the sublime to the ridiculous. We have been dealing with drought and I do not know quite how to link the rest of my remarks into my comments, except perhaps to refer to dry white wines, which is drawing a very long bow. Part of the legislation, as honourable members know, deals with the way in which a levy is to be collected from small winemakers and I want to pick up some of the comments made by the member for Mallee about the wine industry. I am conscious of the fact that the wine industry has committed itself to a dramatic expansion program encouraged by the federal government and in South Australia encouraged by the Dean Brown state government. I have no doubt that could be reflected by other state governments around Australia as well. It is expected that during the 1990s an additional 20,000 hectares of wine grapes will come into production and that the value of wine grape production will go from $l.5 billion in 1993 to, it is hoped, $2.5 billion by the year 2000. I am a little Wednesday, 21 September 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 1339 bothered about this level of expansion, having been around long enough to have watched every primary industry go through cycles and to know that there is only one road from being up, and that is running down. I do not mean that as any criticism of the present government's policy-I think that we are wisely encouraging the wine industry to expand. But there is one cautionary word I want to exercise in the context of this debate. Following the government's decision to call for an inquiry into the wine industry, it has suggested to the wine industry that it would be prepared to allow a depreciation allowance for new plantings. This did not exist in the past but it exists now, so new plantings occurring in the wine industry can be effectively depreciated and there can be a tax advantage in that planting process. I approve of that. I would point out to the government, however, that the same sort of facility does not exist for the write-off in tree fruits and in dried vine fruits. I believe that currently we as a parliament, and the government particularly, are sending what is effectively the wrong signal to horticulturists and viticulturists around Australia, and it is placing a greater emphasis on wine grape expansion than is wise. The signal is, 'We'll give you a tax write-off for this', but not a tax write-off for replacing, say, sultanas, currants, apricots, peaches, pears, normal market stone fruit or canning stone fruit production, or, for that matter, a write-off for citrus growers who may even, in the present climate, choose to expand. I think that this is sending the wrong market signals and that we are having a greater emphasis placed on wine grapes than is wise, and the discerning growers may well choose to have a healthier mix of plantings if in fact the tax write-off were more evenly based. I would like to make that comment to the government and challenge it to pick up that particular call from the industry. I commend the amendment to the Main Committee. for Wakefield ( Mr Andrew), a sincere and genuine speaker who, while he may disagree with us, always removes any personal references from his speech and just gets involved with doing his job, and he is well respected because of that. Having said that, I must try and do the same. I do not believe that the government could possibly consider supporting the amendment, for a number of reasons. The point has been made by speakers on the other side that the drought is not a new thing. Drought has been in Australia now, in some parts of it, for up to four years. Press coverage indicates that the government is going to make an announcement this afternoon, and also there is a fair exposure of what the statement is going to say. And what we find is that, after four years of drought in some areas, the representatives, as they claim, of country people get up and move an amendment like this a matter of hours before the government makes a major statement on the drought relief package that it is going to offer-and they expect us to take it seriously. That, of course, is not putting down the drought or its effect. I would simply remind members opposite to have a look at the record of the state government in New South Wales and see how much it underspent its budget last year on rural assistance funding, and then see what it did to that component of its budget this year. They will find that not only did it underspend it last year by some $9 million, it immediately cut its budget this year by a similar amount, using the argument, 'It was not spent last year so we do not need it this year.' That is the sort of thing that is happening on the other side of politics. Having said that, let me get on with some of the important issues, some of the positive aspects of this legislation that is before us today. There are two parts of it that relate",161,Representatives Main Committee
291,Mr Horne (Paterson) (11.56 A.m.),"Let me say how pleasant it is to follow the member1340 MAIN COMMfITEE Wednesday, 21 September 1994 specifically to my electorate. One is the wine industry bill and the other one is the chicken industry bill. Before we get on to those specifics, I had the good fortune, during the parliamentary recess in winter, to visit Japan, Korea and Taiwan. One of the things that we noticed there was that, because those countries are demanding high quality food imports, Australia is indeed one of the most highly regarded sources for fresh, clean food. That is the way it has to stay. That is why we must ensure that we are going to continue putting money into research and development to ensure that the quality of our produce is number one. In my electorate, the chicken industry employs in the order of 2,000 people. The SteggJes processing plant is just outside my electorate. It employs in excess of 500 people. There are many growers and supporting industries inside my electorate. Their major concern at present is the problem of imported chicken meat. Of course, the only way we are going to prevent imported chicken meat from coming into Australia is by ensuring that the standard that we have for our chicken meat is something that cannot be reproduced elsewhere, and that our consumers will not stand for less than the best that we can offer. It is also the best insurance we have to make sure that chicken exports from Australia can grow, because-as I have already mentioned-the Asian countries of Japan, Korea and Taiwan, with their imports of chicken meat, will demand only the best. I fully support the National Residue Survey Administration (Meat Chickens) Amendment Bill, because it means that that is the best way to safeguard the future of our chicken industry, and it is an extremely valuable industry. This bill's function is to monitor and assess the levels of chemical residues in raw plant and animal commodities, to give domestic and international consumers confidence in the quality and safety of those products, and to assist in identifying the causes and possible solutions of chemical residue problems. There is growing concern about chemical residues in food, as consumers expect a high standard of assurance about food safety and quality. I am sure that there is a great deal that we do not know about the effect of residues in foods that we eat. I am sure that at some time down the track we are going to expose some of the dangers that we have allowed ourselves to be exposed to simply because of the herbicides and the pesticides that we have used over a long period of time. I am fully supportive of that. I will now go on to the parts of the legislation related to the wine industry. BeforeI do, I would like to read a few extracts from the Business Review Weekly that was published on 19 September 1994. The article is headlined 'Southcorp's Europe Strategy Rewarded'. It goes on to talk about an Australian wine's winning the most prestigious award in Britain for wine. Not only does this article talk about our going ahead and winning some of the 'best in class' awards; it states: The morning after the award ceremony of one of Britain's most prestigious wine competitions, David Combe is sitting in his office in Richmond, Surrey, barely able to conceal his delight at South corp Wines' triumph. Combe, Southcorp Wines' senior vice-president, international, admits he knew in advance that Pen folds Bin 707 stood a good chance of winning the International Wine Challenge's bordeaux-style category. But even he was surprised when it also won the competition's most coveted trophy, for the best red wine overall. He goes on to talk about some of the wines that won their classes. There was a Henschke red, a Rosemount from the Hunter Valley, of course, a cabemet shiraz, and a Penfolds cabemet sauvignon that was tailor-made for the British market. He says: Wednesday, 21 September 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 1341 These awards demonstrate in absolute terms that by any criteria our quality is exceptional. It's not just a price-quality relationship. That is the level that our wine industry has got to internationally, and that is why we have to ensure that this government does all it can to enable the wine industry to stay at that level. I would remind everyone that last year the world wine industry produced some three million Iitres of wine more than was consumed. Obviously, the big problem our wine industry faces is that, in a world where there is overproduction of wine, to get a place in a market there will be cost cutting. Again, our wine is being bought because it is the best. I believe that these two pieces of legislation are going to enhance that reputation. Firstly, there is the Wine Grapes Levy Amendment Bill. The purpose of this bill is to revise the arrangements for levies paid under the Wine Grapes Levy Act and to ensure that money will be spent on research and development for the wine grape industry. Sure, it will increase the maximum levy for research and development to $3 per tonne for grapes. But, if that extra dollar per tonne enhances our reputation as a premier winemaker, I think everyone in the industry and everyone outside the industry would agree that it is money well spent. The other section of the bill is about the method of collection and who the levy is collected from. No-one denies the fact that all wine grape growers effectively pay their levy now. If they do not crush their own grapes, they pay the fee to the organisation that is crushing their grapes for them, but they still pay it. Of course, it denies the small grape grower the right to participate in the decision making process of the wine industry, and to deny some of our boutique wine makers that right is a denial of natural justice, it is a denial of participating in the process of democracy. I support this change too because those small grape growers do understand, probably more than anyone else, the value of producing a wine for a niche market. They know how it is done. They simply do not have the capital or do not have the land to produce a large quantity of grapes and therefore support the capitalisation so that they have their own crushing, fermentation and bottling process. They should be allowed to participate in the decision making process of the wine industry. Mr Deputy Speaker, I know that many other people wish to speak on this legislation, and none more important than my very good friend and colleague the member for Page( Mr Harry Woods), who represents that magnificent seat on the north coast and does it very well. Mr Harry Woods interjectinggood job too; there is no doubt about that. We share some time on a committee together and I really enjoy his company too. I support the bills. because I believe that there have been quite a number of incomplete and ignorant statements made this morning about drought, particularly severe drought, from which we are now suffering in Queensland and northern New South Wales. When the coalition government lost office in 1983-and that was after the 1982 drought, which in itself was a severe drought-the rural adjustment scheme was being provided with more money in real terms than it is now, and that was being made available to more people at the lower end of the financial spectrum in farming than what is now the case. There was no assets test on unemployment benefits or, if you like, jobstart and newstart. There was no assets test on Austudy, because it was recognised then, and still is by the coalition, that if the average value of a farm property or, for that matter, many unincorporated town businesses, is about $750,000, then people are",165,Representatives Main Committee

293,Mr Lloyd (Murray)(L2.10 P.m.),"I want to set the record straight with regard to drought,1342 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 21 September 1994 effectively ruled out of any assistance by an assets test, even if they cannot sell the propertyand that is the case now. Farm household support was there, and it was brought in by the coalition government in 1977, because even without an assets test, unemployment benefits did not provide a similar type of safety net for the self-employed sector of this country, as has always been the case for the salary and wage sector of this country. Drought was in the natural disaster scheme and lEOs, income equalisation deposits, were there, with a good incentive in their form to encourage people to put aside money in good years against bad years. That is very important for those areas where fodder is not an alternative, either because the farmers are grain growers or because they are low rainfall areas. In 1982 there was a very severe drought. I will explain more about the difference between severe drought and ordinary drought in a minute. The fodder subsidy was brought in at that time. It was brought in to preserve the national herd and flock, which it did very successfully. It saved Australia billions of dollars in exports by maintaining wheat production or, if you like, grain production, wool production and meat production. In this one year, we are now looking at a loss of about $2 billion in exports because of the drought. If much of the sheep flock is killed or dies-and remember that once sheep are shorn in many parts of Australia, they will be shot, because there is not the money to continue to feed them-there will be a dramatic loss in income for this nation. I acknowledge that there was some rorting of that fodder system. There is in every government system, but in the variety of reviews of that system that took place afterwards, I could quite clearly say that I have more evidence in my office each year of rorting of other government programs in my electorate, whether they be social security, jobs training, Aboriginal schemes, ethnic schemes, or whatever. It happens with all those schemes. We have to take that into context when we consider whether there should be a program or not. The fact that a program is not going to be administered perfectly is not a conclusive argument against it. The Labor government came in in 1983 and changed just about everything that was in place to meet the next severe drought. Income equalisation deposits were virtually ruined, and three attempts by the Labor government to bring them back have not been successful. I think, in particular, of an announcement by the Labor government in one budget to improve the equalisation deposit scheme, but it was deferred for 12 months, so that wool growers who were then receiving a high price for their wool were prevented from investing in those deposits. For members of the government to criticise farmers for not putting aside money in good years for bad years, when they themselves have ruined what was in place to assist and encourage farmers to do so, is really very hypocritical, if not disgraceful. We are looking again at the assets test at the moment. That was brought in by the government. It has fiddled with changes since, recognising that what it has done has been ideological and unfair. It is still not a realistic recognition of the capital formation needed by a non-incorporated business, farm or non-farm, to provide any sort of reasonable equity in welfare compared with the rest of our society. The fact is the member for Maranoa said that there are only 392 recipients of household support at this time when we have got parts of Queensland in their fourth year of drought and our wool growers are at one of their worse points ever. Wednesday, 21 September 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 1343 Concerning natural disasters and drought, a loaded committee was set up by this government some years ago to remove drought from the natural disaster relief scheme. There was a minority report, supported by the NFF representative, that severe drought should remain in the natural disaster arrangements. Remember: when we have natural disaster arrangements, there are agreements with the states on the range of measures which both the Commonwealth and the states are prepared to support. They could be on transport; they could be on fodder; they could be on water. They should recognise-and the policies we have had in place do recognise-that some forms of assistance are not as sensible with regard to environmental degradation as others. For example, it may be more sensible to provide a transport subsidy to get stock out rather than to bring fodder in. One has to be flexible with this. One thing the Labor government has forgotten about altogether with regard to drought and natural disasters is that, under the natural disaster arrangements, not just farmers but town business people in those affected areas can receive assistance-up to $100,000 a year at four per cent interest. Therefore, the Labor government has, by its action, removed the main form of assistance for small businesses in towns affected by drought. The government has also fiddled around with investment allowances-sometimes in and sometimes out. It has therefore reduced the incentive and the ability for farmers in the higher rainfall areas, where it is sensible for them to have fodder, to have the necessary equipment. Once again, it is a disgrace that this government can accuse farmers of not preparing for drought when it has taken those things away. As for the next accusation, that somehow or other we have just come up with a drought policy, that is also wrong. I was the shadow minister for agriculture or primary industry for both the 1990 and 1993 elections. In both those election policies we had drought provisions and they are still policy. Those policies were supported by the NFF and are, to my knowledge, still supported by the NFF. I now want to make a point about where we have moved with drought policy over the years since 1982. I am taking into account that committee which recognised the difference between severe drought and ordinary drought and recognised that there is an ability for farmers-or there should be an ability for farmers if they are given reasonable incentives-to cope with the dry year that happens every three to four years. I accept that is a natural part of farming. It should be able to be covered, provided there are reasonable incentive arrangements such as lEOs, et cetera. But look at our severe droughts-the droughts that occur every 10 to 15 years. I am talking here about southern Australia and the exact years may not relate to northern Australia. The years are 1944, 1957, 1967, 1982 and 1994. There is this recurring pattern of severe drought. It is impossible for anyone completely to cover themselves, particularly when they have had domestic cost price pressures and USA and EC export subsidies reducing prices abroad and there have been no IEDs in place to assist. When we are talking about drought, we are talking about two types of drought: the severe drought which has been in place for up to the fourth or fifth year in parts of southern Queensland, the Darling Downs and parts of northern New South Wales; as distinct from the failure of the winter rainfall in the winter rainfall areas of southern Australia as the drought moves further south. We should recognise a far greater need for those people who are now into their fourth year of drought. It is interesting that the states are providing a range of drought assistance measures at the present time, even though the natural disaster arrangements will not come in to assist them. 1344 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 21 September 1994 Some of those measures include fodder subsidies, whether for transport or for fodder itself. There has been no criticism by this government of that action, and there has been no criticism by farmer organisations of that action. Yet, somehow or other, there is suddenly criticism of this addition by the coalition of a fodder subsidy to its current drought policy. Our drought policy is very clear. It has been in place, as I said, for some years. It is there in our election policy, and it remains policy. First of all, we return to worthwhile incentive based income equalisation deposit arrangements, which will give incentives to farmers to put money aside in better years. We have always recognised that, even when we move from no assets test whatsoever to assets tests, in cases of agriculture and the self-employed generally, there are situations where the assets test should not apply. Our policy clearly states that, in severe situations such as wool price downturns, droughts, floods, et cetera-and whether it be for Austudy, for household support, for jobstart, or whatever-the assets test prevents food being put on the tables of people who, in some cases, are in their fourth year of drought and prevents children receiving adequate education. It really is a disgrace that there is a need in this country for well-meaning people-whom I commendto send food parcels to the people so affected. It is a disgrace that they should have to do so because there is no safety net there-which there should be for every Australian in this day and age. At long last, the government is waking up; but it has taken it years to do so. The most educationally disadvantaged group in this country at the present time is the children on farm properties in those drought affected areas which are not close to a regional community where there is the necessary education so that they can attend every day. I hope that the government does keep catching up, because it has got a long way to go. The government also changed the rural adjustment scheme so that it no longer covers the lower end of at risk farmers. The scheme basically now is almost a second bank, and that is not what the rural adjustment scheme was put in place to be. There is a need to bring back investment incentives so that people can cover ordinary drought better. It is important that we have the essential elements of policy in place. If they are not in place, it is too late when they are finally brought in. There is no better evidence that it is too late now than that we are into the fourth year of drought in the Darling Downs and yet it is only now that something is going to be done, as I understand it, about the assets test. The only changes and additions that the coalition has made-and they were announced by better recognition of farm workers, who of course are also hurt in times of drought, and, secondly, in times of severe drought, a fodder subsidy. A fodder subsidy is a very sensible thing to propose, because of the question of its impact on the future earning capacity of this country. In particular, we are looking at two very big industries being at risk. The first is wool: there are going to be millions of sheep shot, or dying once they are shorn, unless rain comesbecause farmers cannot afford to keep feeding them. The second is the beef feedlot industry, which has been remarkably successful. In big dollar terms, it is probably the most successful value adding industry in Australia in the way it has improved. Perhaps the dairy industry might match it. It is certainly ahead of the wine industry at this stage, but it is at risk in the Japanese and other markets, because of the price of grain. There is no point in talking about the price of grain going up if we had a subsidy scheme; the price of grain has doubled now. There is, however, an outer parameter to the price of grain,",167,Representatives Main Committee
294,The Honourable Member For Gwydir ( Mr Anderson),"to drought policy recently were, firstly,Wednesday, 21 September 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 1345 which is the import parity price of grain. That would still apply if there were a scheme in place. The import parity price is approximately $220 a tonne. It is perhaps possible to land it for about $180 or $190, but then there is the question of transport, and there are also some problems with quarantine with certain situations. The initial reaction of the National Farmers Federation was only to the fodder subsidy; it did not react to all of other elements of the policy that the honourable member for Gwydir announced. It forgot that the real question of price for grain in a drought is the import parity price of grain because there is basically no fodder or hay left in Australia now and there will not be any with the failure of the winter rainfall areas in the south. It forgot that it had already supported the other elements. Now that the federation has read the policy-and it has admitted that it had not read the policy-there is pressure from its own state organisations, and from commodity groups, which are all telling the Canberra section of the National Farmers Federation what they think of that initial reaction. I return to what is a terrible situation in this country. We are one of the most affluent countries in the world but good meaning people have had to prepare food parcels to be sent to help other people in this country because this government removed the safety net that would have allowed them to put groceries on the table. If this drought continues-and I hope it does not continue-this government is going to be forced to adopt more and more the policy that we have had in place for years, whether it likes it or not. Today's announcement will certainly be incorporating some of that. Finally, I want to refer to one of the other bills, the Wine Grapes Levy Amendment Bill. Grapes, together with other forms of irrigated horticulture, provide one of the major seasonal labour sources in this country. My area has more deciduous fruit and tomatoes than grapes but the Sunraysia area has grapes for both dried vine fruit and wine. There are about 15,000 to 20,000 people employed for about three months early in the calendar year, of which about 10,000 come in from other areas. It is a unique and genuine job creation situation each year. It is very valuable with regard to exports, import replacement and value adding. Particularly for the young people-the more physically fit people-it is valuable work experience and it takes them away from that mentality of unemployment benefit or jobstart. Unfortunately-and I genuinely say unfortunately-the government's policy, as announced in its white paper, concentrates on the long-term unemployed and this will actually work against finding jobs or placing young people in jobs in irrigated areas where there is a very large seasonal demand. Each year, the Commonwealth Employment Service in the Shepparton and the Goulburn Valley area in my electorate goes on a tour of about a dozen CES offices in New South Wales and Victoria. These CES officers, together with fruit grower representatives who pay their own way, explain to the CES people in those other places the type of labour that is required and when it will be required. They advise them to stay in touch because weather can change the time the fruit is picked. My office traditionally has stayed open over that early New Year period because of problems with people coming in. That money will not be available any more. We are only talking about a few thousand dollars as against the hundreds of millions of dollars for these other schemes which do not provide the genuine jobs that this scheme provides. I ask the government to look again at this unintended consequence of its policy. This is a sensible arrangement whereby industry and the Commonwealth Employment Service work 1346 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 21 September 1994 together to find people for those many thousands of jobs. These jobs give people the valuable experience of genuine jobs and the arrangement benefits both sides. Labor government has an enormous amount of concern for the problems in the bush. There is a recognition of the severe drought, and of the crisis situation facing many people out there, especially in Queensland and northern New South Wales and, of course, in the other areas that are also being affected at this time. I also recognise the genuine feeling that many of the speakers on the other side have for those areas. They have local connections there, and they know the sort of situation that people are in, as do members on our side. We have put considerable amounts of money into drought relief recently, and this afternoon, or later this evening, we will be announcing a packagewould hope that it is a significant and substantial package, and that it is targeted and well constructed. I believe that it will be, and I think it will go a long way to addressing some of the very real problems in country Australia at the present time. However, I will deal now with the amendment moved by the member for Maranoa( Mr Bruce Scott). I see that as merely a means for members of the opposition to be able to talk about drought, and I suppose that is fair enough. But if they are fair dinkum and if they want to push that, let them take it down to the other house and let us have a debate down there, by which time our package will be out. I put that challenge to the member for Maranoa and others: cut out the rubbish that you are carrying on with and say to us, 'We will put this to a vote in the other house', because to me, that is simply a means of your being about to do a bit of squawking up here-particularly the member for Maranoa. I noted that in his speech he spent a lot of time talking about the chicken industry, and he certainly had a long squawk after that, but on the drought issues he sounded a bit like a dead chook. The issue really is about policy and we have heard a number of references to policy. The member for Murray( Mr Lloyd), interjecting on the member for Richmond( Mr Newell), said, 'Oh, we have had that policy for a long time.' Our problem over this side is that we really do not know what your policy is. We have had Fightback, we have had the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Downer) changing policy on the run, and actually saying that he is not going to release any details of any policy, so you can understand our confusion about where you stand on a lot of areas. Nonetheless, it is good to have you standing up and saying that this is your policy on drought. But we are confused, absolutely confused, about your position on a lot of issues. It seems to me that the opposition, to a great extent, has not got that rigorous approach to policy that enables it to bring out that sort of defined policy that is well constructed and targeted. It has been said by many recently, particularly in the press, that a good opposition is necessary, and I think that nowhere more than in policy issues is that essential. I have got to say that I am confused about where you stand on a whole range of issues. I would like to know-and that is a genuine comment-where the opposition stands on a whole range of issues. The member for Maranoa also attacked the Prime Minister( Mr Keating) for visiting drought stricken areas. He said it was late. I think the real problem that members opposite see there is that the visit was so welcomed, and it was. It is not drawing a long bow at all to say that",170,Representatives Main Committee

He showed genuine concern, as we all do on this side, and I am confident that, with the Prime Minister's support, we are going to have a good package for country Australia. But, bearing in mind that you attack him for visiting the bush, I think there is a real fear of him being out there. If we look at the most recent Bulletin poll, for instance, we see that he is the preferred Prime Minister in rural Australia. That puts a real scare into some of the people opposite. They do not like to see him out in rural Australia, and they doubletalk it around and say, 'He should have been here sooner' or 'He should come more often', but the reality is that members opposite do not like him being there. I suppose that is understandable, because the National Party mostly does not like him being there. I also get that feeling up my way or when I go to other areas, but we will keep coming. The Prime Minister will keep doing the trips and we will keep bringing out good, rigorous, well-constructed policy for country Australia. I note many of the comments coming from the people who met the Prime Minister on his recent tour, and members opposite also will see that country Australia is already recognising the value of having a government that can put together good policy. We will be opposing this amendment for obvious reasons. The challenge to people opposite, if they want to carry the matter further, is that we will have a debate. By then we will know what our package is and we will be able to tell you all about it. There is another challenge, though, contained in this issue of the Prime Minister's visits to drought areas in Australia and to country Australia generally. Why do not members opposite get Mr Downer to visit some of their electorates? He is an embarrassment, an absolute joke, throughout the breadth and width of Australia. I challenge the honourable member for Maranoa to get Mr Downer to his electorate. Mr Kerin's comment about Mr Downer is very apt: that his greatest ability is changing which foot he has in his mouth whilst still keeping the silver spoon there. Today we are discussing the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2), the Wine Grapes Levy Amendment Bill, the Primary Industries Levies and Charges (Wine Grapes) Collection Amendment Bill and the National Residue Survey Administration (Meat Chickens) Amendment Bill. These bills are being debated together and I believe that there is little likelihood of opposition to them, even given the amendment that the honourable member for Maranoa has proposed. Part1 of the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1994 is primarily procedural. The amendments have become necessary because of changes to the structure of the former ministerial councils dealing with agriculture, water resources, soil conservation and rural adjustment issues. These duties are now performed by the Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand and the terminology in the legislation needs to be amended to accommodate these changes. The amendments will affect the Australian Meat and Livestock Industry Policy Council Act 1984, the Biological Control Act 1984, Rural Industries Research Act (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 1985, the Rural Industries Research Act 1985, the Pig Industry Act 1986, the Horticultural Policy Council Act 1987, the Exotic Animal Disease Control Act 1989 and the Primary Industries Council Act 1991. 1348 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 21 September 1994 The bill also proposes to give all producers who pay the wine grapes levy an entitlement to vote at the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation's annual general meeting. This will occur through changes to the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980. Amendments to the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980 will ensure more consistent terminology in the Wine Grapes Levy Act 1987, the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991 and the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980. It will clarify those people who are entitled to speak and vote at the annual general meeting of the wine industry. In the general outline of the bill, part 4 deals with ensuring that ecologically sustainable development procedures are considered in the research and development activities of the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation. Given the widespread environmental degradation of some of the marginal wool producing areas, this is an important amendment which will help arrest the slide in the environmental amenity of these areas. The second part of part 4 allows for greater flexibility in the use of funds received from patents or trademarks associated with non-research and development activities for activities other than research and development. Amendments to the Farm Household Support Act are most timely. As honourable members would realise, the farm household support scheme offers support measures to farmers who are experiencing financial difficulties-as many are now because of drought. The scheme provides assistance in meeting the day-to-day living expenses of farmers who are unable to access further commercial finance. Farm household support is a loan which is available for up to two years at commercial interest rates and is paid at the jobsearch allowance rate. The payment is made fortnightly by the Department of Social Security, which administers the scheme on behalf of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. The main eligibility criterion for the scheme is the inability to access further commercial finance. Evidence for this is a certificate provided by the commercial finance institution to the Department of Social Security and indicating that the farmer is unable to access further commercial loans. Once that inability to obtain finance is established, Social Security will apply an income and assets test. The assets test excludes farm assets, which are broadly defined as any assets essential to the running of the farm. Life insurance and superannuation held by the farmer are also excluded. There are two groups of farmers who benefit from the scheme. There are those who believe they have a future in the industry but are unable to obtain further commercial financial support, and there are also those who have decided to leave farming but require support while they arrange the sale of the property. The first group can receive finance to meet the family's daily living expenses whilst remaining on the property and working to put the business back onto a firm footing. There are no repayments required until the family comes off the scheme, with scope to repay over five or 10 years. Farmers in the second group who sell their property within nine months will receive a payment equivalent to the balance of the farm household support they would have received had they remained on the land for the full nine-months grant period. These are worthwhile initiatives, but I have heard a number of complaints about the scheme's administration, so I welcome amendments made to allow for immediate delivery. The bill also contains measures to amend the Fisheries Administration Act 1991 to allow fishing permit holders greater flexibility in nominating which boat is to be used with that permit. Although few of the hundreds of fishermen in my area fish in Commonwealth Wednesday, 21 September 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 1349 territorial waters, I know that replacing vessels is often stifled by red tape and that fishermen would welcome any moves to reduce the bureaucratic difficulties involved. Arrangements to enable funds collected from the cattle industry to be used for target testing programs and for education extension programs to be aimed at reducing contamination on farms will result from amendments to the National Residue Survey Act 1992, while proposed amendments to the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act are aimed at eradicating an anomaly in funding arrangements for the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation. The bill also amends the definition of the sugar industry organisations in section 4( 1) of the Sugar Cane Levy Act 1987. This amendment has become necessary because of the consolidation of sugar industry organisations. The new organisations have been prescribed for the purposes of the definition. A small drafting error in the Wool Legislation (Repeals and Consequential Provisions) Act 1993, on which I had the pleasure of speaking earlier, has required a slight amendment. Similarly, the wording of the Wool Tax Act (No.3) 1964 has now become redundant, since wool dealers are now required to be registered, which fact means that the term 'registered wool dealer' is anachronistic. This bill further amends the Wheat Marketing Act 1989 to extend the definition of grain. This is to allow seed testing and certification of a greater range of seed species. Improvements in the allocation of levy payments to equity holders in the wheat industry fund will result from minor changes to the Wheat Marketing Act. I would like to also talk about the National Residue Survey Administration (Meat Chickens) Amendment Bill 1994. The bill is intended to allow for an increase from the present O.02c a head to O.06c a head on the levy rate payable for the national residue survey. The move is aimed at increasing consumer protection and further ensuring that Australia's meat chicken producers retain their clean and green image, domestically and internationally. It is also in line with the government's clean food export strategy; and that strategy is another example of policies which are there to develop commercial linkages. The strategy is designed to enhance Australia's image as a supplier of clean, fresh, quality produce in overseas markets. It is based on creating a market advantage for Australian fresh and processed food on the basis of its quality and origin from a clean environment. The program is a joint initiative with industry and government funding and is conditional upon matching industry funds. The Commonwealth is working with industry to ensure that the clean food export strategy has the backing of necessary quality assurance programs, and the amendments to the National Residue Survey Administration (Meat Chicken) Amendment Bill 1994 will allow for increases in the charges for inspection through changes to the regulations rather than legislation. I would not expect the rate to increase markedly over either the short or medium term. Since 1991 the value of chicken exports from Australia has more than doubled, making the protection of our 'clean supplier' tag an important ingredient in continuing growth in this export performance. The Wine Grapes Levy Amendment Bill 1994 affects the components of the wine grapes levy. Producers of small quantities of grapes will now pay a flat fee as the marketing component of the levy. This is not unreasonable if these producers are gaining commercially from the generic promotion of wines elsewhere. They will also gain the right to attend, debate and vote at annual meetings of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation. There is also consideration of amendments to the Primary Industries Levies and Charges (Wine Grapes) Collection Amendment Bill 1994. These amendments follow the amendments 1350 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 21 September 1994 to the Wine Grapes Levy Amendment Bill in that they change the definition of a producer to include those who produce less than 10 tonnes of wine grapes. They also make the definition of a producer clearer in terms of who is the owner of the wine. Under current legislation a grape producer can have his or her grapes turned into wine by a processor and then returned to him or her for sale. The legislation deems that the processor is the owner of the wine, when clearly that is not so. The amendment will address this anomaly. As I said at the outset, I believe this is an appropriate way to deal with non-contentious legislation. We have had ample opportunity to examine the contents of the bills and to raise any concerns we may have about them. I commend the bills to the House. Finally, I would like to say something about some of the comments made previously about communities coming together to support those in drought areas. We have heard the opposition attack the farmhand appeal, and we have heard the opposition attack the measures being taken by communities to help those in need in rural Australia. In my own electorate last weekend the community got together and loaded seven full semitrailers of hay to go to western areas. There was help there from the army to do that, with army trucks. Last night there was a concert in Grafton to raise money for rural areas. I think that is admirable. I think it is a wonderful exhibition of the community coming together and helping their fellow Australians, and I have got nothing but praise for all those people involved. I certainly commend the Grafton, Lower Clarence and north coast people who have been involved with that, including the Rotary clubs that organised it. The government is playing its part in the farmhand appeal, matching that dollar for dollar. Later this evening there will be an announcement of the drought package of extra assistance. That recognises that this is no ordinary drought, that in many areas it has been going on for quite a number of years and that the present policies, whilst having the right direction, perhaps have settings that cannot handle the present severe, extreme and long-lasting drought. Those people out in the areas of rural Australia that are affected by drought can rest confident that the federal Labor government will do everything in its power to bring in well constructed, targeted policies that will assist them through this very difficult period. the second chamber. In fact, it took me some time to figure out how to get the second chamber on my television set. We are talking about the plight of Australian farmers hereMr Lindsay interjectingTechnology and Regional Development, the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Lindsay), is an expert on television sets. I do not get the opportunity to watch television much; I am too busy working to become an expert in that field, so I will let him tell me how to change the channels. In the other chamber we are talking about whether or not university students pay $100. It is really earth-shattering stuff that is going on in the House, really important stuff. I cannot help but comment upon the fact that I served on university councils to which I was elected on a number of occasions. I remember a debate of 2112 hours on one occasion as to whether we should pay 4c or 2c deposit on soft drink bottles. On another occasion we debated for three days the issue of one vote, one value. The relevant motion had been moved by a chap who was elected as a vice-president by 200 votes when there were some 1,000 electors putting somebody else up. SoI renect upon the relative importance placed upon the farmers in this",172,Representatives Main Committee

299,Mr Katter,"Obviously, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry,Wednesday, 21 September 1994 MAIN COMMIITEE 1351 country in view of the stupidity and frivolous legislation being passed in the House. It gives a clear indication of the thinking of the federal government with respect to farmers. Let me put the matter into perspective for the few of us who are here listening, although I note that we do circulate some of our speeches so there will be a large number of people at least reading what I have to say. One of my very best friends has left his station property to go working as a clerk, leaving his wife at home so that he can hold on to the station property. His brother has gone to work as a plant operator so his family are by themselves. Where we had property until recently, my neighbour, a very fine young man, worked for six months navvying in the railway, away from home, with his wife and three kids left by themselves, 200 kilometres to the nearest town. Not surprisingly, that very successful marriage collapsed as a result of the brutality forced upon him by the systems that exist in Australia. I will have more words to say about that further down the track. My good friend told me that his neighbour is away selling Amway. That is how he is holding on to his station. When you go into the station homesteads these days, it is amazing because there is nothing on the walls. There is not a print or even a picture on the walls; there are not even any family photographs in frames anywhere. It is depressing beyond belief. The last time. I visited a station I sat on a wooden stool because there was literally no furniture in the house. I am not saying that five or maybe seven per cent of people out there are not doing reasonably well and not living in these sort of conditions but there is a very large proportion-and I am saying 20 per cent-that are living in homes without anything on the walls whatsoeverMr Bruce Scott-Poverty. socialist government won the election, if you worked as a railway worker in Julia Creek or you had a small holding outside Julia Creek, seventh, eighth and up to ninth grade schooling was available for your children in Julia Creek. That school has been closed, so if you want a secondary education beyond seventh grade, you have to send your kids away to a boarding school. The cost of the very reasonable and very excellent boarding schools in Charters Towers, which educate most of our children in north Queensland in this situation, is about $8,000 to $9,000. The maximum amount of government assistance, it appears to me, and I am informed, that people can get is about $5,000. There is no way that people who have an average income of minus $24,000 are going to be able to put $8,000 away to enable their children to get an education. This is one of the very few advanced countries in the world where a large sector of the population now has no secondary education available to it. We are not talking about tertiary education. We are not talking about whether we pay an extra $200 a year for student fees, as with the frivolity in the other place; we are talking about basic secondary education. I do not know how many doors are left open-very few, I suspect-in our society today to people who have only a seventh grade education. I will shortly come to why grinding poverty and oppression has been imposed by this government. It has not been something that is the result of the natural interplay of market forces or of natural conditions such as drought. Where we had a little piece of land, I think there were 10 of us, but there are now only two station owners left-possibly three-and one of those stations is on the market. I suspect another one will go on the market shortly. They have been sold up by the banks. When these people leave the stations, it is not like losing a job, because they still have some sort of",176,Representatives Main Committee
300,Mr Katter,"An absolutely grinding poverty. In the state of Queensland since the1352 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 21 September 1994 income. It is not a very good income but they leave with an income called unemployment benefits. When a station owner is booted off his station he takes with him maybe $50,000 or $100,000 or $200,000 in debt. So he takes bankruptcy, which is pretty damn unpleasant, or wears that debt for the rest of his days. I might add that some of the people in that situation-particularly the sheep farmers now that sheep prices are coming back-are being pushed out a window and taking the tax debt with them. Even if they take bankruptcy, they must still pay off the tax debt. That is the degree of oppression and human misery that is occurring. In the last two years in the tiny area which was myoId state electorate we have had five suicides. One of them had been the local president and, if my memory serves me correctly, an ex state president of the Cattlemens Union. He had the unenviable task of shooting 100 of his little steers which he did not have the money to keep alive. He shot them to at least enable his cows to survive. In even reasonably ordinary times he would have been able to buy fodder or at least supplementary feed that would have enabled the cows and the calves to survive. In this case, probably half the cows will be lost. The banks were also bearing down upon him, I would imagine. In the depths of his human misery, after four generations of hard work and sacrifice and after watching every single thing that was built by that hard work and sacrifice being lost to him, and knowing that he could not pass on the same advantages that he had enjoyed to his children, he took the ultimate and terrible solution. He was only one of five. A combination of stresses imposed by the regime of oppression that has come down on these people as they lose their jobs and feel the hopelessness of never being able to get a job was the cause, in my opinion, of those five suicides. Those are the suicides that I know of. I am not in a position to know of all the suicides that occur in that area any more. I have not bothered to talk very much in party circles or even in public about these drought relief measures because they are so frivolous and ridiculous. The farmers are going to get nine months of social welfare benefit and that is only if they leave. So what we are actually doing is forcing people to leave the land. That is the solution of this government. It is with deep pain and regret that I say that I do not understand how any of the farmers in Australia have a body representing them called the NFF. I do not understand how its director last year said that one in three farmers had to go. As Julian McGauran, a senator I am very proud of in the National Party, said: 'Who are you? Are you the PR officer for the banks? You are the spokesman for the liquidators, are you?' The NFF director has not recanted or apologised. That was the position he took, and then the same people had the temerity to attack proposals being put up by us-and I thought they would have applauded any assistance. I will bet London to a brick that they applaud the proposals that come forward this afternoon. One has to ask questions about these people. If they take money to do a job and sell out the people that they are supposed to be doing the job for-and I would add to this the actions of the NFF on the issue of Mabo-all I can say is that there is a name to describe them, which I am not going to use. Other people who are listening and are conscious of what we are saying here today can put that name on people who take someone's money and then sell them out. Let me now tum from the emotional side of this-I do not think we can understand it unless we can see the emotional side of it-to the hard statistical evidence that is out there. There have been four reports, and each of them has been a very fine, professionally prepared report. Wednesday, 21 September 1994 MAIN COMMITTEE 1353 One report was done by the Queensland Farmers Federation. Another report was commissioned by the ABC and other people at Longreach. I pay very great tribute to them. A report was done by the UGA. John Wilson was the author of that report and he is an excellent person. A very brilliant report was done by Peter Newman of the DPI Arid Research Centre at Longreach. Those reports aJl confirm, reconfirm and reinforce in one's mind the situation-I am specifically referring to Peter Newman's report-that more than half of the farmers of inland Queensland owe in excess of $500,000. Their projected income for the forthcoming year is minus $24,000. We are now talking about providing them with unemployment benefits for nine months, if they will run away with their tails between their legs. Many of these people came to the most barren land on earth. The first three exploration parties to the north were wiped out to a man. Kennedy's party was wiped out with only one survivor, Jackey Jackey. Burke and Wills were wiped out-there were no survivors out of those who had continued into Northern Australia-and Leichhardt's party vanished without a trace. They were the first three attempts by Europeans to venture into this land, and yet the farmers of inland Queensland have turned the land into some of the most productive parts of the planet. That is what these people have achieved. I never cease to have immense pride in reflecting upon the fact that if I had driven across myoId electorate from Cloncurry to Hughenden 100 years ago, I would not have seen a single goanna, or kangaroo, or emu, or anything. There were no human beings; nothing. The land was completely barren because there was no surface water. Today there are an estimated two million kangaroos in that area. There are people in the area who are producing maybe $300 million a year in export earnings for this country. The thanks that these people are getting from their country is in the form of handouts-toothbrushes and food parcels. Heaven only knows that what the people in the cities are doing is a wonderful thing; but how humiliating, how degrading! Have a look at a race of people who have been reduced to mendicants. Go to the Todd River in Alice Springs and have a look at what handing out taxpayers' money does to an individual and what it has done to five individuals whom I knew in my electorate. They were all people whom I knew well, but they are now dead. They chose to shoot themselves rather than to continue in the pain and misery in which they worked. Who is to blame for this? When I buried my father, I gave a lot of thought to what I would say. People probably give more intense thought to what they will say at their father's funeral than they would give to many other things in their life. Many wonderful things have happened for people in Queensland-for example, the coal that has been mined, the dams that have been built and the artesian bores. The most important thing that happened to the people who live in inland Australia was the minimum price scheme for wool. For the first time in our history we could have some sort of security. We looked with hungry eyes at the sugar industry. I am pleased that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology ( Mr Lindsay) is here because he will back me up in saying what a wonderful industry the people within that industry achieved with their statutory marketing. They built the most magnificent and secure industry of probably any that we have in Australia. When the wool industry got statutory marketing in a very mild form, for the first time in our history we went through two decades of stable reasonable prices. 1354 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 21 September 1994 According to Senator Ron Boswell, in a very brilliant speech in the Senate, the week before Mr Kerin's infamous press conference-and I do not blame him, he was forced to do it by our wool and we were selling it at 890c a kilo. The week after Mr Kerin's press conference, we were selling arguably only 20 per cent, most certainly not more than 30 per cent of the wool clip, and we were selling it at the minimum price of 870c a kilo. Of course, the government ultimately abolished the wool marketing scheme. All right, people can ride the laissez-faire capitalist system; they can ride the roller-coaster; but they can just hope and pray that when the price is down they do not get hit with a drought. It is goodbye time for them if they do. We can ride the droughts. Give us a reasonably stable price and we will ride the droughts. We have weathered 100 droughts in the last 100 years-20 or 30 huge droughts, anyway, in that period of time. We can do that. At times we can even weather interest rates of 10 and 15 per cent-a regime that does not exist anywhere else in the world for farmers. But we cannot stand up to a regime of 25 per cent. In fact, I do not need anyone to tell me what farmers are paying in interest rates. In our last year on St Francis station we paid, with bank charges, 29 per cent interest rates. Even at 25 per cent, debt is doubling every 3 112 years. When we went into our seventh year of debt, for people who had started with a mild debt of $100,000, that doubled and doubled again. Then they are up to the half million dollar mark, which is exactly the figure quoted in all of those things-and I think that $100,000 in debt would have been a fairly average figure. How could anyone impose a regime of 25 per cent interest rates and expect businessmen of any ilk to be standing upright? Our bankruptcies roared away from 4,500 a year when the ALP government was elected to 16,000 a year by 1990-91. Now for every bankruptcy that occurs there are maybe 10 or 20 people who go broke. In fact, I only know one person who has taken technical bankruptcy, but I know hundreds, maybe even thousands if I were pressed, who have gone broke and lost everything. They have lost more than everything; they have walked away with a huge debt on their shoulders. For the rest of their lives they will have to try to pay off a debt of $100,000 or something of that nature. What the government can and should be doing is what every government in Australian history has done. The government can borrow money. The bond rate is six or seven per cent. It can borrow money at six or seven per cent. Please, why can it not borrow that money at six or seven per cent and parcel it out to the fanners at six or seven per cent? There were special help banks. There was the Commonwealth Development Bank which has been commercialised and abolished as a special help bank; there was the Agricultural Bank in Queensland which has been abolished as a special help bank; there was the Primary Industry Bank of Australia, PIBA, which was established as a special help bank, which has been commercialised. There is no special assistance available this time. For the first time in Australian history-in this century, anyway, as far as people's memories can go back-the fanners have had to face a situation where there is no special help bank out there. They just had to wear the 25 per cent interest rates or fall over dead. The government has said, 'We have been generous to you, we have given you $100 million.' What absolute rubbish! It has not given $100 million to the farmers. That money goes to the banks-that is where the money is going-because the banks are borrowing at five and six per cent and are loaning that money out at 10, 11 and 11112 per cent. That is what is happening. And that money is going to pay the ridiculous margin. No banking group anywhere else in the world is enjoying the margins enjoyed by the Australian banks at present.",177,Representatives Main Committee

Heaven only knows that if we had some sort of formula by which write-offs could occur then the banks would be very reasonable in many cases in allowing those write-offs to occur. During the Great Depression, the farming sector was not in as much trouble as it is now. Interestingly, there were only two years in which the farming sector was worse off than it is now-in terms of both the number of people in trouble and commodity prices.

This is a very important issue. The bills before us are the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2), the Wine Grapes Levy Amendment Bill, the Primary Industries Levies and Charges (Wine Grapes) Collection Amendment Bill and the National Residue Survey Administration (Meat Chicken) Amendment Bill. I want particularly to address the chamber at the moment about the ravages of drought in Queensland and New South Wales, bearing in mind that the weather pattern is moving further south. My colleague the member for Kennedy( Mr Katter), who spoke before me, is no doubt going through the pain and suffering with his Queensland constituents. I know the pain and suffering that is occurring in his area, and also in other parts of Queensland and in New South Wales, where people have been in the grip of drought for many years. I also heard the contribution made this morning by my colleague the member for Mallee( Mr Forrest), indicating the spread of the drought further and further south into the grain growing areas and the grazing areas, right down through his electorate and also into my electorate, which it abuts in north-central Victoria. During the last week I took the opportunity to go through some of my rural areas-areas like St Arnaud, the shire of Kara Kara, Newbridge and Logan, which are right on the brink. The weather pattern is moving further south every day and it now extends right down to the Great Dividing Range in Victoria. I have never seen areas like Kyneton and Redesdale, Elphinstone and Harcourt in such a state. These are areas that normally at this time of the year are very green and lush, and at the moment there is absolutely no growth there. As I say, the ravages of the drought are moving further and further south. There is one thing that I want to put to the parliamentary secretary who is present, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology ( Mr Lindsay). I do thank him for listening to the debate, because there are a number of issues that require, I believe, bipartisan support on drought relief. It is not only the impact of drought at the present moment that requires attention but also the provision of drought proofing of properties. rural community on an ongoing basis and on a permanent basis to take precautions and undertake drought proofing.
