40,Mr Greene Asked The Minister Of,"honourable member's questions are1. Persons suffering from consumption are considered as falling within the prohibition in paragraph d of section 3 of the Immigration Restriction Act, and on arrival are declared prohibited immigrants. on a visit only, they are, in ordinary cases, permitted to land on an exemption certificate if they undertake to follow proper precautionary measures against the spread of the disease. If they desire to land with a view to remaining permanently in Australia, the question of their admission depends largely upon the prospects of the cure and the chance of their becoming a charge on the public. If the disease is in the curable stage, and if security is given that the person concerned will be adequately maintained, a certificate of exemption is granted for a limited time At the end of the period of exemption a further examination is held, when the question of cancelling or enforcing the prohibition, or extending the exemption, is decided. 2. Dr. Norris, Director of Quarantine, supplies the following answer :"" No. There is, I am informed, no special value in the climate of any part of Australia for consumptives. The prevalence of the disease throughout Australia is stated to be due to the large number of cases which came here in the past and spread the disease among the local residents. England curable by residence in Australia would, I am informed, be curable in Englandi f properly conditioned. tives coming to Australia have recovered and become useful citizens. have died, the fact being that it is exceptional for cases in the early stage of the disease to be sent to Australia. This course is usually a last resource."" 3. Dr. Norris, Director of Quarantine, supplies the following answer :"" I am aware that when a consumptive is not only instructed as to the proper precautions, but is also f u l ly alive as cate what the opinion of the House was. to their importance, and has the moral sense to observe them, the risk of the spread of the disease from a consumptive in the early stages of the disease is not great, but when a case previously careful becomes advanced, I am informed that with the growing weakness there is not uncommonly a relaxation of morale and care, and the case may become a public menace."" 4. The Government will consider such cases as present themselves, and deal with them as seems best, but are desirous that the difficulty of extirpating the already large amount of consumption in Australia should not be increased by the importation of fresh sources of infection from outside. maintain the existing prohibition as is done in other countries, for instance, Canada and the United States. posedThat the House of Representatives approves ment . was sufficiently so to have his of the fresh distribution of the State of Queensindorsement. land into Electoral Divisions as proposed by minority report, what alteration did he sugMessrs. W. J. Gall, A. A. Spowers, and W. H . gest? Although he declared that he was Graham, the Commissioners for the purpose of -distributing the said State into Divisions, in their report dated the 22nd day of August, 1912-, and laid before this House on the 27th day of August, 1912; and that the names of the Divisions indicated on the map referred to in the Report be adopted with the exception that the name ""..Landsborough"" be altered to reatr ""Lilley."" If they have come here regret very much that the duty should again devolve upon me to protest against the proposal of tbe Minister. I have several reasons for taking this course. I am not intimately concerned, because, as I dare say the honourable member for Capricornia will mention later, even according to this proposal 1 I shall have a majority of over 3,000 votes, that is on the figures for the last election. I am voicing the attitude adopted by 4,300 members of the Amalgamated Workers Association who have protested against the division. A great many of these people are in the hinterland of Cairns, and do not desire to be severed from what has beer* their political centre, and is now their commercial centre, and with which they have direct communication by railway. TheyA case from are in the existing Herbert electorate, and) possibly 3,500 of them are in the portionI t is known that consumpwhich it is now proposed to sever from that electorate.

The fact that the objections which were then-, made were sustained by a majority of tbe House should have been sufficient to indiThe Commissioners have entirely lost sight of the fact that the majority of the House voted with me and sustained my objections. And yet they have sent in what is practically the same re-distribution as the one rejected by this House. The first report of the Commissioners was unanimous so far as the Herbert electorate was concerned, but Mr Graham, who sent in a minority report, said that he was not entirely in favour of the first distribution, but It is intended, therefore, to that, having signed it, he'would be loyal to his colleagues on the Commission and abide by it. When he sent in his minority report he made no reference to Herbert or Kennedy, the two divisions to which he had agreed previously. Thereby he confirmed tory as he would have desired, the arrangeBut when he sent in his",16,Diseased Immigrants

43,Mr Bamford (Herbert) [10.49],"Inot satisfied with the division first made, his only suggestion was that the southern boundary of the then proposed Herbert -electorate should be shifted about 30 miles further south. This would include on a generous estimate 200 additional electors. I really believe that from 100 to 150 would comprise the whole of the electors who would be in the additional portion that he desired to add to the original proposition. Now what is intended by "" community of interest""? indicate whether it should be community of interest from an agricultural, commercial, or political point of view. I consider that community of commercial interest and means of communication should be equal at any rate to the agricultural community .of interest which Mr Graham himself indicates is not everything, because he said in his minority report, referring to community of interest so far as the sugar industry was concerned, that it would be impossible to get all the sugar districts into one electorate, and that therefore that was a matter which might be ignored to a great extent. Mr Graham now, however, stultifies himself by adopting a re-distributhat when an objection is raised^ it shall be tion entirely different from what he himself proposed. So far as commercial interests are concerned, the whole hinterland of Cairns is identified with Cairns. It does all its business with or through Cairns, and has direct means of communication with it. There is a main line of railway running from Cairns to Chillagoe, 139 miles, and several branch railways running from it. The first junction is at Biboohra, 41 miles from Cairns, where a branch line runs off to Mount Molloy. The next branch comes in at Mareeba, 46 miles from Cairns. There is another at Tolga, 64 miles from Cairns, where what is called the Tolga-Johnstone River railway runs along the crest of the tableland and opens up a new agricultural area. Another branch railway goes off at Boonmoo to Stannary Hills and Irvinebank, both mining centres. At Lappa Junction there is another branch line running to Mount Garnet. At Alma-Den, 121 miles from Cairns, there is another branch running to Charleston, also a mining centre, and finally there is a line from Chillagoe to Mungana. All these are feeders to the main line, and give direct communication with Cairns, and the towns on them have their business relations with Caims. Almost the whole of. this hinterland is, under the prothe first Federal election. They think that posed division, politically severed from Mr Bamford. Cairns. The most remarkable thing done by the Commissioners is this: Mareeba, 46 miles from Cairns, Atheiton, 68 miles from Cairns, and Herberton, 80 miles from Caims, are all on the one line of railway, and all in the State electorate of Eacham. But by some extraordinary mental process the Commissioners have put Mareeba and Herberton in the electorate of Kennedy, while they have allowed Atherton, which is between the two, and on the same line Parliament did not of railway, to remain in the electorate of Herbert. The whole thing is absurd. The Commissioners have been charged with incompetency, and I say that the charge is well sustained in this regard. They have ignored means of communication altogether. They have flouted the desire and intention of Parliament, because they have taken no notice of the objection raised here by myself, and sustained by a vote subsequently taken. not tell them what they were to do. should be done. The Act does not require put in writing. But that ought to be the case. An objection should be signed by the person making it. In this instance the objections were verbal, and were made by the sugar-growers of Cairns and Proserpine. The mayor of Mackay told me that he was in Brisbane on other business when he received a telegram asking him to raise an objection to the redistribution. Tbe result of his interview with the Commissioners was successful. If the Commissioners had done their duty they would, at least, have kept a diary in which, all these various objections would have been entered, with the names of the persons who made them. The mayor of Mackay is not himself a sugar-grower, and is only indirectly interested as a business man of Mackay. the objection on the ground that he was an elector, but to suit the wishes of the sugar-growers. The Australian Sugargrowers Association are at the back of this movement, and behind them is the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which has always cherished the hope of being able to win back again that little bit of black-labour country which was wrested from them at their hopes are now approaching fruition,",17,Electoral Divisions Queensland

Possibly there would not be time to bring the new distribution before this Parliament. Even if it were accepted by this House, it would have to be endorsed by another place.

A scheme for the redistribution of electorates is one of the most important and statement made by the honourable member delicate matters that could be put before a Parliament, since it is a matter that personally affects every one of us. When the previous redistribution scheme was before the House, I did not speak to the motion for its adoption. Unfortunately, a vote was taken whilst I was away from the House, although my absence was of less than an hour's duration. I made a public statement, however, that the policy of the Ministry was that there was no-"" thing in the redistribution scheme that demanded that Parliament should take serious exception to it. I said that we might differ on the question of .whether or not it was the best scheme that could be framed, but that that might occur in connection with any redistribution of seats. Assuming the bona fides of the Commissioners-and these gentlemen were aptended to support their scheme. The honourable member for Herbert to-day has urged another reason why this particular scheme should be adopted. He has pointed out that if it were returned to the Commissioners, it is to be assumed that they would resign, inasmuch as they would regard such an action on_ the part of the the honourable Parliament as an imputation on their bona fides. The honourable member for Darling Downs says that this determination on our part is a new-born one. I do not know that it is. I would remind him of the action of a previous Government of which he and the right honourable member for Swan were members, in respect to the redistribution of Federal electorates in Western Australia-a n action going to the very verge of corruption. The honourable member for Illa""warra, who was Minister of Home Affairs in that Government, submitted, in appreciative terms, a motion to approve of the redistribution of electorates in Western Australia, but the whole of his colleagues in the Ministry voted against it.

80,Sir John Forrest,"I think it hasscheme should be again sent back to the Commissioners. What has taken place shows clearly that the existing system has broken down, and that some other arrangement is necessary. No doubt, our intention in the matter was good. We intended, by the appointment of .Commissioners for the distribution of the States into electorates, to put this very important work, which is the foundation of our parliamentary system, into the hands of independent and capable persons, free from all political influence. We intended to avoid the evils of political wire-pulling and gerrymandering, but I ask the Prime Minister now to say whether our desire has been attained. honourable members on both sides are equally anxious to do the best they can for the parties to which they belong, but it must be admitted that our attempt to separate this matter from all political influence has entirely failed. rate parties in this House, so long shall we find honourable members joining to shield a member of their party from the danger of losing his seat.

The present Attorney-General, when dealing with this matter in 1903, said that it would be a lamentable thing if politicians were allowed to divide the States into electorates to suit themselves. but I ask whether this lamentable thing has not already occurred ? I do not desire to blame any party or individual in particular in the matter, but I ask honourable members to say whether, on previous occasions, political support has not been secured to bring about what the Attorney-General described as ""a Then there is the honourable member for Gwydir. Sir JohnQ cause I desire to point out his inconsistency. He took up a very high-minded attitude in 'regard to this matter. He was, in fact, heroic. On the 23rd November, 1909, he saidHas it come to this-that in the National Parliament a question of the boundaries of electorates is to be determined by the political necessities of an individual ? We have all heard the honourable member orating in that style. I wish he were present, because I desire to tell him that it has come to this. Only a few weeks ago the honourable member himself voted to provide for the political necessities of an Probably, individual. Then we have the Prime Minister's statement in 1909I wish to say, in the plainest possible language, that a Government that lends itself to that kind of thing is unfit to occupy its position, because an attempt to manipulate elecSo long as there are sepatorates and to take the work of electoral distribution out of the hands of the responsible officers appointed for the purpose is about the nearest approach to political corruption. Does he not think that the action of the Government in having no opinion upon this matter will encourage a condition of things which, to use his own words, constitutes ""about the nearest approach to political It is corruption."" Certainly it does not tend towards the attainment of his high ideal. When an honourable member's It is useless to find fault with the system unless we are willing to alter it. I do urge upon the Government that the head of the Electoral Department should not be a departmental officer in the ordinary acThat is quite reaceptation of the term.

We are actuated by all sorts of motives in personal and party matters. an independent tribunal of competent persons we ought to abide by its decision. The Government have given their case away by saying that they will support any redistribution scheme, even if it has to be referred back to the Commissioners a dozen times. knows that we are taking the proper stand as a Governmenta stand which he himself did not take when he was a member of a previous Ministry. of this procedure just as much when I was a Minister as I do now. I do not think that Parliament is an impartial tribunal, which is fit to consider this matter. The sooner a properly-constituted tribunal is established in each State to deal with the re-arrangement of electoral boundariesa tribunal whose decisions will be final-the better will it be for all concerned. The existing system, if it be allowed to continue, will only bring discredit upon us. It would be much more satisfactory to every honourable member to know that the determination of the boundaries of his electorate was in the hands of three or four competent and impartial persons, whose decision would be absolutely final. Of course, it would be necessary for them to exhibit a plan of their redistribution scheme, say for a month before it became operative, so that everybody might be afforded an opportunity of pointing out directions in which it might be improved. I desire to make a personal explanation. When the Prime Minister was speaking I stated, by way of interjection, that when the electoral boundaries of Western Australian divisions were under review I voted with the honourable member for Illawarra. I have since found that in the division-list I was paired with the "" Noes"" on that occasion, and not with the "" Ayes."" My colleagues, however, will bear me out that my attitude towards that question betokened my intention to stand by the honourable member for Illawarra. few minutes ago that I had been paired with the "" Noes."" If we appoint [11.40] I should not have risen, but for the remarks of the right honourable member for Swan, who appears to think that the practice of returning to the Commissioners appointed to frame the boundaries of the electoral divisions in the different States, in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, the scheme on which they have agreed, is a dangerous and a bad one. I cannot see that it works out in that way. I agree with those who say that Parliament should not fix the boundaries of electoral divisions; such an arrangement is unthinkable, because, in any Legislature, it would lead to chaos. The constitution of the Commissions appointed for the different States is unobjectionable. One member is the Surveyor-General of the State, who ought always to have a good knowledge of its physical features, having travelled about it so much in connection with his ordinary work, and another is an officer of the Electoral Department. Possibly, it would not be a bad thing to appoint also a senior magistrate. But there is nothing shocking, degrading, infamous, or corrupt in the action of Parliament when, having reviewed a proposed redistribution, it says, in effect, to the Commissioners, "" Gentlemen, we do not think ourselves capable of properly arranging the boundaries of the electoral divisions of this State, but we are of opinion that, in carrying out this work, you have committed an error, of judgment in a certain direction,"" giving the reasons for that view. The honourable member for Swan seemed to regard it as a terrible thing that a majority of those supporting this Government deserted it in regard to the last redistribution scheme. He forgets that Ministerial supporters are not bound to follow the Government on all occasions. I should have thought very little of Ministers had they not stood by the recommendations of their Commissioners, but there is nothing corrupt in independent members refusing to endorse those recommendations. party one. been a party one?

When Parliament declines to accept the recommendations of a Commission, it does better to give a reason for its action than to throw back the report on the Commissioners without giving any reason. I do not blame the Commissioners in the case referred to. The law gives certain directions to guide them in the performance of their duties; they are instructed to give consideration to probable changes in the arrangement of the population of a State, and cannot be blamed for doing so. But to empower Commissioners to take into consideration possible fluctuations of population in various districts must always give rise to the conflict of opinion. three members in this House, the least affected by party bias, were asked to say how, in their opinion, population would vary in half-a-dozen districts within a short time, There is a good deal more patronage with their replies would probably differ materially. always be great differences of opinion. Therefore, the last thing we should do is to impute dishonesty to the Commissioners. What is necessary, I think, is to amend the law, so that the Commissioners may be required to have regard only to the location of population on some fixed date. might produce anomalies occasionally, but over a period of years it would work fairly enough, and would prevent discussion such as we have had, arising out of differences of opinion. the boundaries of electoral divisions accordministration. ing to the location of population on a given date. If that were the law, I do not think that these reports would be referred back to the Commissioners. In the case that has been mentioned, I would have preferred to support the Government, but such strong Teasons were given for referring back the report that I had no option but to vote against it. Unless the law is altered, similar occurrences in connection with redistribuDowns and Swan. At the end of the last tion reports will not be infrequent, but they give no ground either for strong remarks about the Commissioners or for the imputation of corrupt motives to members. If they should still be of the same opinion it would be our duty to bow to it. Mr Archibald. matter must be fixed up by persons who are We are independent of Parliament. Honourable members on the other side seem to be very anxious to create a sort of judicial positioi? for the Chief Electoral Officer, and, indeed, for officers of that character. I am not favorable to the creation of wonderful judicial positions. On the contrary, I am utterly opposed to them. The great danger which the Commonwealth will have to face in the future is the creation of a bureaucracy which will govern us. That is a question for the honourable member for Swan and his friends to seriously consider. At the swing of the political pendulum, which must take place at some time or other, they will be faced with the same position as confronts the present Government. I hold the view that a Government really has very little power and influence. The public, however, think that the Commonwealth Government, like other Governments in Australia, possess a tremendous If any power, but the power is really with the bureaucracy. When honourable members talk about the permanent officers being head and shoulders above Ministers, and free from influence, it is mere rubbish. the bureaucracy than there is with the On such questions there must Government, as any one with his eyes open can see. When you have strong men as Ministers, the Government will not be ruled by the bureaucracy. There are some Ministers who never do anything but sign their names as their officers advise, but there are other Ministers who, when a docuThat ment is submitted, ask what it means, and an explanation has to be given. Perhaps, if he is not satisfied with the explanation, he turns down the document and asks for another report. When you get Ministers The Commissioners should fix of that character you have a strong AdI appeal to the House not to be deluded by the humbug which is talked about the wonderful public servants.

I thought the same as he did then, because while it was hard enough to influence one man, it would be. very hard indeed to influence three men. That is how it struck me. would get a better judgment. ""out of evil cometh good."" Directly the Labour party got into power, the Government accepted the recommendation of the right honourable member for Swan, and brought down a Bill providing for the appointment of three Commissioners to redistribute the States. But the right honourable gentleman was not satisfied even with that. He is pleading that the destinies of this great continent should be left in the hands of eighteen men. We are directly responsible to the people for our actions and votes in this House, but the right [151] honourable gentleman wishes to put these eighteen men on a pedestal above public criticism, and to allow the destinies of the Commonwealth to be ladled out to the people, and to the members of the House. The idea is preposterous in the extreme. The honourable member for Hindmarsh has dealt very trenchantly with the position of public servants running the whole show. He observed, quite rightly and justly, that a Minister who goes through the whole of his work tends to make the Government strong. Repeatedly when I have been visiting Ministers in their offices, the deYou viewed it as a partmental heads have come along with a bundle of papers, and said, "" This is soand-so,"" and ""that is so-and-so."" Ministers did not even cast a glance at what they were asked to sign, but they merely not attached their names to the papers. In many instances they might have been signing their death-warrants, without knowing it. The heads of Departments say that a Minister who wants to know the wherefore of things is too meddlesome; because he goes into details too much, and wants too much explanation. That is not the kind of Minister whom they wish to see at the head of affairs. Yet the right honourable member for Swan is quite willing to hand us over body and soul-and the country, too-to the gentlemen who are running the public service. Yesterday, we had an exhibition of what some honourable members would like to see done with the Electoral Department. If there is one Department more than another in which honourable members should take a deep interest, it is the Electoral Department. Because we know very well what gerrymandering has been done in the past in the States. the future. electoral law too pure.

If we are to continue the present system we ought to alter the section which provides that the Commissioners shall exhibit the plans for thirty days and receive objections. What happens is that the Commissioners send us the plan of a proposed redistribution. Those of us who accept the plan go on our way, believing that everything is right, but somebody else sends in an objection, and the Commissioners prepare a fresh plan. We who have had the plan submitted to us can then offer no objection except on the floor of fhe House, and then we have to reject the whole scheme. If the Commissioners are to receive objections from outside there ought to be some method enabling members of this House to offer their opinions to the Commissioners.

They do not as a body ask that Bowen and Herbert shall be included * in somebody else's electorate.

Motion negatived. earlier period of the day I endeavoured, as a personal explanation, to defend myself against certain aspersions which I regarded as being unjustly placed upon me. That opportunity was not afforded me, because, I presume, I was exceeding the Standing Orders. I take advantage of this occasion to complete what I had to leave unsaid. I want to begin by pointing out that there can be no greater strain put upon any public man than that which is occasioned by his leaving the party with which he has been associated for a number of years. I believe that my leaving the Labour party was as great a wrench as I ever experienced in my life. The fact that I had to 0 leave, even politically, many of my intimate friends was, I can assure the House, . no very light experience. It was one which nothing but an overwhelming sense of re' sponsibility would have caused me to un. dergo. As a result of that step I have been subjected, by many persons in one particular quarter, to an amount of abuse, insult, and downright misrepresentation, which I anticipated in some degree, but the full extent of which I had failed altogether to comprehend. This kind of thing has become so customary that I suppose I (Formal). have got used to it, but now and again I feel somewhat inclined to resent it, as I do to-day. It is not altogether an unusual thing for a politician to change his views. It is an equally common thing for electors to change their views regarding politicians, and when such words as "" rat "" and ""renegade"" are hurled at those who have had the courage of their opinions to make a change, it ought to be remembered by those who use such words that they may be casting a wholesale insult upon ^ thousands of electors who, at the next election, will do what I did two years ago. It is noticeable that even in this Chamber there are others beside myself who have crossed the floor. I do not intend to refer to them in any personal fashion, but it has struck me as somewhat singular that in the case of those gentlemen, who no doubt changed their party for thoroughly good and conscientious reasons, not one of them has been subjected to anything in the nature of insult or misrepresentation from this side of the House. It has remained for one or two honourable members on the other side to single me out for this particular distinction. I am glad to be able to say that, so far as members generally on the other side are concerned, I have had nothing but courtesy from them. The insults and misrepresentation have come almost entirely from one or two. I take that as an indication that many of my old friends on the benches opposite are still my friends, and are quite ready to give me the credit which I am willing to extend to those who have joined them of",28,Electoral Divisions Queensland

To increase the number of Ministers, or their emolument, no alteration of the Constitution is needed, but there must be an Act of Parliament. Without legislation, there is no power to appoint or provide for more than seven Ministers of State. covery. Why did the right honourable member tolerate Honorary Ministers in Governments of which he was a member ? ing now a view that I have always held, and to which I have frequently given expression in the past, and this is, I think, an opportune time for again bringing the question forward. At present there are two Honorary Ministers in the Senate and one in this House. If my reading of the Constitution is correct, they occupy an unsatisfactory position, because there is no proper Constitutional recognition of their status. It is convenient to have Honorary Ministers, and I see no reason why we should not give them a position satisfactory to themselves and to the Parliament. Honorary Ministers have no executive power, and are not, unless specially summoned, advisers of the Crown. All who have been made members of the Executive Council continue to be councillors after the resignation of office, although they are not summoned to advise when out of office. The Constitution created seven Ministers only, and under it no more can be appointed "" until Parliament otherwise provides."" If it were in the power of Ministers to appoint Honorary Ministers, there would be no restriction on that power, and they could as well appoint thirty as appoint three, or, indeed, make their whole party Honorary Ministers. Seeing that the present Ministry, as well as their supporters, are bound to obey the decisions of the caucus, I wonder that they have not made the whole party members of the Executive and advisers of the Crown, because that is what they are, in effect, though not in name. Parliament should decide how many Ministers there should be; it should not be for Ministers themselves to decide the matter. There may be precedent in some of the States for the present condition of things, but there is no precedent in the Old Country, where all , the Ministers hold offices and Teceive pay. If necessary, Parliament should increase the number of Ministers and their emoluments, but this should not be attempted in any other way. A Ministry should be strong, its Ministers should be equal in status, and all should be paid. honourable gentleman suggest? tion should be determined by an Act of Parliament. When Premier of Western Australia, I should have liked to appoint one or two Honorary Ministers, but I was advised that 1 had no right tQ..do so; that the member so appointed would have no power and could receive no pay. do not hold portfolios. some office, if only a titular one. I am in tavour of increasing the number of Ministers by making such Honorary Ministers as may now be necessary Ministers of State, and at the same time fixing the number of Ministers, so that no more can be appointed without an alteration of the law. It should not be within the power of any Ministry to say how many Ministers there should be. I am of opinion that the present arrangement was not contemplated by the Constitution, is unsatisfactory, and dangerous, encouraging the creation of placemen. apprehension in regard to the business to be taken this afternoon.

I sincerely hope that the motion moved by the Minister for the adoption of the report of the Commissioners will be carried unanimously as an indication to another place of our views upon the question. The matter is of serious concern to Queensland, inasmuch as, if the scheme be not accepted, that State in all probability will not secure the additional representative to which it is entitled. In some parts of Queensland the people have already accepted this redistribution, and are calling for nominations of candidates for the new electorate of Lilley. That is an additional reason why this scheme should be adopted, so that the electoral arrangements being made by the various political parties in the State may not be upset. I mentioned this morning that the Commissioners appeared to have acted impartially, and I advanced as a reason for that opinion the fact that, whilst the honourable member for Oxley's majority hacl been reduced by a couple of thousand, the majority of the honourable member for Maranoa had also been reduced to the same extent.

When this question was being discussed on a previous occasion I expressed my complete confidence in the gentlemen who had been intrusted with the duty of making the distribution, and said that I was anxious to give them the fullest support. As an earnest of my desire not to interfere with their work, I said that if they were called upon to deal again with the question I should take up the same attitude-that I should not object to any scheme brought in by them, whether it suited me personally or did not do so. I very much object to this Parliament making itself the arbiter of matters of this sort, because I do not think that it is qualified to do so.

I take it that they are specially qualified to discharge the duty, and have given their best attention to it. I rise, not to question the scheme in the slightest degree, but to draw the attention of the Government to what is perhaps a flaw in the procedure adbpted. It seems to me that the Government have acted illegally, though, of course, not intentionally. My view is that the Commission to which the proposed distribution was referred was not properly constituted, -and that, therefore, the recommendation now under discussion is not in order. The Act provides that the Governor General may appoint three persons in a State to be Commissioners, one of whom shall be the Surveyor-General of the State. The duties of the Commissioners are also defined. They are to make a redistribution, exhibit for thirty days maps showing the proposed alterations of boundaries, consider all complaints or suggestions which may be sent to them regarding these proposed alterations, and, finally, report to the Minister. The report, having been received by the Minister, is submitted to Parliament, and it is provided that, if either House passes a resolution disapproving of it, the Minister may direct the Commissioners to propose a fresh distribution. Thereupon they are required to reconsider the matter, and make a fresh distribution, in connection with which it is not necessary to again exhibit for thirty days maps showing the proposed alterations of boundaries. But, in this instance, when the report was referred to the. Commissioners, Mr Stenberg, the Chairman, had gone to Europe. Thereupon the following notices, dated 19th August, were published in the Government Gazette of the 24th August lastHis Excellency the Governor General in Council has been pleased to approve of the commission, dated the 15th day of November, do so. 1911, issued to Ernst Gottfried Stenberg, Harry been allowed to go away until the proposed Frederick Johnston, and Augustus William redistribution had been approved. Piesse, for the purpose of distributing the State of Western Australia into electoral divisions for the election of members of the House of ReforeI knew that he was going. presentatives being withdrawn as from 6th August, 1912, in so far as it relates to the said Ernst Gottfried Stenberg, who is absent from the to have gone, but the Minister is hardly to Commonwealth. His Excellency Council has been pleased to approve of the appointment, during the pleasure of the Governor General, of Amaziah Commonwealth Public Service Inspector for the Sir John Forrest. State of Western Australia, as a commissioner (to act in conjunction with Commissioners Harry Frederick Johnston and Augustus William Piesse), for the purpose of distributing the State of Western Australia into electoral divisions for the election of members of the House of Representatives in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1902-11 ; the said Amaziah Green to act as chairman of the Commission in place of Ernst Gottfried Stenberg, who is absent from the Commonwealth. The question arises-Did this action create a new Commission? If so, I take it that the maps showing the proposed alterations of boundaries should have been exhibited for thirty days, because a new Commission would have to commence de novo. If it is claimed that a new Commission was not created, I ask if it is legal to alter the personnel of a Commission after a proposed distribution has been before Parliament and referred for further consideration? I take it that the proposed distribution must be referred to the same Commissioners. the elections ought to be held without changing the present boundaries of the divisions. cussing this matter because of any result that may flow from the adoption of the proposed redistribution. Fiat justitia. This is not a question of expediency or advisability, but of legality. If a new Commission was appointed, it should have begun de novo, and exhibited its proposed alterations for thirty clays. Apparently, it was held not to be a new Commission, because there was no exhibition of maps. The redistribution originally proposed was put before Parliament, approved by a majority in the House of Representatives, and rejected by the Senate. On sending it back, was the Government justified in replacing the Chairman of the Commission, who had left Australia, by another officer? raise the question ? Mr Stenberg ought not to have be blamed if he did not know that he was the Governor General in going.

259,Mr Mahon,"I distrust the right honAs a matter of fact, it is not more than two or three weeks ago that this House considered a report of a majority of the Queensland Commission; or, rather, considered a report of two of the Commissioners, because the report of the third, who differed, was not crnsidered at all. I question the honourable gentleman's capacity to interpret the electoral law; if he has been inspired by lawyers in the House, who hold similar views, they should have the pluck to get up and express their own opinions. Let them show, if they can, that the Commissioners have departed from the procedure laid down in the Act. Act we passed it was expressly provided that it was unnecessary to exhibit the maps fcr a month previously, and that provision the Commission followed. whose report we are now considering, were on the first Commission; and, therefore, their report is substantially the report which was contemplated under the provision regarding the publication of the maps. I have nothing to say about the new scheme .except that, though an improvement on the original adjustment, it is by no means perfect. At the same time, it must be admitted that it is well nigh impossible to so divide the State as to give complete effect to community of interest and other statutory requirements. I know that to refer the report back would involve a great deal of delay and doubt, and, perhaps, perpetrate an inequitable distribution of the sideration. electoral population.

This, I very much regret, as the member of the district, because it is a pity that an historic name should vanish from the electoral records of the House. In my judgment, the Commissioners have done their work fairly well. At any rate, the boundaries are more symmetrical, some effort has been made to preserve community of interest, and there has been no absurd attempt, as in the previous case, to anticipate the movements of population in thedistant future.

That all the words down to and inclusive of "" Provided further that"" be left out. -The division dealing with the coasting trade is certainly one of the most important in the Bill, but before proceeding to deal with its merits, I should like to discuss the question of what the coasting trade actually means. I understand from the Attorney-General that the intention of the Government is that the coasting trade shall not include any trade being carried on between Australia and Papua; that he considers' that that intention is carried out by the provisions of the Bill, and that any vessels engaged in the trade between Australia and Papua will not be liable to the coasting-trade provisions. It is proposed by the Government to insert the following definition of the coasting tradeA ship shall be deemed to be engaged in the coasting trade, within the meaning of this Act, if she takes on board passengers or cargo at any port in a State, or a Territory which is part of the Commonwealth, to be carried to, and landed or delivered at. any other port in the same State or Territory or in any other State or other such-Territory : Provided that a ship shall not be deemed to be engaged in the coasting trade by reason of the fact that she carries(a) passengers who hold through tickets to or from a port beyond Austin!ia and the Territories under the authuiity of the Commonwealth; or (A) cargo consigned on a through bill of lading to or from a port beyond Australia and those Territories; or (r) mails between nny ports in Australia or in any of those Territories. read a first time. posed that the Act shall not apply to certain ships unless they are . . . "" in the territorial waters of any Territory which is part of the Commonwealth."" The contention of the Government is that Papua is not part and parcel of the Commonwealth. I would suggest to the Attorneymore clear than appears from the definitions to which I have referred. The question arises as to what forms part of the Commonwealth. The covering sections of the Constitution lay it down that"" The Commonwealth"" shall mean the Commonwealth of Australia as established under this Act. ""The States"" shall mean such of the Colonies of New South Wales, New Zealand, Queensland, Tasmania, Victoria, Western Australia, and South Australia, including the Northern Territory of South Australia, as for the time being are parts of the Commonwealth, and such colonies or territories as may be admitted into or established by the Commonwealth as States. . . . . f{ Section 122 of the Constitution providesThe Parliament mav make laws for the government of any territory surrendered by any State to and accepted by the Commonwealth, or of any territory placed by the Queen under the authority of and accepted by the Commonwealth, or otherwise acquired by the Commonwealth, and may allow the representation of such territory in either Houses of the Parliament -to the extent and on the terms which it thinks fit.",40,Tasmanian Grant Bill

281,Sir Robert Best (Kooyong) [3.47],"It seems, therefore, that the Constitution contemplates that any territory which forms portion pf Australia, or which has been accepted from the Crown by the Commonwealth, shall form part and parcel of the Commonwealth. I therefore urge that the Commonwealth means the Commonwealth of Australia as established under the Constitution Act, and that if the government of a Territory is undertaken, as we have undertaken the government and control of Papua, it thereupon becomes part of the Commonwealth as established under the Constitution. At least, the matter is not quite clear, and if the Government intend that the Papuan trade shall not be included in the Australian coasting trade, they might well provide it more specifically and definitely. broadly and generally, that I am largely in accord with the coasting trade provisions of the measure. example of other great nations in endeavouring to establish a gieat mercantile service, and are justified in laying down as a fundamental principle that Australia is reasonably entitled to its coasting trade, and that the earnings of that trade should be secured, if possible, by ships registered and owned in Australia. and object of these provisions. We bave an excellent and substantial shipping industry-one of the greatest industries in Australia-but there is room for almost indefinite expansion, which we may reasonably hope to assure by passing these provisions relating to the coasting trade. There are a number of countries which reserve their home coasting trade to their own ships. Bill, with certain suggested alterations, These include Russia, France, Spain, Portugal, Brazil, the United States of America, and a number of smaller nations. The United States of America further reserves to its own ships the trade between the United States and the Phillipines and other Possessions. Canada reserves its coasting trade to British ships and to the ships of the following countries-Italy, GerEurope, Australians will not engage in marimany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Austria-Hungary, Denmark, Belgium, and the Argentine Republic-because countries open their coasting trade to British ships in consequence of certain trade treaties. The Navigation Commission of 1907 dealt very fully with the quesa few passengers obtaining more palatial and tion of the coasting trade, and amongst other things recommended that all foreign ships receiving subsidies should be prohibited from participating in it. Very substantial subsidies are already paid to a Sir Robert Best. number of shipping companies by their own national Governments. It is also realized that the wages paid, and industrial conditions generally, in the Australian shipping industry are much superior to those in the oversea trade. The Commission discovered that subsidies were paid by foreign nations as follows:Messageries Maritimes-8s . 3d. per mile on. every trip, in addition' to subsidy on shipbuilding. Nord-Deutscher Lloyd-Â£115,00 0 for Australian service. Japanese Government in 1901-Â£53,66 0 for Australian service. The competition which our local companies have to meet is therefore of an unequal character, and it is impossible for them to I am glad to say, speaking give the present splendid wages and conditions if oversea vessels paying smaller wages and giving inferior conditions, areWe are following the allowed to compete with them on an equal footing. In those circumstances, our coasting trade cannot be founded on the open door principle. On a previous occasion, I. took the opportunity of dealing fully with the various factors which justify us in giving the benefit of the home trade to our own shipping industry. A petition was preThat is the design sented to another place, signed for the Federated Seamen's and Firemen's Union of Australasia by Arthur Cooper, general secretary; for the Sydney district of the Australasian Institute of Marine Engineersby Walter Peck, secretary; and for the Merchant Service Guild of Australasia by W. G. Lawrence, general secretary, in favour of the provisions in thewith the design and object of preserving our coastal trade to Australian shipping. They say, amongst other things, that 1. Australian ship-owners would be handicapped if called upon to compete with ownersemploying crews engaged at European rates of wages. 2. Owing to the conditions of life on land being so much easier in Australia than in. time pursuits, unless while doing so they obtain corresponding advantages. 3. Either sooner or later an Australian Navy those will be a necessity, and if our coasting trade is carried on by means of British or foreign bottoms, the Commonwealth will have no recruiting ground. 4. The occasional temporary convenience of slightly more rapid transit in vessels manned with European orAsiatic crews does not compensate for an inevitable national disaster, and the closing of an avenue to manly and remunerative employment for citizens of the Commonwealth. I dealt very fully with most of these matters on a former occasion, but I think that the case for the coastal trade is concisely and fairly summarized in the points I have read from the document circulated by this maritime organization. The important point is that, by reason of the higher wages paid ancl better conditions prevailing in the Australian vessels, the competition of the oversea trade is most unequal. The combination known as the Australian Steam-ship Owners Federation may reasonably be regarded as the backbone of the Inter-State trade, and I have obtained some actual illustrations, which, I am sure, will enable the Committee to realize the very substantial difference existing between the conditions of our own coastal shipping and those of the oversea trade, with which they have to compete. The Australian Steamship Owners Federation alone represents 133 vessels with a gross tonnage of 287,199 tons, and the masters, ofiicers, engineers, and crew engaged on them number 5,030. If the manning scales for which this Bill provides be adopted, as no doubt they will be, the increased cost to this one combination will be, in the case of engineers, Â£ 6 , 7 6 2 ; greasers, Â£11,680; firemen and trimmers, Â£18,460; and A.B's., O.S., and boys, Â£8,512. In other words, if the manning scales for which the Bill provides are adopted, the increased cost in the case of the Australian Steam-ship Owners Federation alone means a total of Â£45,414. The Australian Steam-ship Owners Federation pays to crews, in respect of wages and overtime, Â£562,500 per annum; for stores and provisions for its vessels, Â£417,000 per annum; and for docking and repairing vessels, Â£352,000 per annum. These figures ought to convince honourable members of the very substantial character of the industry which we are now endeavouring to encourage and extend. member a statement of the profits? anxiety and the anxiety of the Committee, in accordance with our fiscal policy, must be to encourage our own industries. This is one of the greatest of our industries, and it is capable of indefinite expansion. It has been urged, with very considerable force, that the encouragement proposed to be given under this Bill to Australian shipping may mean the creation of a combine or monopoly. Let me say, in reply, that I am prepared to run. that risk, having regard to the fact that I believe it is the determination of this House, and, I hope, of the country, that the National Parliament shall have complete control of monopolies, so that it will be competent for us to say that no restraint of trade or detriment to the public shall be tolerated. Our first anxiety, however, should be to establish the industry. If , at any time, there should become associated with it anything in the nature of a monopoly, it will then be our equally important duty to see that that monopoly is fully controlled, so that the public at least shall not suffer. But let us have the industry. That is the point. In support of the proposal to encourage tnis industry, I urge that we have io recognise the unequal competition to which it is subjected. It is very necessary that we should realize the actual facts. The Adelaide Steam-ship Company recently purchased the steam-ship Yankalilla for the Australian Inter-State trade, and I have here a statement showing wages actually paid on a similar vessel engaged in the oversea trade, as compared with the wages that would be paid on that vessel in the Australian Inter-State trade. It shows that in the case of the oversea vessel the wages in respect of the master, officers, and crew would be Â£1,948 16s., per annum, as against Â£4>392 in the case of the vessel engaged in the Inter-State trade, or a difference of Â£2,443 4 Pe annum s r in favour of the vessel paying the oversea rates. Thesefigures,are convincing as to the unequal character of the competition to which our Australian shipping is subjected under present conditions. I have yet. another illustration. We find that wages paid on the White Star liner Medic in respect of deck hands, the engine-room, and the stewards, are Â£ 2 0 3 per month, as against Â£329 ios. which would be paid on a similar vessel engaged in the Australian tiade. In the engine-room department the wages paid on the oversea vessel are Â£270 10s. per month, as against Â£477, whilst the stewards are paid Â£212 5s. per month as against Â£309 in the case of a vessel of like size trading on the Australian coast and. paying Australian wages, or a total of Â£685 15s., as against Â£1,115 res. This is equal to a difference of Â£5,157 per annum. To drive home my point let me put before honourable members a comparative statement showing wages paid on the Inter-State steamer Karoula, and the mail steamer Orontes. It will be seen that I am selecting the highest type of vessels for the purposes of my comparison.",41,Fisher Navigation Btll
282,Mr Archibald,Has the honourable,43,Fisher Navigation Btll
283,Sir Robert Best,"I have not. Mythe highest type. events, one of the highest. For the purposes of this comparison it is assumed that the Orofites has the same number of men as the Karoola, but, as an actual fact, being an oversea passenger steamer, she carries more. The wages paid per month in the case of the Karoola are Â£1,020 ios., whereas on the Orontes, in the circum-. stances I have stated, they would amount to only Â£660 is. Sd. That means that the Karoola must pay Â£4,325 per annum more than does the Orontesi f the same number of men are carried. This statement refers to only one particular vessel. I propose now to refer to the wages paid on the Baralong, of the Bucknall line, which has a nominal horse-power of 450 tons, and is a vessel of 4,191 tons gross, and 2,661 tons net. The articles for the white crew of this vessel were taken out in London on 2nd February last, for a period not exceeding two years, and the articles for the black crew were taken out in Bombay on 30th May, 1911, for a period of twelve months. This vessel has been trading on our coast. She lifted at Bunbury, Western Australia, 800 tons of sleepers for Port Adelaide, and 800 for Port Lincoln. The monthly wages paid on this oversea vessel is as follows :-Deck department, Â£ 6 5 7 s. 4d; engine department, Â£ 8 1 9s. 4d.; stewards' department, Â£ 15 ios., or a total of Â£162 6s. 8d. per month, as against wages paid on the Cycle, a vessel of 3,987 tons gross, trading on our coast, of Â£ 1 3 1 pei month, in respect of the deck department, Â£ 1 7 4 per month, in respect of the engine department, and Â£ 2 8 per month in the stewards' department, or a total of Â£333In other words, the wages paid on the Cycle amount to Â£3,996 per annum., as against Â£1,948 paid on the Baralong, or a difference of Â£2,048 per annum in favour of the oversea steamer. Honourable members will see that it is quite impossible for our cargo * steamers to carry on in the face of such competition. Let us take yet another oversea vessel, the Anglo-Bolivian, a tramp of 5.503 tons, and compare the wages paid on her with those paid on the Cycle, to which I have just referred. I have here a statement showing that the oversea tramp pays in wages Â£2,646 per annum, as against Â£3,996 per annum paid by the Cycle, or a difference of Â£1,350 in favour of the oversea vessel. The difference is so much in favour of the oversea vessels that it is quite impossible for our own steamers to .compete with them. I would remind honourable members in this connection of the thoughtful and careful investigation made by the Royal Commission, whose inquiries are responsible for the coastal provisions of this Bill. A good deal has been said as to the effect of this policy of restriction, and various arguments have been urged against the Bill. They have been summarized thus1. That they are opposed to the Imperial policy. 2. That they will prove detrimental to our industrial progress by restricting facilities for transport. 3. That they will conduce to a monopoly by the local companies, and place the producers and the travelling public at their mercy. As to the first, your Commissioners have already pointed out that the only real and effective safeguard for our Empire, industrially as well as nationally, is the existence of a numerous and efficiently manned mercantile marine-that we shall be best doing our part in this great work by providing the facilities for the establishment and the maintenance of a_ marine sufficient to transport our products in time of peace, and to assist in guarding onr shores ih time of war. That is a fair answer to the objections which have been urged. It is proposed that certain exemptions shall be made so far as the coastal trade is concerned, by reason of the non-completion of the Western Australian railway. I am aware that provisions to that end were in the measure which I introduced on three occasions in the Senate, and the circumstances of Western Australia cannot be ignored; but the want of railway communication between the western and eastern States will soon cease. Should Parliament deem it wise to make a concession in regard to certain mail steamers, it will do so only on the ground of expediency. The CHA'lRMAN The honourable member's time has expired. I do not think that the provisions of the Bill relating to coasting trade should be confined to Australia; they should be extended to Papua. Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company, an Australian registered company, which has done good work in providing communication with, and opening up, Papua, has now to compete for the trade of the Territory with a Dutch line, whose steamers call at Port Moresby, and with a German line. sidy for providing better conditions for its seamen.",43,Fisher Navigation Btll

Tlie CHAIRMAN -Would it not be better to discuss this matter when it is directly before the Committee? a general discussion. My desire is to secure the protection of an Australian company, which will have to pay the rates of wages, and provide the accommodation required of companies registered in Australia, from the competition in Australian watersbecause Papua is a Territory of the Commonwealth-of foreign companies which are not so handicapped. should insist on the company putting on better boats. another way. visions of the Bill are applied to Papua, the shipping whose operations are confined to the Papuan coast will be affected. plication of these provisions to what may be called the intra-territorial shipping of Papua-that is, to the vessels which voyage along the Papuan coast without crossing to the mainland; my desire is to apply it to the vessels which trade between the mainland and Papua. We should give Australian registered companies a fair deal. that the Minister will supplement what has been said by the honourable member for Kooyong, as to the competition of oversea vessels with Australian vessels in the coasting trade, by giving us figures showing the amount of trade done by the oversea vessels compared with the trade of Australian vessels. In 1903, the late Sir Malcolm McEacharn, speaking on the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, stated that the cargo carried by oversea steamers in 1903 was 100,000 tons, and that carried by all vessels 2,250,000 or 2,300,000 tons, and he estiriiated that the Australian ship-owning companies would have received Â£125,000 more in freights had it not been for the competition of oversea vessels. According to his figures the competition did not amount to very much, but there should be more recent information available. We should be told what the competition of oversea vessels amounts to, and of the trade done by those vessels, how much is done by British, and how much by foreign vessels. The competition of oversea vessels with local vessels takes place chiefly between the ports of the eastern States and those of Western Australia, and it is not enough to convince one of its importance to merely compare the rates of wages paid on local vessels with those paid on oversea vessels. I understand, too, that the Minister proposes to move an amendment which will prevent foreign vessels which are subsidized in aid of navigation from engaging in our coasting trade-that practically any subsidy which is not given for services rendered, such as the carriage of mails, will disqualify vessels not British from be proposed that a vessel shall not engage in the coasting trade which is receiving, or under an arrangement is to receive, or in the preceding twelve months has received, directly or indirectly, a subsidy or bonus from any Government other than the Government of some part of the British Dominions. provison ? how many foreign vessels are employed in our coasting trade, and what the facts are regarding their competition? We have had no information on this point from the Minister, which is not fair, in view of the magnitude ot the interests involved. Of the shipping entering foreign ports, 37 per cent, is British. What a field for retaliation that opens up. Do we know the conditions on which these subsidies are granted, or whicli particular lines are to be shut out? The report of the Subsidies Commission in England contains much information on this point, and I should like to know whether the Minister, or the officers of his Department, have read it for the purposes of these amendments. German, French, and Japanese shipping, and the shipping of many other countries I need not mention, would be excluded absolutely from our local coasting trade. Sir Robert Best told us that Germany pays a direct subsidy of Â£115,000 to the North German Lloyd Company; there are also indirect subsidies, in the way of duty-free materials, food stuffs, differential rates on the railways, and so forth. Then France pays subsidies; and both countries grant some aid for the employment of men who are part of the naval reserves. These two countries would certainly be excluded by the terms of the",44,Fisher Navigation Btll

If their competition resulted in lowering wages, or interfering 'with Australian conditions, I should say that it is desirable; but we have not had that information which the Government ought to be in a position to supply as to the full effect of this proposed legislation. We must remember that we are differentiating between foreign vessels and British vessels, while there are British subsidies, of the class objected to, being granted to the latter. For instance, there is not only the subsidy to the mail steamers for services rendered, but Admiralty subsidies which, in 1902, amounted to Â£78,000 a year. If the granting of subsidies is to determine the vessels to be excluded from our coastal trade, then British vessels must also be excluded equally with foreign vessels. The Minister ought to give the Committee an up-to-date statement, such as was supplied by Sir Malcolm McEacharn and.the daily press in 1902-3, as to the actual volume of trade affected by the competition of oversea vessels. If that competition is only small, and substantially does not touch cargo at all, we ought to know the facts. There have been complaints from producers that they cannot get cargo carried to the West. I have had several complaints from my own district that chaff could not be sent there last year, and the producers blamed a shipping ring, and a chaff ring in Western Australia. affected by the Navigation Bill. I doubted the surmise, that there was some association between the shipping and the chaff ring. At any rate, for the last six or seven years there have been complaints that the shipping facilities for produce to the West are not as great as they ought to be;' and if that be so, we ought to be cautious in discouraging the only competitors who can keep the local shipping trade up to the point of efficiency. We ought to have some definite information on the point, because the position is a very serious one for the producers. There is no connection with the West by rail, and Victoria and South Australia do, or, at any rate, did some few years ago, the great bulk of the trade with the West. If facilities for the carriage of cargo are denied, the consumers ought to have something to say. Then we ought to bear in mind the effect, a year hence, of the opening of the Panama Canal. From The Times of the Is it desirable to shut 6th September, this year, the last to hand, I learn that when that canal is opened British vessels, in their communications with Australia, will be still more handicapped than they are under this Bill. Yokohama will be brought 1,805 miles nearer to New York than Liverpool, Sydney will be brought 2,382 miles nearer to New York than to Liverpool, and Wellington will be brought 2,759 miles nearer. After a very exhaustive examination of the position, The Times says that, from the British Imperial stand-point, this tremendous shrinkage of space between the Australasian Dominions and the great American Republic is significant and important. We must be very careful in our navigation laws that we do not impose any additional handicap on British shipping, if their competition, does not affect our local conditions, which, from the point of view of capital, as well as from the point of view of labour, we like to see on as high a standard as. possible. There is another consideration I should like to lay before the Committee. The Archibald Currie line is, I believe, the only one of importance on the Australian register that does a large external trade. In one vessel, this line took 600 horses to India, and this necessitates the employment of a great number of men, who cannot be employed if they have to be paid white wages. These vessels do no local coasting trade, though their competitors do, and those competitors are foreign vessels not on the Australian register. Some of those competitors are subsidized, and I understand that the Royal Dutch Packet Company are now building some new ships to carry on the same trade as that carried on by the Archibald Currie line. At present the Dutch Packet Company trade to Java and some of the other nearer Eastern, ports, while they do some coastal trade with Cairns, Port Darwin, PoTt Moresby, and other places. It will be seen that the one Australian line which can be regarded as covering more than our local sea is largely affected by the competition of vessels that are not similarly affected by our navigation laws. This trade in horses, as I say, requires the employment of a large number of men; and, under the Indian rule of two to one, the company is able to carry two lascars in the place of one able seaman. In addition to horses, this company",45,Johnson The N We Engaging In Our Coasting Trade I T Is To

At present I understand the company cannot arrange contracts for the carriage of rice, because they do not know what the effect of this Navigation Bill may be. Honourable members should remember that we are applying to this company conditions that foreign companies are not affected by -foreig n companies, such as the Royal Dutch Packet Company, which are guaranteed against loss. In. the case of the company just mentioned, the guarantee on two vessels is at present Â£12,000; and it is very hard on an Australian company to be Buddenly faced by this class of competition. take their vessels off the Australian regisment can find a way to exempt from some ter. do so; and, if they must go to England to register, it will be a fact of which we ought not to be proud. gation laws have driven American ships under the British flag. been, spent in connection with the canalmore, if we take into consideration previous futile efforts-in order to restore the American shipping industry, which was destroyed by similar provisions. Clause 11, which deals with certificated officers, and clause 23, which provides that every officer on any Australian ship, or engaged in the coasting trade, shall be a British subject and thoroughly conversant with the English language, are the clauses which will affect the competition to which I have referred. That clause, perhaps, does not touch these ships, because I understand that their officers are all British. Under clause 41, being ships registered in Australia, they will have to comply with the manning scale of the Bill. That will mean a large increase in the crews. Clause 117 will affect them as regards provisioning; clause 134, as regards clothing; clause 135, as regards accommodation; clause 210, as regards bulkheads and double bottoms; and clause 342, as regards exemption from pilotage. If the Minister can find a way to exempt these vessels from some of those clauses the line? spur of the moment. I do not see how we can frame a general clause providing that any vessel registered in Australia, and engaging only ih external trade, shall be exempt from the provisions of the Bill. The effect would be to leave them in their present position with which no doubt they are perfectly satisfied. Many of them are under local awards. engaged in external trade. applicable to the coasting trade, you must indirectly affect the others on the Australian register. You. undoubtedly, apply to other vessels the scale prescribed by the Arbitration Court through unionism, which, I believe, has a very wholesome effect.

Take, for instance, the freight on fruit between Hobart and Sydney, and on to Brisbane. charged on the oversea steamers. show that the freights between Tasmania and the mainland are enormously heavier you like.

Twenty-four bushel cases go to the ton; so that the freight is between 14s. and 15s. per ton for a two days' run. Then, again, the freight on apples between Hobart and Brisbane-and if the honourable member for Denison has any doubt on the matter let me refer him to the honourable member for Brisbane, who corroborated, not two hours ago, the figures that I have obtained -is is. 8d. per case, or 40s. a ton, for a four days' run.

I believe that the honourable member, and others, are now using them as an excuse for refusing to face the difficulties with which we are now confronted. The Bill hands Tasmania, body and soul, over. to the Australian Shipping Combine, whose freights and charges are much heavier than those of the shipping companies trading overseas. For instance, I am informed that about is. a box is charged for the transport of butter from Byron Bay to Sydney, a twenty hours' run, and the same box will be carried from Sydney to London, a forty days' run, for from 2s. to 2s. 4d. Tasmania is in a different position from the mainland States, which are connected by railway, and between whose ports there is a larger fleet of vessels engaged in conveying passengers and cargo. This Government has just renewed a postal contract with the combine for a period of two years. I shall have something more to say about that when the papers are available. I refer to it now merely to show how the Ministry is bolstering up the combine. member voted against the referendum. is to the honourable member what King Charles' head was to Mr Dick; he cannot discuss any subject without introducing it.

It is not possible to travel between Tasmania and the mainland except by the steamers of the combine, and by the oversea steamers, and it is proposed to prevent the oversea steamers from carrying passengers between the mainland and Tasmania. Although they are not undercutting the Australian companies, charging higher passenger rates, and although the passenger traffic during the summer months is so great that the local steamers cannot carry it, it is proposed to prevent people from travelling between Tasmania and the mainland except by the local boats. Can the Minister show that there has ever been any undue competition in the Tasmanian passenger traffic between the oversea companies and the Australian companies, or that the former have ever tried to undercut the latter? member say that the oversea steamers are to be prohibited from carrying passengers be-' tween Australia and the mainland? prevent them from doing so under their present conditions. I shall take another opportunity to deal with the international phase of this matter. I ask the Committee not to take away from Tasmania the opportunity to benefit by what little competition there is. I should like to see that competition much keener, with a view to compelling the local boats to make reasonable charges. At present, their charges are unreasonable and unjust. But, in effect, the Bill says to the local companies, "" So long as you observe certain conditions, you may combine and make ""your charges what you like."" This is a serious thing for the orchardists of Tasmania, who send from 600,000 to 750,000 cases of apples to Sydney and northern ports every year. The honourable member for Brisbane will admit that the charges on this freight are oppressive, being too great in their ratio to the value of the goods"" Honourable members should consider the matter very seriously before determining to prevent Tasmania from using what opportunities she has to break down existing monopolies. The honourable member for Franklin made an exceptionally strong plea for allowing the Peninsular and Oriental, Orient, and other oversea companies to carry passengers between Sydney and Hobart, but the Committee should see that, conditions being fair and reasonable, all the patronage possible should be given to our railways, and to the shipping companies registered in Australia. Only an infinitesimal part of the tourist traffic to Tasmania is carried by the mail steamers, which make a few trips there during the fruit season to obtain cargo for conveyance to the Old Country.",50,Johnson The N We Engaging In Our Coasting Trade I T Is To

Some of these companies and combines are so strong that even a combination of producers cannot break them down. There is no doubt that, in Australia, there is a shipping ring which is powerful enough, not only to charge exorbitant rates on produce carried from port to port, but, as I interjected a little while ago, to be exceptionally "" cheeky "" at the same time. Very often 'a manufacturer who wishes to send goods, say, from Melbourne to Sydney or Brisbane finds them left upon the wharf. mon occurrence. panies are exceedingly curt, merely intimating that there is no room, and that the shippers must take their chance. Mr McPherson, a leading manufacturer and importer, at a Conference of Chambers of Commerce in Sydney, spoke of the high charges made, by what he frankly called, Matters such as these were of great importance to the Australian manufacturer, and required looking into by some such body as aa Inter-State Commission, for their industries might be permanently injured by the operations of the shipping "" ring,"" as British industry, to his certain knowledge, was, and had been, adversely affected by the London shipping "" ring.""

WhatI have read was not uttered by what is sometimes called an agitator on the Yarra-bank, but by a merchant, importer, and manufacturer, in a large way of business, of a pronounced individualistic type. He not only asserts, but is prepared to prove from actual experience, that there is in Australia a Shipping Ring, and he, a pronounced individualist, would support the expenditure of millions of money, in order to provide ships to carry goods, and produce from one port to another. I attach little importance to the statement of the honourable member for Franklin that the exclusion of the mail boats would interfere with the tourist traffic to Tasmania, but he went on to say, what we all know to be a fact, that there is an Australian Shipping Ring.

380,Mr Fenton,"I do not say that itthe terms of the Bill, hoping that a little later on we shall give relief to our fruit growers and others, by dealing with the shipping companies as they ought to be dealt with by the National Parliament. -Australi a is a great producing country, and we have to consider the producers. We are absolutely dependent on British and foreign ships to carry our produce from Australia to European countries; and the more obstacles we place in the way of those vessels the greater difficulty we shall have in competing with the rest of the world. I am quite with the Government in regard to protecting our own coastal ships; but the British-owned ships do not in any way interfere with our coastal trade, except in the England to meet ours. We all ought to be matter of passengers. There is no doubt that people like to travel in the largest ships possible, which they find the most comfortable, and which, I believe, are the safjjr. Unlike the honourable member for Maribyrnong, I would much sooner pay my own passage to travel by boat than I would travel free on the railways as a member of Parliament; and whenever I have time, I always do travel by sea, simply because a long train journey upsets me for a day or two. Our wheat, fruit, and wool have to be carried oversea; and if we hamper British trade it will mean that our producers will have to pay. is a frequent occurrence for persons in Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne to travel to Adelaide to meet relatives arriving boats, because every extra shilling taken there by mail boat from abroad; and will anybody tell me that it would be a fair thing, for instance, to prevent a husband, who bad met an ailing wife or children at Adelaide, from travelling with them on the steamer? If we pass this clause, no man will be able to meet any member of his family at Adelaide and accompany them on the mail boat to Melbourne. white labour, he could. would have to comply with all the coastal trade conditions laid down in the Bill. That seems a poor way of treating people in a country like Australia. Our population is limited, and we are not rich enough to run our own mail steamers. It is a common thing for people to do what is called the ""apple trip "" when the mail boats are running to Hobart in the season. This is a most popular voyage at Easter time; and when I have done it, as I have on several occasions, I have always found the vessels crowded. There are people in poor circumstances, perhaps, who cannot afford to travel from Sydney to Melbourne by rail; and why should they not have a holiday at reasonable rates on a fine steamer? We seem to be getting so selfish that it is to be a case of everything for ourselves and nothing for anybody else. consideration. tralians are not going to be so selfish, mean,' and self-seeking, that they will allow nobody else in the world but themselves to live? We are Britishers, I take it, first of all-par t of the Empire-and we ought to meet British ships as we should like pleased at the increased wages and better accommodation afforded for our sailors. But that ought not to affect our dealings with other countries. Let them make their own laws, but let us allow our people a little freedom when they want to move about. We can afford to be a little generous. We have a big country, and, if properly managed, a rich country, and we should not adopt petty-minded ways of dealing with other people. I believe that the majority of the Australian people are much broader minded than are some of us in this It House. I see no objection to dealing with the intercoastal carrying trade, but surely we can allow people to travel by these from them means an increase in the freights on the carriage of our goods oversea? [5-45]-1 agree with the honourable member for Balaclava that it is necessary to consider seriously every aspect of the question before we commit ourselves to a course of action which may possibly prejudice some people in the Commonwealth who live in other States, and depend to a large, extent for their business, and for a number of industries which are interwoven with that business, upon the large tourist traffic brought by the big oversea steamers travelling between some of the Australian capitals and elsewhere. It is the duty of honourable members representing constituencies which are affected by that traffic, and whose interests will be injuriously affected by undue interference with it, to consider this , phase of the question very seriously.

If we are going to make a restriction of this northwards as far as Cairns, there were kind, so as practically to give a monopoly to our locally-owned steamers, we should certainly stipulate that cargo space, refrigerating arrangements, and passenger accommodation shall, at least, approximate to that which is provided on the vessels whose trade is being interfered with. there is no doubt that the accommodation provided on the Orient, Peninsular and Oriental, and other liners is incomparably better than that provided on the locallyowned boats which usually do these trips. We had evidence, when the Pearling Industry Commission was travelling, of a disinclination on the part of members of this Parliament to go on a locally-owned steamer when another and superior vessel was available. I have referred on more than one occasion to the Warrego, in which we travelled to Thursday Island. Our experiences on her were such as to give us a deep-rooted disinclinato interfere in any way with the sweet tion to return by her. All but two of the Commission were members of the Labour party, but every one welcomed the opportunity to return by the Japanese mail steamer, the Yawata Maru, because she was in every way better found, better built, stronger, more seaworthy, and cleaner, the discipline on board was better, and the food was better. which there was a case of small-pox ? but the best-built boats in the world are liable to that sort of thing. Passengers from the East bring the infection from ashore. If small-pox had broken out on the Warrego, I do not think a member of tbe ship's company, or a single passenger, would have escaped infection. The honourable member for Herbert, the honourable member for Melbourne, and the honourable member for Coolgardie will support what I say. I do not blame any one for wanting to travel in the best boat that he can. If we are going to establish a practical monopoly in the hands of a local shipping combine, which undoubtedly exists, and which some honourable members on the other side have said is a good thing, we should at least insist that obsolete ships which may have been considered good thirty or forty years ago shall not be used in the Australian trade to-day. So far as the carriage of fruit is concerned, on the Wyandra, the boat on which we. travelled from Sydney cases of apples, the fruit being nicely wrapped in tissue paper, piled up as high as the awning on the decks set apart for saloon and other passengers. They were exposed to heavy rains and sea spray, which washed all the paper off the apples, and :<s we got further north they were exposed to Under present conditions the increasing heat. It is not fair to pioducers that their goods should be treated in that way, yet that is the sort of thing that happens under present arrangements. They have to be transhipped at Sydney, after coming from Hobart, consigned to northern ports. Their goods are ruined before they get to their destination. We should insist on proper conditions on locally-owned vessels, in relation to the carriage and stowage of cargo, accommodationfor passengers, and the rights of passengers to that accommodation. There seems to be no attempt at present will of the owners of those vessels in these matters. The rights of passengers are infringed, the rights of shippers of goods are ignored, and both passengers and customers are treated in a spirit of anything but fair consideration. While I have even' sympathy with the proposal to encourage Australian ships to secure the Australian trade without detriment to the equal interests of others, especially British ships, whose interests ought to be just as dear to us as our own, at the same time, if we are going to exclude the competition of the better ships which come from oversea, and prevent our people from using them, either as carriers of goods or for travelling purposes, we ought to insist, if not that equal accommodation should be provided on the locally-owned ships, at least that there should be a distinct advance in the character of their present accommodation. -There is no doubt something in the point raised by the honourable member for Lang, and that it would be advisable before the Bill finally passes to take power ro exercise some sort of supervision of the kind that he indicates. I am rather inclined to think that such power is already given in the measure.

I do not think they have very much to complain of. They are trading to the East, and I believe that most, if not all, of their vessels carry coloured crews. They are simply picking up cargo and passengers for the East in various Australian ports, and returning. with passengers and cargo from the East for Australia. That cannot be called interfering with the Australian trade, and as they do not trade between ports in Australia, I do not know why they register their ships in Australia at all, although I think I could make a very good guess at the reason. There is nothing to prevent them from registering in Calcutta and Bombay, and I think their ships ought to be registered there, because they carry coloured crews, and are more Eastern than Australian in character. their reason for registering in Australia was this: The shipping interests are entitled to representation, on the various Marine Boards of Australia, according to the tonnage registered in each port. 1 have a pretty good idea that vessels are registered in different ports in Australia, simply to secure to the shipping interests voting power on the Marine Boards, and, if it were not for that, some of them would not be registered where they are. I do not say that that is the case with the firm in question, but they have a reason for registering in Australia, and I do not think it has anything to do with this measure at all. Eveni f the Attorney-General makes an alteration in the Bill, I do not believe it will affect their registering. There is a great deal of humbug talked about the Tasmanian apple trade. The mail boats call at Hobart, not because of the passenger trade they get, but because of the apple trade. manians is such that if any company would carry their fruit for a farthing a ton less than do the mail steam-ship companies, they would throw them over to-morrow. My experience is that shipping companies are always ready and anxious to send their vessels wherever a cargo can be secured. If sufficient inducement offered for sending to Tasmanian ports, Inter-State steameis of the class now trading between the East and Western Australia, we may be sure that, despite any provisions which might be inserted in this Bill, such vessels would call there. We cannot interfere in questions of trade. We have heard a great deal of the injustice that will be inflicted on British shipping companies as the result of the passing of this Bill. As a matter of fact, under this Bill we are doing only what the shipping companies or combines of the world themselves do. Surely what shipping combines do by means of arrangements in connection with the carrying trade of the world, we, as a Parliament, are entitled to do for the protection of our Australian trade and the building up of an Australian maritime fleet as a recruiting ground for our Navy. There are a dozen arguments in favour of the clause, and only one or two against it. Why do certain shipping companies carry only cargo while others cater only for the passenger trade? The answer is that it is because of trade arrangement; and the answer to this cry on the part of outside ship-owners is that they are making similar arrangements in their own interests in conI should think nexion with the trade of the world. Those who travel to South Africa and elsewhere can see the significance of these arrangements. One sees vessels flying a certain flag doing only one class of trade, and the vessels of another company engaging only in another class of trade. Some carry only cargo; others carry only passengers. These ship-owners do not like to be interfered with, but we must interfere with them so far as it is necessary to do so for our self-protection. I invite honourable members of the Opposition to explain the iniquity of cutting up the trade of the world, as many shipping companies do. We hear a great deal of the Australian Shipping Combine, but I am not opposed to a combine or trade arrangement provided that its effect is not to rob the public. It is true that we have no power to deal with combines; but it is easy to put forward this bogy, of a combine in order to frighten the people. We are not The patriotism of Tasgoing to allow such a bogy, however, to deter us in our efforts to build up an Australian maritime fleet, in connection with which the highest standard of wages and conditions of labour must be observed. We must recognise that it is utterly impossible for us to have Protection on shore and Free Trade afloat. The honourable member for Angas deplored the lack of statistics bearing on this question, and I think that we should all like to have more. it is worthwhile placing these restrictions on British ships. I do not believe that it is.",54,Johnson The N We Engaging In Our Coasting Trade I T Is To

Had he lived in a shipping port, as I have done for until settlers and others realize that they many years, he would know that the trade nf these oversea mail steamers is practically pended upon. They know that they will confined to the carriage of passengers. The freights on a mail steamer are higher than are those in respect of the ordinary lines of steam-ships, and for that reason the mail there are arguments which can be urged steamers do not get anything like the cargo of the ordinary lines of steamers. Reference has been made to the grievances of Tasmania in this connection. do not think that there is anything in the cry. argument advanced by the honourable member for Franklin, it is that, for the sake of picking up a few apples in Tasmania, and to enable a few rich people to run over there, we ought to break down the whole system that we are trying to build up. The Commonwealth Parliament cannot afford to provide such a luxury. This cry in regard to Tasmania is another bogy. I do not think that the Bill will detrimentally affect Tasmanian trade. It seems to me that there is a lot of electioneering in the outcry, and that it will be retailed in Tasmania. electioneering about it so far as I am conprotect our local shipping against oversea cerned. ing to the honourable member. The Australian Ship-owners Federation are only too glad to send a vessel where cargo can be picked up or trade developed. Government railways, in certain parts of Auslabour conditions here. tralia, have run a good many vessels but of the carrying trade. Steamers have stuck to the coastal trade in some cases, until they have been forced out of it by railway competition. That is not a very nice thing for a Government Department to do, but it has been done, although seacarriage is always cheaper than rail carriage. railways have done that with the Warrnambool and Port Fairy trade. ways Commissioners of South Australia drove off the whole of the shipping running along the coast from Adelaide to the Victorian border. I ask honourable members to realize that the Australian ship-owners are business men; and that they will keep their boats running when they are practically getting only change for a shilling out of the traffic, because they realize that it is sometimes necessary to incur an initial loss are providing a service which can be dethen be fully recouped. I appeal to honourable members to vote for the clause as it stands. 1 am not going to deny that against it, but we have to take a broad view of the question.

Besides, I do not know that we have any obligation now to try to control the social conditions of other countries. Our own problems should be quite enough for us at present. We are better off than the overcrowded countries of the Old World, whose economic conditions are not so good as ours, and we are free to conduct what experiments we please within our own borders. The Australian shipping companies have been very prosperous of late years. Why, then, should we give them a monopoly ? It must not be forgotten that there are the interests of others of our own people besides those connected with shipping to consider.

432,Mr West (East Sydney) [8.0],"Thisthing of which we, as a National Parliament, should be proud, it is that we have taken part in the endeavour to create an Australian Fleet; and a thoroughly efficient mercantile marine is one of the most useful auxiliaries in the defence of the country. We should endeavour to make the conditions of seafaring life so satisfactory as to attract young Australians. The average Britisher does not now take to the sea on account of the small pay and the humiliating conditions of the work; and, therefore, it is that we find that the British shipping, of which we hear so much, is virtually carried on by means of coloured and foreign races. If we can, by means of legislation of this kind, make a seafaring life congenial to our people, we ought certainly to do so. We have been told that there is a shipping 1 monopoly. If that be true, I would rather have a monopoly in the hands of our own people, than a monopoly in the hands of outsiders. competition, there can be no monopoly. site seem to rely altogether on the law of supply and demand, and on that law of cheapness, which has acted so prejudicially to our own race. Under that law of cheapness, people of the same political notions as honourable members opposite have worked women in coal mines in the Old Country, and oppressed people in the factories; and 1 it certainly is not the sort of law that we are going to lay down here. If we are to have a proper Australian mercantile marine, the shipping on our coast must have some sort of protection, and there can only be fair competition when all the vessels trading here are compelled to observe the same wages and conditions. Any legislation that will serve to keep the coastal trade of Aussteamer, but that was not the case. The tralia in the hands of our own people, will have my strongest support, whether that legislation leads to monopoly of not. We know how men at is. a month have been brought out here on British ships, and have traded on our coasts in the big liners; and that sort of thing ought to be stopped. I am not here to cast any| reflection on the great shipping companies which send vessels here from other parts of the world. They conduct their business as they think fit; but, if they desire to trade here, they must observe Australian conditions. What is the good of a White Australia policy if our coastal trade is in the hands of Asiatic and other cheap labour ? If it is said that 1*5*}2 the ships on our coast will not be able to observe the wages and conditions laid down, then they will have to be subsidized, or the industry will have to be nationalized. The latter course is not proposed in the B ill ; but I think the clay is not far distant when all means of transport-ocean , river, and land-wil l have to be nationalized in the interests of the people. We must not depart from the principle that the coastal trade of Australia $hall be in the hands of Australian shipping companies, or those who are prepared to conduct their business according to the Australian standard. There are honourable members who worry about a few cases of apples that are carried by the great steamers at certain periods of the year, and about certain other details; but all these considerations should be swept aside in a National Parliament when legislation of this kind is under consideration. Every encouragement should be given to those in the business to supply better ships and better services, as no doubt they will if the opportunity be afforded. I hope the Committee will support the Government in the endeavour to. keep the coastal trade of Australia in the hands of our own people. If the large ocean liners will not improve their conditions of employment, they must lose the trade, because I cannot see how we can have any open-door policy in this connection.

The stench of the ooze and river mud still pervaded her, and could not be got rid of. self was quite sufficient to breed disease. We ought to take into consideration the fact that the trade of Thursday Island, Darwin, Western Australia, and Papua will probably be very adversely affected by the Bill as it stands, and might consider also whether it would not be of advantage to pay a bonus to make up for any loss which ihe enforcement of the conditions now proposed would entail upon local ship-owning people. In this connection, I wish to bring before the Committee a written statement made to me by a constituent, Mr ing coloured crews shall trade between ports Werner, who is interested in the Papuan trade. He saysThis"" B ill will seriously affect myself and crews, this Act would result in putting back many other Sydney business friends who have the Territory into the same position as it was in interests in Papua.

They desired that some steps should be taken to modify the provisions of this clause so that their trade would not be adversely affected. I have here a copy This could not have of the letter referred to by Mr Werner, as sent to the Minister of External Affairs, and propose to read a few extracts from it. The writer saysAccording to the proposed Act, its provisions will apply to Papua as well as Australia. The conditions of the two countries, however, are vastly different, and what may be of great benefit to Australia may be of great detriment to Papua. This was recognised in the Proclamation which brought Papua under the control of the Commonwealth Parliament, inasmuch as it was therein stated that no Aus-. trnlian Acts of Parliament shall apply to Papua, unless it is specially mentioned in such Act. That is a point that some of our legal friends might look intoThis fairly indicates that the opinion of the Imperial Government was that it would only be in special cases that Federal laws should come into operation in Papua, and, therefore, up to the present time very little CommonThat, in itwealth legislation (except as regards Post and Telegraph control) applies to that State. The Papuan Civil Law is separate and distinct to Australian. The Papuan Customs Tariff is also altogether different, and is framed to suit a country like Papua that is only in the very earliest stages of settlement. Furthermore, Papua is not directly represented either in the Commonwealth Parliament, or in any Australian State Parliament. The natural resources of the country are only just beginning to be developed, there are absolutely no manufactures of any kind, and, therefore, any_ Australian legislation which is absolutely certain to hinder the progress of the country should not be made to apply to it. According to the proposed Act no boats carrywithin the Territory or under the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, and as three out of four companies calling at Papuan ports carry coloured good and regular communication with the outside world. But these three lines carry coloured crews, and if the proposed Navigation Bill_ is to apply to Papua, they must, of necessity, ring the extra expense which such a change would mean. This will leave the country with only one service, viz., Burns, Philp, and Co.'s steamer, the s.s. Malunga, which makes the round trip, Sydney to Papuan ports, once every six weeks. For this particular service Burns, Philp, and Co. receive a subsidy from the Commonwealth Government of, we believe, Three thousand pounds (Â£3,000) per annum, which places that company in a position to effectively block any chance of any other Ausnow all the Eastern goods, such as rice, & c , tralian company starting in opposition. Without a similar subsidy no other company would pay, as owing to the fact that the importations ports and shipped back to Papua, whereas, into Papua are more than three times the amount of exports, it will be readily seen that ports on the run down to Australia, and supalthough an additional boat might secure good freight on the trip from Australia to Papua, it would, owing to the small volume of exports, only have a third of the freight on the return trip. But besides owning the only steamer which would go to PapuaAnd this is an important point for us to considerBurns, Philp, and Co. are established as merchants, or have agencies in all the different ports of call throughout the Territory, and, therefore, they are in direct competition with the whole of the rest of the commercial community. Every merchant and trading company would therefore have to import their merchandise by a steamer owned by an opposition merchant, and it needs no effort to understand how such a'state of affairs would place Papua entirely at the mercy of Burns, Philp, and Co. They complain that the withdrawal of the present boats, whose existence promotes healthy competition, would throw them into the lap of a company that is an absolute monopoly, and that could thus charge what freights they liked, call or not call, as they pleased, and carry, or refuse to carry, merchandise, as they chose. goes on to sayI f Burns, Philp, and Co. were not merchants the situation would be vastly different, but under present conditions the Commonwealth Parliament, if they do not exempt Papua from the operations of the proposed Bill, will be giving a monopoly of the whole of the trade of the country to one company, and also will be subsidizing the monopoly as well, a monopoly compared with which the American Trusts would be feeble concerns. quite certain that this would not be in keeping with the present tendency of political thought in Australia. I do not want honourable members to think I endorse every opinion that is expressed here. There is a possibility that some of these statements are exaggerations. Even allowing for such a possibility, there is a large substratum of truth underlying the position taken up by these people. tract the company have to conform to certain conditions. not think it governs freights. not keep in mind all the conditions of the mail contract, so that I am unable to say from memory whether or not that is so. The letter continuesFurthermore, it would mean that whereas which are imported into Papua in large quantities would have to be brought to Australian now they can be landed direct from the Eastern plied to the natives, whose staple food is rice, at a very low price. The White Australia policy is one in which every patriotic Australian heartily agrees, but to force white labour conditions on to the shipping trade of Papua in the present state of its development would be as reasonable as to make the awards of the Wages Boards and Arbitration Courts of Australia to apply to the Papuan natives who work on the plantations or about the stores, or do tbe menial work in the homes of the settlers. The writer proceeds to make another important point, and we have to consider how this clause would affect the particular aspect of the maritime trade of Papua to which he refersThen there is another manner in which the proposed legislation would seriously affect the development of Papua. Most of the merchants and trading companies in all the South Sea Islands run small schooners and cutters along the coast and to the adjacent islands for trading purposes. These boats, for the most part, are in charge of natives, or one white man assisted by native boys. The conditions of trade would never warrant these boats being The letter manned in any other way, but if the proposed legislation comes into force in Papua, these boats will certainly have to cease trading. It is for the above reasons that the whole of the white settlers in Papua (except, of course, those interested in Burns, Philp, and Co.), recognise that the proposed legislation will be a serious set-back to the development of the country. Unfortunately, as already stated, Papuan residents are entirely without representation in Australian politics, and have no means whatever of bringing their views or inWe are terests before the people of Australia, except by means of the press. He proceeds to point out that a petition has been prepared for presentation to Parliament, which every white settler is at liberty to sign, although I have no recollection of such a petition having yet been presented to the House. He statesA petition has been got up by the white residents of Papua, and will be presented at the proper time. It has been signed, we can confidently assure you, by every white person in the Territory at liberty to sign. Surely the Federal Government, representing the Democracy of Australia, will never foist on an unwilling people, who have no voice in the management of their affairs, legislation which they are",59,Smith A Tribute Of Others Which Equal I T In Efficiency And Capa

It would be much better at any rate, to suspend applying the Act to Papua for, say, 15 or 20 years, or such time as Papua be given by the Parliament in the interests has reached a state of development which would warrant other Australian shipping companies joining in the trade, without the aid of a subsidy. In considering the Defence of Australia, the tive which might well be considered is development of Papua should also be taken seriously into consideration. shipping of their own ? not think those who are developing Papua have sufficient means to embark upon the unterprise of building and running steamers in competition, for example, with those of Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company. They are, for the most part, men of small means, who are living in the tropics under very trying conditions, with the object of developing a country whose development will certainly be an additional safeguard to Australia against possible risk of invasion. That point of view is a very important one, and ought not to be lost sight of by us. The writer goes on to sayLike Thursday Island, Papua is an outpost of Australia. an enemy upon Australia, it will come from the north. Therefore, every facility that can be given to Papua to develop as rapidly as possible should be allowed it, and no restrictions of any kind should be placed upon the country to retard its progress. These statements have been put forward by persons interested in the development and trade of Papua to establish a case for the Territory. I should be neglecting my duty if , having these facts in my possession, and being requested by a constituent who is interested in Papuan trade to lay them before the Committee, I failed to do so. We all desire to bring about the best conditions possible for Australian shipping, Australian seamen, and those whose business takes them to sea in other than a professional capacity; but I think that we desire to bring about those better conditions with as little injury as possible to the interests of other people. Unless we are prepared to put up with a less advantageous service than we have as the result of existing competition-unles s we are prepared to allow our shipping, in the absence of healthy rivalry, to be of the obsolete type, and are content to travel in inferior ships, we must consider yet another alternative. If the trade is not sufficient to warrant the shipping companies putting on vessels of an up-to-date character for the carriage of both passengers and cargo, we shall have seriously to consider whether some financial assistance might not of developing our shipping in conformity with the White Australia policy, in which we all firmly believe. Another alternawhether we may not admit the principle of exempting this portion of the trade from the operation of the clause for a limited period. We could see how it acted, and would still have power to remove the exemption at any time, so as to give full force to the Bill. Such an exemption would not affect the principle of the Bill, and it would certainly do something to guard against those injustices which at first seem to be inseparable from the operation of the clause as it stands. [8.40] -The preservation of the Australian seaboard service for Australian shipping is all-important. The honourable member for Parramatta expressed the opinion that we owed much to the Mother Country, and should consider her in this connection. We often hear that statement trotted out, and If any attack is ever made by I agree that we do owe a great deal to the Mother Land; but there is another side to the question which I think it necessary to put before the Committee.

They have carried, and no doubt in the future will carry, munitions of war to be used against the British Forces. When there is'any question of pounds, shillings and pence at stake, they do not consider the Mother Country. All that we say to these ship-owners is, "" When you are trading on the Australian seaboard you shall conform to Australian shipping conditions."" I do not think we are asking too much, and oversea ship-owners, if they have any sense of fair dealing, will admit that we are not.

448,Mr Mathews,"Quite so. Thetions. We shall' then welcome them. A great deal has been said about the shipping trade of Papua and the Northern Territory. It has also been asserted that the people on the north-west coast, of Western Australia ought to have facilities to participate in the shipping of foreign nations as well as British shipping companies who work their vessels with black men, or underpaid white crews. We are spending hundreds and thousands of pounds upon the development of the Northern Territory. Are we seeking to develop it for the sake of foreign shipping companies, or is it our desire to develop it for its own intrinsic value, and for the shipping of Australia? We should be foolish if we did not look forward to the time when an increase in the trade of the Northern'Territory will mean also an increase in pur shipping trade. The honourable member for Lang said that we should be treating Papua harshly if we passed this clause. I simply read a statement on the subject. constituent. Have we not spent already a very large sum on \ Papua? On this .year's Estimates alone provision is made for an expenditure of Â£53,000 on the development of that Territory. Are we to develop it in the interests of a Dutch mail company whose vessels are manned with black labour and come into competition with the shipping of Australia? The wages paid in the shipping trade of Australia are two or three times as high as those paid on some foreign vessels, .and it is only just that we should preserve the Australian trade for those who conform to our conditions. able member must not attribute to myself have carried that timber, but the contract the opinions I have read. I simply quoted was given to the Baralong, of theBucknall the opinions of others. able member's explanation. We are told that the competition of oversea vessels with local vessels amounts to so little that it is presumably, the present South Australian not worth considering. . The gentleman who Government, since the Baralong, according wrote to the honourable member for Lang to her articles, arrived at Fremantle on the stated that if the Dutch vessels ceased to 16th, and at Bunbury on 26th April. Her call at Papua the rice which they bring articles were returned on the ist May, and would be taken first to Australia to be she arrived at Port Lincoln on the 7th. Her transhipped there, and would therefore cost articles were deposited in Adelaide on the more to the Papuans. Rice, he says, is a 12th, and returned on the 18th. She arstaple food with fhem. But this rice is rived in Sydney on the 22nd, and in Melgrown in the Dutch East Indies, and Dutch bourne on the 31st. Of the 1,600 loads of vessels will continue to take it to Papua, as sleepers which she took from Bunbury, 800 they are doing now, not from motives of were for Port Adelaide, and another 800 philanthropy, but because there is a good market for it there. We have had to fight Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Company, before, and shall do it again; we do not hold a brief for them; but, under their mail contracts, they are bound to give the same rights to all traders. They cannot charge more than is arranged for, and must, moreover, maintain certain regular services. Possibly it would be better if a second Australian company were trading to Pap'ua, though probably, if there were two companies, an arrangement would soon be made between them, and the people of Papua would be no better off. As the honourable member for Hindmarsh has told us, the shipping business of the world is governed by such arrangements. Incidentally I regret that the white population of Papua does not enjoy proper representation. There are difficulties in the way of providing for that, but those difficulties ought to be surmounted. We must keep Australian ship ping white, and insist on the maintenance t of a high standard of living, even if , in consequence, we have to subsidize more steam-ship lines. steamers ourselves. the population of certain places is under a disadvantage because services are not. frequent enough does not pverweigh the neces sity of keeping Australian shipping white, and maintaining a proper standard of living. In contradiction of what has been said to the effect that the oversea ships do not compete with the local shipping, let me mention a recent case.

He sits there taunting me as if I were a great landed monopolist like himself. much money in lemons just now. One of the great problems is to get the fruit to oversea markets, and I do not see how a ring fence around our shipping is going to help us to solve it. The more boats we can attract here the better for our producers. We have too few of them at present, and our great object should be to get more competition for the carrying of our trade oversea. That will not be secured by the restrictions now proposed round our coast. I would risk doing even that, if it could be proved that our ship-owners were suffering any serious disability which did not enable them to make fair profits and pay fair dividends, while paying such wages, and giving such conditions to labour as our own Courts determined. There can be no question in this discussion of the working man's side of it. That is guaranteed already in the terms of the Bill, and by the other machinery set up by this Parliament. It is, therefore, a question of whether we should make a monopoly for the shipping of Australia, as against any other that may come along. I am reminded that it has a monopoly now. It is not quite complete at present. This is a proposal to complete it ; and, when it is completed, I do not know how we are going to fare. My friends opposite, who are "" girding"" against monopolies on every platform, are now, by their deliberate act, making a monopoly complete and perfect of its kind, so far as our Inter-State shipping is concerned. That is the aspect of this matter that appeals to me, and I hope it will receive the fullest consideration that this Chamber can give it before we commit ourselves to a step which seems likely to be fraught with trouble in the near future. the Committee will not agree to the Dutch Packet Company and the Nord Deutscher Lloyd Company coming into competition with Australian shipping, with regard to the Papuan trade. When on a visit to Papua, I found that the majority of the people who are complaining most keep large stores at Samarai, Yule Island, and Port Moresby, in competition with Burns, Philp, and Company. The Papuan ought not to be denied the right to do his own is not fair to impose Australian conditions on one company, and then allow the planters and storekeepers in the various ports of Papua to have the benefit of cheap Chinese and Javanese labour on the boats of the Dutch Packet and Nord Deutscher Lloyd Companies. If we insist upon certain wages being paid, it is only fair that we should protect the company which is already receiving a subsidy from the Commonwealth. If those people who have stores there care to do so, they can buy ships and run them to Papua in just the same way as Burns, Philp, and Company do. All that is ' necessary in regard to Papua is the plan that Burns, Philp, and Company follow. They do their work in Papua by white labour, as they do in Australian ports. They have white crews and white firemen; but when they get to Port Moresby, the first port of call, they take on a crew of native Papuans, and do the round trip with them to Samarai and back. The people who are crying out for the other steam-ship lines have exactly the same privileges. Many of them are now running small cutters, with a white man in charge, and native Papuans as boat boys.

From the first time that the Navigation Bill was introduced into this Parliament, the StateI represent has hitherto had the assistance and sympathy of the Government of the day in regard to any proposal whicli might have To that letter I received nothing more the effect of preventing persons travelling than ari acknowledgment, so that, although to and fro by sea, until such time as other I had made a good many attempts to means of communication were provided. In regard to the present Bill, I have tried to obtain, on behalf of Western Australia, the same consideration that I have hitherto received from previous Governments; but I have had, as )'et, no intimation as ""to the action the Government propose to take in regard to my amendment. I gather, however, from a letter addressed to the Premier of Western Australia, which reached me only to-day, that the Government do not propose to accept the amendment I have suggested; but that the only consideration they intend to give is the power already in the Bill, by which Executive authority can be given from time to time, in certain conditions and special cases, for the exemption of British ships from the coasting wrote to the Prime Minister in the followIn the Navigation B ill introduced by the of the State of Western Australia are conwith the railways of the State of South not be deemed engaging in the coasting trade."" After 1907 it was thought that the tember, 1908, and the 12th and 24th August, 1910, and is left out in the present B i ll now before the House of Representatives. Believing that the principal objection to the clause in the Bill of 12th September, 1907, was the danger of its being ruled to be unconstitutional, I have, with the assistance of Mr Glynn, submitted an amendment to clause 286, herewith enclosed, which is, t believe, within the Constitution, and is general in its scope. I may point out that this course is followed in the Sugar Bounty Act, which, although applicable to the whole Commonwealth, in practice only applies to two States. I hope the Government will help in this matter. Both Western Australia and Tasmania are isolated States-fa r away with but few opportunities for communication with the rest of the Commonwealth, and both reason and necessity require that until railway communication is established with Perth, as many opportunities of transit of every kind by sea should be available, and should 'be assisted and encouraged. To place any obstacle whatever in the way of means of transit by sea now existing would be unjust to the great western State, and must retard its advancement. This is so apparent that I need not say more, but most earnestly commend this amendment, which cannot but be of temporary application, to the favorable consideration of your Government.",67,Summary

They will consider that its supporters could not have had any idea of the development of this vast territory, and of the necessity for giving it every possible chance. Instead of developing enterprise honourable members opposite desire to restrict it. This clause places restrictions, not only upon means of transit by sea, but on every kind of enterprise and energy. right honourable member say that when he asked us to vote for the trans-Australian railway ? know that I have ever expressed an opinion to the contrary, nor do I quite understand the appropriateness of the honourable member's interjection.

Are not the producers-thos e who carve out homes for themselves in the wilderness, and subjugate it, to be considered? British seamen who brought the people here. were. listening to these narrow views on the part of honourable members opposite for the last ten years. They are all in favour of coercion and restriction, but these restricsteamers will not be allowed to carry pastions and disabilities must react upon oursengers between ports until they have obselves. steamers the restrictions for which this clause provides, they will have to increase their freights and other charges. Every shilling, that we take out of the pockets of the oversea shipping companies in one direction will have to be made good in another, and the people will have to pay. Everything comes back to the producer on the land. Surely we do not wish to prohibit or impose any further restrictions on travelling by sea. We need improved travelling facilities, and every ocean roadway should be open to the person who wishes to travel .by it. My own State spent at least ^2,500,000 on harbour works at Fremantle and Albany, in order that these very mail steamers should be able to call there to deliver and to take away the our mails, to carry our passengers in comfort, and to carry some of our produos to the Old Country. Our desire was to place that State on the high road between the eastern States and the Old Country. T was responsible for the introduction of the measure which created the Fremantle Harbor, but had any one told me at the time that within a few years, although the mail steamers would still be calling at Fremantle, the people of Western Australia would be prevented from travelling by them to and from the eastern States, I would not have believed it. Is this one of the great advantages which Western Australia has received from Federation? The people of that State are entirely dependent upon sea transit for their communication with the eastern States, but if the Bill passes as the Government desire to frame it, it will be of no advantage to the people of Western Australia to have the mail steamers calling at their ports so far as passenger communication with the eastern States is concerned. I do not desire that the local steam-ship companies shall have to suffer by the competition of cargo tramps; my only wish is that passengers may be permitted to travel without let or hindrance by sea where thefe is no means of communirate, it was cation by railway.

I do not think that this Government should ask Parliament for the power to prevent the public from travelling from one port of Australia to another by sea by whatever vessels may be available, when there is no means of travelling by land. My proposal does not go as far as I would like to go. It asks for as little as' possible. I have made as small a request as I can, in the hope that it may obtain consideration. The Attorney General laughs, he cares little for the isolation of the people of Western Australia. What guarantee is there that permits will be granted to the mail steamer companies?

I cannot understand why it should be proposed to deprive them of the benefits which they now derive from these lines of communication.

Their opportunities for travelling are not so good as are possessed on the east coast, but they have the benefit of the steam-ship lines doing busiorable gentleman that that is not so. ness with Singapore and other places beyond Australia. This it is proposed to take from them. I cannot understand why obstacles and difficulties should be placed in the way of people who are really the pioneers of settlement on this vast coastline, because such a policy must retard the progress of the country, and, on the part of Parliament, is atrocious and wicked.

It seems to me that people are prethat a shipping company of Adelaide, in pared to pay the higher rate, not only because they desire the most comfort, but because they have to take advantage of the opportunities for travelling as they present themselves. British shipping companies cannot conform to the conditions laid down by the B ill ; for ourselves. and, while that may be a reasonable question, I think it would be difficult, if not impossible, for them to comply. But supposing those shipping companies did conform to the conditions, in what way would that help the mercantile marine of Australia? Supposing they said, ""The conditions are very irksome, but we shall obey the law."" How would that be of any assistance to those who own the ships, or the seamen who work on them? competition. the Australian ship-owners? have a tendency to do so-to treat all men alike is a basic principle of good law. that, if the British shipping companies did conform to the conditions, it would not satisfy the ship-owners of Australia, or the sailors, nor would it satisfy honourable members opposite.

I am informed that masters, mates, sailors, firemen, and stewards are not more than 10,000 to 12,000; and if those men have good conditions under their arbitration awards, I do not see why the tens of thousands of producers should be unnecessarily inconvenienced.",71,Fowler Th E Honourable Member S Time

We were told the other day that some of the British shipping companies were paying 50 and 60 per cent., and that the Peninsular and Oriental Company have paid 50 per cent, in dividends.

I am informed, in a published statement, that the average dividend paid by representative steam-ship companies last year was 6.06 per cent., the dividends varying from nothing to 9 per cent. It is true that one company, the Oceanic, paid as much as 30 per cent., which raised the average, but, eliminating that company, the average is reduced to 5.7 per cent. The balance-sheets of the intercolonial steamship companies show that the dividends bave varied from 8 per cent, to 15 per cent, during the last year; so that tbey do not seem to be doing very badly. for the statement in regard to foreign vessels?

Another thing I regret is that honourable members opposite seem to have no regard for the Old Country.' I know that the honourable member for Maranoa is a man wbo has fought the battles of his country, but if he sticks to the Labour party much longer he will not feel that he is a Britisher at all. All the time, while we aTe placing restrictions upon shipping; and sneering at and insulting other nations who are not of' tbe same colour, as ourselves, we are talking about getting new markets for our produce.

There is, however, a give and take in all these, things. I should think . that, if tbe Shipopinions which honourable members opposite hold in regard to foreign nations were considered by those nations to be the feeling should be the best hated people in the whole world. They are seeking markets from other countries, but doing their best to incur the hatred and contempt of the people with whom they desire to trade. I can only express the hope lhat, at any rate, some honourable members opposite will see that it is unwise at this time, and in this fashion, to place any restriction in regard to travelling on the people who live along several thousand miles of our coastline, and have no means of travelling except by sea.
