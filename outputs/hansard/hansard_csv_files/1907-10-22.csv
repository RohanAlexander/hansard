In submitting this motion, I desire to say that it will not be proceeded with for a few weeks, as it is desirable to allow the parties who are interested in the measure an opportunity to peruse it, and to make any representations that they may deem to be necessary. The Bill purports to embody a codification of the law. States of the Commonwealth at the present time, the law relating to marine insurance is based upon what is known as the common law, and in order to ascertain what the common law is it is necessary to consult something like 2,000 decisions of the various Courts. In England, Sir M. D. Chalmers, the ""famous draftsman, who drafted the Bills of Exchange Act, codified the law in respect of marine insurance, after having spent a considerable time upon it. 1894 and 1906 the measure which he drafted came before; itihe Imperial Parliament several times, and was carefully considered by expert Committees. Lajst year-afte r it had undergone several modifications-it became the law of Great Britain. It is proposed to adapt that law to the conditions of Australia, and, accordingly, we desire to afford those who are interested in the measure every opportunity to see how far the provisions of the British Act are applicable. My advice is that the Bill is suitable to Australian conditions, but, inasmuch as it relates to a matter which concerns particular interests, it is highly desirable that those who will be affected by it should have an opportunity of becoming familiar with its provisions before its second reading is carried. with the Bill this session?

There is, of course, a great' temptation to make a lengthy speech, but I shall not embrace the present opportunity to do so. It had been intended. I think, to commence a debate upon the subject on Thursday,' but the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Angas today affords a better opportunity than we should then have had, because, under the circumstances which then prevailed, the question might have been mixed up with matters arising in connection with the general tariff.

But to say so much was not to advocate this policy by way of bargaining. The Government, as I shall show by references to the Prime Minister's speeches, said at the Imperial Conference that a policy of preference would be proposed, but that nothing in the nature of a bargain would be put forward.

If , therefore, they think, as they undoubtedly do, that the proper way toencourage and aid home industries is to impose But a high Tariff on competing imports, how can. we blame them if their policy is shaped in> accordance with their beliefs? And since something like two-thirds of the Australian over-sea commerce is with the United Kingdom, howcouldthey carry out their policy unless they protected their own manufacturers against the competition of British firms, since they alonehad so large a share of the trade? That is the position which the Government have always taken up.

The following is from the article in the Birmingham Post:Really Australia is but following the course -which from the first they have predicted. articles published since the introduction of the Tariff? received them only lately. Here is another paragraph from the Birmingham PostI t pleases free-traders to sneer at the preference given; to depreciate its importance, and to regard it as Australia's "" last w o r d "" on the subject. A more mistaken view can hardly be conceived. Let all who desire to discuss the question be perfectly candid and endeavour to realize things as they are. It would not have been surprising if after the Colonial Conference there had been no preference; but Australia has given one without bargaining,"" and on the basis of present conditions. The Westminster Gazette, referring to the question to which I alluded a few moments ago, writesThese complaints are very unreasonable. Sir William promised to give preference; he never promised not to raise the Tariff before he gave preference; he never promised not to make the Tariff prohibitive before he gave preference. . . . Sir William Lyne and his school have been absolutely frank about their intentions since the question of preference was started. They have told us that the fostering of their home manufactures was their first object, and that nothing would be done for the Mother Country which interfered with it. . . But they are free to alter their Tariff as they think' fit, and they have been perfectly frank with us. It is therefore useless and unjust to complain of deception on their part. The Financier of Friday, August 23rd in referring to myself, wroteA l l he proposed to do was to raise the duties against foreigners, while leaving the duties which British importers would have to pay at a level which would confer complete protection to the Australian manufacturer. These are a few paragraphs which I have selected from a number recently sent to me from Great Britain. They indicate that there is on the part of a large section of the people of Great Britain a feeling that we are carrying out our promise, and there has been no deception. Every one clearly understood what we proposed to do. They recognise that although we failed in our efforts to induce the British Government to enter into a reciprocal agreement, we did not decline for that reason to grant any (preference to the old country. We are granting her a preference, asking for nothing in return, and are content to wait until she is prepared to reciprocate, if that time should ever come. It is all .very well to urge that we have attempted to interfere with the free-trade policy of Great Britain. I do not intend to discuss that question, except in passing to inquire why our Australian wines could not be admitted duty free into the United Kingdom without raising the price of bread and foodstuffs generally.' The wine industry in Australia is a very large one, but our wines to a large extent are purchased by French people, carried to France, and after being blended, there witb much lighter wines, a large proportion of them probably find 'their way into Great Britain. It would be very much better if we were in .a position to secure the direct introduction of our wines free or nearly free into Great Britain. gentleman ask for that at the Imperial Conference ? Sir WILLIA M LYNE -Yes. Government would not agree to that proposal, the Commonwealth Government, are now offering' Great 'Britain'this preference. Sir WILLIA M LYNE -Yes. I raised the point when Mr Asquith was dealing with the question of free-trade versus protection. Sir JOHN -FORREST -Wines from France are not admitted free into the United Kingdom. Sir WILLIA M LYNE I think that there is a duty of 4s. per gallon on wine, but I am not quite sure. per gallon on sparkling wines and 3s. per gallon'on other wines'.

It is as followsThe preference concessions w ill , on the basis of our present imports, represent ^1,250,000, or 11* per cent. That is to say, th*t amount reprepresents the difference in duty between the general Tariff and the preference Tariff; but as it is expected that the imports from Great Britain will increase in consequence of these preference proposals, it will not be improper to estimate that the concession will amount to, say, ^1,500,000, or 13* per cent. Minister arrive at his statement that the concession offered by the Government is a percentage of 1.3 per cent. ? calculation on a different basis, which did not include the whole of the items. In the last table I read I included a number of items with a percentage preference of 100 per cent. If . the honourable member will go through the figures when they are printed, I shall be glad to hear every criticism that he has to offer upon them, because I have instructed the officers to be exceptionally careful in this matter, and to give me all the particulars, so that I might lay them ibefore the Committee. My main object was to get from independent individuals who understand this question thoroughly-and no one understands the preference proposals better than does the Comptroller-General of Customs, under, whose direction these figures were prepared by one of his officers a true comparison of the percentages of preference offered by Canada and Australia, showing as a whole the advantage that we propose to give to Great Britain. I have given that information to honourable members, and I shall be very glad to hear what holes they can pick in it. doubt that, but we cannot understand the contradictions without some explanation. Sir WILLIA M LYNE I ask the honourable member to look at the figures carefully, and he will find there are no contradictions. The other evening certain honourable members said that I was giving away the preference in connection with biscuits, anc! I think also in connection with blue. The preference proposed in connection with those items amounts practically to nothing. Neither the Prime Minister nor myself attach much importance to the preference proposed in connection with small items. What we are concerned about are the proposals in connection with the main items which give a considerable and important preference to Great Britain. items ? just now referred to the main items"" of foreign importations. man read a jumble of figures. Sir WILLIA M LYNE I read no jumble of figures. I referred honourable the members to the main items. I referred as representing large foreign importations. I am not to blame if the honourable member could not follow them. If the debate on preference is not concluded to-night, honourable members will have an opportunity to see the figures to which I have referred in print. I hope they will go through the various calculations carefullv, to see how they have been worked out by the officers of the Department, when I have no doubt they will find that the figures I have quoted are correct. I wish particularly to impress upon honourable members that in what I am saying I believe I am giving expression to the very strong feelings entertained by the Prime Minister in regard' to this matter. It will be admitted that the honourable gentleman would be placed in a very unenviable position were the Committee, to refuse to grant the preference submitted after he had given his word that preference to Great Britain would be proposed. The newspaper extracts I have made show that some of the press writers understand exactly what was said, and have correctly interpreted what was stated by the Prime Minister. The Government have brought tial preference to British manufacturers in respect of the main items affected, representing at the present time large importations from foreign countries. We desire that a certain proportion of those articles should be manufactured by ourselves, and that the 1 balance should be imported from Great Britain rather than from foreign countries.

Australia is a continent nearly equal in area to the United States, and yet in spite of its great possibilities and mineral wealth, we can. never expect that it will be populated as we desire, unless we establish our own manufactures for the production of articles which we are at present importing from foreign countries. Whilst we desire that our own kith ancl kin in Great Britain should supply us with what we are unable to manufacture and* produce locally, we hope under this Tariff to induce our own people to do a great deal more-than they are now doing to supply Australian requirements in the manufacture of the raw materials we produce. That should be the object of every Australian. self, I do not call any man an Australian who encourages the importation of articles which are the production of the cheap labour of the Continent of Europe, to the detriment of our own people. That very thing is being done by some members of the Committee who still call themselves protectionists. If we do nothing else we should at least stand by Australia and the development of Australian industries the object being that this may be made a self-contained country.

It was then clearly understood that the honourable member tor Cowper intended totest this question by moving a reduction in the duty proposed to be levied upon, candles imported from the United Kingdom. The honourable member for Angaswished to eliminate the preference altogether, but I objected to that suggestion at the time and it was not' persevered with. WhatI then said was that I was quite prepared to give the Committee an opportunity to vote upon this question to-night. I do not care in what direction the proposal is made so long as it does not result in any complication of the issue. WhyI raised the question in the first instance was that if the original proposal of the honourable member for Angas had been submitted in the form in which such proposals are usually submitted, the proposed preference would, in any case, have been eliminated. I do not withdrawi from the position which I took up the other evening. Sir WILLIA M LYNE -The honourable member for Cowper has moved to reduce the duty upon candles imported from the United!

147,Mr Reid (East Sydney) [4.42],"Ifore it has :begun. I think that such expressions should be avoided in a House which is supposed to be composed of independent, representatives of the people. am very glad that upon the present occasion we may hope to have the satisfaction of hearing a statement from the Prime Minister upon this important question. I propose therefore to deal with it much more fully* than I should have done under other circumstances. The Treasurer concluded his remarks with a very patriotic peroration, in which he aspired to the time when Australia will be a self-contained country. It is a noble ambition, but an impossible one. There is no country in the world which has ever been, or which ever, can be, self-contained.. If we settled fifty persons in tlie centre of .the most abundant natural resources, with every product capable of satisfying their pleasures, or tastes, or industrial dispositions, there would still remain something wanting without which the whole of their wealth would lead not to happiness but to miseryI refer to intercourse with other intelligent human beings in other countries. Take the case of the United Staites, with their marvellous natural resources, marvellous population, and with the most rigid protective policy the world has ever seen. If honourable members study the statistics of that country, they will find that in spite of their enormous export trade they have an enormous import trade, which is valued at several hundred millions sterling, or more than $1,000,000,000 dollars annually. These sentiments are often unsound. Man was not created to live in isolation from in One would think being in a state of isolation, who had everything that he could desire, would reach the highest pitch of happiness and wealth. But he would not. He would be the most melancholy and miserable individual in the world unless he had the freest intercourse with his fellow man. We ought to feel deeply impressed by the eloquent aspirations of the leading protectionists in Australia for a closer commercial intercourse with the greatest free trade country in the world. It is one of the most striking developments of Australian protection that we find the eloquence of its leading advocates devoted to an exjaression of the most profound desire to cultivate closer commercial relations with the greatest free-trade nation in the world, which happens to be the mother country. How can there be closer commercial intercourse without an increase in the exchange I bf commodities between the two countries? Would it be commercial intercourse to exchange sovereigns for goods-for Great Britain to send out her millions of pounds in coin or bullion each year in exchange for Australian meat or wheat ? Would that be commercial exchange ? No ! The expression conveys the idea of the exchange of commodities which are produced in the respective countries. mercial interchange, we do not speak of gold as a commercial commodity. It is used to pay for an article which has been transmitted. than an ordinary commodity, in that its value never depreciates. change, but it is not a medium of interchange. There is a great difference between the two expressions. But I wish to direct the attention of the Committee, first, to the fact that the perorations of the greatest protectionists in Australia are now being devoted to a development of commercial interchange between the great markets and the great manufacturing powers of the Mother 'Country and the great markets and producing centres of Australia. Apart from the patriotic consideration, this fact represents a striking development in the political attitude of leading protectionists. The theory of protection itself is absolutely opposed to any such arrangement. The his fellow man theory upon which Australian: protection different parts of the world. has been founded always has been that that the human there are industries in Australia which in their period of infancy must be protected from the pressure of outside competition on the part of older nations in a more advanced industrial condition. Well, that policy is entirely opposed to the policy of increasing the hold of British manufactures upon the markets of Australia. The two policies do not harmonise. They are absolutely opposed one to the other. The first question that I want to ask on this Tariff is -Are those duties in the second schedule -whic h form the offer of a preference to the Mother Country-suppose d to be a sufficient protection for Australian industries, or not ? If they are not a sufficient protection for Australian industries, the Ministry are not f a it h f u l to the mandate which, . according to their own statement, they",29,Thomson W E Do Not Down Proposals Which Will Give A Substan

I wish to say parenthetically that, much as I differ from the views of the Prime Minister, so far as ability ancl force are concerned he was a perfectly worthy representative of Australia at the Conference. So that I hope it will be understood that my criticisms have no personal bearing. The impression which the Prime Minister made upon the people of the Mother Country was-evidently a very strong one. To us in Australia there was the difficulty of quite grasping the change which had come over the Prime Minister in If they are sufficient to his ardour to encourage closer commercial intercourse with Great Britain.

You can offer a trading inducement to the people of England only by opening your doors to the enterprise of their manufacturers. your manufacturers for the benefit of your farmers, say so. to be an honest bargain, it is not something for nothing. It is something for something. It must mean that or it is as'ham. Well, this something for something must mean more than an interference with' the current of foreign trade. A t the present moment the Mother Country, in spite of yourprotective Tariff and your barriers, sends more than Â£26,000.00 0 worth of goods per annum into Australia. The whole of the foreign trade of the world with Australia is only about one half of that, and one half of that trade would be impossible to the Mother Countryi f you opened your ports to-morrow, because it consists of articles which could not be produced in that country. your foreign trade is a trade which you could not divert in that direction. Let me just show by reference to two or three items only the magnificent hold which this ""decaying"" Mother Country has in the markets of Australia. Having no preference here, having to compete on equal terms with ' the mighty enterprise of an awakened Germany and of the magnificent United States on this impartial battle ground, what is the position of the Mother Country? In respect to three items-piec e goods, cotton and linen, woollens, and iron plates, corrugated and galvanized-pro ducts to the value of Â£ 6 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 sterling a turing millions of England, without imyear come into Australia from the Mother Country. the other OnlyÂ£ 2 9 8 , 0 0 0 fro m France, Germany, and the United States-from the cheap white and coloured labour of the world, to whom our market had been as free as it was to the people of the Mother Country. What sort of. substantial advantage would Great Britain' reap if we wiped out that Â£ 2 9 8 , 0 0 0 of foreign-trade altogether? It is not by wiping out the 'foreign trade that we can give Great Britain a substantial advantage ; that must be done by wiping out our Australian manufactures. able and learned member desire to wipe stantial preference of 1902. Consequently, out Australian manufactures? ot a policy, and not expressing any personal wishes. But we owe to the people of the Mother Country straight plain talk. We are told that the Treasurer, at the Conference, deplored the fact that the lifeblood of England was being sucked out If you are prepared to sacrifice of her by. foreign trade. I have been looking at Australian figures in regard Becausei f this is fo this neutral battle-ground. I find that, during the four years from 1902 to 1906, the increase of imports from the Mother Country was Â£2,700,00 0 worth, as against an increase of under Â£ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 worth from France, Germany, and the United States combined, there being a positive decrease in the case of France and the. United States. Whether protectionists or free-traders, we are glad to see, written in the undeniable figures of our own trade statistics, the marvellous energy and success which still remain with the industries of the Mother Country. Those results have not been won by favouritism or preferential trade. The Treasurer, at the Imperial Conference, not only deplored the sucking In other words, one-half of of the life-blood out of the Mother Country, but said that, in spite of his having a father and a grandfather from the old land, something more was wanted-that some further link was required. What was it? The missing link he longed for was a closer unity of commerce between the Mother Country and the rest of the Empire. What a strange utterance from this rabid protectionist Treasurer ! that noble sentiment. But we cannot have much closer commerce with the manufacpinging on the developing industries of How much from all protected Australia; we cannot have a discountries in the world? placement in favour of one force, without injuriously affecting another force.

159,Mr Reid,"And I heartily applaudpledged in honour to a substantial preference not only a preference, but a substantial preference an unconditional, substantial preference without any bargaining for something in return. The Government stand pledged twice over to an unconditional substantial preference. Can we be surprised at the attitude of the British Government, although our Prime Minister, with his great eloquence and ability, brought all his genius to bear on their position? Was there ever a more extraordinary, expedition outside the pages of Don Quixote than that in which the Prime Minister engaged when he went to the Mother Country to upset a free-trade policy which had just been affirmed by millions of the electors of Great Britain, and which, in the House of Commons, had been further affirmed by about 500 votes to 98? Was there ever anything more, I shall not say ridiculous, but anything more chivalrous in the region of practical, politics, than for a practical statesman to go to the people and Ministers of the Mother Country, with the enormous mass of parliamentary support behind them, and expect, by the charm of Australian eloquence, to melt awav those solid battlements behind which millions of the people stood-to charm away the solemn faith of the British Government, and destroy, with a breath, the policy on which, for good or evil, the destinies of the Mother Country solidly rest to-day ? It was one of the most extraordinary positions. Can we be surprised that the British Government had to say "" no "" ? What would our Prime Minister have thought had the British Ministry said "" yes "" ? How unfair, as the Treasurer practically did, to put the Ministers of the old country in a false position, as if they were ungracious and offensive in their attitude of negation. What would have been said if we had had an. overwhelming protectionist vote at our elections, affirming the policy of protection, and British statesmen had come here, and at a Conference board, thundered with all. their eloquence, asking the Ministers of Australia to abandon their protectionist policy as a fetish-as a thing which had no real sense or substance in it? What would have been said of such British Ministers? What would our newspapers have said of them? I think that Mr Asquith made one of the manliest expositions p f the question I have ever seen in a heated controversy. Mr Reid. saidWhat is the good of protecting and fostering the growth of native industries, if at the same time you are going to admit against them into the market the most dangerous competitor in the whole world-becaus e that is what the British manufacturer is? That is what the British manufacturers are, and it is the sort of talk we would expect from a protectionist. But Mr Asquith had the manliness to realize what the policy of protection in Australia meant. He saidYou are not going to admit anybody, British or foreign, to compete on level terms in your markets in respect of the industries which you desire to protect. You could not do it. It is a negation of protection. Obviously the thing itself is contradictory. I w ill not go into the question whether the British manufacturer will remain the most dangerous. I think at this moment he still is, at any rate, very dangerous, and you cannot have him in. You know you cannot without abandoning Drotection. Is that not a straightforward statement of the case from a protectionist's point of view? I think it isa straightforward recognition of the view of protectionists. If the protectionists say to the Mother Country, "" We are going to give up our policy of shutting you out; we see you can do us a great deal of good if we cripple our manufactures for the benefit of our farmers,"" they will make the only substantial offer that can be made. Listen to the words of General Botha, who was one of the bitterest, although one of the bravest and straightest, enemies the British race ever had. Sitting at the Conference table; he made a very short speech, from which I shall quote: a few words. He saidThe resolution of 1902 should continue to stand as it does That is the unconditional substantial preference proposal. I do not see any chance of pressing upon the Mother Country any addition to that resolution. The position that we take in the Transvaal now that we have responsible government, is that the Mother Country ought to leave us alone as much as possible to regulate our own affairs, and, therefore, it is all the more difficult for me to come here and interfere with matters concerning the Mother Country. So far-as I can judge it appears to me that the British people made their voices and opinion heard on this matter during the last general election in England. . . . Although no preference is given by the Mother Country to the Transvaal, the bond beween the Transvaal and theMother Country wiU nbt thereby be weakened. That is a ll i have to say.

What would have been the shock to that august assemblage in Londoni f , after the impassioned speech delivered by the Prime Minister of Australia, an anticipatory draft of the Tariff now before us had been laid on the table of the Conference? shock of astonishment that would have run through the British Islesi f the people had heard then of what was to be done by. those who were clamouring for the imposition of taxes on the very bread and meat of struggling millions-unde r a glorious programme of lightening the burdens of competition and opening the bright gates of Australia to the depressed, 'oppressed, and decaying British manufacturers? immediately after the Prime Minister's speech at the Conference, the people of Great Britain had been told that on the main lines of British industry the Australian duties, in some cases, were to be doubled? When the oratory of the Prime Minister was gushing so freely there was a duty of 15 per cent, on woollen piece goods -We have now a duty of 30 per cent, against such imrjorts from the Mother Countrv. The duty has been doubled. The duty on machinery was, in. respect to a number of lines, 12 per cent. ; 1 it is now. 20 and 25 per cent. I am not We respect her deciquite sure whether the duty on cotvaried. If I remember rightly, it was 5 per cent, under the old Tariff, and that duty remains as against British imports, whilst those from foreign countries are dutiable at 10 per cent. But let us look for a moment at the main lines of British export. Cotton manufactures, Â£100,000,000; woollen manufactures, Â£32,000,000; linen, jute, and apparel, Â£19,000,000. I think that we now have If they carry out their duties ranging from 25 to 40 per cent, on there is more to follow. The Prime Minister, through a newspaper reporter, sent a cablegram to the merchants of Great Britain, saying "" There is more to come.""' Did he mean another 20 per cent, on apparel-anothe r message of brotherly love? I have no word The British export of metals, including ships, are of the value of Â£40,0001,000, and the exports of machinery are valued at ,Â£20,000,000. We have a total value of Â£217,000,000 in respect of these five items. Has the duty on a single line been altered in favour of the Mother Country? Not one'; in four cases the duties have been either doubled or substantially increased. That does not fit inwith the glorious position which the Prime What would have been the Minister took up at that distinguished gathering at Home. We can readily give a substantial preference if we begin by doubling the duty on imports from theMother Country. This decaying MotherCountry, whose expiring energies elicited thewarmest sympathy of the.Treasurer of Australia, has, during the last ten years, increased her trade by Â£322,000,000, or 43 1 per cent. May I remind honorable members that these figures do not relate What would have been said if , merely to imports. Great Britain, in tenyears, had an increased importation of the value of Â£156,000,000, but an increasein exports of Â£166,000,000. That is the position of the poor decaying Mother Country! Her trade has now risen toÂ£1,000,000,000.

But if the preference were to be substantial if it were intended to help great industries, such as the machinery, woollen and apparel industries-grea t lines of British production which are also important lines of Australian manufacture-if it were to injure the infant industries of Australia, it is very questionable whether the Prime Minister could carry his party with him to that extent.

237,Mr Reid,"It was, of course, inevito me to be really silly. A young man is bound to grow more rapidly than a fullgrown man. It is in the course of nature. Great Britain had a phenomenal, an unnatural, predominance over the commerce of the world forty or fifty years ago. Where was the law of nature.to keep the great peoples of Germany and of the United States in the background? Their trade was bound to grow. Suppose that in a race, one horse being at the winning post, another is half-a-mile away. The second horse may have gained a quarterof-a-mile in the last mile. But should we, therefore, admire the horse that gains most in the last mile? I think it is the winner that we should a'dmire most all the time. You have to look at this matter from every point of view. Look at the task set to Great Britain,, with a trade of Â£24,000,000, to increase it at all. It is an infinitely greater burden on her to increase her trade from Â£24,000,000 to nearly Â£27,000,000 than for Germany to increase her trade from Â£2,600,000 to Â£3,200,000. But instead of that she has increased her trade eight times more rapidly than the combined trade of those other great nations increased. sending goods to the amount of 1 per cent, of our whole trade in one year, and next year increased her trade by 1 per cent., that would be said to be an increase of 100 per cent. like to quote a sentence from the very able speech made at the Conference by Mr are al multitude of considerations which Lloyd George. My honourable friend, the member for Dalley, practically expressed the same idea in different words on Friday last. I have quoted Mr Asquith's fair and manly view of the protectionists of Australia. NowI wish to quote the view of the British Government, in connection with a system of arranged or reciprocal preference. Mr Lloyd George says-and says very frankly and ably-We are not in a position to pledge ourselves to anything which will involve the setting UD of a Tariff on foodstuffs and raw material in this country. The Prime Minister, at the Conference, made the interjectionWithout the Tariff we do not get the opportunity of preference. The same idea was expressed by the Treasurer the other day on an item before this Committee. He was asked-""Why are you going to put these duties on animalshorses, sheep, and pigs? There was no duty before, and we have had very few imports."" The Treasurer said"" I wish to put them .on, because I want to have something to give away to New Zealand when negotiating."" Are we to take it, then, in regard to a good deal of this preference scheme, that the Government propose to put on duties in order to have something to give back when negotiating? If so, it lets a lot of light into the position. Mr Lloyd George went on to sayWe are not here to endeavour to manceuvre each other info false positions, A very pregnant observation. but to discharge the practical business of the Empire. A very pregnant observation also. We are in perfect accord as to the objects we would strive to promote. . . . We are in complete agreement with the colonial, delegates in their belief that the attainment of this object would be assisted by any scheme or system which would develop Inter-Imperial trade, provided such a scheme did not inflict sacrifices on any individual community so great as to produce a sense of grievance with the conditions of the Empire, so deep as to introduce elements of discontent and discord into the Confederation, and thus imperil its efficiency, and, may be, its continual existence as an organization. That puts a view which has been put more than oncea view put there very forcibly -of the tangled skein which British statesmen have to unwind. British statesmen have to consider large questions of policy affecting their relations with one or other of the parts of the Empire. There they must take into account. When, for instance, Australia comes forward enthu-* siastically with some definite proposal, or when Canada submits a matter of policy, the Mother Country, with the vast weight of responsibility upon her shoulders, has a multitude of other considerations to take into account. But my view of the grievance which the Mother Country has against Australia is this-that Australia, in the person of her representatives, does not mean business. I think that one of the greatest possible wrongs in the higher sphere of Imperial statesmanship is done when ardent and impassioned appeals are made at the centre of Imperial power to re-arrange a system upon which, perhaps, the stability of the Empire depends, not in response to a genuine offer intended to give pound for pound, but in response to an appeal which is not backed up by a readiness to give a fair exchange.",42,William Lyne Th E Honourable But It Is Utterly Misleading In Every

241,Mr Reid,"will .have nothing short of shutting out all products which can be made in this country. Then there is the high tariffist, who looks-on a Tariff such as we have had as a very milk-and-water production, and who regardsany duties under 40 or 50 per cent, as by no means the real thing. Then there is another section, who, I am glad to think, have great weight both in this House and in the country-thos e who, in adjusting the duties, have some anxiety with regard to other than the manufacturing industries of Australia. I think I may fairly point out the difference between what I call the natural or primary industries of Australia and the -industries to which a Tariff is essential, by saying that I call the latter Tariff industries, while I consider Australian industries those which are born and which can expand and strike r their.'roots in their natural atmosphere tries of England first develop under protection?' I. think it is extremely likely that, if the honourable member were an advocate of measles, he' could put forward a most convincing argument in the fact that he had never .known a nation which, at some time or other, had not had the measles. That argument, however, would not necessarily mean that it is a blessing to a nation to have the measles. Mother Country there was a marvellous appetite for nourishment even among "" infantile "" industries that had been flourishing for 200 years. It is one of the marvels of protected industries that their infancy is eternal. Their appetite becomes manly, but their appeals for consideration are always those of a weakling, of a child who will die if it is not nourished and sheltered. draws a distinction between duties which have sole reference to the interests of the industries for the benefit of which they aie imposed and the interests of people engaged in other industries of Australia. revenue tariffist? genuine protectionist. Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.4.5 p.m. ing about preferential trade regarding a operation of the new Tariff in reference to fhree very large lines to which I alluded before we adjourned for dinner. Take the item of cotton and linen piece goods. The duty, as against imports of such goods from the United Kingdom, is the same asthat under the old Tariff, but to show the 'wonderful command which the. UnitedKingdom has in respect of that line over the markets of Australia, I would point out that her exports to this country in one year were of the value of over Â£3,000,000. In the markets of Australia Great Britain has to meet on equal terms the competition of the rest of the world, and yet her proportion of the trade is Â£3,000,000 as against only Â£160,000 for foreign countries. Cotton goods comprise most of the articles coming under the heading of "" Linen and cotton piece goods."" And yet that decaying country, Great Britain, is able to import cotton from the farthest ends of fhe earth to supply her own wants in cotton manufactures, and toannually export ,Â£100,000,000 worth of manufactures, the raw material of which is mainly produced in the United States and in India. Great Britain obtains cotton from the United States and India, transforms it into manufactured articles,. a.nd sends out every year a surplus of Â£.100,000,000 worth of those manufactures. What is the use of describing as a decaying people a community that is able to take away every year from the United States Â£100,000,000 worth of trade in respect of manufactures, the In the raw material of which is produced in unparalleled abundance in a part of the States where any quantity of black labour is available. I do not think that we need be very nervous about the position of Great Britain in regard to its industries. Imaginewhat would be said if Germany could pointto this one achievement. The whole world would ring with the story of the decadence of the Mother Country; it would be said that The moderate protectionistshe was ruined, that her doom was sealed. The old country, with its little bit of earth, which, has been ploughed over and over for a thousand years, with its mineral resources,' so far as iron is concerned, giving out to such an extent that she spends millions on imports of iron ore from all parts of the world, still sends out this enormous export of cotton and linen goods the raw material of which is not produced within her own borders. What is the use of talkline bf this kind, in respect of which, with the exception of imports of the value of Â£160,000, she holds the whole of our trade?

Let us compare Germany and Great Britain on another important point. I am indebted to the honourable member for Barrier for the figures which.

During the period between 1871: and 1881, the cost of food in a German workman'-s family might be represented by the figures 11,2, and in an English workman's family by the figures 140; but during the four years between 1897 and 1901 the cost of the German family, instead of being 112, was 100, and that of the British family had made the marvellous improvement of. from 140 to 100. book from which the right honourable member has been reading? .Morrison Davidson, a very well-known man. I look upon any genuine, unconditional .preference to the Mother Country as something of which I must heartily approve. Tn my opinion, it would be a wise and patriotic step to grant such a preference, '-and I shall be only too pleased to do what I can to make our preference as substantial as possible. I draw the sharpest possible line between a generous unconditional preference and an agreement between the In that old country, Mother Country and the self-governing dependencies of the Empire. We must all. be profoundly sensible that, whilst Aus-' tralia can afford to make mistakes whicli may cost her very little, a country like the United Kingdom, with the pressure of Surely that is something to Empire responsibility upon her, cannot Any one who has the afford to do so. She is not in the position of a youth in the f u l l possession of his powers and energies, who can. afford to bungle along the path of life, ultimately, despite his mistakes, becoming a successful man. ""With the enormous strain Britain finds all the problems which affect her trade' and ber fiscal policy of the greatest magnitude and Goncern. There should not be the slightest feeling of soreness on our part if the Mother Country regards this matter in thelight of the interests of its own people. We, too, must look at it from both sides, and I have never concealed the opinion that, from the 'point of view of the Mother Country, it would be a vital mistake to abandon the system upon which her trade and industry rest Therefore, I have ' no grievance against the people of the United Kingdom for refusing to enter into reciprocal arrangements. ' I believe that, in doing so they are. consulting their best interests, and that such arrangements would not make their bread cheaper', or the conditions of their masses better, but, on the contrary, would make' things, worse fpr them. The honourable member for' Corio has made an interjection which was 'frequently uttered by the Prime Minister at the Imperial Conference. When speakers, notably members of the British' Government, used the expression "" tax '.' m relation to imposts. on food, he' interjected more than once, "" Not a tax,' but a duty."" Even a protectionist must admit that if goods subject to the Customs_ impost cannot be produced entirely in fhe country in which they are subject to taxation, the duty on them must have the effect of inhome to us clearly. largely on the ratio of the importations? dom could supply all the foodstuffs she wants, the .effect of the duty on foodstuffs would be to stimulate production to the extent of making the importations, .of Australian wheat unnecessary. .

When he got there it was raining heavily, so that he had to remain indoors, but whenever he looked out of the window of the hotel, a fair-haired young woman passed. "" Father, this is no place for me. It is always raining, and all the women have red hair."" Faulty generalizations of that sort are often made fromi imperfect data. It does not follow, because prices went down in England in 1894, that that was due to the imposition of a duty. The fluctuation of prices is brought about by a thousand conditions. If , owing to a drought, the production of wheat in the United States shows a falling off, prices harden, while if there are good harvests, prices drop. It is an elementary fallacy to attribute a falling wheat market to the imposition of a duty. Therefore I do not think 'that the honourable member for Corio is sound on the point. wheat fell outside the duty. the duty. The fluctuations of the markets of the world are so familiar to honourable members that they know that the fact that a commodity was at a certain price in one year and at another price in another year is. no proof that its value has been affected by an Act of Parliament. have not had much to do with the rise in the price of wheat here. brought me back to the point from which I was straying. Up to a certain point, the wheat duty may have had some protective incidence when Victoria was a separate State. But take Australia.'now, with her enormous wheat production and her small population. wheat is not regulated by the Tariff, but by the markets of the world. Every bushel of wheat that is sold on the farm in Australia is sold at a price which leaves to the buyer a margin of profit after allowing for. the expense of conveyance and shipment and the chances of the market based on the quotations. A fall of a fraction in Mark-lane will affect the wheat market all over the world. prices regulated? demand. I should be just as foolish as I was tempted to suggest somebody elsewas if I endeavoured to assign all the causes' for a fall in price in Mark-:lane. There may be many causes. For instance, on the share market, though not so acutely, without any rhyme or reason sometimes the value of shares will go up and down in Accordingly he wrote home, the most extraordinary way. The market is sensitive and may be frightened. All sorts of elements seem to affect quotations, even in the wheat market. in holding wheat will send up the price. be the use of their holding wheat if there is no prospect of a shortage? drought coming on. If it was thought we were going to have a magnificent season that Wheat would be . got rid of before the abundant harvest was reaped. What possible benefit would a duty on wool be to the pastoral industry ? None whatever. If we put a duty of 100 per cent, on wool, the price would still be regulated by the demand in the markets of the world. With reference to the proposed duties on food in England, those who believe that they will not increase the prices areat liberty to enter into these projects in the gayest possible spirit. But I honestly believe that, situated as the people of the Mother Country are, any barrier between them ancl the abundance of the world would inflict serious loss upon them. Therefore, I support the view which has been so ably expressed by British Ministers, and so emphatically endorsed by the British people, that a preferential treaty would not be a good thing for the Mother Country. No Australian can want to injure the Mother Country, and, what is more,, no Australian can want to interfere with her liberty in fixing her own domestic policy. Sometimes a cruel strain has been The price of Australian put on the people of the Mother Country and their statesmen by insinuations of the sort which I am going to mention, and which' I have not noticed in any speeches by the Prime Minister.

Mr J. H . CATTS -Who said that, anyhow ? will accept my assurance, I have seen the statement made often, and General Botha referred very strongly to it in the opposite direction. I have expressly acquitted the Prime Minister of making any such statement, but it has been made repeatedly by over-zealous champions, probably more so in the Mother Country than here. During the great electoral struggle between the Liberals and the Conservatives, this was the most ordinary argument to use:.""Oh, you are alienating the affections of the people of the self-governingStates. you do not go in for this preference, you will weaken the ties between the self-governing Dominions, such as Australia and Canada, and the Mother Country."" heartily agree-becaus e I have expressed the same sentiment over and over againwith Mr Lloyd George in this view, that perhaps the simple secret of the phenomenally harmonious relations which prevail between the self-governing Dominions ancl the Mother Country might be summed up in a very simple phrase"" This attachment, this harmony, these magnificent aspects of our British Empire, mainly have come from the assertion and the enjoyment of liberty ""-libert y in each of the self governing Dominions of the Empire. This is the life-blood of the strength of the British Empire. self-governing Dominions an honest grievance : let the Imperial power, backed up as it is with its mighty fleets, endeavour ih the smallest particular to encroach on the freedom of our political institutions, to make upon us demands which it is in a position to enforce, ancl , to Ave clo not see our way to accede, ancl it will create a crisis which will more imperil the majestic strength of this tie than any other conceivable situation. It is a marvellous thing, but it seems absolutely true, that the frailer, the more elastic, the tie which unites the Mother Country with her great self-governing Dominions, the more powerful, enduring, and reliable it becomes. When times of adversity break upon us, and the old flag is flying in troubled skies,, then we lay aside our fiscal differences, ' forget our views about this form or that form of policy, and an elec? trie thrill of sympathy passes to the? farthest extremities of the Empire, which shows that there is a living connection existing between the great Imperial heart and the farthest Dominions, such as those in these Australasian seas. I believe that to maintain that system, to If the honourable member preserve the marvellous harmony and stability of the Empire, the fewer ties and bargains we have the better. In those circumstances, whilst I hail with delight any generous unconditional preference which is given to the Mother Country, and which she so richly deserves, so long as she honestly and fearlessly believes in the policy which she has adopted, a policy which I regard as being essential to her stability and her strength, I hope that Australia will be found none the less loyal because the Mother Country asserts, on If her part, the independence we claim for ourselves.

Besides, so far as Australia is concerned, the whole situation is transformed by the fact that, prior to attending that Conference, we had given notice of a proposal to omit from the fourth resolution the qualification embodied in the words "" either by exemption or by a reduction of the duties now or hereafter imposed."" We struck out those words. The effect of this is that the offer of a substantial preference on our side was made subject to the condition that we received an eciual and similar preference from the Mother Country. orable member's shot goes wide. gentleman vote for the resolution about giving substantial preference? tain unanimity.

No one can coerce the British Government into giving a sovereign for a shilling. We pointed out from the first that any engagement of this kind must be absolutely free and spontaneous, and, hence there was never a possibility of our imposing upon them the onerous burdens to which the right honourable member alluded several times.

I made the very simple and ends, by means of improvements in our reasonable request that, althouch I believe shipping communication, of our cable comthe vessels are in regard to oaigo charged munication, or of our .postal facilities. went on to sketch the possibility of a committee of experts bei;rig appointed, who would periodically review the trade of the Empire as a whole in order to retain trade for the accommodation occupied. Finally, as far as possible within the Empire, pointat page 426, I explained thating out that the idea .was capable of indefinite expansion, and that there were many stand-points which we could not yet attempt to touch. We were in favour of the adoption of every means pf co-operation for common ends. I had already written a despatch, the first from any Dominion challenging the maintenance of the high rates of charge on the Suez Canal. asked for a reduction, either by the British Government itself-the possessor by means of a happy investment of an enormous interest in the Canal, from which it receives a superb return-or . if that were not directly possible, for some indirect assistance by which we could meet the needs of y ships and foreignships. From the very first I pointed if the whole of the reduction asked could not be made. At present, passenger may be occupied. There are certain seasons in the Australian trade when, as a matter of fact, the mail ships and other are charged ' on the whole of the acI on their gross tonnage, so far as passengers are concerned, there should be a concession to commence with by charging only Every time. I have touched this question I have' from the first, included improved cable communication, mail communication, and ihe diffusion of commercial intelligence, the -multiplying of commercial agencies in the country all as parts of one S5'stem. I have never severed them. Preferential trade, with me, means all those things, as well as promoting our dealing with each other's commodities. But, of course, the centre and pivot of We the discussion at the commencement, and for the major portion of the Conference, was Tariff preferences. On that, I have now to show, in reply to the leader of the Opposition, .not only that there has been no variation in the attitude of the Government, but that, as I shall evidence b.y very few quotations, the mind of the",55,William Lyne Th E Honourable But It Is Utterly Misleading In Every

The memory of the leader of the Opposition in regard to the official report is, perhaps, not so fresh as my own. lish the principle involved in the 40 per cent. of what the right honourable member is pleased to call "" high"" duties. Tariff preferences, of course, as it was necessary to remind the Conference, even excluding those other forms I have temporarily dismissed, are of many kinds. We specially warned the British Ministers that we should be putting forward only one particular set of proposals, with a. full understanding that these would be merely the seed which might hereafter grow to something much greater. We were about to adopt the forms now available, whereas other forms of preference .might become useful at a later date. Here is the exact proposal which I ventured to submit, as reported on page 235What we suggest is a trade in preferences, in trade advantages which should be conceded to each other, on the usual principle of trade, that it should be to the benefit of both parties concerned. I think that is explicit enough in itself. and means anything. So' far as I am aware, no one has yet fathered, or is likely to father, any such proposition as that this matter of business is to be dealt with to the advantage of one of the parties only. That answers your J Â£ I for a shilling idea. I there warned them that reductions in our There is not anv business of that character, duties were not likely to come; that weor which is assumed to be of that character.

We may regret that we cannot clo the business,, but necessarily we must in every case bow to< his decision. So, in -the present instance, it appears to us to be possible for each to imposeduties on a certain scale-puttin g aside the advantage which may be gained from those duties-grantin g each other preferences under them without loss orrisk of loss.

I took especial care, in that ease (as well as in others) to safeguard the members of the Conference against any misapprehension by pointing out that with us 15'per cent., as a rule, was a very moderate duty. Having so paved the way to an understanding of the scale of duties we had in mind, I went on to point out that there were two modes of preferenceThe Commonwealth may proceed either to lower existing duties in favour of Great Britain or to increase these duties to the foreigner. This latter course has been followed in Canada, New Zealand, ancl South Africa, and probably in no perceptible degree influences' the amount of duties collected.

In that direction, I said, it was possible to clo a creat deal, and we have done much in regarcl to them under the Tariff proposals now before us. At the same time, I warned the Conference-anc l this shows that I was speaking not merely of an increase of the duties on foreign goods-that an increase of local production must be allowed for where our circumstances were favorable. At page 258, pursuing another line of exposition, I saidThis would be the effect of substantial preof them, going on to sayferences, ancl substantial preferences are contemplated by the third resolution of the Conference, of 1902. Having quoted the fourth resolution of 1:902, which, provided that we might give to the products and manufactures of other self-governing Colonies similar concessions to those extended to the United Kingdom, under what I termed a system of "" Imperial reciprocities,"" I proceededRepeating for the. last time lhat the Commonwealth postulates your absolute independence in the judgment you are to exercise, ancl adding that we are not pleading for something which is to involve sacrifices, but for a co-operation which is to be mutually beneficial-repeatin g that for the last time-surel y the endeavour to look at this question from what I have termed a corporate pojnt of view, ancl the endeavour to secure corporate action, can be productive of nothing but good. . . . The policy is large, and the principle of that policv applies not only to trade andcommerce, but is capable, as already suggested, of indefinite expansion. The latter statement appears at' page 259, and lower down in the same page honourable members will find the followingWe have not yet propounded a complete scheme for anv of tliese on either basis: that is to say, neither as a one-sided preference tendered by ourselves, nor still less of the possibilities of a preference balanced by concessions from you. > Later, on. I am reported at page 261It is hardly necessary to remind the Conference that preferences may be of all kinds, degrees, ancl extents. They vary, and will vary, from time to time, between the same parties, and even more greatly between them and other parties. The Customs Tariff which we. shall submit will be framed on the same principle I have been enunciating here. Now what is it? Could any one mistake thisOur first consideration will be that of the circumstances of Australia and its demands. The next will be the possibility of giving a preference, ancl tlierefore entering into closer commercial relations with the Mother Country and our sister dominions. The third will be To that I shall recur in a few how far, and in what degree, it shall apply to foreign countries who single us out for special disabilities. I clearly showed that our Tariff, whether ""one-sided"" or reciprocal, was to be framed -with due regard to three considerations, given in the order of their necessity : Australia and its demands, preference making for closer commercial union with the Mother Countrv, and, finally, retaliation on those outside who were discriminating against us. honourable gentleman would take any one of them ?

But again, I suppose, the British Government represented here may say, "" No , we are not prepared to do that. our self-governing dependencies, but whilst we might do this, we would disturb the whole system of trade, and would lose, perhaps, more than we would gain otherwise, by disturbing the whole system of trade that we have in this country."" This is a question wh^ch is not for us. would give the preference if the British Government still maintained their, views. preference, but points out, as we do, that the preference given without, return is nothing like the preference which would be offered in return for a reciprocal preference from Great Britain. That is his point. It might be 66 per cent. that both Parliaments thought fit. Precisely the same attitude was taken up by the representatives. of the other self-governing Dominions. They all said, "" So far as we are concerned, what we seek* is reciprocity with the Mother Countrya preference exCOOK -That is much tended to us and a preference granted by us-the question of the details of those It is the sort of talk that preferences to be worked out, as they must necessarily be, according to the judgment of the several Parliaments concerned.""

If that is true, gentlemen, of our Empire as a whole, of its structure and its foundations, nowhere is it truer, I think, than in this department of fiscal policy. It is by giving, as the Mother Country has done, complete fiscal autonomy to her ColoniesI will not say only by that, but it is partly by that, and largely by .that-lha t we have succeeded in arriving at a working'Imperial arrangement. There was no hostility to our doctrine of ""Australia first."" He went on to say that he would not. even criticise our fiscal policy, though he did not agree with it, and then at page 307 of the report he showed his complete -understanding of our intentions. I call attention to it again, not as a inatter of Complaint, but simply as a matter of fact-in these very preferential Tariffs that have 'been the subject of discussion during the last few days there is not one of them which proposes to let British manufactures enter into the Colonial markets to compete on level terms with the Colonial manufacturer in regard to the class of commodities the production of which you think it your duly to encourage by protective duties. And quite rightly, from your point of view, if I mav say so put the matter more fairly. that people here are invited to believe that in the Tariff now before the Committee we have departedso absolutely from the principles laid down at this Imperial Conference debate, as to take the British Government by surprise. I wish to showhow frankly and freely Mr Asquith, and afterwards Mr Lloyd George, recognised our exact position, ancl realized the meaning of the words that we there used. On the same page it will be found that Mr Asquith further saidYou are not going lo admit anybody, British Or foreign, to compete on level terms in your markets in respect of the industries which you desire to protect. You could not do it. It is a negation of protection. Obviously the thing itself is self-contradictorv. the Government try to do it sometimes. find this passage which the right honourable member for East Sydney also quotedUnder the system of preference, or the mitigated form of protection which it is proposed your protective Tariff should now take, it is.essential for your purpose', in the exercise 'ofyour fiscal independence, and in the maintenance, as vou conceive it to be,' of vour economic interests, lo exclude the British manufacturers to a very large extent from your markets.

It was a great privilege to hear them, and a great honour to meet them It is said that there was no knowledge in Great Britain with regard to our Tariff proposals, but this is how Mr Lloyd George referred to the matter. At page 360 referring to our elections, he saidI believe lhat at that election Mr Deakin also sought and secured a mandate for raising the protective duties now levied by the Commonwealth against ihe importation of goods in which Britain drives a very considerable trade with the Australian consumer at the present moment.

Mr Asquith'.s Cobdenite principles are pure and absolute, with no admixture of protectionist admissions of the kind to which we are getting accustomed in this country. boldly, in effect, that,whatever protectionist Tariff we may impose, it cannot injure the United Kingdom. Alluding to all protectionist Tariffs, foreign or colonial, he statedI assert these two propositions : that we stand .'better at this moment industrially in the Tariffprotected markets of Europe than any of the nations which have protected themselves inter se by retaliation.

The most encouraging feature is that, on the part of the British people and its Parliament as a whole, there is to-day an even more generous spirit than has obtained hitherto. carping from some quarters at the Do minions for not having taken their share of the defence burden of the Empire. The last debate in the House of Commons, when that question was considered, was marked by a striking speech from the leader of the Opposition, Mr Balfour, with whicl '-""the Government immediately 'issociated U -ilf. This proceeded exactly on the same broad lines as the official statehere proposed. ment afterwards made to us by Lord Tweedmouth on behalf of the Government Although they felt that we had a responsiulity in connection with Imperial defence, hey left it to their self-governing Doninions to determine for themselves how far, when, andto what extent, they ivould undertake to share that burden. Greater and more generous treatment there could not possibly be. .It is upon the senti.nent thus expressed and the practical developments that we may anticipate from it, that .we may confidently rely to bring us and keep us together in the future. Â£>o, though as to the Tariff we were met by Mr Asquith in an absolutely uncompromising manner-as my quotations will have shown it was with the utmost courtesy and consideration, and an almost anxious desire to avoid trespassing, even for a moment, upon the privileges which had already been conceded to us. Having been met in that spirit, it seems to me ab' solutely. essential thjat the self-governing Dominions of their own accord should take into serious consideration their relations with' the Mother Country with a. view of discharging, according to their own consciences, and their consciousness of the fitness of things, their duty ' in regard to' the world-power under whose shelter we have grown up. Under its shelterour children must continue' wbile rising gradually to. the full measure of their responsibilities, within the Empire to the end of time. This digression is cognate, because it brings me back to the question of granting a preference to the United KingAmong the greatest dom at the present moment. That preference is due upon commercial and trade grounds alone. I .put it upon no higher grounds now, because it is to be dealt with as a matter of business. At the same time, 1 realize that considerations of business in this instance can be as much invested with spirit, sentiment, and aspiration as if there were no bargain. We bring forward our proposals with far greater ---ijarmfh, zeal, and hope for their future development than we would do if they merely repreIn recent years there has been sented a business transaction. They ought to represent ai contract of the character that a father would make with bis son upon the latter entering into business on his own account. These arrangements are very different fromthose which they would make with outside competitors. Therefore, this Committee will do well for itself and well for the Commonwealtli if it grants such a preference as is This particular schedule must be .of a temporary character, because, by carefully observing the effects of each of these concessions, we shall seek to discover, those which: are practicable, those which may be further extended, and those which should be withdrawn as having failed in their effect. Hereafter, in the light of experience, we shall be able to do what, at present, we can only attempt in a general and theoretical fashion, that is, to foster trade with the Mother. Country where it will best suit her development and that of the Commonwealth. I have put the matter in this way, although we are now viewing it from our own side of the shield. Despite the coldness with which our overtures for reciprocity, are being received in the Mother Country, I have by no means abandoned the opinion that it will not be long before we discover a change in the attitude lately adopted towards us. in this matter, and in the course Great Britain will be prepared to take. Her feeling for the Dominions oould not be warmer than it is at present, and, if I am not much mistaken, it will find adequate channels of expression before many, years. If asked why I venture this daring prophecy about a country with which I cam claim no immediate political acquaintance except that which has been derived during three short visits, I turn for one illustration to the impassioned language of Mr Lloyd George, than whom there is no more determined free-importer. port of the Conference he saysA considerable !part of the surplus population of the United Kingdom, which now goes to foreign lands in search of a livelihood might then find it to its profit to pilch its tents somewhere under thc nag, and the Empire would gain in riches of material and of men. We agree with our Colonial comrades, that all this is worth concerted effort,.even if that effort at the outset ccsts ua something. Thc federation of free Commonwealths is worth making some sacrifice for. One never knows when its strength may be essential to the great cause of human freedom, and that is priceless I am nqt one of those who believe that the value of great ideals is to be assessed always by Board of Trade returns. In thc main purpose, therefore, which has brought you and ourselves to this Conference, we agree. We differ only on ways and means. Every adopied a protective policy. Country alone stands aloof. If the words of Mr Lloyd George mean anything, this distinguished free-trader is prepared in the future, if he finds it necessary for the cohesion and development of the Empire, to make some sacrifices of his own opinions. sacrifice of principle is demanded. there are greater things than free-trade. greater things than any fiscal system, and the occasion to demonstrate it may arise. Certainly the cause of human freedom is priceless. If we are met in that spirit, many ways will be open to us in the future for many kinds of preference, not excluding Tariff preference. ister mind reading the following sentence uttered by Mr Lloyd George? We are prepared to make even greater sacrifices in the futufe, but we are convinced that' to tax the food of the people is to cast an undue share of the sacrifice on the poorest and most helpless part of our population, and that a tax on raw material would fetter us in the severe conflict we are waging with the most skilful trade competitors with whom any nation has ever yet been confronted. That would be a sacrifice which would diminish our power for further sacrifice, and we doubt the wisdom of making it. But I misread that statement altogether if the first is not the. major and permanent proposition, and the second the minor immediate qualification of Mr Lloyd George's present undoubted, firm, and clear conviction. Though he believes that sacrifices Upon page 362 of the remay be involved, he will be prepared to make them. He is against us at present; but not beyond hope. not to attempt a change. treatment which our goods have received in foreign ports, we have to remember that which was meted out to our ships, in , the Marshall Islands a wrong wl?ich has remained unredressed ' even to this day, and for which a reasonable demand has been knocking in vain' at the door of the Chancellor at Berlin during the past eighteen months or two years-. How can foreign powers who take that course of action wonder if we extend preself-governing Dominion has ferences elsewhere, and even impose disThe Mother abilities upon them? BeforeI conclude, may 1 remind tbe Committee-as my ho'nr orable colleague has done in detail-that the preference proposed at present covers Â£15,000,000 worth of British goods, upon some lines of which, at all events, decided inroads have been made? Within the last few days I have learned, from communications direct from several houses interested in importing leading lines, that deliberate No t of principle; no attempts-quit e proper and reasonable attempts in their way-ar e being made to undersell some of the staple 'products in which, to-day, Great Britain holds tbe pride of place, by a deliberate reduction in the ordinary prices of foreign goods brought here. I have had evidence placed in my hands relating to a particular line in which the foreigner has nofooting whatever, and in which hisprices have been reduced below the cost of production in order to obtain our trade. Tbis is only one of several dangers. Whilst Great Britain now holds ,Â£15,000,000 worth of trade which will be affected by the proposed preferences; experience shows that she must not rely upon retaining it, and, therefore, any assistance we can render her must be counted. The preferences proposed also cover ,Â£9,000,000 worth of goods from foreign countries, over all of which the British importer will obtain an advantage. I propose only to mention the effect of our preference .upon seventy-six items which will be free to the United Kingdom, sixty-six of which .will be subject to a 5 per cent, duty' in the case of a foreigner, and ten of which will bear a 10 per cent duty. These affect nearly three and a half mil-' lion pounds worth of imports, of. which one and a half millions are foreign goods!",65,Thomson H E Said He Country Larger Areas Of Land Were Placed

479,Mr Deakin,"When we speak of theOur preference protects the three ancl a half millions, ancl gives Great Britain the opportunity of competing for the one ancl a half millions a year. I am informed from a careful calculation that this will probably mean a trade of three millions to the Mother Country a.t once. I have taken out a list of some twenty odd lines in which foreign competition is or may become severe, and on.which this preference will afford considerable relief, but pass from this because, I have already exceeded the time for which I thought it would be possible for me to address the Committee, or for honourable members to consent to listen. I had intended to allude to another proposal which was received at the Conference-if I may use the expression-wit h scant courtesy. It was that, following the original suggestion of . Mr Hofmeyr, in 1.887, afterwards elaborated by Sir George Sydenham Clarke, there should be formed an Imperial fund, contributed to by all the Dominions, to be devoted to Imperial purposes. raised iby the imposition of a rate to be agreed upon, equivalent to a duty of 1 per cent, or less upon foreign imports-, together with a condition enabling a country which did not desire to impose such a duty to make its contribution in some other fashion. This proposal for the establishment to be devoted to the encouragement of quick and cheap communication between the mother land and her oversea Dominions, or cheaper freight for British manufacturers, and cheaper freight for our producers here, cheaper cable messages, the lowering of canal rates, or in any other manner in which we could increase trade and intercommunication between the parts of the Empire-thi s proposal was first scouted and then ridiculed. So strong . was the Little Englander spirit which, having banged the door on the policy of preference, bolted and barred it , then practically rejected a proposal for Imperial union for Imperial ends, only making at last a lame effort to frame a meaningless resolution which we declined to adopt. that the honourable gentleman should say that there was scant courtesy. scant courtesy, though, indeed, it was not f u l l y debated by those present. strong statements were uttered.

Each Parliament would have controlled its own contribution. It was simply to be dedicated to Imperial purposes by each, so that there was no interference with its self government. There was also a debate on the proposal for an "" All Red Line""-a n old proposal known for ten or twenty vears in this country-whic h is now being discussed with warmth in Canada. I fear that the direct or indirect interest of Australia in such a line is at present small. Nevertheless we supported the proposal on Imperial grounds so f a r as it affected Canada.
