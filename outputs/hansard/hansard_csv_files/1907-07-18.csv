0,And Read Prayers. Following Statement Appears In This Morn,"ing's Age:lobbies at Parliament House yesterday circulating alarmist rumors with reference to the political situation. A story was industriously passed from man to man last evening to the effect that the Prime Minister was, on account of his health, about to withdraw from politics altogether; that Sir John Forrest, whose alleged uneasiness has been much discussed, will resign; that SirW i l liam Lyne is about to assume the Prime Ministership ; and, finally, that the Tariff is not to be tabled till the end of next month. In view ot the strenuous endeavours to secure acceptance of this concoction, it is as well that it should be known that the whole story is a fabrication. The last sentence is perfectly true. The whole story is a fabrication on the part of the writer. I have consulted the deputy leader of the Opposition and the Opposition Whip, and learn from them that the statement is absolutely false. Honourable members are so accustomed to these infamous concoctions that some of them seem to regard this as a matter of amusement. That is a sign of the degradation to which the reading of deliberately manufactured items of false intelligence reduces the people of Victoria. I contradict this statement because of the promise I gave that, during the illness of the Prime Minister, no attempt would be made to disturb the f^ouse of i&epiTsentatirjes . * Thursday, 18 July, 1007.

9,Mr Maloney (Melbourne) [2.39i,"It was brought into existence largely by the terrible Civil War, and to-day $140,000,000, or £28,000,000, are annually paid in pensions to the relatives of men who lost their lives in attempting tp slaughter their brother citizens. I cannot, however, find any pension 3ist for the benefit of relatives of persons : who died to save life. But the States of New South Wales and Victoria have done more by their pension systems for ameliorating the conditions of aged poor than has 'been done anywhere else. Victoria pays £200,000 per annum in old-age pensions, and New South Wales £490,000, or more .than twice as much. But Victoria pays more in pensions to her public servants than is paid to the public servants of New South Wales, the aggregate old-age and Public -service pensions of New South Wales amounting to only ,£30,000 per annum more than those of Victoria. .such as the honourable member proposes in -existence in any part of the world? of such a schema has been twice proposed in the French Chamber of Deputies, and I am under the impression that it has been carried. France the Legislature adopted as the ""basis of the pension the amount payable to his dependents when a soldier fell in battle, which, as the honourable and learned member for Parkes is aware, is higher than that which would be payable if he died in time of peace. In Australia we .have established no standard upon which we could base a pension for a display of conspicuous bravery, apart from the pen-' sions which are payable in respect of the Public Service of the States, and in the form of old-age pensions. posal be carried, the credit attaching to it must belong to France for having taken the initiative in this connection. But I ask, why -should we always require a precedent in matters of this kind ? Why should we not make our own precedents ? No matter how little we may know of life we cannot fail to acknowledge that both sexes universally .admire the possession and display of courage. Without desiring to recapitulate instances in which such courage has been exhibited, I may, perhaps, be pardoned for -quoting the well-known words of GordonL if e is mostly froth and bubble, Two things stand like stone, Kindness in another's trouble, Courage in your own. I am sure that all of us have some personal knowledge of men who have not hesitated to risk their own lives in an attempt to save those of their fellows. I shall mention only one of these instancesthat of the diver'at the Bonnie Vale rriine in Western Australia, who day after day donned his diving suit and descended into the dark depths in an attempt to rescue a miner who was entombed there. The hero was manly enough to acknowledge upon every occasion that I heard him speak that there were hundreds of men in Australia who, if they had possessed a knowledge of diving and of the mine in question, would have done precisely what he did. The Italian Consul acknowledged that until I informed him of the fact-upo n the occasion when I was asked to take the vicechair at a meeting convened for the purpose of recognising the bravery exhibited by Diver Hughes-h e was not aware that the hero had a wife and family dependent upon him. Of course every nation has its own courageous sons. Personally I do not believe that men usually stop to weigh the danger which confronts them when they are suddenly aroused to action. But when a man knows that probably he will not reBut in turn alive from his self-imposed task, it must be a bitter thing to reflect that his little ones, his wife or others who are dependent upon him, will be thrust upon the cold charity of the world. I do hope that the representatives of New South Wales will look with a kindly eye upon the mo-. tion. I am pleased to acknowledge that that State has done far more good by means of its pension list than has Victoria. In this State we pay in pensions to public servancs more than is paid by the whole of Australasia. Further, the pension list of VictoriaI f my proaggregates nearly double the amount paid in civil pensions in New South Wales. The amount paid in old-age pensions by New South Wales totals £496,000 as against £177,000 paid to retired public servants. In Victoria we pay £343,000 in pensions to public servants alone. I do not wish for a moment to point the finger of scorn at the payment of these civil pensions, because they are payable by virtue of an honourable undertaking, which should be respected. WhatI desire to impress upon honourable members is that New South Wales, which is an older State than Victoria, and which possesses a population of at least 200,000 in excess of our own, has done more than we have done to eliminate misery in its midst. Do 'we think that men",15,Reward Of Bravery Old Age Pensions

11,Mr Maloney,"The establishmentwho have spent their lives in the civil duties of life should be honoured as we honour those who jeopardize their own safety in attempts to rescue their fellows from death? However, I do not wish to discuss the merits of that question. I do hope that we shall soon establish a civilizashould be made so that any person risking his or tion of humanity, the foundation of which will be the abolition of war. I trust that the time will speedily come when we shall majke war between nations as difficult as it is in England between individuals. When the mother country did away with the duel system, to my mind she did away with a system which was an outrage upon civilization-that of human killing human. Our civilization will never be perfect until we have abolished war between nations and consigned that infamous system to oblivion. I trust that those who cannot see their way to support the motion at the present time will be able to do so when we come to deal legislatively with the question of old-age pensions. I am quite sure that every one sympathizes with the humanitarian spirit exhibited by the author of this motion. I have never known the honourable member to rise in this House-eve n when questions of the most mathematical or economic nature were under consideration-withou t seeking to draw the debate into some humanitarian channel. Not only do I sympathize with the humanitarian spirit which he displays, but I also desire to see bravery rewarded. At the same time, the honourable member does not appear to have considered some of the difficulties which stand in the way of giving effect to his desire. He has neglected to frame his motion in such a form as to achieve his purpose. In the first place, I am very doubtful Avhether, under the Constitution, we can twist the authority to legislate in respect of old-age pensions into an authority to grant rewards to persons who may not be entitled to that nension by reason of their age. If we can do so, we shall be converting this House into an organization for the reward of good deeds. That is a constitutional objection which I venture to urge. learned member challenge the granting of ,a reward to a retired commandant? -vided for in the Constitution. If the honourable member for Melbourne desires his motion to have any effect-if he wishes it to partake of the nature of a direction to the Government, quite apart from the constitutional difficulty to which I have referred-h e should look more closely into the subject. In this motion he wishes us to affirmThat, in any scheme of pensions, provision her l i fe to save that of another human being shall become entitled to a f u l l old-age pension. He does not say whether the person who risks his life is to be granted a reward as an old-age pension. used by me simply as the unit. honourable member intends that if a boy of fourteen years exhibits conspicuous bravery in an effort to save life, he shall at once become the recipient of an old-age pension. old-age pension. member should frame his motion in such a way, that it will have some effect. He has really embodied in it something which will have no effect whatever. What the honourable member wishes to insure is that however young a person may be who has displayed conspicuous bravery, he shall be entitled to a sum of money equivalent to that which he would receive as an old-age pension if he were sixty-five years of age. But the honourable member does not provide for that in his motion. He has simply asserted that if a person exhibits commendable bravery, he shall be made the recipient of an old-age pension.. In the latter portion of his proposal he affirms that if a would be rescuer loses his or her life in an attempt to save that of others, his or her next of kin shall become entitled to a double pension. He does not provide that the next of kin, if she happens to be a widow of twenty years of age, shall immediately receive the equivalent in money of a double old-age pension. Consequently the motion will not achieve what the honourable member desires it to achieve. Doubtless his wish is that if a man or woman exhibits bravery in an effort to save life he or she shall become entitled to some award. But at least he ought to safeguard his proposal in some way, because if a substantial reward were offered we might expect all sorts of wild, senseless attempts made to save life, and the qualification which the honourable member would make the basis of the reward would undoubtedly be present. The attempt would have been made. I would",16,Reward Of Bravery Old Age Pensions

Perhaps he is not aware that this Government, against the express wish of the House, paid a sum of money to a certain officer, irrespective of any retiring allowance to which he might be entitled under.the Constitution. Surely that was the time when a constitutional objection of this kind should have been raised. criticism of the motion by the honourable and learned member. occurred to me that if we are to offer rewards at all they should be granted only upon the certificate of the Royal Humane Society, or some other kindred body. My own view is that if effect is to be given to a motion of this kind, the reward should be made to follow immediately upon the performance of the act of bravery. not so sure that unless a proposal of this sort is safeguarded in some way, there will not be a large number of applications on behalf of persons whose deeds exhibit very little of bravery, and whose lives were never seriously imperilled. the motion has pointed out, his desire is not to press this motion to a division with a view to compelling the Government to take immediate action. place a humanitarian proposition before the House, and to endeavour to secure some useful means of rewarding persons who have upon occasions either risked or lost their lives in an effort to save the lives of others. He also desires to prevent those dependent upon them for support from being cast upon the charity of the world. I think it is the duty of the Commonwealth to see that any person who risks his life to save that of others, should be suitably rewarded.

The underlying principle of the motion is, as I have said, a good one, and it ought not to fee necessary to bring pressure to bear on the Government in order to induce them to consider whether or not effect could be given to it. If the proposal is unconstitutional, then several actions taken by us recently must be fairly wide of the mark so far as their constitutionality is concerned. With all due respect to the honourable and learned member for Parkes, I submit that the proper time to consider what steps should be taken to prevent the abuse of such a system as that proposed by the honourable member for Melbourne, is when a Bill providing for its adoption is submitted for our consideration. We might make a start by recognising those cases in which awards are made by the Royal Humane Society, and in that way the determination of whether or not' a person was entitled to the pension on these grounds would be left to that body. T should like the acting leader of the Government-the Minister of Trade and Customs, who is undoubtedly a humanitarianto say whether or not the Government are prepared to make inquiries with a view of ascertaining whether the scheme could be carried out.

I 'have been led to submit this motion by the hope that it will lead to our considering very early this session the question of whether or not post office officials should be required to act as returning officers. I am one of those who believe that the present arrangement under which postmasters, whether they desire to or not, are required to act as returning Officers, is a very injudicious one. in New South Wales prior to Federation ? gaged as returning officers in connection with State elections, and I hold that it is unwise to thrust extra duties upon the officials of the Postal Department.

Most honourable members have no conception of .the immense amount ofwork which the duty of conducting an election entails upon a returning officer. There is much to be done, not only during the actual progress of an election, but all the year roundThe unsatisfactory position of these officersis intensified by the way in which the Electoral Department is administered. To my mind, that Department is a most patheticinstitution. There is nothing like it in the heavens above, the earth below, or the waters under the >earth, and the instructions which it issues lead to much unnecessary duplication of work. Tons of worthless literature are distributed amongst the returning officers. the postal officials.

34,Mr Thomas,"Certainly not. I ampf his other work, tosend out fifty-two letters to the various, polling booth officers within the electorate of Barrier. It is most unfair that a returning officer, in the midst of his other duties, should be called upon as this one was to issue a mass of correspondence. It would apnear that shortly after the sending of this telegram a deputation -waited on the Acting Minister of HomeA f fairs, with the result that another telegram was issued instructine the returning officers that they were to revert to the original system. This necessitated the despatch of another batch of fifty-two letters by the .returning officer for Barrier. I chanced to meet him shortly after hehad received these instructions, and when he inquired what I would do in the eircumstanees, I promptly replied that I should not send out any further instruction' on the subject. Whether or not he acted on my advice I cannot say. Such rapid changes are absurd. This caseis typical of many of the ridiculous instructions issued by the Department. The central office in Melbourne has absolutely no conception, of the work entailed upon returning officersby the issue of a new direction. election was over tlie Chief Electoral Officer sent out a circular inviting the various .returning officers to f urnish a report, and to suggest reforms that, might lead to an improvement in the conduct: of the elections. suggested, amongst other things, that more polling booths should be established in the -electorate, pointing out that we had there Only about one-fourth of the number provided in connection with the State election for the same division. It seems that under the present law there Can be only one polling booth for a polling district, and this official wrote asking that more should be allowed.. The Department, in reply, requested him to group the names in the Barrier district, in the way that he thought necessary for new polling booths; but this, he told me, would mean six months' work at eight hours a day, and, therefore, he immediately dropped the idea. I understandthat instructions, have already beenissued to the returning officers, in view of another election, to send in a report containing the names of all the officers whom they desire to have employed under them, and also the names of the -places where more polling booths are required. This work would occupy two or three weeks, and, moreover, might prove % absolutely useless. I suppose we. all hope that there may not be an election until nearly three years hence; and, of course, a' great many things may happen in. that time. The most striking illustration of the utter uselessness of much of the work that returning officers are requested to do under the Act is the difference between the amount of their work and that done by the States returning officers. The returning officer at the Barrier, before he undertook the Federal work, was. employed in a similar capacity by the State. that there is absolutely no comparison between the work done by thetwo sets of officers. Of course, in the case of the BarrierI am prepared to admit that while he was acting for the State he had only one electorate to look after, whereas the Federal electorate now under his charge comprises fourState electorates,, so that considerably more work may be expected. Buti f we turn our attention to. South Australia we shall find further arguments in favour of the view I am presenting. I As soon as the last general shall not. say a great deal, on this point, however, because I trust the. honourable member for Boothby. may have a wordor two to say about, it . The returning officer for the Boothby electorate is also returning, officer for the State, electorate The returning officer for Barrier of East Torrens, South Australia. In that State there are no "" singler barrelled."" electorates, the divisions returning from two to five, representatives, and East Torrens. is. what is called a "" five-barrelled "" electorate. This State electorate really has more votes, and is more extensive that the Boothby electorate; but the returning officer holds, as did the returningofficer at the Barrier, that there is no comparison between the work required in the one case and in the other. Our whole electoral system requires to be put on a better basis. I shall not sav much in this connection now, because Mr Lewis is Chief Electoral Officer no longer. I felt that a mistake was made when he was appointed, and, in my opinion, we are now paying the penalty, to some extent, for that mistake. I understand that it was Mr Lewis' idea that the returning officers in the various districts should be post-office officials. His reasons were, first, that the officers would be compelled to do the work;whether they liked' it or not, and, secondly, that they would be obliged to> take whatever remuneration",19,Postal Official S As Returning Officers
35,Mr Tudor,I s he a post office official?,20,Postal Official S As Returning Officers
36,Mr Thomas,"No. He assured mewas offered; seeing that if they did not, the alternative would be their leaving the Department. I know that a large number of postmasters strenuously object to acting as returning officers. The late postmaster at BrokenH ill I forget his name for the moment-whe n he was transferred to Newcastle, was asked to take charge of the electoral work at the latter place; and, I am told, on good authority, that he protested. However, he either had to take the office or leave the Department; and to-day he is not only postmaster but electoral officer at Newcastle. There is a great deal of dissatisfaction amongst post-office officials on account of their being called upon to do this work; and such a feelingdoes not tend to smoothness in the conduct of elections. If we have returning officers who are performing the duties on compulsion, and not because they are willing to perforin them, we cannot expect good results. times past, postmasters have, I know, been able to thrust a good deal of the work on to their subordinates, but the latter are beginning to object to being called upon to work overtime unless they are paid. said before, the returning officer at BrokenH ill is not a postal official, but a business man, who has been connected with the Federal elections ever since the Commonwealth was inaugurated, and took part in two previous State elections. officer who has given satisfaction to all classes of the community. Further, I believe he has given satisfaction to the Department, if only because, as I gather from the returns, the election for the Barrier was conducted more cheaply than the election in any other country district in New South Wales. ber make cheapness the test? for these reasons, the officer must, I think, have given satisfaction to the Department, the cost being lower only in the case of one or two of the Sydney electorates. my opinion, if we had not had the services of this business man, and the work had -been thrust on the postmaster, the result would have been disastrous. postmaster at BrokenH ill is a man of ' great ability, in whom I have the greatest confidence, and for whom I have the greatest respect, and he is highly thought of by the Department. to BrokenH ill , he has done good and valuable service, but the post office there has been terribly undermanned, so much so, that when-.one of the letter carriers took ill , it was impossible to supply his place, and the public were notified that they must come to the post office and get their'letters in that particular district. Previous to the last election, and until very recently, that condition of things prevailed; but, since then, four or five extra officials have been appointed, indicating that, in the opinion of the Department, the office must have been undermanned. If the extra electoral work had been thrust on the postmaster, I venture to think that, under the circumstances, the work and his anxiety to do his duty to both Departmnets, would have undermined his health. The present returning officer desires to resign, because of the work that has been thrust upon him, and also because of the remuneration which is paid. If the gentleman does resign, I In know, and not merely from hearsay, that the postmaster at BrokenH ill w i l f accept the position under protest-that he will accept it only on the understanding that should he refuse he must cease to be an official of As I the Post Office. He has quite sufficient postal work to do. That work is increasing, and there is every indication that it will continue to increase; and extra duties must not be imposed on him if he is to satisfy the public and the Department. If He is an the Federal elections were conducted as sensibly as the State elections seem to be, there might not be the same strong objection to the employment of the postmasters; but, in view of the great work imposed, either in consequence of the way in which the Department is administered, or in consequence of the way in which the Act is framed, I contend that it is extremely injudicious to continue the present system. The duties of a postmaster and of a returning officer are entirely different; a man may be an I am merely saying that, excellent postmaster, and yet not a good returning officer. I shall refer to the case of Mr Croft, postmaster at Gawler, only very briefly, because I am sorry to say In that he is now before the Court in Adelaide. I have never had the pleasure of meeting Mr Croft personally, but I understand that he has efficiently performed the The present duties of postmaster for ' a great many years. He is within two years of the time when he could claim his pension, but, on account of the work imposed on him by the Electoral Department he seems to ""have Since his appointment blundered, and to have got himself into his present unfortunate position..",20,Postal Official S As Returning Officers

I should also like to have a report from the Minister or the Under-Secretary as to whether, in the opinion of the chief officials of the Department, the proper working of the Post Office is in any way interfered with through postal officials having to do electoral work. I shall not occupy more time in speaking to the motion, as I wish to give other honorable members an opportunity to express their views on the subject. if they feel as I do, the Government, when it introduces its promised amending Electoral B ill , will dissociate the electoral from the postal work. AlthoughI support the motion, I do not know that it is worded quite as it should be. If reports were obtained from every electoral officer throughout the Commonwealth, the result would be a very voluminous document. What the honourable member for Barrier no doubt desires is, that the opinions of the postal officials who do electoral work shall be ascertained, and a statement furnished by the Department of the number of officials who are opposed to the continuance of the present system, the number who are in favour of it, and the number who are indifferent. Such a statement would tell us all that we really need to know, and the information could be obtained easily and at little expense. While I should like the postal officials to be relieved of this duty if they dislike it , I not convenience must be our first concern. It is, however, of value to know whether our electoral machinery is being worked by men who like their duties, or by men who feel, as some do, that these duties have been unjustly thrust upon them. When the present system was first proposed, I had doubts about its satisfactory working. A reason which, as much as any other, influenced the Government of the .day in adopting it was that the postal officials are entirely under the control of the CommonI am wealth. spare time on their hands. cials in charge of small country post-offices often have a great deal of time on their hands which they can usefully .employ in performing the work of the Electoral Department; but in busy offices the postal officials have no time to spare! Probably in such cases men who are excellent postmasters show themselves to be indifferent returning officers. Where the postal work is not heavy, the officials in charge ought, of course, to make cood electoral officers. Probably, however, the higher officials in the Department hold the opinion that the present system interferes with promotions and transfers, because the needs of the elecI hope that, toral branch have always to be considered, although the postal work is of more importance. Sometimes transfers could be effected easily, and promotions made rapidly, if only the postal work had to be taken into consideration, whereas at present they are hindered by reason of the difficulty of getting men who can do postal work and electoral work equally well. For the proper performance of the work of an electoral registrar, the longer a man remains in one district the better qualified he becomes, because he gets to know the electors of the district, and can choose as assistants the men who are best able to help him. A great deal in the conduct of elections depends on the assistants thus chosen. If a man shows himself, particularly capable in the postal businesshe must, of course, be promoted rapidly, until he reaches one of the more important offices which his organizing abilities entitle him to control. The Electoral Department has sometimes come in for unmerited criticism, owing, I think, to a disposition on the part of the postal authorities to conadmit that we cansider almost any one good enough for consider them only; the public electoral work. Consequently, men who are unfitted for this work sometimes have it thrust upon them. I do not say that the South Australian returning officer who burnt the ballot papers after the last election was totally unfit for his work; but he",21,Postal Official S As Returning Officers

In South Australia many of the State-returning officers' are not public servants outside the scope of their electoral work, and where suitable men can be obtained outside the service, I think it is wise to appoint them. In one or two instances in which such men have been displaced by public servants, it has been to the disadvantage of the Electoral Department. As a rule, the returning officers who are not public servants are enthusiasts, who payi great attention to their duties, and are particularly successful in the conduct of elections. member for Barrier pointed out that the work entailed in the conduct of Federal elections is much greater than in the conduct of State elections, and referred to an instructive case in my own district. The Commonwealth and South Australian Electoral Acts are almost identical, providing for precisely similar method's of registration, filling up of claims, transfers, and voting. division of Boothby and the State electorate of Torrens are almost coterminous, the one returning officer being in charge of both Commonwealth and State elections. I visited this gentleman just before last nomination day, and he then contrasted the immense volume of papers, correspondence, instructions, and other printed matter sent to him by the Commonwealth authorities, with the small volume sent to him by the State authorities, although the State electorate is a little larger than the Commonwealth division. Pointing to a bookcase, he said, "" A little more than a week ago we conducted, a State election. bookcase is contained all the material necessary for carrying it out. All the 'remaining space in this office is occupied by Commonwealth papers. Another room is partlv filled with similar parpers, and in a portion of the balcony which has been railed off for the purpose still another half ton of Commonwealth papers are stored."" member account for that state of things? for it. Here are two Departments,, one being administered by the State authority, and the other by the Commonwealth.. The services of. the same officers are utilized by each. The only difference between the Departments is in regard, to their adminisstration. Yet in the one case a. very I believe so. A small quantity of space suffices for official papers, whereas in the other a very considerable space is required. At the last election a great mistake was committed in having the votes counted at so many polling places. If we intend to impose upon the presiding, officers at small polling places, the duty of deciding whether or not votes are informal, we do not want those officers to be constantly removed from one centre to another. Under the existing system, postal officials are chiefly charged with the performance of electoral duties, and so long as that condition obtains we must necessarily have a large number of new electoral officers who are The honourable unfamiliar with the law. very glad that the honourable member for Barrier has brought this question under the notice of the House. I . believe that the greater portion of the bungling which took place in connection with the recent elections was due to the practice-fro m motives of economy-of piling all sorts of additional duties upon Moreover, the Commonwealth postal officials. Not only are they compelled to act as registrars and returning officers, but they are obliged to discharge many other duties. When the Public Service was classified I was under the impression that the salaries payable to the various officers were fixed in accordance with the Commissioner's view of the value of the services which they rendered. Evidently I was under a misapprehension. A t the present time postmasters are called upon to act as clerks of courts, registrars of ' births and deaths, and Customs officers. For these extra services they do not receive a single penny. I know of no time in the In that history of South Australia when greater discontent existed amongst the postal officials than exists to-day. That discontent, I may say, is general throughout the State. The point which was raised in this connection by the honourable member for Boothby is a very important one. These postal officials cannot be located at any one centre for a prolonged period, and the",22,Postal Official S As Returning Officers

49,Mr Poynton (Grey) [3.50],"I amresult is that new officers are constantly being called upon to discharge electoral duties. Indeed, the administration of the Department would be ludicrous if it were not alarming. A great deal of the bungling which has occurred is due to additional work being piled upon postal officers who formerly had quite enough to do. I should like to see this motion go further, because I believe that if an officer renders additional services to the Government he should be paid for them. Under the administration of the State Government postal officials in South Australia who performed work in connection with the Savings Bank received an extra sum for their services in that connection. under the administration of the Commonwealth, notwithstanding that each officer has been classified, and that, in some instances the salaries payable in respect of certain offices have been reduced by more than £ 1 0 0 a year, the Government have practically said to our postal officers, "" You must undertake all sorts of additional work without any extra pay."" I do not think we shall ever secure efficiency in connection with electoral matters so long as postal officials are called upon to discharge these duties. The frequent changes which have to be made will always result in bungling. If additional duties are thrust upon public servants, in opposition to their wishes, we shall never get the best service of which they are capable. I am satisfied that the Government will realize this when it is too late. tion under consideration evidences that private members' business is not always unimportant. The honourable member for Barrier has raised a question which, I believe, will have to be seriously considered when the Electoral Act is being amended. Many of the suggestions which he has made will, doubtless, be accepted by the House. Under cover of this motion, he has protested against the conduct of elections under the existing system. He has declared that one reason for the bungling which characterized the recent elections was that postal officials are compelled to perform electoral work in the capacity of returning officers. I may add that our Electoral Act also permits of other officers, such as Customs officials, being pressed into the service. To my mind, economy should not be the dominant consideration in the conduct of elections. It is our duty to place in the hands of the electors, machinery which will enable them to quickly and effectively record their votes. As has been remarked by the leader of the Opposition, there is only one day in a thousand when the free and independent elector is in a position to exercise his power. Hitherto, the exercise of that power has been largely prevented by a faulty Electoral Act, which, among other defects, permits of the employment of postal officials as returning officers. It has been said that this system was copied from that which obtains in Victoria. postal official in Victoria who is connected with the Electoral Department of the State. tion that the ex-member for Balaclava, Sir George Turner, stated that the reason why the Commonwealth utilized post-offices and school buildings in connection with the conduct of elections was founded upon motives of economy. The same spirit seems to have seized upon the returning officers, who vie with each other to conduct the elections as cheaply as possible. In my opinion, the true test of efficiency of an Electoral Act is not the cheapness with which elections can be conducted, but the effectiveness of the machinery. Under the existing system, many faults can be traced to the employment of public servants as electoral officers. It must be recognised that if a postal official gives proper attention to his ordinary duties he has no time to devote to the work of a returning officer. A postmaster called upon to act as returning officer has really to devote the whole of his attention to electoral matters for six weeks prior to polling day, and for four weeks afterwards. He has at the outset to appoint subordinate officers, arrange for their payment, and secure polling booths, whilst so soon as polling day is over he has to draw up reports -and attend to a hundred and one matters arising out of the election. It is a mistake to assume that the present system is an economical one. During an election campaign a postmaster when, called upon to act as returning officer, must be relieved of his ordinary postal duties. The relieving officer is paid by the Post and Telegraph Department, and the expense so incurred is not debited to the Electoral Department, so that we have no means of correctly ascertaining the cost of a general election. The Electoral Act is so comDlicated that we require to have as returning officers men who have not to give their attention to other matters. A busy postal",23,Postal Official S As Returning Officers

52,But Mr Wilks,"I have a vivid recollecofficer, even assuming that he has the aptitude to act as an electoral officer, cannot devote to a study of the Act the time necessary to enable him to master its many details. It is a well known fact that so many mistakes occurred at the last general elections that practically every honourable member could have been unseated if his return had been contested. Air. THOMAS make is that the Act is so complicated that it is impossible for a returning officer, having other duties to attend to, to make himself conversant with its provisions, and see that they are completely observed. The extent of the work falling upon him, and the mass of literature which he has to assimilate may be gauged by the statement of the honourable member for Boothby, that a returning officer in South Australia was able to put within a very small compass all the papers to which he had to give attention in connection with a State election, whereas those issued to him in connection with a Federal election practically filled a large building,, and demanded the attention of a librarian. that sometimes takes place. first place to free postal officials from this desire to make any attack upon him, but he extra, work, and I would remind honourable members that in this connection we must have regard not merely to the economical administration of the Act, but to the effectiveness of the whole system. It is all very well for us to say that we should not employ postal officials in this capacity, but have we considered how their places are to be filled ? I have given some thought to this question, and have a suggestion to make. The-weakness of the present system has been amply demonstrated, and I feel confident that the time will soora come when the Department of Home Affairs will find it necessary to create a separate Department to deal with the Electoral law, and to appoint a number of permanent returning officers. The control of two contiguous electorates might be placed in the hands of one official who, with an assistant, could attend not only to the work of conducting an election, but collect the rolls, and see to their purification from time to time. A t the present time, in. estimating the cost of a general election, we do not take into account the cost of employing the police to collect the rolls. I have always held that if the police were freed from this duty, they would be in a better position to attend to the work for which they were primarily appointed-the suppression of crime and the maintenance of order. During the last few years their work has been greatly increased under various States Acts, and under the Commonwealth Electoral law we have added still further to their duties. If my suggestion were D o not say that. adopted, it would be no longer necesT h e point I wish to sary to employ the police to collect the rolls. The permanent returning officer and his assistant would in each case be responsible for the correctness of the rolls as well as for the proper conduct of an election, and, in the event of a bungle, we should have no difficulty in sheeting home the responsibility. At present, owing to mistakes such as those which occurred in connection with the Senate election in South Australia, and also at the polling for the return of a representative for the electorate of Echuca, the Government are put to much expense in conducting a fresh election, and the blame cannot be sheeted home to any one. Returning officers naturally desire to be as economical as possible, and the returning officer for Dalley proved at the last general election that he was no exception to the rule. I have no vied with others in endeavouring as far as possible to keep down expenses, desiring no doubt to demonstrate his fitness for the position. The result of the economies practised in my electorate, however, was that we might as well have had open voting on polling day. The booths were certainly not so fitted up as to provide for an effective system of voting by ballot. That state of affairs was not peculiar to my own constituency, and was undoubtedly due to the adoption of a cheeseparing policy. The returning officer for Dalley had charge of an important post-office, and whilst he was engaged in attending to his duties under the Electoral Act, had to be relieved by a competent officer from the Sydney General Post Office. The work of a post-office must be seriously disorganized under such a system. I dare say that many honourable members have, at some time in their career, acted as deputy returning officers, and I would ask them, bearing in mind their experience when they first acted in that capacity', to say what would be their confusion on being called upon suddenly to administer so complicated a piece of electoral machinery as is the Commonwealth Act.",24,Postal Official S As Returning Officers
53,Mr Wilks,,25,Postal Official S As Returning Officers
54,Mr Reid,That explains the muddling,25,Postal Official S As Returning Officers
55,Mr Wilks,"Exactly. I wish in theThe returning officers, however, have to select their assistants in a haphazard fashion, and it is not surprising that mistakes should be made by men who are absolutely new to the work. We have city and post-office directories compiled by private enterprise-publication s which are remarkable for their accuracy-and it should not be difficult to secure as assistants to the permanent returning officers men able to prepare and correct rolls with satisfactory results. Nowadays, when a man wishes to ascertain the address of a citizen, he never thinks of looking at a voters' roll. He invariably turns to a directory, and finds that the information there obtained is rarely inaccurate. able member for Barrier has suggested that private citizens should be called upon to displace Government officials as returning officers. I agree with him that it is wrong to employ public servants in that capacity, but the scheme which he suggests does hot meet with my approval. Under it , a man who had been a. political partisan might suddenly be called upon to act as returning officer, and on the eve of polling day might appoint as deputies a number of men sharing his own political views. To overcome the difficulty, we must get rid of one class of 'public servants, and create another. The cost of the Electoral Department is money well spent if it results in well conducted elections, and I ' hope that when the Electoral Bill is introduced, my proposition will be seriously considered. The honourable member for Barrier has enabled us to point out in advance what we consider to be the objectionable features of the present system, and I am sure that the Postmaster-General work of his Department is seriously^ disorganized by the employment of postmasters as electoral officers. The public servant who is called upon to act as returning officer is at once brought into the realm of practical politics. His duties necessarily bring him into contact with the retiring member, or his friends, as well as the other candidates, and he is attacked by outside business people who think they should have been selected to assist in the conduct of the election. The ordinary duties of a postal official are of an almost judicial character, and I hold that he should not be associated with politics. In the interests of the Department itself it is unwise that any of its officers should be required to attend to duties of a semi-political character. WhilstI take this view of the situation, I recognise at once the weakness of the system under which John Smith is taken out of his shop, and, at practically a moment's notice, required to act as returning officer. If he is a busy man he is fully occupied in earning his own living, and cannot afford the time, unless he be a student, or is fascinated with politics-in which case, I suppose, he would probably be a candidateto study the Electoral Act. That Act consists of several hundred sections, and I question very much whether even a member of Parliament, if he were suddenly asked, could give a clear interpretation of any one of them. How then can we expect a busy citizen, even assuming that he The honorhas a judicial mind, to fully comprehend all the provisions of the Act, and be responsible for the conduct of an election ? One of the Justices of the High Court the other day lamented the fact that he could not pin the responsibility for negligence at an election on any official. To meet this deficiency, I suggest that an Electoral Department should be created. The idea I have is that two contiguous Federal electorates should have one peimanent presiding officer, who, with a small staff under him, would appoint officials, and, in the intervals between elections, see to the rolls and undertake general registering work. The honourable member for Gray made a mistake when he told us all the Post Office officials had this work placed on their shoulders without remuneration ; the honourable member forgets that the returning officers also act as registrars, though I admit 'that for performing the duties of the latter office in between elections they receive only the miserrecognises that the able pittance of £ 2 5 per annum. Postmasters should not be registrars if they are to do their own legitimate work efficiently. The honourable member for Barrier seems to be afraid that if the postal officials were asked whether they would like to be relieved of the extra duties the answer might not be of the character he expects-that all might not be for or all against. It is here that human nature comes into play. There are officials who consider that the office of returning officer gives them a desirable social status; and public servants, like other people, sometimes do not object to bring themselves under the public eye. Many of the officials might think nothing of the £ 2 ' $ per annum, but might think a great deal -foolishly , I think-of the temporary distinction and power attaching to the duties of a returning officer ; they are prepared to give ten weeks' -slavery, and runtine-isk of displeasing a large number of persons, in order to exercise supreme authority for a few hours. That may be an honourable ambition, but it is not one that should be -gratified at the expense of efficiency in their legitimate work. I am surprised that the Postmaster General has not before now represented to the Department of Home Affairs that the electoral duties impose a severe drag upon tlie Post Office officials. If those officials say that, in rjerforming the duties of returning officers, they wish to fill in their leisure moments-to play at politics-they make the admission that their offices are overmanned, and that they are not overworked. Under such circumstances, it would be the duty of the Postmaster-General, without sweating, but on proper lines of administration, to see that the offices are not overmanned. I take it, however, that in most cases there are not more postal officials than are required, and that the extra work is therefore detrimental to the discharge of their legitimate work. we had some one who could take charge of the elections, and be responsible for their conduct. Recent revelations have shown "" the man in the street"" the negligence that is rampant in electoral matters, and I cannot see how the responsibility is to be pinned to any person without an Electoral Department properly administered. As in the case of the Post Office, it is not desirable that the administration should be centralized in electoral matters, because centhey already, have too much to do. As to tralization in both instances means weakness. If there were an Electoral Department, the returning officers could be told distinctly, and in time, what their duties were, and there would not be the countermanding of -instructions of which we have -heard this afternoon. The head of such a Department would properly drill and examine men for the positions of political experts, and such a system would cause a saving and promote efficiency, while it would enable 3*ou, Mr Speaker, the High Court, and us, as members, to sheet home the responsibilty for negligence. The officials in such a Department could not afford to be political partisans. They would be civil servants, whose sole occupation would be that of electoral experts, and any abuse arising from partisanship, prejudice, carelessness, or ignorance, would mean the loss of their office. The official in charge of such a Department must be a highly Mr Wilks. competent organizer, and highly paid, because we cannot get the man qualified for such an office at a cheap rate. I do not measure salaries by the amount, but by the character of the official, and the quality of the work performed. We could afford -to pay highly for the services of the most competent organizer available, and, havingtaken that step, we ought to see that he ismade solely responsible for the efficient performance of his duties. I understand this motion to have a twofold meaning-first , that the Post Office officials are overworked when they are called upon, to undertake these electoral duties, and, secondly, that the electoral duties are badly performed. I do not quite like the wav in which this motion has been submitted. Indeed, the honourable member for Barrier somewhat anticipated my comment in this regard. If we were to ask these officials whether or not they considered themselves overworked, the answers would carrv no weight, because we all think we are overworked. I , myself, feel that I am veryIt is time much overworked. danger to discipline in the Department. anticipate what the reports would be. StillI sympathize with the honourable member for Barrier in his opinion that the postal officials ought not to be called upon to do this electoral work. These officials have very important duties to perform, and I think they do their work thoroughly. Indeed the electoral work, I think it is exceedingly badly done, and I sympathize entirely with the honourable member for Dalley in his suggestion that there ought to be a' permanent returning officer with subordinates. I should like to go a step further, and see whether we cannot get the electoral work, not only of the Commonwealth, but also of the States, done by the same set of officials. trying to bring that about for some time, and the Act was altered especially to enable it to be done. hear that from the Minister, because such a plan would effect a great saving of money and give greater efficiency.

However, that is a matter which, under proper departmental management, would be gone into.

That case should be set against the instance complained of by the honourable member for Fawkner, ini which, after taking three days to bring a man to his way of thinking, he found that that man's name was not on the roll, and could not be placed there. The Commonwealth Electoral Act is, however, more liberal than that of Victoria, because names can be placed on the Commonwealth rolls within three weeks of an election, whereas no one can vote in a State electorate whose name has not been on the roll for twelve months. I think that there should be uniformity in electoral matters so far as it can be obtained. For instance, there would be fewer informal votes if one system were adopted for indicating the elector's preference, whether by striking out the favoured candidate's name, or putting a cross opposite to it. The honourable member for Dalley seems to think that the postal officials were asked to undertake electoral work by Sir George Turner, because he had found an arrangement similar to that now complained of to work well in Victoria. But so far as I know, no person connected with the Victorian Postal Department-a t any rate in the metropolitan area-eve r had anything to do with elections until the Commonwealth Electoral Act was brought into operation. If the motion is carried-as I think it will beI trust that the Minister will furnish an even more complete report than is asked for, and that in drafting an amending Electoral Bill care will be taken to provide more effective means of checking the rolls, so that persons entitled to vote shall not be disfranchised. Steps ought also to be taken to simplify the forms used, so that the instructions distributed may not be so voluminous. inous as the Victorian instructions. returning officer for Yarra that the volume of instructions issuer! by the Commonwealth Department is by no means so large as the us believe. The papers sent to him., if piled on the table of the House, would not make a heap a foot high. three inches high. why the Commonwealth instructions issued to a South Australian returning officer should be greater in volume than the instructions issued by the South Australian electoral office, because the Electoral Acts of the Commonwealth and South Australia are so much alike. I trust that good will come of this discussion, and that a better electoral system will be obtained, though the present is the best that has ever been in operation in Victoria. Economy has been too much studied in con nexion with the Commonwealth electoral system. It seems to be thought that the Commonwealth elections should not cost more than is expended on the elections of any one of the States. In Queensland at the last Commonwealth election thousands of persons were given no opportunity to have their names placed on the electoral rolls, although they had resided in the State for considerable periods. The method of grouping names according to the polling booths in a division is politically insane. What often happens is that a constable takes a man's name and puts it on the roll, but when an election occurs a long time afterwards, that man has moved to a different part of the electorate. On presenting himself at the polling booth, he is asked, ""What is your number?"" a question which he cannot answer, because he has not had an opportunity to see the roll. Probably his name"" does not anpear on the roll for the polling booth at which he presents himself, and the chances are ten to one that, although properly enrolled for the division, it is not discovered at all, and he is therefore disfranchised. In my division there are 138 polling booths, with a separate list of names for each, so that the presiding officer at any one of them might easily overlook a name which is not on his own list. extremely cumbersome. thousands of men to be disfranchised. member suggest? according to polling booths be done away-",28,Postal Official S As Returning Officers

But many other persons are disfranchised for reasons which are the fault of the Department. For instance, I know of a district in which thousands of men are congregated. there from all parts of Australia. But the electoral officials are so neglectful of their work that many of these men were unable to vote at the last election. When I spoke to the post office official at Cloncurry about the bad state of affairs there, he said, "" It is no business of mine. Why do not the people apply for a polling booth?"" But for eighteen months it was known that there were places where 100 or 150 votes could be polled, and yet no provision was made for polling them. One official told me that he had enough to do in attending to his postal duties without bothering about electoral work. If the postal officials are to continue to perform electoral work, the Government should insist upon its being done properly. If it cannot be done properly by them, other nersons should be appointed to take charge of it. I do not agree with those who say that the present system is altogether bad and vicious. The underlying idea is a good one, though it has not worked out well in practice. The idea was to place the control of. the Electoral Department as far as possible under Federal authority. That was the motive underlying the appointment of postal officials throughout the Commonwealth to conduct the elections for this Parliament. It seems to me, however, that in discharging these duties a great many officers feel that they are being called upon to render additional service under somewhat exacting conditions. Another matter which was responsible for a good deal of trouble during the recent elections has reference to the counting of votes. In some of the States the presiding officers were permitted to count the votes in particular boxes, with disastrous results. In South Australia the practice was so disastrous that several applications for the unseating of successful candidates were made to the High Court, acting as the Court of Disputed Returns. In Queensland the head of the Department took the stand that nobody should be permitted to count the votes except the registrars in the different divisions of the In QueensState. Consequently, that officer, in the case of the Kennedy election, was occupied for a whole week before the returns were Of complete so far as Charters Towers was concerned. There is no doubt that a very efficient count was made, but, nevertheless, it involved considerable trouble, and threw a great responsibility upon the registrar. In other places, the registrars appointed assistants to undertake the supervision of They have come the whole of the elections, because they themselves were unable to personally look after the work. I maintain that if it be necessary to appoint postal officials to conduct our elections, provision should be made to relieve them of some of their other duties, so that they may discharge their electoral duties efficiently. If the Postal Department is of opinion that the Electoral Department should be charged for the services of these officers, that course might ver.y well be adopted. Until something of the kind is done, I am satisfied that the bungling which we have witnessed will be continued. Then an amendment of the Act is necessary, not only in connection with the compilation of the rolls, but in regard to the method of voting. The compilation of the rolls should be altered, and the present method of grouping them around polling booths should be abolished. It is a portion of the machinery which practically disfranchises a large number. Other sections of the Act dealing with bribery, corruption, the hiring of cabs, and candidates' expenses, should also be amended. In regard to candidates' expenses, we should either make the limitation imposed by the Act effective, or repeal the provision. Certainly we should take drastic steps to prevent a continuance of the existing disgraceful condition of affairs. I know of electorates in which as much as £ 6 0 0 , £ 7 0 0 , and £ 8 0 0 were expended in one centre, notwithstanding the limitation imposed by the Statute. I hope that when the new Bill is introduced, the Government will take steps to overcome these anomalies. I think that the honourable member for Barrier is to be congratulated upon having submitted this motion, because the discussion which has taken place will have the effecc of allowing the",29,Postal Official S As Returning Officers

93,Mr Mcdonald,"Yes.Minister of Home Affairs to know exactly the opinions entertained by honourable members in regard to the conduct of the last elections. mind, a great deal may be said in favour of the suggestion which has been made by the honourable member for Dalley. Bun the point which, chiefly impressed me was that its adoption would probably involve the Commonwealth in an enormous expenditure. If we were called upon to organize and maintain a Department throughout all the States and in each electorate purely for electoral purposes, it would necessitate the appointment of a very large staff indeed. But, at least, a Department of that character would make for greater general efficiency than exists at. the present time. Although much has been said concerning the unsatisfactory method of conducting elections under the existing system, I claim that a great deal of blame has been laid upon the shoulders of postal officials which is not altogether warranted. So far as my experience goes, those officials have performed their work in a wonderfully efficient manner considering the disabilities under which they laboured, and especially in view of the fact that at each election they had practically to work under a new Act. In many instances, postmasters have been obliged to appoint deputies in some of the polling booths of the division over which they presided. It stands to reason that one man could not be personally responsible for the supervision of all the booths within his electorate. In my judgment, the trouble which has been experienced in many cases is due to the appointment of inexperienced men, who have had no knowledge whatever of the electoral law. ter versed in it now than they were. who were placed in charge of booths had no knowledge of our electoral law, and were quite unable to give accurate replies to voters seeking, information. Further; no definite plan has been followed in the arrangement of polling places. I have seen booths in which there was absolutely no privacy, but merely an improvised desk, and what could only be. called a partition by courtesy. The elector was supposed to enter one of these compartments for the purpose of recording his vote, but a person in the; next compartment had merely to turn hishead to ascertain for which candidate he was voting. That, it struck me, was a matter which ought, to be remedied. Another evil which, should be removed has reference to the practice which, obtained in a great number of polling booths, of allowing persons to walk in and out without question, and not merely to enter the compartments set apart for voters, but to interfere with and. give personal, directions to the voter. I believe that postmasters are as anxious to guard against these abuses as are any other presiding officers. If we adopt the suggestion of the honourable member for Dalley there is no guarantee that we shall abolish these evils. It seems to me that all presiding officers and poll clerks should be thoroughly instructed in their duties some time before the election. If possible, they should be familiarized with the law by the holding of mock elections. There is a good deal to be said in support of the complaints of. the honourable member for. Kennedy in regard to the grouping of voters round polling places in the different electorates.. The present practice has led to a great amount of confusion. So long as: an elector's name appeared on the roll for a particular division the old plan of allowing him to vote in any portion of that division without any reference to the particular neighbourhood in. which he re^ sides was. very much preferable to the present system. The: motion under consideration opens up a. very wide field for discussion, and one feels almost tempted to ventilate a number of grievances under cover of it. But as it is proposed to amend the Electoral Act during the current session, perhaps, it would be wise for me to bring forward those grievances then. The best course to adopt is either to bring forward these matters when the amending B ill is under consideration, or to make suggestions in writing to the Minister, who could deal with them when drafting it. I wish to draw attention to the extreme parsimony practised by the Department, which, under the direction of the Minister, I understand, refuses to allow any sum to be set apart to provide refreshments for the presiding officers and poll clerks. These men, at the last general election, were, I am informed, in many instances, required to remain in the booths throughout the day and f a r into the night without any refreshments. That is carrying economy to a point that will not commend itself to the sympathy of the' House,",30,Postal Official S As Returning Officers

96,Mr Johnson,"A great many officersand I trust that we shall not resort again to such extremes in economy. suggestion I wish to make is that the amending B ill should extend to members of Parliament themselves the provisions of the section in the principal Act, which prohibits candidates from making donations or presenting gifts to clubs, institutions, and so forth, within three months prior to the date of election. There can be no question that the practice of making, and seeking, donations is, in many cases, becoming a positive scandal. It does, in fact and in essence, in a great number, of cases, amount to bribery on the part of donors, and to intimidation, and almost to blackmail, on the part of some of those who seek the gifts, and opens the' door to unscrupulous men of means to practically purchase their seats by means of monetary or other gifts. bribery will be made much more comprehensive than it is. I have no doubt that the various suggestions offered during this debate will be noted by the Minister of ""Home Affairs, and chat, as a result of it , we shall have some improvement in the electoral law before the next general election takes place. are two sides to the question before us, since it has a bearing upon the efficiency of the Postal Department, on the one hand, and the effectiveness of the Electoral Department on the other. When the Electoral B ill was under consideration it was decided, mainly, I think, in the interests of economy, that, ,as far as possible, civil servants only should be employed to administer the electoral law. The opinion was expressed that we should be able to exercise over such officers a control that would be impossible if private citizens were engaged. Public Service Commissioner, however, has an important bearing upon this question. In days gone by many officers receiving high salaries had very little to do, but in -the Federal Public Service nowadays merit is taken into consideration in making promotions, and men are transferred from time to time to positions where they have to earn their salaries. It must be recognised that if we impose much outside work on our postmasters, by appointing them returning officers, either the Postal Department must suffer or our electoral law must, in some cases be ineffectively administered. work of returning officers varies considerOne ably. In Victoria the Federal electorates are comparatively small. Mr W. H . IRVINE -They are quite big enough for us. electorate which I have the honour to represent is nearly as big as the State of Victoria. It extends 300 miles along the Queensland border, and comprises 134 polling places. In connection with the State .elections, the number of polling places in my constituency is much larger. There is a vast amount of work to be attended to by the returning officer for so large a division, and in selecting a postmaster to act in that capacity, the Department has to take into consideration the question of whether he can be readily communicated with by the central office, I hope that the section governing and be able in turn to keep in close touch with his assistants. In some districts inmy electorate a mail is delivered only once a week, and it takes something like three weeks to .receive a reply to a letter sent from one part of it to another. Usually the official in charge of one of the largest post-offices in an electorate is appointed as returning officer, and it is believed that a man of ability and experience will thus be secured to administer the Act. As the number of big post-offices in a rural constituency is very limited, the field of selection is comparatively small, and it is sometimes found that a capable postmaster is quite ignorant of the work falling to the lot of an electoral officer. Hitherto the \postmaster at Bourke has actedas returning officer for Darling. Bourke has a tri-weekly mail service from Sydney, and mails are regularly despatched' thence to the Queensland border. Owing to the transfers that are made from timeto time by the Public Service CommisThe policy adopted by the sioner, a postmaster who has proved himself a capable administrator of the Electoral Act may be succeeded by one whohas had no experience, and has no knowledge whatever of local conditions. Several -new areas, comprising 10,000 electors, were added to my constituency shortly prior to the last general election, and the returning officer who was called upon to act in that electorate for the first time, experienced very considerable difficulty. Being somewhat new to the work, and unfamiliar with the district, and becausealso of the parsimony of the Department, The he appointed as a presiding officer at one",31,Postal Official S As Returning Officers

Every of the Commonwealth has, so far, been conducted on economical lines, but I am afraid that we are trending in the direction of securing cheapness at the cost of efficiency. have had many discreditable and the transfers made in the Postal Department from time to time have not always been satisfactory from the point of view of the proper administration of the electoral law.

Anv one who is familiar with that part of the Commonwealth will recognise the difficulties which this officer experienced in carrying out his work. He Mr Spence. had to make inquiries as to the most desirable presiding officers to appoint; to This gentleman arrange for special vehicles, and also for horsemen to convey ballot-boxes and ballot papers to the remote parts of the electorate, and to attend to a mass of correspondence. The parsimony of the I Electoral Department is such that many to learn that one experienced men outside the service have by him to absolutely declined to act as deputies or poll clerks. The result is that the returning officers have been forced to accept the services of any Tom, Dick or Harry The on the look out for . a job. Is it any wonder that in these circumstances misThis took takes have occurred, particularly when we remember that many of these men, . absolutely new to the work, never saw the instructions issued by the Department? I doubt very much whether even members of the Commonwealth Parliament could When I inquired why an pass an examination on the Electoral Act; which they themselves framed; and we cannot expect some person, who is appointed merely because he desires a billet for the day, to be familiar with its provisions. The desire for economy, on the part of the Having reDepartment, entails considerable risk. When a presiding officer is appointed to a booth, say, in some small place, there is no compulsion to appoint a poll clerk or scrutineer ; and the result is that if that presiding Department officer be a strong partisan, he may be tempted, in the absence of any check, to pack the ballot-box. I have mentioned this matter to the heads of the Department, but on each occasion I have been told that the canAt every general election we didates have the right to appoint scrutioccurrences, neers. That is perfectly true; but, in my own electorate, for instance, there are 134 polling places, and the candidate is limited to an expenditure of £ 1 0 0 . Of course, I do not say that packing a ballot-box has I would suggest that the ever taken place in Australia, but there have been cases in Victoria, arid also in Queensland, where the supply of ballot papers have run out at a polling place, although a number more than sufficient to cover all the names on the roll had been I sent up. These occurrences are due to permitting smart and unscrupulous men to The reconduct elections; and the Department should be no party to such a risk, simply from a desire to economize. I think the suggestion I have made might be acted upon by the Postmaster-General, even regarding the question from the departmental point of view. It has been hinted that some of the postal officials have leisure time; but, with the present organization, I do not think they can have much, if any. I do know that there have been numerous complaints, several from places in my own electorate, of the shortage of men in post offices; and it is admitted by the Department that there is a shortage. However, it takes about six months before an additional man can be appointed; an agitation is followedby a long interval, necessary to convince the Department, and then there comes into play the slow method of filling vacancies. In the meantime, the other officials are working overtime; and we can well see what the addition of the electoral work must mean to them. I do not disagree with the idea that, as far as possible, be made as efficient as possible; and I trust public servants should be employed for this work, but I think the idea may be carried too far. For instance, the appointment of postmasters as registrars works very well, because they have means of knowing the movements of electors better than any other class; and I do not think there is much complaint on that score. But, in view of the growing postal work, particularly in the larger offices, where the divisional returning officers are located, I think it would be wise to secure permanently the services of some person who knows the district, and can, even at a distance of 200 or 300 miles, select the best men for the work at election time. There is no class of work in which personality counts for so much as in election work. In the Darling division, even at the first Commonwealth election, the Department had the good fortune to select a very able man who did not hesitate to use his own judgment, and be guided by common sense. When he could not get replies to his telegrams from head-quarters, he acted on his own initiative and responsibility; and had there not been in the position a man of such courage, there would have been a big bungle over that election. But we cannot find such men in every place. The Public Service Commissioner, when he appoints a postmaster, appoints him for postal work, and not for electoral work; and tlie two classes of duties do not seem to work well together. amalgamation of the duties may be all very well in closely-settled places like Victoria, House of Assembly, the five Federal elecwhere there are not adverse conditions in connection with the mails, and so forth, or immense areas to cover, as in the case of Queensland. In some places, it might be better to obtain the services of an experienced person from outside the Department, always taking care, of course, that he is not a partisan. In the case which I cited a little while ago, the results were due to a lack of knowledge on the part of those who recommended the appointment. I brought under the notice of the heads of the Department the fact that that man was a partisan and inefficient, but nothing was done. Perhaps, as I obtained a large majority, it was not deemed necessary to look into the matter very closely; but had the result been otherwise, the heads of the Department would have heard a great deal more about it. The honourable member for Barrier has done a good thing in submitting this motion. Our electoral laws ought to that the officials of the Postal Department, from the heads down, will express their views, so that these may be before -us when the electoral law is under consideration. move That the words "" post office,"" lines 1 and 2, be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word ""Federal."" In my district, a Customs officer has charge of the elections; and if the postal officials are asked to express their opinion in regard to this extra work, I think the same opportunity should be afforded to all Federal officers who may be concerned. Many honourable members have complained as to the conduct of the elections; but, perhaps, it is those who were not returned who should complain more bitterly. In my own district, although the official referred to had had no previous experience, he had brains, and so applied himself to the study of the Electoral Act that there were no complaints, even from defeated candidates. As to the absence of names from the roll, that will always be the case while so many people move from district to district without taking care to see that their names are not transferred. In some parts of my electorate, many names were not on the roll, some through the fault of the electors themselves, and others through the fault of the police officer; but the rolls in all the other districts, I understand, were very complete The in this respect. The Parliament of Tasmania, I may say, has adopted, for the toral districts, so that the Federal rolls may be used. Under these circumstances, there are two classes interested in having the rolls correct, namely, candidates for the Legislative Assembly and candidates for the Commonwealth Parliament; and the result cannot fail to be satisfactory. Up to",32,Postal Official S As Returning Officers

The officer in my district worked until past midnight for many weeks before and after the elections in order to complete his work ; and the small sum he received in no way remunerated him for the extra labour. However, as he was an officer of the Commonwealth Government, he, of course, could not refuse to do the work. I do not see why the Department of Trade and Customs or the Post and Telegraph Department should, as is now the case, be. debited with a portion, of the expense of the elections. We are told that these officials are employed by the Government, and that this is just a little extra work thrown upon them. If that be so, then I think their salaries should be reduced in the Customs or the Postal Department, and the saving included in the electoral expenditure, so that each Department may show the actual cost of its administration.

Huge machinery had to be manipulated, and it has to be admitted that there were grave mistakes and omissions. This debate has furnished a large amount of information, which I trust will be put to a useful purpose. At the outset, we must remember that a Select Committee of this House, which sat some years back, laid great emphasis on the fact that the employment of public officers for the purpose of conducting elections must be largely beneficial, both to the public and to the service. This is the unanimous finding of that Select Committee as set out in their reportYour Committee affirm the advisability of the appointment, where possible, of officers of the Public Service of the Commonwealth to ..fulfil electoral duties' on the grounds that they are subject to control and discipline; official reports electoral machinery of the States and the Returning Officers. are easily obtainable as to their fitness; arrangements can more easily be madefor their instruction in official duties, and. they are less likely to be engaged Tn party politics. pressed ? general election. ence of the honourable member since then ? sible to use public officials without increasing their work unfairly and irksomely, it is better to do so than to employ persons who are not in the service. opinion that the Postal Department is overmanned ? instances it is a mistake to use postal officials for electoral work, and, when temporarily administerinsr the Postal Department, I urged the Deputy Postmasters-General to ascertain how far electoral work could be performed by postal officials without interference'with their ordinary duties.

129,Mr Page (Maranoa) {5.40],"The canthe subject were so frequent and confusing, that they put me in , mind of the songFirst she would and then she wouldn't, Then she smiled and thought she couldn't, She thought she should and thought she shouldn't. Conflicting instructions were sent along at brief intervals, and the administration was such as one might expect to see burlesqued in a comic opera. In my division, there are 1.85 polling places, but it must be remembered that that division is as large as the State of New South Wales. I asked the present Attorney-General, when he was Minister of Home Affairs, to see that no man had to go more than 30 miles to record his vote. The honourable and learned member told me that those who lived further than that from a polling booth could take advantage of the postal voting provisions of the Act. That was ridiculous advice. Votes recorded under those provisions require the attendance of Justices of the Peace, medical practitioners, or Commonwealth officials as witnesses. stable in the Maranoa District, and do not need them. Besides, the distances to be traversed are so great, and the mail services so slow, that in many cases those who did apply to he allowed to vote by post were unable to have their votes recorded. In some parts of the country a fall of rain amounting to not more than an inch would completely dislocate the mail service. Yet, only three weeks were allowed for the sending out of ballot-boxes to the South Australian border. Had there been rain the elections in the Kennedy and Maranoa divisions could not have been held. The returning officer for Maranoa has nearly been driven into a lunatic asylum by the amount of work which he has had to do. He has been going night and day, and pn Saturdays and Sundays, but could get no assistance until, on my arrival in Melbourne a few weeks ago, I personally represented his case to the authorities. DirectlyI explained the position to them, assistance was granted to him. Had he gone out of his mind, probably half-a-dozen men would to be sent to do his work. Yet the Department refused him assistance in order to save a few pounds. secret of the inefficient manner in which elections for this Parliament have been conducted is to be found in the inordinate desire of the Department of Home Affairs to secure economy. That Department wishes to be able to point to the fact that elections are conducted very much cheaper now than theyl were under the old system. That cheapness, however, is being attained by the sweating of postal officials who are unable to rebel against extra duties thrust upon them, because they have been threatened that if they do so their services will be dispensed with. Does the Minister representing the Minister of Home Affairs think that the Postal Department is over-manned ? whole thing needs inquiring into. Department has his time fully occupied in the discharge of his ordinary duties. Why should the Electoral Department ask him to perform its work after he has discharged his ordinary duties? Post Office is said to be a regular sweating shop. offices in all the big centres are sweating shops. So far as the division of Maranoa is concerned, I want the Minister to subdivide it in a similar fashion to that which is adopted in connection with the State electorates in Queensland, for instance, the State electorate of Barcoo embraces the subdivisions of Barcaldine, Blackall, Alpha, Tambo, Isisford and Windorah. Consequently an elector knows precisely where to look for his name upon the roll. Upon the polling day for the last election a number of . persons interviewed me at Roma, and stated that their names were not upon the roll. I asked them where they resided when they applied to have their names inserted upon the list. They gave me this information, and I then looked at the particular group and found that their names were upon the roll. The position is easily explained. All the information which they could give to the officer of the polling booth was that they; ought to be upon the roll for either the Charleville or Barcaldine subdivisions. The roll was consulted, and their names not being found there, they were obliged to walk out of the booth. I contend that if have had the different stations in and around the chief centres of population were grouped, everybody would know precisely where to The look for his name. ThenI want more polling booths established in the division of Maranoa. In my opinion 30 miles is quite far enough for polling places to be",36,Postal Official S As Returning Officers

Another point that I wish to make is that we have no satisfactory guarantee that South Australia will consent to the making of this survey. Certainly, if I understand the Attorney-General rightly, the Premier of that State has declared that he is willing that a survey should be made through South Australian territory, but I contend that before taking this step we -should have before us an Act passed by the South Australian Legislature giving the necessary sanction. that we have power to enter South Australian territory for the purpose of making the siirvey what is the meaning of the cl ause relating to the construction of the railway line ini the Northern Territory agreement. Another point to be considered in connection with this aspect of the question is that the South Australian railway with which the transcontinental line is to be connected; is ot a different gauge from that which it is. suggested we should adopt. We do not know whether South Australia will be prepared to join with Western Australia in securing a uniform gauge. of the same gauge as the Western Australia lines. that the transcontinental line shall have a 4 f t . 8£ in. gauge. will be of a different gauge. Western Australia has promised to alter its gauge, in order to secure uniformity. Another objection which I have to this. B ill is that the cost of the survey should be borne by South Australia and Western Australia, who will derive a direct benefit from it . If , as the Attorney-General would have us believe, the project is an excellent one, why -should not the two States most directly concerned make the survey at their own cost? pay them well to expend £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 on such a work. Tasmania should be asked to contribute to the cost of which will [18 JULY, 1907.1 Railway SurveyB ill . 719 The right, honorI f the work is to be carried out satisfactorily-if , as has been suggested by the honourable and learned member for Flinders, exploratory work is to be done in connection with it-the cost, instead of being £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 , will probably amount to £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 or £ 6 0 , 0 0 0. The making of the survey will be a step towards the construction of a line, which, according to some estimates, would involve an outlay of £ 4 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0. Experience shows that estimates are usually exceeded, and the probability is that it would cost something like £5,000,00 0 to lay down a properly equipped railway. The making of the survey will be but the thin end of the wedgea proposal for the construction of the line itself is fairly sure to follow. According to the figures presented to us, the line would not be a paying conI f it be true cern for some years.

Thev certainly do not indicate that she is likelv to make much advancement for some time, and the probability is, that, instead of the line becoming a payable one, ten years after its completion, we shall find ourselves still called upon to bear a heavy loss.

Whether any steps have been taken to that end I do not know; but we ought to safeguard the interests of the public. As soon as a survey has been made, and there is a prospect of the line being constructed, speculators may take up lands ahead of settlement, and thus reap all the advantages which the line, constructed at the cost of the Commonwealth, would give in the way of added values. In order that we may safeguard ourselves, I shall, when in Committee, move an amendment in clause 2 of the Bill, to the following'effect: That the following words be added to the clause :"" Provided that no money shall be expended in connection with railway surveys or construction unless the Governments of the States, within whose territory it is proposed that the Commonwealth shall construct railways, previously agree to reserve from alienation, and place under Commonwealth control, all available Crown lands for a distance of twenty-five miles on each side of any proposed line."" That amendment is similar to one which was proposed when this question was under consideration on a previous occasion; and the object is to protect the Commonwealth from speculators who may-and , of course, I cannot blame them for doing so-tak e advantage of the work in order to enrich themselves at the public expense. I do not intend to traverse at any length the proposals made, because I have already done so on a previous occasion. I should like, however, to draw attention to one item in the report of the Engineers-in-Chief, regarding the desirability or otherwise of constructing this line. Paragraph 2 of the report is as followsAs to the advisability of constructing the proposed line at the present time, we beg respectf u l ly to suggest that, in view of the direct monetary loss involved, this is largely a question I of policy and sentiment depending on many issues regarding which we have no information, and we hope we may be excused from expressing any other opinion than that, if the past progress of Western Australia is maintained, the line will ultimately be a necessity and a financial success. In regard to the latter part of this paragraph, we all know that when any area of land becomes populous, there is no doubt as to the necessity for rail way s, nor can there be any doubt as to such lines proving a financial success. But, unfortunately, we know that this line will traverse a vast area of country, where, at present, not a solitary soul is living. What the character of the country is we have no means of knowing in the absence of reliable information. But, so far as the"" information available is concerned, the impression which is forced on our minds, by a perusal of the reports, is that this, country is very largely a waste tract, and that only over a certain portion of it can we hope for profitable settlement, so necessary to a diminution of the losses which it is admitted must follow the construction of the line. Those losses the Engineers-in-Chief estimate at £68,000 per annum, extended over a period of ten years, making a total loss to the Commonwealth of £680,000 on the working of the railway. So far as I have been able to discover, there does not seem to be any hope of materially reducing that loss by means of settlement along the line, except for a distance of, perhaps, one-third of the route, which the honourable member for Fremantle has told us is suitable for agricultural purposes. Nobody seems to know definitely what the remaining two-thirds of the land is like, but, from the information we have, it is not likely, unless there is some great mineral development, that we shall obtain any revenue for many a long day from the greater part of the land. At any rate, if the land is practically valueless at the present time, I cannot see that there should be any objection on the part of the South Australian Government to give the concession aimed at by my amendment. On the other hand, if the concession be made, and development operations reveal rich mineral deposits, or some other means of obtaining revenue from the land, the amendment will, to that extent, safeguard the interests of the public, and, perhaps, reduce the loss which otherwise seems inevitable.

157,Mr Mcwilliams (Frariklin) [6.25],"I desire to say that I have not altered in the least the stand I took when this question was before a previous Parliament. I have absolutely no objection to the construction of this railway line, because I believe such a line would do a great deal of good. But my opinion is that the line is one which the States directly interested should themselves construct. I have never been able to .see the slightest reason why there should'be a Federal railway built to connect two States railways; the proposal is to dovetail in between two States systems a Federal line, going, really, from nowhere to nowhere. However justifiable the line may be as a general utility line, there is not the slightest justification for calling on the States which have had to construct their own railways, to contribute to the cost. I have a great deal of sympathy with the right honourable member for Swan. No one can help admiring the pertinacity and ability with which he has advocated this railway. I go so far as to say that, if the construction of the line is sancfrom the State from which I come accepted tioned, and it is constructed by the Federal Government, the people of Western Australia will owe it almost wholly to the splendid efforts of the right honourable gentleman. It is quite clear, from the statement made by the right honourable gentleman, that certain pre-Federation pledges were made in regard to a transcontinental line. But some of us held that none of those who made the pledges had the slightest authority, either direct or implied, to commit the whole of Australia to such a scheme. We know that certain other pledges were given in the little State of Tasmania. The advocates of Federation pledged themselves that revenue in Tasmania from the Customs under the Commonwealth would not be more than £ro,ooo less than under the State Tariff. In fact, some of these gentlemen stated that 2§ per cent., and certainly not more than 5 per cent., of loss would be incurred; but the reduction in the revenue from Customs in Tasmania has been equivalent to 60 per cent. If the pledges in regard to the transcontinental railway are to stand good-if the whole of this Parliament have to stand by these pre-Federation pledgeswe in Tasmania are perfectly justified in asking that the pledges shall remain good in relation to the revenue of Tasmania. One of the objects of this Bill is the development of territory, and I point out that in Tasmania there is splendid territory which we are unable to develop simply for [24] want of the necessary revenue. Yet, under these circumstances, the people of the States -the revenues of which have been depleted by Federation-ar e told, ""Although there are necessary public works in your own States which you cannot carry out for want of revenue, you are to be handicapped still further by being compelled to contribute to expenditure on public works in other States."" Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.45 p.m. which, prior to Federation, may have been given to Western Australia by prominent politicians in the other States were given without authority, express or implied, from the people of those States. If the Commonwealth undertook to fulfil all the promises made by prominent politicians when advocating the acceptance of the draft Constitution, bhe problems which would have to be faced would be many, and of enormous difficulty. Many of the electors in good faith what unfortunately have proved to be very unreliable prognostications of what would happen Under Federation. Our loss of revenue has been very much-.larger'than was estimated. I do not wish to make what is proverbially called a poor mouth; but, from end to end of Tasmania, necessaryf public works are left undone, and our railway employees and other public servants, in both the higher and lower branches, have to be content with lower rates of remuneration than are paid for; similar services in the other States. These low rates are paid, not because the people of Tasmania wish to underpay their servants, but because, owing to the loss of revenue which the State has sustained under Federation, it is impossible to pay them what they really earn. We are asked to be generous to Western Australia, but we must be fair and just to our own people first. I admire the pertinacity with which the right honourable member for Swan has stuck to his position. If . the proposed railway is made, the people of Western Australia will have to thank the right honourable gentleman for his untiring effort to have it approved by this Parliament; He told us last night that he does not"" regard the sanctioning of the proposed siirvev as the fulfilment of the pre-'Federal pledges to which he alluded. He said that he did not desire promises to vote for the survey and not for the railway.

As I have previously spoken upon it, I do not propose to occupy much time in discussing it this evening. Nevertheless, I feel that I should not cast a silent vote upon such an important question. The passing of this Bill by the Parliament will involve not merely an expenditure of £20,000 upOn a trial survey, but an outlay of £5,000,000 or £6,000,000 upon the construction of the proposed transcontinental railway. believes that the country which it will traquire this preference over all the other verse is worthless. ple of Western Australia to prove that it is not a waterless waste. I have consistently opposed this Bill, and I know of no reason why I should alter my.attitude towards it. The expenditure of £20,000 upon a trial survey is of very small moment as compared with the outlay of £5,000,000 or £6,000,000, which will be required to construct the line. tion is estimated at £4,500,000. unlikely that the undertaking will involve an outlay of double that sum. The engineers who framed that estimate have not travelled over the ground, and are not in a position to make a thoroughly reliable forecast. I am aware that some honourable members intend voting for the Bill under the impression that they are not committing themselves to support. the (proposal for the construction of the railway. In my opinion, having admitted the principle they' will be in duty bound to vote for the construction of the line. They can only be released from that position' by a . report that the line will prove unremuneratiye. BillI have to bear in mind that I am a Queensland representative, and I have no hesitation in saying that that State cannot afford to become a participator [24]2 in this great venture. Much as I would like to support the Treasurer, I shall be obliged to vote against the Bill. If the proposed railway is of such importance to Western Australia as has been represented, surely the people of that State can afford to expend £20,000 in a survey of the route. If they did that they might have good reason for requesting this Parliament to sanction the construction of the line, because their action would show that they had some confidence in their own country. At the present time, however, they have not sufficient confidence in it to warrant them spending the small sum of £20,000. Dur ing the recent election campaign I was repeatedly asked if I would support this measure. The question, I can assure honourable members, was a very live one in Queensland. I had no hesitation in assuring my hearers that I would not be a party to penalizing Queensland to that extent. In opposing the BillI am, therefore, merely giving effect to my hustings pledges. Why does Western Australia reStates? The Constitution provides that every State shall receive equal treatmentthat a preference shall not be given to one State over another. It further declares that there shall be no discrimination as between State and State. Yet in this Bill it is proposed to bestow upon Western Australia and South Australia a substantial advantage over the sister States. Why should we specially legislate in their interests ? bounty ? forced upon the sugar-growers of Queensland, who never asked for it. Had they been left alone, they would not have expected .any assistance from this Parliament. I do not feel that Queensland is under any obligation to the Commonwealth Legislature. Do not forget that, upon a population basis, that State will be required to contribute £4,000 as her proportion of the expense of carrying out this preliminary survey. Queensland might, with an .equal amount of reason to that exhibited by Western Australia, appeal to this Parliament to sanction a. preliminary 'survey of a railway route from Brisbane to the Gulf In .considering this of Carpentaria. that such a line was necessary for defence purposes.",43,Kalgoorlie To Port August A Railway Survey Bill Second Reading

I have had the pleasure of listening to almost every speech which he has made since he entered this House, but I confess that I never heard him to such advantage as I did last night.

Nor will the speech which the Treasurer himself delivered influence a solitary vote. Honourable members hadmade up their minds upon the subject long before the Bill was brought forward.

We must congratulate the right honourable gentleman and the honourable member for Fremantle on the very lucid manner in which they put before the House the case for the construction of this line. I think, however, that a great mistake has been made in regard to it since the inception of the other advocates of the railway in Western Australia, have from time to time endeavoured to make the people of the eastern States believe that a distinct promise was made during the Federal campaign that the line would be constructed. Extracts from letters, speeches, and newspaper articles were read last night by the right honourable member for Swan, with regard to the project by States Premiers and others prior to the inception of Federation. When they are examined, however, it is found that they constitute nothing more than an advocacy of therailway by individuals, without any attempt to commit the eastern States or any assurance that the Commonwealth would agree to its construction. Most of the public men in question simply "" hoped "" -that the consummation of Federation would bring about the construction of the line. The people of Western Australia believed that the hope would be realized, and that as the outcome of Federation we should have what has been described as two steel bands connecting the east with the west!

When he made these orations in the West, the people there believed that his promises were of value-the y had so much faith in him that they were confident that he would be able to secure the carrying out of this work just as he has carried out other great works for which he deserves -c much credit. In this connection I think it well to sav, in passing, that he was not alone responsible for many of the works, and more particularly the Coolgardie water supply scheme, for which he is O'Connor, who made the Coolgardie water scheme possible. The Treasurer had the good fortune to be at the head of the Government in Western Australia at the time, and to be able to provide the money necessary to carry it out; but the master mind was that of the man who laid down his life for the work, and who has never received the credit to which he is entitled in respect of it. more generously than has the Treasurer Mr O'Connor's claim to share in the credit for that work. He has referred to it in nearly every speech he has made on the subject. does not diminish in the slightest degree the credit to which the right honourable member for Swan is entitled. right honourable gentleman saying, "" I I , the great emperor of the west, did so and so,"" we have to bear in mind that others are equallv entitled to praise. The Treasurer should receive that credit which is his an additional sum must be provided in order due, and no more. Some honourable members have said to-dav that if this line be constructed it will be because of his efforts. As a matter of fact, all the representatives of Western Australia have been from time to time just as ardent in their advocacy of the line as he has been. The honourable member for Perth, when speaking upon the question last night, indicated that the feeling in Western Australia was not unanimously in favour of a line running from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta. Some time ago the honourable member for Coolgardie showed that one of the greatest necessities of the goldfields was the construction of a line from Esperance to Kalgoorlie, which he proved would provide cheaper carriage, and be of Kalgoorlie to [REPRESENTATIVES.] Port Augusta much greater service to them than would that now proposed. He pointed out that the Esperance Bay line was opposed by the people of Fremantle and Perth, because its construction would cut off much of the traffic between those centres and the goldfields. built. agreed to only after much opposition. It was only recently that the gold-fields influence was strong enough to force the work on the Government. are against it. and when it is opened it will be of great assistance to them. I can quite understand that the honourable member for Fremantle should try to throw cold water on the proposal for ajrailway between Esperance and the gold-fields; but what we have to consider is the value of the railway for the survey of which we are asked to vote some one has admitted £20,000, and what the adoption of such a proposal carries with it. The sum mentioned may prove inadequate, and then doubtless we shall be asked to supply a further amount. Some honourable members take the view that no more 1 money will be required; but what would happen if , the survey having been made for half the distance, all the money was found to have been expended? Would honourable members, under such circumstances, allow the survey to be abandoned ? If the Treasurer, in such a case, were still on the Treasury benches-as I hope he will not-h e would point out that the survey had been made half way, and that that the Federation might not be made to look ridiculous. Even honourable members, who all along have been against this project, and are now sick and tired of the question, would feel themselves almost compelled to assist the Government in completing the survey. Then, honourable members have said that if they vote for this Bill, they do not commit themselves to approve of the construction of the line. That, in my view, is a ridiculous position. When honourable members have made up their minds that a survey is warranted, they have made up their minds that a railway is practicable, and that, in a very short period, the enterprise will pay, or nearly pay, and not entail a heavy annual loss upon the people of the Commonwealth.

When the honourable member for Oxley was speaking the Treasurer, before his anger got the better of him, .denied that he had ever expressed the opinion that the annual loss would be £60,000 or £70,000; but only last night the right honourable gentleman indicated that, 'in his opinion, the loss would be somewhere in that'neighbourhood. When the right honourable gentleman was in the midst of his great oration, the honourable member for Wentworth and myself had the temerity on one or two occasions to interject. At one point of the right honourable gentleman's speech I , in imitation of the lordly style so often assumed by him, waved my hands and inquired, ""What is a million""? The Tight honourable gentleman immediately asked, "" What is a loss of £60,000 or .£70,000 a year "" ? Such a loss might be a mere nothing to some people, but it -would be a matter of great concern to the people of Australia. That, however, is not all the loss that would be incurred. When this question was before a previous Parliament Mr Kennedy,, the late member for Echuca, and myself , in opposing the proposal, had all the reports on the subject laid before honourable members. Under the circumstances, it would be only a waste of time to quote these documents again tonight; but I may say that the engineers who travelled and examined a portion of the route estimated the annual loss at about the figure I have indicated. And it must oe remembered that the project was looked at through rose-coloured spectacles. We have to consider the difficulties of transportation, and calculate the number of passengers likely to be carried, and the enormous -cost of the haulage of goods over such a route.

250,Mr Wilson,"The honourable andbe better to send an impartial officer on behalf of the Commonwealth ? ern Australian Government should make a preliminary survey before the Commonwealth incurs any expense whatever. We have no assurance that permanent water is to be obtained along the proposed route. Then the country between the border and Port Augusta in South Australia has not been surveyed, though it is believed to contain large areas of morass which it will be difficult to cross. Is the South Australian Government prepared to survey this country, or to let Western Australia surveyors go over it ? A preliminary survey of the whole route should be made by the Governments interested before anything is done by the Commonwealth. If it were thought advisable, a surveyor might, in the interests of the _ Commonwealth, accompany any party sent out. The preliminary survey having been made, we should be in a position to decide whether a more detailed survey was worthwhile. I cannot understand the position of the honourable and learned member for Flinders and others, who say that in voting for this survey they do not commit themselves to the construction of the proposed railway. To my mind that is an absurd contention. they admit that Western Australia has a claimi upon the Commonwealth in respect to the making of the proposed railwav. that the working of the line will .involve considerable expense. The cost of haulage would' be very great.' and the discomforts of the journey so considerable that the passengers would be very few, while not much freight is to be expected. getting fuel and water will be enormous. tained between Melbourne and Svdney, or between Melbourne and Adelaide? tain fuel between Kalgoorlie and Port Augusta as between Melbourne and the capital of either South Australia or New South Wales, the construction of the proposed line would be less difficult wood on the track. member in his wanderings on the track has crossed this country. should like to hear of his experiences.

We do not know that there is firewood of any value on the route, or an adequate watesupply. The right honourable member for Swan says that the railway could be made for £3,000,000, but the Chief Engineer of Western Australia, estimated the cost at £4,400,000. If the experience of the States in the matter of railway construction is to be repeated, it would probably cost . over £5,000,000 to make and equip this railway. It must be constructed on a gauge that will allow trains to be run through from Melbourne to Fremantle, and thus provide for the through conveyance of mails and passengers. This will make it an , expensive line. Probably, too, means will have to be taken to prevent sand from drifting over the track and covering the rails. of New South Wales after a long drought the fences, even in good country, are completely covered with drifting sand. The sahie thing is likely to happen in the dry district of which I am speaking, where, ir> places, rain seems not to have fallen for years. ' The Treasurer has practically admitted that the annual loss in workinrr expenses will be from £60,000 to £70,000, and to that must be added an interest charge of £150,000, supposing that the £5,000,000 required to make the line were borrowed at 3 per cent. Western Australian members may laugh at these figures, but if Parliament sanctions the construction of the line, the laugh will certainly be with them, because the proportion of the loss which they will have to The' cost of bear will be very small. It will fall principally upon Victoria and New South Wales. But South Australia, Queensland, and Tasmania will also have to bear their share. the profit.' be ? What would any business man in Austialia offer for the chance of the profit to be derived during the first ten years after the construction of the line ? There would be no offer, because there is no prospect of obtaining a profit for the next fifty years. That loss will have to be borne by the If that is so, I eastern States of Australia.

Are honourable members foolish enough to believe that a railway of this great iength can ever take the place takings of a much more urgent character. of water carriage? I well recollect when I the Great Western Railway Company in England bought up the Great Western Canal for the purpose of destroying water carriage competition. practically closed in order that the railway company might have its fling, notwithstanding that the traffic along the 4 .canal had to be drawn by horses. How, a then, can we expect the proposed railway to successfully compete with water carriage? The honourable member for Fremantle has admitted that a railway from Esperance to Kalgoorlie is in course of construction. That means that the cheapest possible way of sending goods from the eastern States to the gold-fields will be via Esperance Bay. A very small proportion of the goods at present conveyed by sea from the eastern States to Western Australia will be diverted to the proposed railway. perishable products will be able. to pay the heavy freights which must necessarily be charged upon the line. The eastern States will be required to bear the brunt of the burden. I very rarely admit that the Age is right in its contentions-so rarelv that when I find myself entertaining the views expressed by that newspaper, I involuntarilv pause to inquire whether I am not politically wrong. But on the present occasion I must admit that the quotations made by the honourable member fcr Oxley, the reading of which drove the Treasurer from the Chamber in a state of intense indignation, contain a great deal of truth. ment of the Commonwealth brought forward this Bill in order that it might retain the support of the Western Australian representatives. Some of the followers of that Administration agreed to vote for the survev in order to save the ""face"" the Ministry. The same thing happened in connection with the Watson and the Reid-McLean Administrations.

""Upon this question the Age may lay the flattering unction to its soul that panies them will never return, because he Mr Wilson. it is right. The proposal embodied in the Bill is one of very great importance Does he mean to suggest that to the people of Australia. I believe that some day this transcontinental line will be constructed, because it will become a necessary work. But there are many underWe have to consider greatei questions, both was in England hearing that internally and externally. In the first place our population must be very considerably increased. The honourable member for Fremantle, in his advocacy of That canal was the Bill, exclaims, "" Let us open up the country."" I should be very sorry to take immigrants from the green fields of Cornwall, the lovely hedges of Devonshire, or the grand wolds of Yorkshire to Esperance Bay, and to place them upon a farm adjacent to the proposed railway. What a vista would open to them? Instead of the dairy cow which produces their beautiful cream and butter, they would have to take goats and camels with them, because the animals would have no opportunity to get anything to eat save spinifex and gum leaves, and these only in the more favoured portions of this 'remarkable region. Yet the honourable member asks us to fill up this portion of the Only the most expensive of country. What a rush for dairy farms there would be along the route of the projected line ? for gold. hear that the honourable member, of all others-in view of the memorable speech which he delivered in this Chamber upon the question of Socialism-is lusting after gold.

I do not know where they pegged out those claims ing? fer a charge of dummying against any honourable member. of this House. ger of dummying along the route of the proposed railway.

I cannot imagine that this country can be opened up for the purposes of settlement. honourable member for Franklin was speaking, I observed that he held in his hand a copy of a romance. Apparently he felt that the proposal tp construct this railwaywas so very romantic that it might well have figured in one of those admirable novels by Jules Verne, who wrote of things which afterwards became accomplished facts. The transcontinental railway from Kalgoorlie to Pqrt Augusta will some day become an accomplished fact, but its construction will be due to a considerable increase in our population. The hands of our brothers and sisters in Western Australia and South Australia must first'Stretch across this waste. When that time comes they will create the necessity for constructing this line. But when will that time arrive ? I wish that I could become an ardent advocate of this railway within the next five years Western Australia, but fear that my dreams in that respect have no hope of realization. As members of a Federal Parliament, it is our duty to deal with far more urgent questions before attempting to carry out this work. Incidentally, I may say that the great question upon which the general election was fought was that of Tariff revision; but because the Government are not yet ready 1.0 submit the Tariff resolutions the business paper is for our delectation stuffed with chestnuts. The Treasurer last night read a letter written by you, Mr Speaker, when Premier of South Australia, in reference to this line, and I think that the allusions which he made to it were most unfair. The fact that since writing that letter you have been transferred from the Parliament of South Australia to that of the Commonwealth absolves you from any responsibility in respect to it. The leader of a Government cannot commit his successors to the f u l filment of a promise made by him, although as an honourable man he would endeavour, as far as possible, to see that it was carried out. It could not be said that a promise made by the leader of the Labour Party, when Prime Minister of Australia, -was binding upon his successor, the present leader of the Opposition. It is for the people to determine whether a promise made by the leader of a Government should be fulfilled by his successor. The Premier of South Australia promised to bring in a B ill dealing with this question simultaneously with the introduction of a like measure in the Parliament of Western Australia. Has the Western Australian GoWhilst the vernment fulfilled her portion of the contract ? tion was passed three years ago by the Parliament of Western Australia. not fulfilled all its obligations in respect to that compact, and South Australia is in , no way to blame for the position she has taken up. If this line be constructed she will be called upon to hand over a portion of her territory to the Commonwealth, and will also have to bear a proportion of the annual loss on the working of the line. I think, from what I have read, that the people of South Australia have had a rather unpleasant experience of transcontinental railways, and are not likely to display any anxiety to have this project carried out. I had before me a day or two ago an interesting map prepared at the I could wish nothing better for conference of engineers which recently sat in Sydney. This map deals with the future possibilities of Australia, and shows that one of the most feasible schemes of intercommunication between the States is a railway running from Kalgoorlie to Oodna-, datta and thence across to Bourke. A line would also be constructed from Oodnadatta to Daly Waters and Palmerston, and would connect with one from Cloncurry. perhaps knows the country well, but he has not thought of travelling over the route of the transcontinental line now under consideration. If the country to be traversed is of such excellent quality, why are not some honourable members prepared to shoulder their swags and walk across it? The honourable member for Fremantle would also have us believe that all the desert lands of Australia are to be found in the electorate of Maranoa. ber imagine that Oodnadatta is in Queensland ? been pointing out that the South Australian Government have to make good the loss on the line to Oodnadatta, and would hesitate to incur further losses by the construction of this railway.",51,Kalgoorlie To Port August A Railway Survey Bill Second Reading

I believe that the Government of Queensland are stretching out lines of railway towards the western and northern borders of that State, and if railways are to be of any value to us from the stand-point of defence, it seems to me that we shall require one going further north. It has been suggested that the Port Augusta-Kalgoorlie line is necessary for defence purposes, but to my mind there is little in the argument. Although on questions of defence I defer always to the honourable member for Maranoa, I feel that the means of communication afforded by such a line as this could be easily cut, and that troops sent along it might suddenly find themselves cut off from their base. send over the transcontinental line, it is useless to build it. ber is quite correct. We have to remember that we have a great seaboard, and that it is our duty before entering upon such an undertaking as this to make sure that our sea approaches are safe. I am sorry that at the recent Imperial Conference a suggestion was made which, if adopted, will, mean that our sea defences will be weakened. Although we should strengthen our position by the provision of mosquito fleets and other means of protecting our harbors, I hope that we shall always maintain the closest of ties with the mother country, and have her assistance in the protection of our shores. I do not think it will be necessary for many years to build railways for defence' purposes, but I trust that we will make such progress that the necessity for suchi a line as this will soon become apparent. The time for its construction, however, has not yet arrived, and we ought not to be called upon to carry out the survey. Australia is not in a position to shoulder the heavy losses that the line would entail. We have to remember that the finances of Queensland and Tasmania have suffered under Federation, and that by building this railway we should not lighten their burden. points into consideration, I feel it my duty to do mv utmost to prevent the passing of the Bill."" debate so far has resolved itself into a consideration of the advisableness or otherendeavwise of constructing the railway, and not of the question of whether what I may describe as an exploratory survey should be made. The honourable member for Corangamite has spoken of the poor country, and of the disabilities settlers are likely to meet there; but I have heard the same sort of language regarding the Darling 'Downs in Queensland, though in the latter case the arguments were used in the interests of the people who had the monopoly of the land. member compare this country with the Darling Downs for one moment? to do so. But I do not condemn the whole of the country before it has even been seen. seen the Treasurer's account of this country? the Treasurer's account I should get rather a disappointing idea of the country; but when I hear the Treasurer himself, I am almost inclined to regard it as equal to the Darling Downs. I regret the attempt that is being made to convey to the people that if we pass this Bill we commit ourselves to the construction of the railway. As I stated on a former occasion, I in no way' commit myself to the construction when I vote for the Bill before us. The whole of the moneyi we are now asked to vote will be spent in securing from officers appointed by, and responsible to, the Commonwealth,, accurate data on which honourable members may come to a conclusion regarding the feasibility of this railway.

285,Mr Fisher,"We must have reportsGovernment and Parliament. As' to the question just now asked by the honourable member for Brisbane, I express the hope that the Commonwealth will sooner or later build a railway to the Northern Territory by Cloncurry and Pine Creek. I know of 110 other practical wav of opening up Australia than by the Commonwealth Government undertaking such works, though they may not be carried out for years. I am not of opinion that only the States should construct railways;, if it be desirable that the Commonwealth should do so, I hope the Government will delay not a day longer than is necessary to protect the public interests. in existence to do anything for the welfare of the people. Colonel FOXTON -The honourable member is aiming at unification. tionist; but I should not hesitate to allow the Commonwealth Government to do anything on behalf of the whole of the people which can be done better by them than by the several State Governments of Australia. The position is merely that the same people send representatives to a central Parliament to do certain things which -can be done more cheaply and efficiently by that Parliament than by the six separate States Parliaments. I particularly regret the action of the honourable member for Corangamite in speaking on behalf of Victoria. I have had some opportunity for observation, and I say there is no State which has benefited half as much from Federation as has Victoria. entitled to all the benefits that arise from Federation, but it does not show a statesmanlike spirit to unreasonably oppose a proposal of the kind now before us. There is nothing in the Federal bond about a transcontinental railway. But this paltry expenditure of £20,000, even if the only result be to conciliate'Western Australia to a certain extent, will be beneficial. I trust that the matter will not be narrowed down to a mere question of money. I have made it clear that in voting for this BillI in no way commit myself to support the construction of the line, but I-heartily support the Bill in the hope that the verdict will be that it is worthwhile to provide the line. I have travelled across the Canadian Pacific Railway, and I have read the discussions when that railway, was first proposed; and I can say that there was then 'even more bitter opposition to that project than to the one with which we are now dealing. Even in Queensland some of the railways 'which were most violently opposed as lines which would never pay have been some of the best paying lines from the start: Colonel FOXTON -Which are they ? for example. ber think that the transcontinental railway Would pay from the start? to think so; but if I were assured that it would pay in ten years, I should heartily support its construction, as a legitimate and proper enterprise. But it is only complicating matters to discuss the construction of the line on the proposal before us. The honourable member for Corangamite referred to the great desire for population; and it would seem that there is a similar cry in most new countries. No"" doubt the idea of population is a good one, but I am more concerned with the welfare of the people who are already here than with the desire to have great masses of population, with the attendant evils of privation and misery. If the desire for population be gratified, there must come a time, unless new lands are upheaved from the ocean, when the world will be over-populated. The obtaining of a large population' should not be the chief aim of our legislation. We should consider also the happiness of the people already here. I would rather live in a country sparsely populated, where every one had a reasonable opportunity to live as Qf course the Victorians are men. and women should and gain .a fair competence, than live in the richest and most densely populated country in the world where the conditions were not so favorable to the general well-being. I heartily support the Bill, and hope that, on investigation, the result will be such as to satisfy us as-completely as the project now satisfies the Treasurer. I do not intend to go into this matter at any length. The honourable member for Oxlev, and the honourable member who preceded him, expressed fully my feelings in regard to the proposed survey. I do not think that we who vote against this Bill ought to be. charged with' an anti-Federal spirit. T am just as ardent a Federalist as any man in the House or, probably, in the country.

292,Mr Archer (Capricornia) [9.40],"can see to induce us to vote for this Bill would be that, in our opinion, it is a railway that the Commonwealth should construct. If we do not believe that it is a work that should be undertaken by the Commonwealth within a reasonable time, it is not logical for us to vote £20,000 for a surveya survey for a railway to be built within an indefinite time. The stage has not arrived when the Commonwealth should undertake such a work. The only ground upon which this could be made a Federal enterprise would be that of defence ; and I cannot see that, at the present time, the question of a railway for such a purpose is urgent. Our defence must entirely rest on the supremacy of the Imperial Navy at sea, because, unless we hold the sea, we have no hope of defending ourselves to any good purpose. Seeing that defence considerations are out of the question, I cannot take the view that the Commonwealth is called upon to construct a line between two States. If by voting for this Bill honourable members do not commit themselves to the construction of the line, they commit themselves to the principle of the Commonwealth undertaking the work. That is a principle I am against, at the present time at any rate, and, therefore, I feel bound to oppose the spending of money on the survey. I do not propose to elaborate the other reasons which I have against the BiU, but I feel that I could not allow the second reading to pass with a silent vote on my part. not have addressed the House had it not been .for remarks which have fallen from honourable members opposite. I wish to make it clear that in. voting for the BillI in np way pledge myself to the construction of the line ; and in this I take the view which was expressed last night by the honourable and learned member for Flinders. Of course, a.great deal could be said for and against the construction of this railway, but that is not the question .before us now. I am prepared to vote for the Bill, but I repeat'that' in doing so, I am in no wav committed to vote for the railway itself. honourable member who has just sat down has used an. argument which has been several times repeated, and which, I think, it is fair should be'replied to at the outset. surely it can find some more fruitful butThose in this Chamber who' are true federalists 'mustrealize that there must be a delimitation of responsibility as between the Commonwealth and the States. The Constitution gives the Commonwealth and the States equal powers in respect to the imposition of direct taxation, the making of railways, and other matters. But those who sit on this side ""of the Chamber hold the view that the Commonwealth should be very careful not to encroach upon the province of the States. Not one of us believes that the Commonwealth should, except in case of necessity, impose direct taxation, because we recognise that by doing so the revenue required'by the States for their various agencies would be seriously impaired. Mr W. H . IRVINE -It is entirely a matter of expediency, according tq the circumstances of the case. So, too,"" is the construction of the proposed railway. The question is whether, under the circumstances, it is the right thing to do. learned member contend that the Commonwealth is bound by some understanding given to Western Australia to undertake this project, or does he think that the work should be proceeded with on its merits? Mr W. H . IRVINE I do not think that there is an understanding binding this Parliament to sanction the construction of the proposed railway, but there is an understanding binding it to sanction an investigation as to the reasonableness of constructing it. ing an investigation if we are not prepared to proceed with the work should the results of the investigation be favorable?

Honourable members who think with me are of opinion that this railway, if constructed,should be paid for by the two States primarily concerned. We agree with the honourable and learned member for Flinders that there is no understanding binding the Commonwealth, but we further hold that the development of territory by railway construction is a matter properly within the province of the States.

If he could prove that all the political leaders in Australia, men of every party, who were not fishing for political support, solemnly promised that the railway should be made if Western Australia joined the Union, that promise would bind us, not only to sanction this survey, but to expend the £4,500,000 which would be necessary for the construction of the line. Of those whose opinions he quoted, only two-the right honourable members for East Sydney and Adelaide-and I am not quite sure about the latter-were Premiers at the time they expressed them. But the point I wish to make is this: The Treasurer admitted last night that, at the Conference of PreH .

301,Mr Kelly,"It should not be contention that the Commonwealth is commitscene at which we are now present. He referred to this discussion as a -post-mortem, but it is really an exhumation. The body has already been exhumed three times, nnd will be again buried in another place. Still we should not gloat over the misfortunes of the Treasurer, and the other representatives of Western Australia. We admire his abilities, respect him, and many of us, I think, love him for his eccentricities. I rose chiefly to give 'honourable members notice that I intend to move in Committee ""an amendment such as I have described. I also intend to move the addition of the following provisoThat the States of Western Australia and South Australia shall place under the control of the Commonwealth all Crown lands for a distance of twenty-five miles upon either side of the railbetter quality than that to be found in way. notice of an amendment to that effect. my own. The other amendmenf of which I desire to give notice is a rather important one, in view of the manner in which it is sought to sandwich the proposal for the construction of a transcontinental line into the question of the transfer of the Northern Territory. It readsThis survey shall be :made only so soon .as the States of South Australia and Western Australia have given an undertaking to permit and facilitate the eventual construction by the Commonwealth over whatever route it may select. I hope that honourable members will agree to that amendment. Bill able member was supporting it. for Fremantle can secure a majority in' favour of the amendments which I have outlined I shall be glad to record my vote with the "" ayes "" upon the third reading of the Bill. My opposition to the measure is not prompted by anv disregard for the people of the great western State. But my first duty, I conceive, is to the Constitution, which I am sworn to uphold, and to the electors who have sent me here. I cannot forget that I am one of the trustees of the public purse of the Commonwealth, and that the proposed railway would not constitute a fair charge upon the Commonwealth exchequer. Holding these views, I trust that honourable members will not accuse me of any lack of sympathy' with the Western State in opposing the Bill. having listened to the debate upon the -initial motion in connection, with this measure, I was under the impression that its fate had been determined Personally, I believe it is desirable that Western Australia should be connected with the eastern States by rail. If throughout the whole of the intervening country there was not a single tree or waterhole, I still maintain that the proposed railway should be built. An Honorable MEMBER -Why? and in order to connect the people of Western Australia with those of the eastern States. I am satisfied that a great deal . of the country between Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie is of a the western portion of New South Wales. I think that at the present juncture the Commonwealth should step in and say, ""We will explore this country.."" When that has been done it is quite possible that -the two States chiefly, concerned, namely Western Australia and South Australia,' maybe prepared to construct the line in the expectation that within a few years it will become a payable proposition. Of course the -honourable member for Corangamite has lived all his life in the little garden State of Victoria, and is consequently under the impression that it is only a certain class'of country which is fit for settlement. Had he travelled very much he would know that it is posIn opposing this sible, even in"" poor country, to conserve water, for the purposes of stock. In the western portions of New South Wales, the annual rainfall does not exceed 8 inches, notwithstanding which sufficient water is conserved for the purposes of stock. Assuming that the country between Kalgoorlie and' Port Augusta is capable of profitable settlement, that fact would be a big inducement to Western Australia and South Australia to at once undertake the construction of the proposed railway. ' Upon the other hand, if it were demonstrated that that country is a desert, the question would arise as to whether, in the interests of defence, the Commonwealth should not undertake this, national work. I believe that the Treasurer is correct when he affirms that the people of Western Australia -were induced to join the -Federationbecause they were promised by the leaders of the Federal movement in the eastern States that this line would be'constructed.

307,Mr Spence,"Fo r defence purposes,services of an expert geologist-ther e is a very clever officer in South Australia who would be only too glad to undertake the trip-to explore the country adjacent to the proposed route from a geological standpoint. As the result of his investigations we might obtain a report which would encourage the States of Western Australia and South Australia to undertake tbe construction of the line themselves. In the ""United States at the present time the authorities are talking of connecting the railway systems of the northern portion of the American continent with those of the south, so that they may have a railway running from Buenos Ayres to Washington. It is said that the distance separating the two systems is "" only 4,000 miles."" Yet we are afraid to sanction the construction of a line over 1,100 miles of alleged desert. An honourable member, who hat been over this country, spoke last night of the magnificent timber which he had seen there, and I can bear testimony to the fact that some of the finest gold specimens I have ever seen were obtained from Taicoola. I strongly support the proposed survey, and I hope that, whilst it is in progress, all data likely to prove of value to us in the future will be secured. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee: Clause1 agreed to. Clause 2The Minister may cause a survey to be made of a route for a railway to connect Kalgoorlie, in the State of Western Australia, with Port Augusta, in the State of South Australia. speaking upon the motion for the second reading of the Bill, I intimated my intention to move an amendment to prevent the land upon either side of the railway being exploited by speculators. With that object in view, I suggest that certain words be added to the clause to bring it into harmony with what appeared to be the general sentiment of the House when the question was under consideration in a previous Parliament. I move That the following words be added, "" Provided that no money shall be expended in connection with railway surveys or construction unless the Governments of the States within whose territory it is proposed that the Commonwealth shall construct railways previously agree to reserve from alienation and place under Commonwealth control all available Crown lands for a distance of fifty miles on each side of any proposed line."" [*S] My original idea was to propose that there should be a reservation of all Crown lands within a distance of twenty-five miles on each side, but it has been suggested to me that since the country through which the line will run is mostly inferior, a larger margin is necessary to insure some return. I have been looking through Explorations in Australia, in which the Treasurer describes the country through which this line will travel, and I propose , to quote one or two passages showing what the right honourable gentleman himself has said about it. After referring to tbe explorations of Stuart, he writesThe telegraph line divides Australia into two portions, nearly equal in dimensions, but very different in character. To the east are the busy and rapidly advancing settlements, fertile plains, extensive ranges of grassy downs, broad rivers, abundant vegetation; to the west a "" great lone land""a wilderness, interspersed with_ salt marshes' and lakes, barren hills, and "" spinifex deserts."" It is the Sahara of the south, but a Sahara with few oases of fertility, beyond which is the thin fringe of scattered settlements of the colony of Western Australia. able member will not make a donkey of himself. Why not quote my description of the country through which the railway will pass? going to address me in that insulting manner, I shall not hesitate to read several passages from his work, although I have promised not to speak at length.

I shall be satisfied if he will quote from my book passages showing the nature of the country through which the line will pass. tions must cease.

The reports published by the Treasurer are certainly not sufficient to justify the belief that a profitable return will be obtained from the railway from agricultural or pastoral sources. why does the honourable member wish to secure reservations? poor agricultural and grazing country, there is a possibility of its proving rich in mineral resources, and we ought therefore to take steps to prevent it being exploited by speculators, who may apply its wealth to their own private use without benefit to the revenue when it should be a source of income to make good any deficiency in the cost of working the line. I shall not make any further quotations from the Treasurer's work, since I have promised not to occupy much time, but will content myself by urging the Government to accept the amendment. be far better if this amendment were put in the Bill for the construction of the railway. authority to construct the line, as it provides that no money is to be spent unless a certain thing is done. The conclusion to that is that if the reservation is made the money may be spent. I recommend the honourable member for Lang to dissociate his proposal from the comparatively small outlay required for the survey. objection was raised on a previous occasion, and the honourable member for Parkes pointed out very properly that the mischief would probably have been done by the time the survey was arranged for, so that before a commencement could be made with the construction of the railway all the speculators would have been on the ground. That is the very thing we want to avoid. It would be very much wiser to make the -reservation in connection with the survey, as otherwise it would be said that the proposal was brought forward too late. Amendment negatived. move That the following words be added :"" Provided that the States of Western Australia, South Australia, or both, individually or collectively, undertake to reimburse to the Commonwealth the cost of the survey in, the event of the Commonwealth not deciding within five years of the completion of the survey to construct the line."" The principle is clear. My object is to give honourable members who have told us what a marvellous financial transaction the construction of this railway will be, an opportunity of proving the value of their assertions. Amendment' negatived. propose to move only one further amendment. I think all honourable members will 'support it on the principle that the person who pays should have the control of the work. I move That the following words be added :"" So soon as the States of South Australia and Western Australia have given an undertaking to permit and facilitate the eventual construction of the line by the Commonwealth over whatever route it may select."" I wish to prevent any State from endeavouring, for reasons of local development, to dictate to the Commonwealth, which will have to find the money,-the exact route the line is to take. Under the Constitution we have no power to drive even a survey peg in any State without the consent of that State, and without some such special provision as I now propose being made beforehand, a State may afterwards dictate to It seems to be a sort of implied the Commonwealth the direction the line is to take. not say that the Commonwealth shall not survey a line. has no right to construct a railway through any State without that State's consent, it cannot survey the route of the railway without that State's consent, because the survey is only the initial work of the railway.

326,Mr Kelly,"That is why I fear theto meet him half way all through this measure. If in the course of my public duty I have found it necessary occasionally to point out the inconsistencies of his position I can hardly be blamed. If I find it my public duty to point out that he is mainly responsible for the extraordinary tangle in which this Survey Bill is now, surely I am not to blame. I have always pointed these things out in the fairest and most open way. Now that the right honourable gentleman has graced the Chamber with his presence I should like to ask him whether he has any further authorities to give to the House in tiie connection in which he used them last night? Sir member asked me that privately, too. assured publicly that the right honourable gentleman had. the honourable member. the right honourable gentleman has no other communications to make, although he told the House yesterday with his hand on his heart, that he had only, gathered these things together at a moment's notice, and that if he had time he could give the House many other authorities from other sources such as would overwhelm us with a sense of shame at the gross way Western Australia had been treated by the public men of Australia. The right honourable gentleman is in a more cautious mood to-day, and refuses even to answer a civil question about the authorities of which he spoke so flamboyantly only last night. However, I can see that the right honourable gentleman has very little interest in this railway; with him. as with others from the West, it is just a fine electioneering advertisement. If the right honourable gentleman cannot get the satisfaction of always having this railway held up before the people of the West as a bait-if he cannot twit his colleagues in the ranks of labour with being honourable members who are not interested as keenly as he is himself in the welfare of Australia-if he is to complain that he is sent alone to the Federal Parliament to carry out this work, it is rather sinpower may lie with the Commonwealth. gular that he cannot help a humble member Hke myself by giving the little information for which I am entitled to ask.

Western Australia has given consent by Act of Parliament. that this amendment is unnecessary, so far as Western Australia is concerned, and surely South Australia could not grumble if JOHN FORREST -The honourable asked to subscribe to the same principle. surely does not desire to ask Western Australia to do what that State has already done ? sary, except that, otherwise, the good work might be hindered if South Australia only were mentioned. The clause might be subject to misinterpretation, because South Australia would ask, "" Why is Western Australia not requested to comply with the same condition ?"" Why not carry on our business in a business-like way? In spite of the fact that this is not a party question on which alone party agreements are usually made, I have done everything I possibly could to help Ministers to conclude the business to-night, in accordance with the arrangement made. mistake, in my opinion, to submit this amendment, because it implies that we have not the power to make the survey unless an Act of Parliament is passed by the State affected. We have the power, under the Constitution, of railway construction, though we may not have the power-and even this is doubted-to construct lines, except with the consent of the State We have the power to construct Federal lines, and we may have the power to do so, even if the States do not consent. On this point, I prefer to follow Professor Harrison Moore, who, in his work on the Commonwealth, threw out the suggestion! that that It is now proposed that we shall declare by inference that we cannot even make a survey, with a view to deciding the policy of constructing a line, without the consent cf the State; and "" State"" in the Constitution means a State acting through an",59,Kalgoorlie To Port August A Railway Survey Bill Second Reading

368,We Know That At The Close Of A Ses,"Mr FISHER I am not protesting-which would mean, not only an adjournment from Thursday to Tuesday, but a -much more lengthy adjournment, and,, pos-sibly, other and more serious consequences. Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Minister -of Trade and Customs) [ n . 8 ] press my regret that one or two honourable members should have taken exception to the proposed adjournment. It was not my -wish to adjourn the House over Friday. I was asked to do so by the leaders of the parties. terial policy ? Has the Minister any business to go on with? lack of business on the notice-paper. If the debate on the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill had not proceeded so long as it did to-night, other business would have been taken. There was -an arrangement that the discussion on that Bill should not occupy the whole of this -evening, and that an opportunity should be .given to proceed with the second reading -of another Bill. The honourable member for Cook has lectured the Government on what they have done, but I think he will find by-and-by that the Government have to make such arrangements under certain -conditions in order to carry on the business -of the House. -speak as the Minister has. Sir WILLIAM LYNE that, but there are some old honourable -members whose experience may be relied upon to show them what is the proper -course to take. The Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill has provoked a lengthy discussion, both yesterday and to-day, and if i had not made the arrangement I made to-night it could have been blocked for another day. thing about the proposed adjournment. We were kept in the dark. Sir WILLIAM LYNE -duty to go round to members of the Opposition and tell them what is proposed to t>e done. In fact, I thought they all knew -that it was intended to adjourn over Friday. -say we knew nothing about the matter. Sir WILLIAM LYNE me when I heard that honourable members -on the other side did not know, and I regret the fact. If 1 had had the slightest knowledge that they did not know of the arrangement I should have made an announcement to tbe House. WhatI wish to impress on the honourable member for Cook is that to-night we have completed and passed on to the Senate a very imI must exportant measure. If he had been here longer he would have known how easy it would be to prevent the completion of the measure to-night, and I do not think he would have said that I was unwise in making an arrangement by whicb I got the Bill completed for the Senate. Probably, if it had been intended to sit to-morrow, it might not have been ready to send to the other Chamber this week. Mr J. H . CATTS I think that an earlier announcement of the proposed adjournment ought to have been made to honourable members. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I was not aware that honourable members did not know of the proposed adjournment. I quite agree chat it is not fair for certain members of the House to make an arrangement at the last moment and then to leave without letting the members of their party know of it. In the future, if a proposal of the kind is made to me, I shall certainly make an announcement to the House. I did what I did purely in the interests of advancing the business of the House to a certain stage to-night. I do not wish to create any bad feeling in tbe Chamber such as we have had created in the past. So far, I quite admit everything has been going on very amicably, and I do not wish unnecessarily to disturb the present good feeling. Question resolved in the affirmative. posedThat the House do now adjourn. It is not my Mr J. H .

375,Mr Ewing (Richmond,"Minister offrom the Government, but there has been no consideration with regard to any special locality. I think that I previously informed the House how General Gordon's visit originated. He made certain representations to me, saying that he had information with regard to the manufacture of small arms, and I informed him that I should be glad to see him. We discussed the matter in an informal way. I believe it is his opinion that Lithgow would be a suitable locality, but in mating a definite reply to the honourable member I may say that the question of locality has not been considered by me or the .Government, and that we have many steps to go before we get to that point. Mr W. H. [11.15] -I asked the Treasurer yesterday if he would give us more detailed information than has yet been iplaced before the House as to the character of the survey which it is proposed to make under the Bill which was read a third time this evening, and the Attorney-General has shown me a statement of particulars which I should like him to read, so that it may be published in Hansard. torney-General) [11.16] I am glad to afford the House the information to which the honourable and learned member refers. Yesterday I asked the Treasurer, who has made the arrangements with Mr Kernot, what is contemplated, and in reply the right honourable gentleman has furnished the following statement1. The'survey would be a sufficient one to ascertain the cost of construction, the cost of water supply by conservation, the prospects of water being obtained by boring, the character of the land on each side of the route, and its suitability for agricultural and pastoral purposes, and there would be a geological survey to ascertain the mineral resources of the country. There are two routes through South Australia to be examined-on e from Port Augustav i i Tar. coola, passing some forty miles north of Eucla, and thence to Kalgoorlie; the other from Port Augusta through the Gawler Ranges vid Fowlers Bay, and the head of the Great Australian Bight, passing about ten miles north of Eucla to Kalgoorlie. Both routes would practically tTavcrse the same route through Western Australia. The Tarcoola route would probablv cost about half a million sterling more than the more southern route. a. The actual pegging out of the construction would not be included in the ,£20,000, but the information would be sufficient to enable Parliament to decide ns to whether the work should be undertaken, and sufficient to enable Parliament to pass a B ill setting out the route to be followed' and authorizing the work to be undertaken. for explorations' to the north and soutb of the proposed routes with a view to determining the character of the country? Government has notified that it is prepared to send out a prospecting party with which it would be possible for the survey party to co-operate. I shall represent to the Minister of Home Affairs, who has charge of the Bill, that it is the desire of honourable members that, asfar as possible, the nature of the country through which the line will pass shall be ascertained.
