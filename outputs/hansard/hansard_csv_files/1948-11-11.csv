Thursday, 11 .November, 191f8. Mr .DEPUTY-SEEAXEB (Hr. J. J. Clark) took the chair at 2.30 p.m., and read prayers. Mmister aware that, according to this morning's press reports, the Joint Coal Board intends to asi the miners' federation on Monday of next week to raise the present darg to permit miners to produce at least one ton of coal a day more than they are producing at present, and to ""work hack on each of the three "" back "" alternate between now 'and Christmas ? In view of the serious state of Australian industry, as the result of the acute shortage of black coal available from .New South Wales and of the need -to avoid any disruption -of Australian industry, with .its consequential effect on the whole Australian economy, will the Prime Minister make a personal -pica .to the New South Wales coal-miners to work each -Saturday morning between now and Christinas, in preference to alternate Saturdays? ' Mr .CHI-FLEY I have not seen the reoortto which the honourable member has referred. I am aware that some time ago the joint Coal Board approached the miners' federation with regard to the darg. I understood at that time that an agreement had been reached, particularly in respect of mine? in which power COAL. Saturdays that Temain",7,Setup
1,Mr Harrison,"I s the Primeoorers are installed, to inorease the number of tons of coal that could be produced .under the darg. The proposal referred to by the honourable member is apparently a new one. I have discussed with the Minister for Shipping and Fuel the possibility of the miners working on eaoh of the "" back "" Saturdays. I shall not make any plea to the miners, but I shall point out to the coal-miners, as 1 have done previously, how important it is to ensure that adequate supplies of coal shall be made available for industrial and domestic purposes. The coal-miners, however, are not the only persons in the community who bave failed to achieve full production. Not only some other workers, but also some people in much higher positions seem to be able to spend plenty of time in places other than their places of employment. The honourable member may rest assured that any appeal that I can make to workers generally, particularly to the coal-miners, to increase production, will be made. for the Army indicate the present position in regard to recruiting for the Citizen Military Eorces? What is the percentage of recruits already enlisted in relation to the total overall requirements of the forces? * Is the present rate of enlistment considered satisfactory? honourable member for having informed me this morning that he proposed to ask this question, because I am now able to supply the information he seeks. Approximately one-quarter of the number of men required for the Citizen Military Eorces has been recruited since the campaign officially commenced on the 1st July of this year. The over-all requirement for the new citizen army is 47,903, and up to the 28th October, 12,047 recruits, or 24.5 per cent, of the total, had heen enlisted. Victoria leads the other States with the highest percentage of enlistments as 4,122 or 28.8 per cent, of the quota of 13,939 set down for that State have joined up. New Sonth Wales is next, with 4,566 enlistments, or 25.4 per cent, of the target figure of 17,390. Comparative figure? for the other States aro as follows:Western Australia-3,03 0 required, 804 enlisted, or 21.8 per cent; Soutli Australia4,272, 859, 10.7 per cent; Tasmania -1,848 . 356, 19.2 per cent.; Queensland-6,824 , 1,340. 19.1 per cent. Although there is a slight lag in enlistments in the less populous States compared with those in Victoria and New South Wales, recruiting to date is quite satisfactory.' Recent publicity drives and Army exhibitions in the States have yielded good results, and have been responsible, no doubt, for improved weekly averages. If the present rate of enlistment Ls maintained, requirements for the Citizen Military Eorces will be fulfilled in a little more than twelve months. ter for the Army whether the film All Quiet on the Western Front was shown by the recruiting group during the recent drive for recruits for the Citizen Army in Tasmania. Does thc Minister con-, .sider it a suitable film to he shown or one likely to encourage enlistment? that the film All Quiet on the Western Front was displayed in Tasmania. I do not know whether the film is based on the book of that name, but if it is, it is not suitable for display in Tasmania. I shall ascertain the facts. MR. ARTHUR CROUCH. Crouch, of Sydney, been appointed to the staff of the journal BCON, which circulates amongst members ""of the occupation force in Japan? If so; will the Minister say whether Mr Crouch is an ex-serviceman? Was thc position on BCON advertised in the newspapers, and were there any other applicants for the position? If so, what were their names, qualifications and war service? If the Minister cannot supply this information immediately, will he make inquiries, and issue a full statement later? sant with the details of the appointment referred to by the honorahle memher, but I issued instructions some time ago that all appointments are to he made",12,Thursday 11 November 1948

7,Mr Chambers,"I am not converfrom among ex-iservicemen. I shall inquire into the matter mentioned by the honourable member. Kr.' CONELAN"" -Can the Minister t'or Works and Housing say whether Parliament House is a temporary building, and whether a site on CapitolH ill was set aside in the Griffin plan for the permanent Parliament House? In view of the fact that the Parliament will have a larger membership after the next general election, will the Minister obtain Cabinet approval to conduct a world-wide competition for plans and specifications for a new building, as it will take several years for such the Department of Civil Aviation to a competition to be completed? present Parliament House is a very good one^ and I only hope that I shall be here in it for a long time. It will be a good enough stable for me for the next ten or fifteen years. Therefore, whilst admitting that the honourable member's suggestion has merit, and should be kept in mind, I believe that it is far too early co start a competition for a new Parliament House that might not be built within the next twenty years. If such a competition were held, we might have a repetition of what happened in connection with the permanent administrative building in Canberra. The design for that building was prepared over twenty years ago, and, whilst it was regarded as suitable at the time, it was not of the type of which modern architects would approve. Therefore, I consider that it will be time enough to call for designs for the new Parliament House when we are in a position to go on with the building. Dame ENID LYONS I desire to make a personal explanation. ""When asking a question yesterday about King -Island, I mentioned the matter pf air -services. I have received from"" the warden of the island a telegram stating that some misunderstanding may exist concerning the cancellation of air services, and he desires me to inform the public, through this House, that there is still a curtailed passenger service to King Island on three days a week. Civil Aviation consider bringing Australian civil aviation conditions into line with those of the TJnited States of America by making it compulsory for all aircraft to carry de-icing equipment? Will he inquire into the existing practices, as I have been informed that a recent unofficial inspection of twelve aircraft on the ground at the Essendon aerodrome in Victoria disclosed that only one had de-icing equipment properly attached? As it has been stated that such equipment reduces the pay-load of aircraft by 50 lb. an engine, will he request insist on such equipment, even though icing may be only an occasional hazard in Australian flying conditions? it is correct that all aircraft in the TJnited States of America are obliged to carry de-icing equipment. Many services in that country fly south where de-icing equipment would-rarely be required and these aircraft are probably never flown north where icing conditions can be frequently expected. It is most advantageous that aircraft should be equipped with de-icing equipment and I should like to see Australian aircraft so equipped. There is no objection to deicing equipment on the score that it reduces the pay-load by 50 lb. an engine. That is less than one-quarter of the passenger allowance and that consideration has not influenced decisions. I take the opportunity of saying that Australia is a member of the International Civil Aviation Organization, whose standards have world-wide acceptance. The Department of Civil Aviation is doing its best to live up to them. I say with a great deal of confidence that Australia is nearer to acceptance and application of those standards than is any other country. WAR PENSIONS.

NEW GUINEA AND PAPUA. tion of the Prime Minister been directed to an article published in Renzo's Digest of Tokyo, and reproduced in this morning's Sydney Morning Herald, recommending the migration of 20,000 Japanese, principally to Dutch New Guinea, over a period of ten years? Has the right honourable gentleman been informed that at a meeting of the United Nations in Paris the representative of tlie South African Government has said that it would integrate South-West Africa into the Union of South Africa and would not place it-under the authority of the United Nations Trusteeship Council? In view of the impossibility of establishing adequate defences in New Guinea under trusteeship or mandate conditions, will the right honourable gentleman give consideration to the integration of New Guinea into the Commonwealth of Australia, so that effective defences against possible aggression rnay be provided? article to which the right honourable gentleman has referred. It was previously suggested by a private individual that Japanese should be allowed to migrate to New Guinea or to Dutch New Guinea. The Australian Government made it clear that it was violently opposed to such migration. We are not able to interfere with the administration of Dutch territory, but we shall make every effort possible to prevent Japanese migestion for the integration of Dutch New Guinea into the Commonwealth of Australia would be regarded with some hostility by the Dutch Government. the portion of New Guinea which is controlled by the Australian Government. part of New Guinea that is now being administered by the Australian Government will eventually reach a stage of equality comparable with the mainland of Australia. I remind the right honourable gentleman that the residents of that, part of New Guinea which is under Australian control do not pay taxes, and accordingly I am not sure that they would want to be placed on an equality with Australian residents. The matter has already been considered but the right honourable gentleman may rest assured that the Government will further consider it. Minister for External Territories, 1 address a question to the Prime Minister. In June last the Minister for ExternaTerritories introduced a bill relating to Papua and New Guinea. The principal purpose of the measure which was of some importance was to merge the administrations of Papua and New Guinea. I asked the Minister at the time whether there had been any opposition to the proposal at the nieeting of the Trusteeship Council of the United Nations, particularly by Russia, as had been stated in this House. The honourable gentleman repliedThe Soviet view was that it would be impossible to envisage independence when all aspects of administration were refused and the plan would in practice inevitably prevent New Guinea attaining self-government or independence. I observe that the bill has been withdrawn from the notice-paper. As the Russian representative at the meeting of the Security Council of the United Nations was so well informed, will the Prime Minister state whether representations were made to him by the Minister for External Affairs to drop or to postpone the bill? Were any representations made by the Soviet Embassy in Australia in relation to the",16,Public Service Statement By M K R G Casey

Will the measure be reintroduced? dropped because of representations made by any outside country. Before the bill was introduced I examined its conditions carefully with the Minister for External Affairs. It was intended to proceed with the measure during the present sittings of the Parliament but in the meantime some charges were made at the meeting of the Trusteeship Council for which there was no justification. were made by other representatives as well as by the representative of Russia. It was suggested that the proposal might be referred to the International Court of Justice. The Australian representatives made a strong protest against any such appeal. nal Affairs discussed these protests with me personally, and not with the Minister for External Territories I then-and I decided that in view of what had been said it would be far better for the Minister for External Affairs to deal with the objections at a later meeting of the Trusteeship Council. The right honourable gentleman agreed to do so. I am satisfied that the objections voiced at the meeting of the Council were made by people who were completely uninformed about the position; and I considered that it would be best to allow the matter to be settled in the Council. It is the intention .of the Government to bring down a bill during the next session. »f the Parliament. RAIL TRANSPORT. Minister state whether it is true that the Queensland Government is attempting to obtain railway engines, steel rails and structural steel from France and Belgium, and is requesting the Australian Government to make available dollar credits for the purchase of rolling stock in America? This equipment is urgently needed to relieve serious shortages in railway rolling stock, which is holding up the rapid transport of goods, and must seriously hamper the planned development of coal deposits and of Empire food production in central Queensland. Did this action on the part of the Queensland Government result from the shortage of equipment in Australia?. If so, what is the reason for the-shortage, and what action has been taken by the Minister for Transport, who has been approached in the matter, to explore fully the possibility of producing the required steel in Australia ?' Queensland Government is anxious to improve the transport facilities of thar. State. Some time ago, the Minister for Transport made valiant efforts to induce the States to agree to a scheme for the standardization of railway gauges throughout Australia. The Queensland Government was requested to join in. that general scheme; but, because it objected to the inclusion in the scheme of a lin«i The Minister for Exterintended to make possible the exploitation of the fertile areas of the Channel country, the Queensland Government refused to do so. I understand that, as do not think he was here the result of further negotiations, the Queensland Government is now prepared to waive its objection and to join in the general scheme. No formal agreement has yet been signed. It is true that all the State Railways Departments in Australia, with the exception of the Tasmanian Railway Department, have madf; requests for permission to import railway equipment from overseas. I do not. recall any request having been made in connection, with steel rails, but requests have certainly been made for permission to import locomotives and rolling-stock. The Governments of Victoria and South .Australia sought permission to import diesel engines from America in order to relieve the strain on their railway transport systems. It has also heen proposed that an American diesel locomotive manufacturing company should enter into an arrangement with the Clyde Engineering Company for the purpose of manufacturing American-type diesel locomotives in Australia.

42,Mr Harrison (Wentworth,"Actingthe beat return for the money that has been -advanced to the States. The latest available report of the Housing L'ommission is dated June, 1946, and no other official or authentic information about its activities is abtainable. Having regard to the great difficulty experienced by many people in securing homes, it seems to me that it is time the matter was ventilated on the floor of the House. The housing of the people is a matter of tremendous importance. Without adequate housing, it is impossible to inculcate in the people a proper pride in themselves, their country and their way of life. Housing -is seen to be particularly important when we consider the present disturbed condition of the world, and the effect of had living conditions in breeding discontent among the people. Living conditions are far from good for many people in Australia to-day, particularly for newlymarried couples and young mothers who are compelled to live with parents in houses that were designed to accommodate one family only. In common with other honourable members, I have received many letters from constituents which describe the difficulties encountered by those who are seeking to ibtain homes. from a letter written by Mr Frederick M. Lewisham, who is almost completely blind. Four years ago, he obtained a permit from the Department of War Organization of Industry to build a .house. A government advance was obtained, and documents were signed by ,a builder and himself. Later, when the .builder could not fulfil his obligations, difficulties arose. Mr Gray states in his letterWc have spent j'ears trying to get a house in Sydney and pounds on mug promises and -interviews and still although owning this ground for four years, wo still have no house. .We have a heap of correspondence from politicians and Housing Commission officers.. . . . Moreton, Secretary of the Housing Commission sent us a wire offering us temporary accommodation at Hargreaves Park which although 1 was struck instantly blind some time early last year and had been in a lot of pain during last year and still suffer a fair lot, the so-called emergency accommodation supplied by the commission turned out to be a converted morgue foT which we were charged 15a. .per week. My wife was disgusted and we had to.leave it and are now in one room here at Lewisham which the Sun procured for us with two deaf and dumb folk. I have received numerous letters from young married people living with their "" in-laws "". Tie discontent and domestic strife which arises from such situations is shattering many marriages. I propose later to cite figures which prove that housing conditions in New South Wale9, and, indeed, throughout Australia generally, have improved very little. One wonders whether the immense amounts of money which have been made available for housing are being used to the best advantage. Because essential commodities are scarce, a great many houses remain in an unfinished state. That freezes the materials which have been used basically in the construction of the framework of homes. The commission has failed to make available the essential requirements for completing homes once the building* have been commenced. Another factor is the inability of salary and wage earners to keep pace with the unending increases of the cost of living. We must take thosefacts into consideration when we are making plans to house the people. The Minister said, in his second-reading I propose to quote speechThe main aim of the agreement is the pro Gray. of 60 Victoria-street, vision of good standard housing for the lower income groups. If that objective can be achieved, members of the Opposition will not be at variance with the Minister, because the policy which he has enunciated goes to the crux of the housing situation. The success or'failure of the Government to provide homes for that section of the community forms the basis of my criti cisin to-day. An examination of facts and figures shows the utter failure of the Government to house those people Although hostilities ceased more than three years ago, housing remains the major unsolved problem, and disillusioned home-seekers are bitterly critical of the Government's unfulfilled promises to provide them with dwellings. Soaring building costs prevent persons on the lower ranges of income from building their own homes, and, therefore, they must look to the Government for assistance to obtain homes. Becords relating to the progress of housing, which arr always conservative, show the extraordinary increase of the price per square for standard homes. The Government has accepted the responsibility to provide homes for the people in the lower income groups, it has made large sums of money available to the States, and it has endeavoured to obtain priorities for its building projects. However, the net result of all that effort has been complete failure to achieve the building target which the Government set itself after the war. It has failed lamentably and miserably not only to provide sufficient homes but also to train sufficient skilled labour through the Commonwealth reconstruction training scheme. Home-building was a wartime casualty, and should be rehabilitated. The magnitude of the Government's failure is revealed in figures. In 1944, the Commonwealth Housing Commission fixed a target of 50,000 homes in the first post-war year, rising to 80,000 homes in the third year. The setting of that target followed a fact-finding inquiry which assessed the housing shortage throughout 300,000 homes. recommended the construction of an additional 4j0,000 homes a year after 1945 in order to meet the normal requirements. or failure of the Government's venture by the results that had been achieved. In 1945-46, when the target was 50,000 dwellings, only 15,376 homes were completed. In the next year, 32,607 homes were built. In 1947-48, the number was 42,867. and by whom, those 42,867 houses were constructed. The Government may seek to take the credit for the building of those homes, but when we analyse the figures showing the number built by private enterprise and the number built hy government instrumentalities, respectively, the true story is revealed. The rate of construction is sufficient to meet only normal requirements. The lag of 300,000 homes is net being overtaken. In other words, the Government's scheme has not made any impact upon the major problem. That is not the whole story. Official statistics, manent feature of the Australian economy, a for reasons which may be known to th Government, no longer show the number? of homes built by private enterprise and the number built by government instrumentalities. Only the tota! number of houses constructed h shown. That fact is significant. Unles an honourable member is prepared to dig deeply beneath the surface, he is unabhto ascertain the number of homes which are being built by government instru mentalities. I have succeeded in diggint a little below the surface, and I should like to know why the details of construction are no longer shown. Is it because the Government is ashamed to reveal itfailure to build homes compared with the achievements of private enterprise? Does not the Government desire to disclose the increasing number of home? which are being privately built? Doesit wish to conceal the lag in home building on the part of its own instrumentalities? I should like to know the reason. From July, 1945, to September, 1947, 70 per cent, of the homesthe Commonwealth at commenced by private enterprise were The commission also completed, but government instrumentalities completed only 55 per cent, of the homes which they commenced. The Minister, in his second-reading speech We can judge the success said that between April, 1944, and June. 1948, 15,271 dwellings had been completed under the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement. The Commonwealth Statistician has disclosed that 42,867 new houses were completed in 1947-48. Of that number, 6,370 were built by government instrumentalities and about 36,500 by private builders. That means that, in spite of steadily advancing building costs, six times more homes are being built by private builder? than are being built by government instrumentalities, notwithstanding the priority in building materials taken hy the Government, and the making available of huge amounts of money to the States to carry out their building projects. Professor Copland, a former economic adviser of the Government and the former Priees Commissioner, recently wrote a pamphlet called Bach to Earth in Economics. He bluntly stated At tlie present rate of housing construction the housing.crisis will hecome almost a per-",19,Second Reading

We still have no stock-pile. tion has been reached. The explanation of this is again partly shortage of basic materials more than low output per man in building conduction. But the high and rising costs of construction act as a powerful deterrent to enteri n reply the Minister for Works and prise in the building industry. by the fact that the Government took his advice on economics. must take responsibility for any advice it accepts. If it accepts wrong advice it is obviously culpable. Professor Copland may have been the economic adviser, but he was not its adviser on housing. He has pointed out its ineptitude and smug complacency. The truth of his statements is aptly illustrated by statistics w h i c h ' show that 1.7,100 buildings were erected in New South Walesi n 1939 and only 16,825 in the year ended the 30th June, 1948. So instead of going forward we are falling back w it h the housing programme. The lack of houses w ill remain as a continuing crisis unless the Government is willing to tackle the problem strongly and w i th common sense. The failure to build more homes cau be attributed basically to the failure of the Government to ensure sufficient output of essentials for the production and transport of building materials. been drumming that fact into the minds of members of the Government ever since the war ended. Nothing can be said about it now that is not already trite. But however trite the statement may be, it must be repeated that every ton of coal lost affects the production of some essential for housing. Let us consider three of these essentials-bricks , tiles and steel. I do not propose to say anything ahout galvanized iron at the moment because I cannot even think of galvanized iron and remain calm. The production of bricks is 20per cent, less than it was in 1938-39, the year that preceded the war. That is an indictment of the Government. I i is useless for it to t r y to defend itself by saying that it cannot reach its target its responsibility. Three years ago we emphasized the primary need for the production of a stock-pile of buildingThe output of terra-cotta tiles for the seven months of 1947-48 was only slightly higher than that of 1938-39. I know that Housing( Mr Lemmon) w ill say something like this: "" A t least we are doing something about housing, but what d i d you do? No t h in g ! "" Doubtless that w ill The Government be his opening gambit, but the present production of essentials like bricks and tiles does not approach the production in 1938-39. Then, Government's the output of steel is less than 100,000 tons monthly compared with 97,500 tons in 1938-39, which means that the production of such an essential f o i home building is only comparable with that of 1938-39. The restriction of the output of coal by the Communist-controlled miners' federation is becoming a part of our national production set-up. Industries, including those producing building materials, have to adjust themselves to these set-backs. Production difficulties w ill not be solved by the Government's waiting u n t i l the miners are out on a limb, and then using brave words and threats, well knowing that it w ill not be called to back them up with action. Surely, the Government realizes that the acceptance of coal production We have hold-ups in industry as a regular occurrence is bringing into heing a psychology that is reflected in lowered output generally. The success of the Government's housing scheme depends on production. The Prime Minister has belatedly recognized this, although we have been hammering it into his mind for years. He showed his recognition of it last month in an address to a conference of trade unions in the Sydney TradesH a l l convened by his Government in the hope of persuading the workers to increase production. The conference was",21,Second Reading
45,Mr Rankin,Perhaps that is caused,22,Second Reading
46,Mr Harrison,"attended by 140 delegates of 64 federal trade unions. In tbe issue of the Sydney Daily Telegraph of the 6th November, the right honourable gentleman is reported to have .said at that conferenceI think it is a disgrace to the trade union movement that, when tliere are differences between unions, they cannot findsome way to settle the disputes without depriving the community ofthings it should have. 1 am not always, able to see tlie reason that they drive men to strike. The newspaper article continuedMr Ohifley said it would be a long time before people could get. many of the. things they wanted.. The great need, for houses, public works, ulectric light undertakings, schools, and other modern amenities could not be met, no matter how much money was available. . Mr Chifley addedWhat is short to-day is notmoney, bub willing hands. Those strong words were wrung from the Prime Minister in extremis after he had at; last realized that increased production, w-as essential for this nation's welfare. Xo soonerhad those wordsbeen uttered by the right' honourable gentleman than the Postmaster-General (Senator Cameron) came into' the arena. In an article publisbed over his> name in the Australian Worker, the official organ of the Australian ""Workers Union, on the 3rd November, Senator Cameron said^and I . ask the House and the country to note that this was not a chance observation, but aconsidered statement prepared for publicationI f , as tire result ofworkers increasing tlie productivity' of the soil and increasing the productionofmaterials and. commodities of all kinds, tlie wealthy continue to be made wealthier and more powerful economically and politically, and the expenditure on preparations for war in times of peace continues to be increased and military conscription or slavery to be extended, workers have nothing to gain and everything beyond' what would be necessary to maintain themselves and their families ing strike action,, however, by workers nowadays in most countries in the world would indicate that the dangers of producing surpluses is being realized' by thom where the necessary provision is not being made to raise their standards of living and to provide for co-operative and peaceful trading among, the nations. if any, illusions about the matter. Mr Harrison. I ask the House and the' country to note the class hatred expressed by the Minister in that statement. Here, once again, this Minister-as if quite customary with. Ministers in this-. Government-expressed , a personal view., and in expressing that view he sabotaged completely the Prime Minister's appeai for greater production. He sabotaged., not only the housing programme, but also the industrial effort of Australia. Ministers of' the Labour Government, the so called leadersof the Australian Labour party, set both the timeand tempo for production in industry. On the one hand the Prime Minister appealed for increased production, because of the. great housing shortage and the need for building up the economy of this country,. whilst on the other hand one of his Ministers said to the workers, in effect, "" It is all right, boys, this appeal for increased productionis a fallacy and a. myth. The more you produce the worse it will be for you' . : This is a sort of: fillip for the miners. Even while he was addressing the coalminers, the Prime Minister knew full well that somewhere the completion of houses was being held up, and the families of workers were being deprived of the ordinary amenities and comfort.' of civilization.. A great deal has. been said about, the Australian Government's failure to train ex-servicemen under the Commonwealth reconstruction training scheme so that additional skilled, labour will be available for thebuilding, trade. Thif is one of the factors which has conr tributed to the collapse of the government housingscheme. Honourable mem; bersand the people of this country are aware of the plan that the Government evolved to train ex-servicemen who had no opportunity of training prior to the war, so that they could take up useful occupations. It was decided to open the to lose by increasing production building industry to those men. As I have previously pointed, out, in July, 1939 . . . Increas150,900 persons were engaged in the buildingindustry. In 1948, 168,000 persons were so engaged'-a n increase of only 11 per cent. In the Commonwealtb Public .Service the increase in the same period was 101,400 employees, or more COal-nvincrs, for example, have few. than 150 percent. The total number of persons employed in the servicenow if 169,200. Whilst we could do without this galaxy of public servants in over inflated government departments, we cannot do without homes for the people. Although the Government has encouraged an increase in departmental staffs under its own control by no less than 150 per cent, compared with pre-war figures, it has encouraged the training of ex-servicemen and. other mechanics in industry has only increased in. the same period to a degree that has increased the total number of employees by only 11 per cent. The reason for that is the refusal of the Communist-controlled Building Workers' In dustrial Union to permit these men to be trained. against the construction of houses and otherunits essential to the national economy. bowed to the wishes of that union, with the result that the building trades have not gained much skilled labour. The Government's failure to train ex-servicemen for the building trades was publicly criticized by the president of the New South Wales branch of the Returned Sailors-, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, Mr Ken Bolton, in the November issue of Reveille, the official organ of the league. In an article headed "" Commonwealth Muddle!-Who is Right?' Mr Dedman and Mr Bolton can't Agree"", the views of both the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) and the State president of the league are stated. With regard, to tbe position in New South Wales, Mr Bolton saidIn 1939 there were 47,010 men in the building industry, while in 1948 there are only 38,710; this at a time when ex-servicemen are screaming for homes. The Building Workers'' Industrial TJnion and the Plumbers' Union, whose representatives sit on the Industrial Committees which govern the intake of trainees, have said, "" No more trainees', using as their excuse, that there are insufficient building materials available. Mr census, in 271 instances five or monDedman endorses, t i is opinion, or should I say excuse. The answer to that one is that for the month of May, 1048, Commonwealth Employment Bureau figures indicate that 1,371 unfilled applications were received from private employers for building tradesmen. In other words, 1,371 employers already have sufficient materials to carry out 1,371 building operations. In addition, employers spend hundreds of pounds in advertising for tradesmen. Pick up a copy of the Sydney Morning Herald aud just count up the num ber of people who want carpenters and plumbers. Now! Would they advertise, i ' they did not have materials? The Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holloway) said repeatedly during the debate on the Estimates thai the basic reason why these men were not being trained was the shortage of materials. If there are 1,371 vacancies in New South Wales for building tradesmen, it is reasonable to assume that thenis suflicient material available to provide 1,371 men with work: Mr Bolton went on to sayYes, there's 3,045 still waiting to be trained . The Communist policy is they are made up of carpentry 2,052, brick laying 064, plumbing 163, and plastering 166 These are authentic figures taken from tht> official minutes of the New Sonth WaleiThe Government has Reconstruction Training Committee, held on the 7th October, 1948. Mr Dedman can'; explain this lot away. There is a demand for skilled men, yet men are awaiting training. The greatest blight upon our young people is that they must share houses with others. Janet Kalven, in a hook entitled, The Task of Women in thu Modern World, referred to the home. If I had to preach a sermon, I should use a passage from that book as my text. I L the light of the figures that I propose to Reconstruction Training quote, I urge the Minister to take not' of it.. Janet Kalven wroteThe home is at once an economic and indii: trial centre preparing goods for family use; a schoo] in which the young are introduced tithe universe; a sanctuary of rest and relaxa tion; a temple dedicated to the praise of God That refers to the home and not to the house; There is ' a great difference between the two. The people of Australia want, homes., The census of June, 1947. showed that, at that time, 116,828 famih groups were sharing houses. The average Australian house has two, or at the most three, bedrooms, one bathroom and one lavatory. According to that families were sharing a single house Can one imagine anything more destructive to the morale of those families? The shortage of houses is the major problem that confronts us to-day. The census showed, further, that four families wertoccupying each of 818 houses, thretfamilies, each of 4,446 houses, and two families each of 25,002 houses. Mr Frjr.LKK -Peopl e were living in tents when the Opposition parties were in power. member for Hume( Mr Fuller) has just that it does not want to encourage home entered the 'chamber. I anticipated that ownership because it will create, to adopt interjection by pointing out that more the phrase that was used by the Minister bricks, tiles and steel were being profor luced, and more houses built in 1938-39 Dedman), "" little capitalists "". The best than at the present time. In 1944, the sheet-anchor that this country can posCommonwealth Housing Commission sibly have is the home owner. Every assessed the Australian housing shortage man who marries aspires to own his own at 300,000 homes. It declared that home. Fourthly, the Government should -"">0,000 homes should be built in the first aim post-war year, and that the number and giving greater encouragement toshould be increased to 80,000 in the third workers, including incentive payments post-war year.

Indeed, only 42,000 houses building have heen built. Of that number, apnumbers of young men may enter proximately 6,000 were constructed by the industry. Lastly, the Government rhe Commonwealth Housing Commission should proceed with the demolition of nnd the rest by private enterprise. I slums and the provision at reasonable suggest to the Minister, as I have done cost of good houses which can be purbefore, that there is only one way in chased on suitable terms. which to implement an effective housing policy.

52,Mr Thompson (Hindmarsh) [3.58].,"me that when the State Premiers met the Prime Minister to discuss the transference of powers from the States to the Commonwealth and housing was mentioned, every State Premier insisted responsibility of the States. That was the first fact brought to my notice by the Premier of South Australia following my appointment to the commission. After examining the terms of reference the commission ascertained that, so far as the Commonwealth was concerned, it could only inform the Australian Government about the.housing position in Australia and furnish advice upon the nnanciai aspects of the home-building schemes submitted by the States. That is still the position. The purpose of the bill now before us is to authorize the raising of a loan of £14,000,000 to finance activities under the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement. That agreement was the outcome of recommendations made by the commission. After examining its terms of reference the commission realized that it had no authority to construct houses and that its function was limited to bringhomes and homes for its own officers, ing pressure to bear on the States to meet the housing position and to raise the standards of housing generally. If honourable members will refer to the report of the Commonwealth Housing Commission they will see that it amply bears out what I have said. The sole responsibility of the Commonwealth under the scheme is to provide the requihousing position which exists in Australia site finance and to lay down housing standards and conditions under which advances may be made to the States to finance the construction of homes. The Acting Leader of the Opposition has said that the Commonwealth is opposed to private home ownership. not tained that the basic wage earner was not in a position to finance the purchase of his own home, and accordmoney from the Commonwealth for the ingly it recommended that the State housing authorities should institute group building schemes to provide houses for low-wage earners at a reasonable rental. The commission also laid down conditions relating to the sale of homes to home purchasers. The Commonwealth is not able to build a home for the ordinary member of the community. Its activities in this field are confined to the building of homes in the Australian Capital Territory, war-service homes for ex-service personnel and for certain of ib that it should be the officers in Commonwealth employment. The Acting Leader of the Opposition referred to letters he had received from people seeking to purchase their own homes. I receive letters every week from such people. About a fortnight ago a man whom I know well wrote to me asking what the Australian Government could do to enable his married son to obtain a home. In reply I informed him that if his son was an ex-serviceman he could obtain a war-service home, or he could secure an advance from the Commonwealth Bank to finance the building of a home, but that apart from those two courses the Australian Government had no power to help him. The Acting Leader of the Opposition has charged the Government with having fallen down on the job of providing homes for the people. The honourable gentleman knows very well that, apart from war-service the Commonwealth has no responsibility or authority. He is well aware that responsibility for housing the people rests solely upon the States and that the States refused to hand thai responsibility to the Commonwealth. He was most unfair in attempting to blame the Australian Government for the acute to-day. The honourable gentleman quoted certain figures relating to the number of homes constructed. Those figures refer only to the States which are working under the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement. South Australia, That is which, in common with other States, so. The commission ascersuffers from an acute housing position, is not working under that agreement. That State government has not received any building of homes. It is financing and undertaking its own home-building programmes. It is co-operating with the Commonwealth, however, in adopting the standards laid down by the Commonwealth in the agreement. The Acting Leader of the Opposition referred to the decline in the production of bricks and tiles since 1938-39 and .said that he was afraid to refer to the -galvanized .iron position. .members who know anything about the building industry are well aware that in 1938-39 tile production was limited almost entirely to terra cotta tiles. [Quorum formed.] every suburb of every city are to be found factories engaged in the production of cement tiles. The volume of cement tile production to-day is very great. The monthly average production of bricks in 1938-39 was 60,000,000. In June of this year the production was 5.2,100,000, and in July, 50,100,000. I am sure that when the Acting Leader of the Opposition made his criticism of the brick making industry, he did not realize that his ""but the figures do not indicate the true argument was likely to rebound on him. Any one who knows anything about brickmaking is well aware that there were very few up-to-date brickmaking plants in Australia in 193S-39. Brickmakers had to go down into the muck and slush, dig out clay and after forming and firing the bricks, manually handle them. Brickmaking was one of the heaviest and dirtiest of jobs. Many brickmakers enlisted during the war years and after their, discharge from the armed forces, sought more congenial employment. They would not return to the mush and slush of the pug holes. That is why brick production has declined. Brickmakers are not prepared to install modern machinery in their works. A few months ago the South Australian Government brought out a number of migrants to work in the brickyards. It .agreed to provide homes for them on their arrival. ""When the migrants arrived here they were established in newlyfinished Housing Trust homes. diately complaints were made by other people that the newcomers had been given homes while they themselves had been waiting for five or six years for a home without obtaining one. When I spoke to the State authorities about the matter [ was informed that as the migrants had come to Australia to make bricks for the building of homes they had been given priority in the allotment of homes. After working two or three weeks in the brickyards and experiencing the conditions of employment there the migrants Mr Thompson. said, "" We did not'think that we would be asked to make bricks under these conHonorahle ditions. We made bricks in England under very much better conditions. We shall seek other employment"". They left -their jobs and engaged in other .work, but they stayed in To-day in almost their homes. They could not be evicted. The Acting Leader of the 'Opposition blamed the Government for not bringing about more production, but I remind him that he is the representative of the employers, including the manufacturers ol bricks, so that he must -accept some of the responsibility for the 'present position. The honourable member cited figures in connection with the production of tiles, position. It may be that they refer only to terra-cotta tiles, and not to cement tiles, also. In 1938-39, the average monthly production of hoth terra-cotta and concrete tiles was 3,680,000, whereas production in June of this year was '6,040,000.

The Acting Leader of the Opposition said that he could not obtain information about the activities of housing authorities. I have here a statement issued by Mr L. P. D. O'Connor, deputy director of the Housing Division of the Department of Works and Housing, at the direction of Mr Welch, the Director of Housing.

The commission estimated that there was a shortage of 300,000 houses. As the Acting Leader of the Opposition correctly stated, 40,000 new houses are needed every year to provide fbr increased population and to replace old buildings. The commission allowed for this, and estimated that the shortage would be made good in ten years' time if the programme could be adhered to. No provision was made in the estimate for the housing of immigrants, because the commission had no way of estimating the number that would be entering, the. country, but it pointed out that one dwelling, unit would be needed for every four immigrants. Until the making of the. present agreement with the States, the responsibility for building houses rested, entirely upon State authorities and private enterprise.

In our speeches in this House we should endeavour to convince the workers that we believe that they should get a fair deal in employment, and that we shall -lo everything in our power to ensure that they enjoy an adequate standard of living.

A few words of encouragement will often accomplish more than threats.

But we shall not encourage developed, them to work harder by throwing stones at them and upbraiding them. I admit that members of the Opposition are just as honest as I am in endeavouring to get the best conditions for the Australian people. The Acting Leader of the OppoWhilst that position is sition has referred to deplorable housing conditions, and has cited instances of as many as five families sharing a house. I know only too well that people are living under impossible conditions, on verandahs, and even in disused stables, because they are unable to obtain better accommodation. Doubtless, the Acting Leader of the Opposition is as anxious as I am to remove those unfortunate conditions, but the remedy does not. lie in blaming the Government for all States except one had Labour governments, and non-Labour parties have endeavoured to make a good deal of political capital out of the fact that State Labour governments at that time did not embark on. housing programmes. To-day. however, non-Labour governments are in oflice in three of the States, and,' if they fail to use the money which is available for housing, they must accept the responsibility. During the eighteen months I Housing Commission I devoted 70 or SO hours a week to an examination of housing problems, and, in doing so, I accumulated a good deal of information which I should like to give to the House. However, I do not consider that it will be necessary for me to do so. I urge honourable members not to make the debate on this bill an opportunity tc attack the Government, or to blame it for the failure to meel the housing target which the Commonwealth Housing Commission set three .years ago.

56,Mr Fadden (Darling Downs,"Leade respecially the Lahour Government of New South Wales to make extravagant promises forecasting an early end to the housing shortage. Ex-servicemen and others living in make-shift dwellings or tTying to make do in furnished rooms or with their relatives were told during the last State general election that 30,000 dwellings a year would he completed in .Yew South Wales alone. In the middle of 1946, a Brisbane woman and her nine young children were found living in a tent. She said that although the Housing Commission had cold her she would be given a house in two or three weeks, on making inquiries she had found that she had been excluded from the housing project concerned. At Rockdale, a few miles from Brisbane, a family of six was found living in a disused fowl-house which measured 20 feet by 14 feet. The ages of the children, of whom there were four, ranged from thirteen years to nine months. The Housing Commission when contacted indicated that the family was on the waiting list for temporary housing. It will be recalled that for 1945-46 the target was 24,000 homes throughout Australia. However, the results for the first half of the year were not very heartening, for only .192 houses were completed by the Government's administrative efforts in Queensland and the total for the whole of Australia, was a mere 1,791. TJnder these conditions, is it any wonder that the Commonwealth passed the whole responsibility for housing on to the State government? The States themselves were quick to see that they would have to use private enterprise on a large scale in an endeavour to overcome the leeway for which the Australian apathy was largely responsible. Although some of the shortage has been caught up, the position is still far from satisfactory. Houses are needed in every city and town and, indeed, in every hamlet in Australia. Much of the blame for this is due to the Australian Government which has shown incredible apathy and complacency in dealing with Communistinspired dislocations and disruptions in the industries that supply the commodities sheltering of the people of Australia. Mr Fadden. Many military and air force establishments which had served their purpose by the end of 1945 were converted into temporary housing accommodation. Some -of them in Queensland and in other States although in many cases occupied only as temporary dwellings, -have been in use' for almost three years and are still in use. Some at Victoria Park, Brisbane and elsewhere have been the scenes of violent crimes. Such happenings have been to no small degree attributable to the conditions under which the tenants have had to live. A few days ago, a Sydney stipendiary magistrate described one of the New South Wales temporary housing settlements as "" a den of iniquity and a centre of vice and crime because of the congestion there"". More than 5,000 people are accommodated in about 200 army huts each of which is divided into ahout four flats. Most people living under those conditions are decent and cannot get desirable accommodation elsewhere. But, undoubtedly, some undesirable people * congregate in temporary housing settlements. The obvious solution is to step up production of hricks, timber, galvanized iron, builders' hardware, and other materials essential for the building of more houses. People should not be compelled to live under such conditions for two and even three years before they and their young families can hope to get a home of their own. Even when people obtain possession of a home under the various State housing projects anomalies remain to be rectified. In a recent debate in this House, 3 proved that every shilling rise of the basic wage gave -the Eederal Treasurer at Government's least £1,000,000 more in extra tax. The story does not end there. TJnder the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement, certain rentals are subsidized by the Commonwealth Government. Shortly, the Commonwealth has accepted responsibility for making up the equivalent of the economic rent of the dwelling based on the basic ""wage. With every increase of the hasic wage under the formula, the tenant has to pay more rent and more tax and so the Commonwealth is relieved requisite for the effective of a part of its responsibility in subsidization of such rentals. The catch is that such increases of the basic wage are intended to cover merely the rise in the cost of living, and if .the individual .conwhether houses could be built without cerned has to pay extra tax and extra rent from .such increases obviously :his standards of .living are lo.wer and his family has to do without food and clothing which such. increases were given to provide. With the withdrawal of millions of .pounds in subsidy on staple foods such as milk and potatoes, the .basic wage was bound to rise. The higher prices of these commodities is a .direct result .of ments policy .in removing subsidies from them. Tie subsidies paid by the Commonwealth kept the price of commodities down. It would have been sensible to keep them in operation, but, so great was the Government's chagrin at the defeat of the recent referendum, that it took a different stand. As the States were to take over the control of prices and rents, it said, "" That .being so, there will he no subsidies "". --Order! I hope the right honourable gentleman will connect his arguments about subsidies with housing. provides for the subsidization of rents, so the matter of subsidies'.is wrapped up with the subject before .us. Anyway, .1 have made my -point. In the same way, the cost of housing, building materials, and a thousand and one other commodities has increased greatly as a direct result of Labour policy in instituting the 40-hour week at a time when production should have been increased. federal indirect taxes, such a3 pay-roll tax and sales tax on many commodities, including an estimated 5 per cent, of building materials, has also largely contributed to the rise of the prices of houses, furnishings, wireless sets, food and other essentials. Leader Harrison), in his speech, said that certain building materials were still subject to sales tax, and he was contradicted by members of the Government, who said that that was not true. In fact, his statecapitalists "" are not created. ment was true. Many commodities used a9 building materials are still subject to sales tax. Nails, for instance, are taxable. Mr ''FADDEN -Yes, and I doubt them. 'Nuts and bolts, door handles brackets, coat hooks, bathroom fittings and hinges are all subject to sales tax. Structural steel is also subject to the tax, and it is used extensively in the erection of modern buildings. The cost of building a home is so high that it is beyond the financial capacity of the average man to build one. Only the rich can afford to the Australian Governdo so. Others must obtain financial assistance from the Government or building societies. I am armed with the latest figures reflecting the increase of the cost of home-building in Australia. They are as follows:Cost per-HouBe. 1930. . 1948. £ £ 3-bedroom brick 1,062 2,250 2-bedroom brick 945 1,942 3-bedroom fibro 696 1,687 2-be'drooin fibro 600 1,400 Surely such homes are the minimum requirement of a young man and his -family!

As many millions of .pounds of Commonwealth public funds are involved each year, and as the Commonwealth Audit Act may be extensively amended by a bill which is at present on the notice-paper, I should like to see provision made for a closer scrutiny of .State accounts by the officers of the Commonwealth Auditor-General's Department. possibly, and probably, insufficient scrutiny, or insufficient vigilance in connection with the expenditure of these large sums, amounting to .millions of pounds.. I should like to see a tightening up of supervision and I ask that some definite assurance be given in that regard. Eood, clothing and shelter are the three fundamental human essentials. It is evidently the policy of the Australian Labour, party, by any test that may be applied, or from whatever angle the searchlight of investigation is directed, to make each person in Australia less and less self-reliant in respect of those three factors. The implementation of that policy does not go unnoticed by discerning people. The Government realizes that, in order to be consistent with its socialization policy, it must make people more dependent upon it, and, consequently, more subservient to the policy of the Australian party with relation to socialization. Consistent with that policy, we find a continuation of the system of building permits, and of .control in respect of buildGovernment entirely for the shortages ing materials. To-day, it is almost impossible for an individual to build a home on his own initiative. In any case, as 1 have said before, it is only the very rich people who can afford to acquire their own homes. Even after the average person has obtained a permit and arranged for the necessary materials, it is necessary for him to obtain financial assistance, usually through some government instrumentality, in order to put the work in hand. The present state of housing throughout Australia is not such as can result in credit or satisfaction to the Government. Rather has it been responMr Fadden. by the sible for much annoyance and disgust to the people of Australia generally. before the House seeks to authorize the raising of moneys to be advanced to the States for the purposes of housing. It is generally agreed that one of the greatest problems facing this country to-day is housing. The magnitude of this task was realized by this Government during the war. Following the end of the war, the necessity to institute national control over the building of I consider that there is liomes in order to relieve the acute shortage of accommodation became apparent. This problem has not only just arisen. Our situation is somewhat different from that of other countries that were sadly bombed in the war years, and where destruction of great magnitude took place. In this country our housing problem has arisen as an aftermath of the depression and war years, when building cf homes practically ceased. The difficulty has been aggravated by the great increase in national prosperity in this country since the waT. To-day many young couples are well able to pay the rent of a dwelling, should one be available for them. The problem that confronted the Government in pre-war years was altogether different. In those days many young married couples, because of lack of employment, were forced to live with their "" in-laws "". They did not have the money to pay the rent of a house or dwelling. Consequently, the deLabour mand for homes in pre-war years, when all the materials and labour necessary for building were available, was not as great as it is to-day. It is idle to blame this that now exist in this regard. If my memory serves me rightly, when the matter of placing this industry under national control was referred to the people of this country by referendum, the fiercest opposition to the proposal was encountered from the Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Harrison) ahd the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden). At that time those honourable gentlemen said that this was a problem for the States to handle; that it was socialization, and that this Government should mind its own business. Those facts should be borne well in",32,Houses Completed April 1944 To June 1948
61,Mr Daly (Martin) [5.5],"The billmind by Opposition members wben they uow criticize this Government's efforts to assist with the provision of homes. I point out to the members of the Opposition that in times of peace this National Parliament has no constitu* tional authority to build homes for the people of this country on its own initiative. The Constitution limits our activities in respect of housing to the construcdeals in that regard. I exclude from my tion of war service homes, homes for munitions workers in times of war and homes for certain of its own officers. Therefore it is idle to blame this Government for the general shortage of houses. Much criticism has been levelled nt tbe Government by the Leader of the Australian Country party about housing conditions in the various States. I agree that it is a national tragedy that people have to live in temporary housing settlements, and that we are not in a position ro provide homes for all of the people who need them. It must be remembered, however, that the State governments, particuare the members of the Opposition in this larly those in the more populous States -uch as New South ""Wales, have done a valuable job in making emergency accommodation available to many thousands of (-eople. During the recent rents and prices eferendum campaign, members of this Government guaranteed to the people of this country continuity of occupation of their homes if the referendum were successful, and the members of the Opposition stoutly asserted that the defeat of that referendum would not in any way affect them in that regard. What do we find to-day? The New South Wales Government is sorely pressed to provide emergency accommodation for people who are awaiting the construction fif homes by private enterprise or by government instrumentalities. Yet, when that Government endeavoured to pass ihrough South Wales an act to deal with Mack-marketing in houses, to prevent evictions, and to give some measure of security to the people in the occupation Upper House, an unelective body, which is controlled by the same parties that sit in opposition in this Parliament, rejected the measure. Its passage would have relieved considerably the demand for emergency accommodation in that State. It would have overcome the all-too-prevalent practice of people in the metropolitan area of Sydney, and in other parts of the State, being evicted by people who had bought the homes at black-market prices, over the heads of people who were occupying them. There have been many unscrupulous remarks people who had genuine reasons for desiring to occupy their homes. Despite that, the Opposition continues to criticize this Government. I say to the people of my constituency and to other people in the metropolitan area of Sydney, who, this week, and in the weeks ahead, may find themselves on the streets, with no other accommodation available, that they can attribute their position to the defeat of the referendum. It is for that reason that they have to face the gloomy and unfortunate prospect of having no dwelling at all. The people responsible Parliament, and in the State Parliament of New South Wales. I am happy to say that about April next the Australian Labour party will probably control the upper house in New South Wales. The people will then be able to look forward to the enactment of very progressive legislation which was rejected by the Liberal party. I realize that my remarks are not very comforting to the people who face the very serious prospect of eviction. I suggest to the people living in the metropolitan area of 'Sydney, who are to be evicted, that they should approach the Liberal members in the State Parliament and ask what action they intend to take to prevent them being the Parliament of New thrown on to the street. Efforts should be made to keep those people in their homes. I was amazed to find the Leader of the Australian Country party speaking of price control in relation of their homes, the to housing.

Whenever a bill is introduced in this attitude for a member of the Opposition to adopt, but it seems to me to be the only practical one. In relation to this bill, there was one passage in the Minister's second-reading speech that caused me some satisfaction. I was about to say it caused rne considerable satisfaction, but that would hardly be a correct statement, because my satisfaction is limited by the Minister's words. At the end of his speech, the honourable gentleman, saidAlthough the agreement is primarily intended to make provision for rental housing, it the houses may be sold subject to certain is also provided iu thc agreement that the houses may he sold subject to certain conditions, and negotiations wit h the States to settle the administrative procedure in this con nexion are now iu train. That shows that at least there is a realization of the need for some provision for the purchase of houses to be included in the Hoinmonwealth and State Housing Agreement. We are told that the administrative machinery is about to be established. When the agreement was first discussed in this House, it was pointed out that any housing scheme that did not provide for the possibility of ownership was not a good one. I believe, -is all honourable members on this side of Ihe House believe, that in the ownership of tlieir honies by the people lies the greatest possible security for the future welfare of this country. A person's own home is a much dearer place to him than is a house that he rents. There is something in the knowledge that a man's home is a place from which he cannot be turned out which gives him confidence to face the world, and which provides his family with the background of security and stability which is necessary to produce good citizens. government housing schemes to-day thc emphasis is on houses to rent, or, in other words, on ownership by governments. In my vicw, the more home ownership is in government hands the less likely we are to achieve that freedom and splendour of citizenship that makes a free and splendid people. A great point of difference between the Opposition and the Oovernment is that we believe in the diffusion of ownership throughout the community, whereas honourable gentlemen opposite believe in. the concentration of ownership in government hands. Dame Enid I/i/ovs. 17,000 houses is for sale. Dame ENID LYONS -They have not hitherto been offered for sale. In his second-reading speech, the Minister saidThe agreement is primarily intended tomnku provision for rental housing. If the houses are for sale, why did the houorable gentleman make that statement? The honourable gentleman alsosaidI t is also provided in the agreement that conditions. When the Minister is replying to thisdebate, I invite him to state the terms and conditions under which private ownership may be achieved. I ask him to furnish to honourable members full details regarding the price and the terms under which the houses are to be made available. The provision in the agreement enabling thehomes to be purchased gives me somehope. I sincerely trust that that principle will be extended and that in laterschemes greater facilities will be provided for people who desire to possess their homes.

Dame ENID LYONS -That iu noway sets aside anything that I have said, nor does it set aside my view that theNevertheless, in most success of all housing schemes lies in concentration on ownership rather than-, on rental. If the Minister contends that all hone-ranle members on the Government side of the House believe in private ownership, all I can say is that their published utterances tend to belie his belief. Not long ago a man whose name I believe is Bulmer, who is the secretary of the Building Workers Industrial TJnion in New South Wales, made a statement to the effect that he was opposed to theownership of homes because the ownership of a home tended to rob a worker of""",35,Houses Completed April 1944 To June 1948

For that reason, I applaud the words in the Minister's speech which I quoted as they give us hope for the future, that imder these government housing schemes some people will be able to purchase their own homes.

Such a belief is entirely wrong. The agreement which now operates is exactly the same as the agreement made in 1945. TJnderi t , provision has been made for sales to tenants. Treasurer in writing? have to obtain the written consent of the Treasurer for sales below capital cost. Under the agreement, sales may he made to tenants only. The States are not permitted to sell houses to people who do not live in them and who desire to hecome landlords. Sales are restricted to people who Financef o r the purchase of such homes is provided either by the State finance authority, by co-operative building societies or by the Commonwealth Bank. In the case of ex-servicemen, finance is provided by the War Service Homes Commission. Where a tenant has been in. possession of his home for a specified period the total payment of that portion of his rent which is allowed for amortization is rebated to the tenant in reduction of the capital cost of the home. We have done everything (possible to enable tenants to become home-owners. On the 5th June, 1948, the Prime Minister wrote to the State Treasurers indicating his desire that they should proceed with the selling of the homes built under the scheme. Many of the States are now in thc process of effecting sales to tenants. The Leader of the Australian Country The honorparty ( Mr Fadden) complained of the continued imposition of sales tax on she endeavours to see the home-building materials and fittings. The Aoting Leader of the Opposition I remind ( Mr Harrison) referred to. the imposition of sale? tax on baths, sinks and builders' hardware. No sales tax is im posed on baths, sinks, bricks, timber, riles and coppers. Indeed, no sales tax i.s imposed on most of the materials, fitThe honourable tings and fixtures used in the construction of a home. It is true that sales tax is imposed on a few items, including nails, but their total cost would not represent more than .3 per cent, of the cost of a house. The sales tax of 10 per eent. on requirements that represent only .3 per cent, of the total cost of a home would amonnt to only a few pounds. Probably as many nails are used in box factories as in home construction. The sales tax is still imposed on bolts and nuts; but how many bolts and nuts are used in the construction of a house? No items which are now subjected to sales tax at the 10 per cent, rate are solely used in the construction of W o . The States homes.

71,Mr Spendek,With the consent of the,38,Houses Completed April 1944 To June 1948
72,Mr Lemmon,"the Opposition had a guilty conscience, for he said that honourable members on this side of the House would probably reply to his criticism by harking back to the past and contrasting what is now being done with what was done when the Opposition parties were in office. The Leader of the Australian Country party criticized the New South Wales Government, which he stated, undertook to build 30,000 homes a year. No promise was ever made by the Premier of New South Wales that the New South Wales Housing Commission would build 30,000 homes. He said that, as the result of the combined efforts of private and. governmental agencies, it was hoped to build 30,000 houses in New South Wales. He has succeeded in having 15,400 houses built. When the governments formed by the Opposition parties were in office, they did not build a single house, notwithstanding their promise to provide £20,000,000 for housing. The Premier of New South Wales fixed a target of 30.000 houses and, at least, succeeded in having more than half that number built. That is a better result than the sorry history of the promises made hy honourable members opposite. I propose now to deal with the increased cost of construction. denies that housmg costs have increased tremendously. During his second-reading speech, the Acting Leader of the Opposition said that he had received certain information from the Commonwealth Statistician in. regard to the cost of construction by private individuals and by governments, but that he had to go deeper in order to have those costs dissected so that he could ascertain the position. The honourable gentleman also claimed that the figures were presented by the Commonwealth Statistician in such a way as to hide the facts. In fact, a breakdown of the cost figures furnished by the Commonwealth Statistician was supplied to him by my department. has been made available to him and to honourable members generally. The figures are furnished to the press from time to time in monthly housing reports issued by my department. We have never denied that there has been a great increase of costs. The figures Mr Lemmon. published by my department every quarter show the rising trend very clearly. We admit frankly that since 1939 the cost of home building in Australia has increased by approximately 100 per cent. Australia, however, is not the only country in which home-building costs have risen steeply. According to information furnished to the Town Planning Conference, held at Zurich in June last, homebuilding costs in various countries have increased as follows:Per cen t. Great Britain 150 Sweden 100 France 1,500 Norway 100 United States of America 111 Some of those countries were not directly affected by the war. The Acting Leader of the Opposition complained about the Commonwealth entering the housing field although, as a matter of fact, the Commonwealth's part is confined to providing the money. He also complained about the activities of the State housing commissions, and said that all houses should be built by private enterprise. Nevertheless, on many occasions, those who are about to build factories ask that a housing settlement be established in the area under the Commonwealth and State No one Housing Agreement. The Acting Leader of the Opposition and his supporters cannot have it both ways. He also said that the delay in providing houses was caused by the scarcity of materials. He cited figures relating to some materials, but he did not mention that the production of certain other materials had increased by more than 200 per cent. He mentioned the production of ordinary burnt bricks, but he did not refer to the production of cement bricks and prefabricated canite, which are now being used in the construction of houses. He claimed that the production of tiles was lagging, but the figures he cited referred only to terra-cotta tiles. He omitted to mention that the production of terra-cotta The fullest information tiles and cement tiles was 70 per cent, higher than before the war. A little later in his speech, he abandoned his theory that the housing shortage was due to the scarcity of materials. He said that the fact that some builders were advertising for carpenters and bricklayers proved that plenty of materials were available,, and tnat the real trouble was due, to ai breakdown, of the Commonwealth reconstruction training scheme. E suggest, that he should make up his mind about, what he. thinks is really responsible for the situation, of which he complains ?' ex-servicemen have qualified under the reconstruction training scheme? Mi-. LEMMON -It is quite true. The Acting Leader of the Opposition quoted from a letter written by a partially blind man, who had obtained a permit from the Department of War Organization of Industry to build a house. He had obtained the necessary finance, and had entered' into a contract with a builder to erect the house, but the builder had defaulted. Well, surely he cannot blame the Commonwealth for that. If the house in question had been a war service home, the War Service Homes Commission would have got another builder to do the job or would have done the work itself. If the man had been blinded or otherwise incapacitated during his war service, he would have been given a first priority for the construction of his home. Apparently, however, this unfortunate man had to depend upon a private builder. If the permit was issued by the Department of War Organization of Industry, it must have been' not later than 1945. It is now 1948, and the man is still without a home. The story, as told by the Acting Leader of the Opposition, merely demonstrates the failure of private enterprise; The Acting Leader of the Opposition further complained that housing programmes had not been fully carried out. It is true that certain objectives were set,, are built under the agreement. and it is good to set a high objective'. It must be remembered:, however, that the programme provided merely that the building of a certain number of houses should be begun. It was known, that there would be considerable delay in the completion of the houses, but the position has improved so much that the completion rate is close to the commencement rate. Last year, 43,635 dwelling units, including 768 flats, were completed by Commonwealth and State housing authorities, and by private builders. directly concerned with the erection of war service homes only. That is the largest number of dwellings built in Australia in a year since. 1927^ The average number constructed eacn> year during the ten years beforethe Labour Government came into, office was only 27,000. By the end of the present financial year, it is expected that between 48,000 and 50,000 more dwellings will have been completed. The Acting Leader of the Opposition mentioned a number of things which, he said, should be done in order to hasten the construction of houses. He said that we should appoint a business executive to control and direct housing construction. Under the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement, the actual construction of houses is the responsibility of the State housing authorities. In two of the States, the housing authorities function under the direction of Liberal governments. If those governments wish to appoint business executives they are free to do so. Certainly, the. Commonwealth cannot prevent them from doing so. I suggest that the Acting Leader of. the Opposition should discuss the matter with his: colleagues in the Liberal Governments of Victoria and South Australia. He also blamed sales tax as a factordelaying the construction of houses, but his argument in that respect has been completely exploded. He touched upon the subject of home ownership, and I have already explained that the agreement provides that the occupants of houses constructed under the agreement may purchase them if they desire to do so. As a matter of fact, the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) has encouraged the State housing-authorities to sell the houses that Slum clearance was the next subject discussed by the Acting Leader of the Opposition. As I have already mentioned, he also complained of the scarcity of building tradesmen. Well, does he suggest that tradesmen, who might be employed on the construction of new houses, should be used to pull down houses already existing? In my opinion, this is not the time to undertake slum clearance. The policy of any government interested in The Commonwealth was providing, homes for the people",38,Houses Completed April 1944 To June 1948
73,Mr Duthie,"I s it true that 19,000should be to use all available labour find material for the construction of new dwellings, so that the young people who now have to live in alums may be able to move into other areas as soon as possible. The time for slum clearance is not when there is a general scarcity of houses, but when there is a reserve of labour and materials for which an outlet is sought. The Government is determined that never again will people go without homes because of a shortage of money. The only thing that limits our ability to provide homes is the physical capacity tc build them. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In committee: Clause1 agreed to. Clause2 (Authority to borrow £14,000,000). Mrs. BLACKBURN (Bourke) [5.57] This clause authorizes the raising of £14,000,000 for making advances to thcStates for the purposes of housing. Can the Minister say whether this is regarded as merely an instalment, and whether we may expect that further amounts will be raised from time to time for the same purpose? The shortage of homes is so great that the expenditure of £14,000,000 will hardly touch the fringe of the problem. Works and Housing) [5.58] -The amount of £14,000,000 was approved by the National Works Council in the helief that the various housing authorities would not be able to expend more this year. Up to June last, a total of £31,115,000 had been made available under the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement. More money will be made available from time to time in order to finance such building as the council believes that the housing authorities are able to accomplish. Sitting suspended from ti to S p.m..

I direct attention to the Second Schedule depreciation is really accruing, and, to the CommonAvealth and State Housing therefore, is becoming a credit. A few Agreement, which relates to the manner years hence, the houses will begin to of ascertaining losses incurred by a 'State deteriorate and those credits will be in or in connection with the administration of housing projects. Paragraph 1 of the schedule readsAs soon as practicable after the end of ciicli financial year, the Treasurer of the State shall supply to the Treasurer of the Commonwealtb a statement showing the amount of any lossesincurred by the State during the financial year in respect of its housing projects. The following provisions shall apply for the purpose of preparing any such statement. I do not propose to go into the details, but the statement which is referred to in paragraph. 1 is divided into two parts, one of which is headed "" Receipts"" and the other "" Payments"". The return should show all the revenues received in respect of a housing project, and all payments, so that the net balance may be indicated. If a State shows a loss, a certain obligation devolves upon the. Commonwealth. I understand that the Parliament has not been informed at any time of the contents of those returns from the States. I should like the Minister for Works and Housing( Mr Lemmon) to inform me, first, whether the States have submitted the returns in accordance with the provisions of the Second Schedule to the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement Act; secondly, what is the purport of those, statements, so that honourable members may know whether there have been profits or losses; and thirdly, whether the Minister has any objection to laying the statements on the table. Works and Housing) [8.3] -The statements to which the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) has referred have been made available to the Commonwealth by the Treasurers of the respective States. Speaking from memory, I believe that last year, most of the States showed a small credit, but New South Wales has a small debit. When we determine the rent, we allow a small percentage for tenancies which may not be filled. At present, because of the extraordinary demand for houses, all the tenancies are promptly filled. An allowance is also made for depreciation. As nearly all of the houses are newly constructed, the portion of t.he rent which is earmarked for",40,Houses Completed April 1944 To June 1948

If a person purchases the house which he is occupying, the credits which will accrue will be offset against the capital cost of the home. The State Treasurers have submitted their returns for this year in accordance with the Second Schedule to the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement, but the Commonwealth is challenging certain items which they had included as capital expenditure on the ground that they are excessive. When the position has been clarified, I shall make the returns available to honourable members .who are interested in them. this clause deals with the application of moneys for housing purposes, I submit that honourable members will be in order in suggesting ways in which the money may be more wisely spent or distributed than those which the Government proposes. I believe that the Government, in expending approximately £2,000,000 on the construction of administrative offices in Canberra, is utilizing valuable labour and material which can be employed to better advantage in building houses. The Minister for Works and Housing( Mr Lemmon) praised his department, and claimed that a record number of houses was built in 1947-48. He overlooked the fact that the building programme is only keeping pace with the number of homes which the Commonwealth Housing Commission regards as the normal requirements of Australia, nnd is not overtaking the leeway of 300,000 homes. The Minister stated, in effect, that the Government does not propose to use labour to pull down homes ior the purposes of slum clearance. The corollary to that statement is that the Government should not use valuable labour on public works when the manpower and materials are urgently required for housing the people. I do not deny that the Government is assisting in the construction of many homes, but private enterprise is doing even better. Doubtless the Minister will reply that the materials required for the administrative offices are different from those required for homes. r-tatement will be correct, but the honourable gentleman will not bo able to convince any person that bricks, timber and skilled labour which will be used in building the administrative offices could not be better employed in the construction of homes for the people. We have obtained artisans from the United Kingdom to accelerate the Government's building programme, but some of them are employed in patching Parliament House. To-day, the honourable member for Griffith( Mr Conelan) asked the Minister for Works aud Housing to inform him when the newParliament House would be built. asked a question about the new Parliiiment House. lionorable member for Balaclava should tell the truth. of the bonorable member's question? The DEPUTY CHAIEMAN Order! for Griffith is not sure of what he said. The DEPUTY CHAIEMAN Order! The Chair will not permit the honourable member for Griffith to interject in order to reply to the honorahle member for Balaclava. Incidentally, the remarks of the honourable member for Balaclava are somewhat wide of the clause. the Government should practise what it preaches. It should not waste labour, imported and local, on the construction of administrative offices when the housing programme is of greater importance. Who will say that the demands of any department are of greater importance than the need to provide shelter for people without homes? I agree that departments in Canberra should be properly accommodated, but the Government should not construct administrative offices until the leeway in housing has been overtaken. I now wish to make some practical In some respects, such a suggestions to the Minister. I know that he is enthusiastic, and if he will adopt my proposals, the money to which this bill relates will be spent to greater advantage.

83,Mr White,"I am emphasizing thatattention of the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Customs to the shortage of zinc oxide which is required for the manufacture of paint and of spelter for .galvanizing iron. and galvanized iron are in short supply because substantial quantities are being exported. I also asked a question about the shortage of electrical fittings, large quantities of which are being exported. Australia makes sufficient electrical fittings to meet the needs of the local market, but because of large exports, the local demand is not being satisfied and houses eannot be completed. The Minister has also stated that sales tax has been removed from practically every item used in the building trade. I consider that all items required in the building trade should be exempt from sales tax. Thisimpost is still applied, I understand, to certain lines of builders' hardware, and is a factor in preventing the reduction of building costs. The Minister should also explore the possibility qf permitting the importation under customs by-law of goods required in the building trade. Oregon is an instance. In South Australia, there is a great demand for that timber which is not, in a sence, competitive with our native timbers. The entry of baths and sinks should also be permitted under customs by-law, because the shortage of such fittings is preventing the completion of many houses. The importation of such fittings can be closely watched so that it will not injure Australian industries. The Governmentshould also take a strong stand against the Building Workers Industrial TJnion. The Communist secretary of that organization has visited joinery shops in Melbourne and has scattered the .skilled staffs. The organization unsuccessfully submitted certain claims to the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, .and to a Commonwealth conciliation commissioner, but disrupters and saboteurs in the building trade went to factories The Order! The honorahle member is not entitled to discuss that subject. deal with that industrial problem, and ensure that thousands of ex-servicemen, who are awaiting training as plumbers, carpenters and bricklayers under the Commonwealth reconstruction training scheme, receive their instruction and Paint obtain employment in industry as quickly as possible. Of course, the Communists are delighted when many people .have no homes.

Parliament House will be forgotten until the leeway in housing has been overtaken.. The provision of homes for the people must be the first consideration.

The Postmaster-General (Senator Cameron) .has urged workers not to over-produce The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN. Order! not be tolerated. I urge the Minister to heed the suggestions which members of the Opposition have advanced during this debate because their adoption would help the Government to obtain greater production. The honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) attempted to mislead the House about a question which I asked this afternoon, and I desire to correct any wrong impression which he may have created. As a member of the Public Works Oommittee, I asked the Minister for Works and Housing( Mr Lemmon) whether he would submit to Cabinet a plans for the new Parliament House.

The honourable member must withdraw that remark and apologize. a pologize. honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott) was pathetic in his efforts to criticize the Government for its decision to distribute to the State governments the money to be raised under this bill. He and other honourable gentlement opposite have always impressed upon us the need to decentralize power. By giving the State governments full authority over the spending of their respective shares of the £14,000,000 the Australian Government is ensuring that decentralization of authority. Honorahle gentlemen opposite have no monopoly of interest in the housing of Australia's homeless people. We are at least as sincere in our desire to see people properly housed as they are. increasing marriage rate is constantly creating a greater demand for homes. We are still trying to catch up the lag created before and during the war. It is a colossal task that will test our ingenuity and our ability to co-operate with both private enterprise and State housing authorities. The Order! The honourable member must also keep to the clause. He is tending to get wide of it.

The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,-The honourable member is apparently attempting to reply to something that the Minister said in a previous debate. That is out of order. The Minister has not spoken on that line in the committee stages of this bill so the honourable member has nothing to reply to. Secondly, the honourable member is getting wide of the clause. The Chair has ruled that clause 3 deals only with the appropriation of moneys raised. Whilst the limits are narrow, they must he observed. Moneys borrowed under, this Act shall be issued and applied only for the expenses of borrowing and for making advances to the States for the purposes of housing in pursuance of the agreement the execution of which support the bill fully. is authorized by tlie Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement Act 1.945. The relevant section of the agreement readsEach State shall ensure that adequate legislation exists in the State to enable it at all times to control throughout the State(a) rental housing projects under this Agreement; (6) slum clearance; and (c) town planning. As there has :not heen any' slum clearance policy in the States, I contend that the .States .are not carrying out the agreement between the Commonwealth and the States ""which was made in 1945, and ratified in Act 44 of 1945.

Some of the States have already placed orders for specific items, and others have indicated that they intend to do 90. That is for all items'Other than oregon timber. The honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott) endeavoured to point out that this elause limits the amount to £14,000,000. Although that is correct, I endeavoured to point out to the committee, prior to the supension of the sitting, that £14,000,000 is only this year's instalment.

Of course no one pretends that in Canberra, where there are only 16,000 people, the representative should have the same voice in national affairs as,, for example, the representative of an area such as many of us represent, where we have up to 80,000 or 90,000 electors. The point is that not only will the member foi Canberra have no voice or 1 vote, except on local matters, but also the people who live here will have no form of local government whatsoever in which they can take part. Mr Br.Aix -There is an advisory council. Territory there is a form of legislative council which, under certain circumstances, has powers to act and do certain things for the citizens of that community. In New Guinea, even before the war, there was a similar council, and the Minister for External Territories ( Mr Ward) has told us that soon there will be another council in New Guinea, with certain powers to act. The Minister for External Territories told us with great pride, that the natives of New Guinea are to have a voice in their local self-government. Those who know anything about the natives of New Guinea will realize that they do not want a voice in their own self-government, that they are not capable of expressing themselves in that way, and that no possible benefit can accrue to them from having such a voice. In respect of New Guinea and this much-flaunted native qnestion honourable member must confine his remarks to the matter that is being debated. comparison. I say that that statement was made by the Minister for External Territories to impress that international ""wind-shop"", the United Nations. It would have been much more to the point, if instead of ensuring that we had a measure of democracy among people who were not developed to use it, had we seen to it earlier that people here, in a white Australian community, had the means of expressing themselves and of saying how their local affairs should be conducted. The citizens have no effective voice in the control of the Australian Capital Territory. As the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Blain) has pointed out, there is an Australian Capital Territory Advisory Council. It consists of seven members, four of whom are nominated hy the Government, -ft is curious that that should be so under M Labour government, because I have heard honourable members opposite complain about the nominated membership of certain legislative councils in this country. However, the Australian Capital Territory Advisory Council has four nominated members and three elected members, which means that the nominated members are in the majority. Even if the council decides to advise that a certain course of action be taken, there is no authority to whom it can give that advice which is bound to act upon it. I agree that tinMinister for the Interior( Mr Johnson) receives its recommendations, but he is not bound to take the faintest notice of them. It may be said that, despite this disadvantage, the people of Canberra generally, are fairly well off, contented aud happy. I admit that the Government can point to many advantages that they enjoy. For example, there is a good water supply, sewerage system and electricity service ancl a high level of employment. In short, Canberra is a country town with the amenities of a city. However, the fact that the people of Canberra are well treated does not. compensate for the fact that they have no voice in the control of their affairs. Whatever this community may be at the present time, no one can pretend that it is a democracy. It may he administered benevolently, but the fundamental rights of its people are not recognized. The organization is anti-democratic. The Australian Capital Territory is a curious development in this country. It is a little area of socialist practice in the midst of an otherwise more or less democratic land, where we pay, at any rate, lip-service to the principles of the freedom, responsibilities and rights of the individual and of free enterprise.

123,Mr Gullett,"I want to draw athe happy hunting gr.ound of planners. There is no interference -with those people in government positions who plan the life and the development of the community. They can tell the people exactly what they shall do and how they shall behave, and no one can effectively contradict them. For example, tradesmen in Canberra cannot put lettering on their shop windows unless it conforms to the size and the type stipulated by regulations promulgated by the appropriate departmental official. I notice that several honourable members are looking rather surprised, and no doubt they would regard that as most extraordinary in their own districts. If-the tenant of a government house, and nearly everybody in Canberra lives in a government house, wishes to grow a hedge 5 feet high, he is not allowed to do so. His hedge is cut for him, and he is not allowed to cut it himself, even though he wishes to do so, or to allow it to grow to the height that he desires. If a community group in Canberra wishes to erect a public hall, it cannot do so unless it receives department. mental approval. I am reliably informed, and the facts seem to confirm my information, that departmental approval is never forthcoming for an operation of that kind. Some of the trade unions add to the difficulties by taking a stand against any form of community effort in Canberra. I am given to understand that when people in one of the new suburbs wanted to dig holes and plant their own trees in the streets, they were aot allowed to do so because a trade union said that that work was usually done by its members. I could refer to other ways in which officials are allowed to interfere every house, controls the lease, directly with the lives of ordinary individuals. Not only has officialdom practically unlimited powers here, and not only have the citizens practically no powers at all, but the great majority of the residents are not allowed even to criticize the system. The great majority of the people are Commonwealth public servants or people who are employed by the Commonwealth, directly or indirectly. recently, Commonwealth public servants were unable to comment on any matter of public interest. That rule has nowbeen relaxed to some degree in that they are now allowed to comment on purely local matters. I put it to the House that the great majority of people here, who have almost no civic rights, have not organized protests and forced the Government to take some action to remedy that situation because, being public servants and living in government houses, and being dependent upon government tolerance and approval for almost everything that they do, they are not in a position to protest against bhe regime. I am glad to see that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Fraser) is present in the chamber. 1. am interested to see that the honourable gentleman is smiling in a somewhat disbelieving and supercilious manner. It would be much better if, instead of saying one thing to the people of Canberra in his broadcasts and remaining silent in the House honourable member for Henty must con-: fine himself to the bill. He may not discuss individual members of the Parliareferred to the honourable gentleman if 1 had not heard it mooted honourable gentleman attempts to evade my ruling I shall ask him to resume his seat. I shall not warn him a second time. the planners and the socialist organizers are supreme. The Government owns tbe land, controls the building of almost or indirectly, of every shop, and exercises control over all business premises in one way or another. Every undertaking in Canberra operates by virtue of government tolerance and approval. That is. 1 suggest, the perfect socialist set-up. It is, in effect, an experiment in socialism. It will be of interest, therefore, to see what conditions obtain in a state of affairs that is so Until quite much favoured by the planners.

128,Mr Conelan,"""What has this got toin do with the bill, as every honourable member understands, except the honourable member for Griffith( Mr Conelan >When the honourable gentleman raises his voice The honorable member must confine himself to the bill. Interior spends a great deal of time in Canberra and continually receives deputations from residents. Therefore he must be aware of local conditions. I do .not want to discuss the prices of peas, potatoes, clothing and furniture in detail. The fact is that they are all much higher iu price than in other cities and towns of comparable size. The quality of goods sold in Canberra also is very poor. If fche Minister doubts that, he need only read, in a recent issue of the Canberra Times, a reported statement by certain Canberra housewives who complained most bitterly about the conditions which tliey have to suffer. Also, anybody who doubts the disabilities of shoppers in Canberra need only read the Hansard report of the speech made by the honourable inember for Eremantle ( Mr Beazley), who told a harrowing tale ahout his experiences when he took a little string bag to the shops and was kept waiting for liours to buy indifferent goods, for which he was charged most outrageous prices. That may amuse honourable members opposite, but it is a tragic reality to the residents of Canberra. organizers who sold the goods. that the honourable member raised that point. Of course they are not socialist organizers. But in this community, the Government has set itself up to regulate everything. It built the shops, it built the ancl residential areas. Housing limitahouses, and it controls the leases. What has been the result? It has caused inconvenience, exploitation, and a measure of petty monopoly to the disadvantage of those who have to live in tbe territory. The people of Canberra are at ihe mercy of the Governinent and governinent officials, against whose acts they liave no chance of securing redress. Whatp needed'in this community, allied to the theories of the planners, is plain horsesense, which can be provided only by local self-governing bodies of the kind with which every honourable memher is familiar in his own electorate. Representation of that kind is denied to the people, although it is one of their greatest needs. I refer now to the Burley Griffin plan, which, of course, is the foundation of Canberra. It is a beautiful plan. Let us all admit that at once. honourable member. neer, but the plan appeals to me. AlthoughI like it, I say that it is not Holy Writ, but it is being treated as Holy Writ by the present administration. In many respects it is already out of date. We have only to look at the roads here,which were built in the good old spacious days when it was thought that it would be very nice for us all to drive about in a leisurely fashion in carriages. Those roads are incapable of coping even with the traffic in Canberra to-day. That is only one aspect of the Canberra plan which is out of date. In this city, we have discarded what is regarded as'a normal feature of any growing town-the main street. The Burley Griffin plan provides for shopping centres. The failure of the Government to alter that part of the plan has caused the greatest possible inconvenience to people who live here. Not for nothing do most towns have a main street. A main street is very convenient; it is something around which a centre develops. Many people live long distances from the shopping centres in Canberra, and there are no intermediate shops. The plan should be altered so that shops could' be spread throughout the industrial tions in Canberra are unduly severe. It is fitting that there should be restrictions on the typesof houses that may be built in this area where the Government always has the final word, but unfortunately the policy of this Government seems to be to build an unlimited number of very small houses.

Thousands of tiny homes that are. now being erected will be inadequate for the. needs of families with more than two or three children. Canberrawill suffer particularly severely from the effect of this shori-sighted policy. If large blocks of temporary flats were erected, a9 I suggest, young married couples could live in them for a few years and, as their families grew, they could move out to large, and. comfortable houses. [ have allowed the honourable member considerable latitude. He should now return to the subject of the bill and state his opinions about that. my best, sir, but I bow to your ruling. In conclusion, I shall refer briefly to the general design of Canberra. honorahle member any ideas about tbe design of the bill? The bill is merely a machinery measure, about which it would be possible to say nothing at all, hut I take the line, which r indicated at the beginning of my speech, that the people of this; city suffer from the lack of adequate representation. I am trying to give it to them in some measure. Therefore, my remarks might reasonably be considered to apply to the hill. However, I shall accept your opinion, Mr Deputy Speaker. My final comment is that the provision of representation in this House for residents of the Australian Capital Territory should be supplemented by some adequate form of local self-government. The citizens of Canberra should have some effective instrumentality of their own election, not merely some body which may give advice to some other authority which may, or may not, take the advice which is tendered to it. They should be provided with some means of. putting their own wishes into practice. That is a fundamental need of any community, and it should delay. The speech by Mr Ulrich. Ellis, to which the House has just listened, is full of misstatements. honourable member for Eden-Monaro has referred to a speech by Mr Ulrich Ellis. Tliere is no person of thatname in this House. Chair did not hear any name mentioned There is no .point of order. were so many mistakes thaf it would not be possible for me to reply to all of them. think that the honourable member should attempt to do so. that impossible task. Before' proceeding to deal with the principles laid down in tlie bill, I should like to correct one or two of the. most serious misstatements made by the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) in the speech which he has just read to the House. As an illustration of the tyranny under which the people of the National Capital suffer, the honourable membei"" said, for example, that the people are not even allowed the freedom to cut their own. hedges. He invited the House to believe that in this city,, in which I am glad to know he has taken up residence, a person cannot even let his hedge grow to the height he likes, and that a resident is not allowed to cut it himself hut must have it cut by some government official at the prescribed height of 5 feet. That is typical of many false statements about the National Capital that have been repeated for many years) which are calculated to deceive a great many -people as to living conditions in Canberra. In all that sort of nonsense there is no truth whatever. Any resident of this capital city may cut his own hedge if he likes, and at thc height he likes. This is just one of those silly stories that the honourable member",51,Second Reading

145,Mr Fraser,"I shall not attemptfor Henty, having allowed himself to be gulled into 'believing, now seeks to persuade the House is true. If a resident of this city wishes the Government to cut his hedge, officials of the Parks and Gardens Section of the .Department of the Interior will cut it, and at the standard height. If a resident wishes to cut his own hedge, he has as much freedom to do so in Canberra as he would have were he residing in any other city or town in Australia. I shall waste no more time in refuting the misstatements made by the deceived honourable member for Henty. It has heen said that the Australian Capital Territory has not one representative but 74 representatives, since every member of the House of Kepresentatives has an interest in thc National Capital. Indeed, many citizens of this city have opposed moves to have a member for the Australian Capital Territory elected on the very ground that if one member were elected by the citizens of the Australian Capital Territory and made responsible for the representation of this city, its people would lose because they would no longer have the interest of every other member of the House. do not believe that that is true. I believe that the election of a member for the Australian Capital Territory will confer many benefits on the people of this city and will enable all honourable members who have an interest in it to gain a better understanding of the problems that its people face and how they should be attacked. For many years, those who sought to obtain the election of a member for the Australian Capital Territory had also to contend against the argument that if the residents of the Australian Capital Terriof 30,000 voters, that the effort tory were granted representation in the National Parliament they would have to pay higher direct taxes. In the past, when State taxation was very much heavier than federal taxationbefore uniform income tax was introduced-the Capital enjoyed a substantial monetary advantage. Many of them feared that if they obtained the right of representation they would have to accept the obligation of paying higher taxes. That was one of the current attitudes on the part of the Mr Fraser. people of Canberra themselves which held back the representation of the Australian Capital Territory in this Parliament. With the introduction of uniform income tax the force of that argument was swept away. For many years I have been associated with the citizens' rights movement in the National Capital. For a long time that movement asked for the election of a member to represent the Australian Capital Territory with full voting rights, and was not prepared to accept anything less than that; but repeated deputations to successive Ministers for the Interior and Prime Ministers proved to the citizens of Canberra that no government, either of the party which is at present in power, or of the parties which are at present in Opposition, was, in the then state of development of Canberra, prepared to give the Australian Capital' Territory representation by a member with full voting rights. While it is argued, and quite properly, that it is undemocratic that 15,000 residents of Canberra should be without a direct voice or vote in the National Parliament, it would be, it is contended, even more undemocratic that 15,000 people in this city should exercise I equal voting rights with the 60,000, 70,000 or 80,000 electors who comprise the average electorates in the existing Parliament. The opportunity of the residents of the Australian Capital Territory to obtain the election of a member came with the movement to increase the size of this National Parliament. It is only since legislation was introduced to increase the size of the National Parliament by reducing the sizo of the electorates on the mainland to an average number of 40,000 voters, and the Tasmanian electorates to an average number to obtain a member for the Australian Capital Territory has been finally crowned with success. The residents of Canberra, as represented in the citizens' rights league, have accepted the view that for the present, and until the popularesidents of the National tion of the Australian Capital Territory increases, the voting power of that member should be limited to matters directly affecting the Australian Capital Territory. The point I wish to make, and I hope that the Government will bear it in mind, is that, whilst it may be true that it. would be undemocratic at present to give tbe Australian Capital Territory a member witb full voting rigbts, it would also be very undemocratic if f u l l voting rigbts were not given to the members for the Australian Capital Territory immediately this territory obtained a number cf voters equal to one more than one-half of the average electoral quota. The number of names on the electoral roll for the Australian Capital Territory is at present growing at the rate of from 1,000 to 1,200 a year. Because the present Government believes in the National Capital and has with tremendous energy planned to develop this city, the population of Canberra will grew' even more rapidly next year. I submit that the Australian Capital Territory should automatically be granted a member with full voting rights immediately its electoral population is one more than one-half of I'nder existing electoral laws, when in nny State, after the number of quotas has been arranged and the number of members for that State has been fixed, there remains one over one-half of the quota of that State, it is given an extra member. So, the principle is clearly established, and should not be forgotten wben we are providing for representation of the Australian Capital Territory, that one over one-half of a quota should give the member for this Territory full voting rights in this chamber. I believe that by the 1952 elections the member for the Australian Capital Territory will be able to claim full voting power in this chamber. In the meantime, it is exceedingly important that steps should be taken to give to the people of Canberra some self-governing' authority. It is true that there are very considerable and practical difficulties in the way of doing so because this city is financed partly from the Commonwealth Treasury. The funds wihich in Canberra far exceed those contributed by its citizens alone. Those funds general revenues of the Commonwealth. While that continues, it is obvious that the Commonwealth itself must have a substantial say in the management of Canberra. However, the revenues of this city are growing rapidly. The benefits of the leasehold system which has operated in Canberra since its foundation, will be appreciated more as the years go by. Already Canberra leases are yielding substantial revenue for the Government. The population of Canberra is growing, and its people are contributing a large annual sum in direct taxes because they are paying into the Commonwealth Treasury the f u l l total of Commonwealth and State tax. I believe that an attempt should be made to establish a Canberra budget, and to provide in that budget money for a local municipal council to manage the affairs of this city. That council should be elected by the Canberra people, and should have the right to control the revenue contributed by the people of this city. Canberra is an interesting example of both the advantages and disadvantages of the minimum electoral quota. official planning in the absence of compensating democratic electoral rights. The honourable member for Henty went to great lengths to show the disadvantages of life in this city, but as I have said, many of his illustrations were entirely inapt. The advantages of life in Canberra are plain to any one who visits this city and compares its amenities with those of the average town of comparable size in other parts of Australia. The advantages of security and physical planning are enjoyed by Canberra people, but it is absurd to say that the defects of life here are the result of the operation of a socialist system. No socialist system operates in this city, and no form of democratic life really exists here, nor can it exist, until the people of the Australian Capital Territory are represented in the National Parliament. The defects of the administration of Canberra, and the disadvantages of life here, are, in fact, the defects and disadvantages of a. totalitarian system of government. Canare expended berra officials hold over the lives of the people of this city, far more power than is exercised or possessed by officials anycome largely from the where else in the Commonwealth. The disadvantages that flow from that situation should be understood by the people of Australia as being the disadvantages of a totalitarian system of administration. This is a city in which, if one lives in a government boarding house, the Government puts the milk on one's porridge in the morning. It would be only a comparatively short step to add sugar also. But that is nothing more than a typical defect of a state of society in which complete power has been placed in the hands of officials, and in which those who are governed by the officials have no right or power to assert their position as free democratic citizens of the Commonwealth. [ have a particular knowledge of these matters, because, when I was elected to this Parliament as the member for Eden Monaro six years ago, I let it be known that, as one who had lived in this city for many years, I should be glad to help any Cariberra citizen who wanted assistance until Canberra had a member of its own. In the last six years, many Canberra residents have chosen to look upon me as the member of this Parliament who takes a particular interest in .the affairs of Canberra, and rarely a day passes without half a dozen Canberra people coming to my office to seek my assistance or advice. I have been glad to help those people, and I concede that other members of the Parliament have also taken an interest in representing this city and looking after the interests of its residents. Because of my association with the people of Canberra, particularly during my membership of this chamber, I realize that there is an urgent need for direct representation of thc Australian Capital Territory in this legislature. I shall be very glad indeed when a member for Canberra is elected, because he will be able to give his full time and attention to the defects of the administration and the injustices which various 'people in this city suffer, or believe that they suffer from. I shall be happy to pass that work over to whoever is elected as the member for the Australian Capital Territory. the speculation about my position, I have never said anything publicly except that [ shall continue to seek the voting privileges of the membei' for Eden-Monaro in this House. As the representative of that constituency, I shall be very happy to co-operate with the first member for the National Capital to press for various improvements tliat are needed in this city, and to keep before the Government the ideal that Canberra should have a Mr Fruner. member with not only a voice in this Parliament but also, as soon as the population of this city warrants it, with full voting rights. I congratulate the Minister for the Interior( Mr Johnson) upon the introduction of this measure. Honourable members have stressed the undemocratic nature of the system which exists in Canberra to-day. Erom 1927 until the outbreak of ""World War II . , governments of the political complexion of honourable members opposite were in control of the planning of Canberra, and of its administration, and for Opposition members to stress now that this Government'3 measure of self-government for the National Capita] is not adequate does not excuse the fact that tliey gave to this city no form of self-government at all. The defects of the administration of Canberra to-day are a legacy to the present Minister from the past. The Minister was taken to task by the honourable memher for Henty( Mr Gullett) because he had not done anything to modify the Canberra plan. I point out, however, that the Minister is the only one of a succession of Ministers who has attempted to vary the original plan to meet the needs of the Canberra community, particularly with the object of providing improved shopping facilities. The memher for the Australian Capital Territory will not have the same voting power as other members of the Parliament. It is necessary to understand that, in order to give the member for the Australian Capital Territory full voting power, an alteration of tie Constitution would have to be approved by the people of Australia. The Oommonwealth is a Despite all federation of six States, and the Constitution sets out how those States are to be represented in the Parliament. When the Constitution was framed, it was not contemplated that territories controlled by the Commonwealth would ever be represented by memhers whose votes would be able to disturb the balance of the voting power of the six States in the National Parliament. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro, and the honourable member for Henty, were in agreement in one Tespect: they stressed the",52,Second Reading
146,Mr Beazley (Eremantle) [9.23],"ueed for civil self-government in Canberra. The honourable member for Eden Monaro pointed out how vast is the expenditure of national revenue in Canberra 'above the Tevenue contributed by the people of Canberra. According to the Estimates for 1948-49, the revenue from all sources in the Australian Capital Territory is expected to be £500,000 for the year. The vote for the Territory this year is £909,000, in addition to which capital works undertaken by the Commonwealth in the Territory are expected TO cost another £2,256,000. Thus, expenditure in the Territory will be nearly seven times as great as the revenue raised in the Territory, and that is the impedidiscovered that one of the firms which I ment to the granting of civil self-governcriticized owns a block of 3,000 shares in ment. The present dimculty can be traced to a defect in the original plan for the building of Canberra. National Capital, but it is also a city in pendent person who disagreed with me. which people must live. It would have been better if the plan had provided in the beginning for a governmental centre, with government buildings which would be the responsibility of the National Parhope that steps will be taken to check liament. Outside that, there should have been a residential area which would enjoy civil self-government. Under the present system, it is difficult to differentiate between governmental and civic needs. Some weeks ago, I made a statement about services and shopping facilities in Canberra, and it earned me more publicity than any speech I ever made in this .Parliament. that august institution, the joint campaign committee of the private banks, took notice of the statement, [n bank clerks, it stated that a .socialist member of Parliament had discovered that socialism was defective, and that he had found it particularly defective in Canberra. In my statement, I referred to bread and milk, which are not socialisgratulate the Minister for the Interior tically produced in Canberra. I also referred to shopping facilities, and they are not under public control, either. However, I am not concerned with the distortion of what I said. I am concerned with the functions of the member for the Australian Caoital Territory, who will have to consider problems which have arisen in Canberra. The most serious of these has to do with something which is the very reverse of socialism. It is the existence in this city of private monopolies. I congratulate the Minister for the Interior on his intention to pro'vide more shops in Canberra. I hope that it will be made a condition of the lease of those shops that the lessees shall have no connection with any existing business in Canberra; or, better still, tliat the shops, when constructed, shall be leased to the Canberra Co-operative Society. It i9 interesting to examine how closely various businesses are linked in Canberra. I criticized shopping facilities, and my remarks evoked a hysterical response from the Canberra Times. I have since the company which publishes the Canberra Times, so that the voice of the This is the journal was not the voice of an indebut the voice of a servant defending his master's products. There is much interlocking of business interests in Canberra, and no real competition. 3 the monopolistic trend in Canberra business undertakings. The member for the Australian Capital Territory, if he does not enter the Parliament .by courtesy of some existing business interests which might finance his campaign, with the support of the Canberra Times, will 'be a valuable acquisiEven tion, a valuable stimulus to the Government, and a help to the Minister for the Interior in the development of Canberra. This bill will remove a grave injustice. a recent circular issued to The people of Canberra are at last to have a voice in the Parliament. I hope that, when electing their membeT, they will make sure that he is independent of the private business monopolies which have grown up in the Territory.

That, of",55,Second Reading
147,Mr Haeeison (Wentworth,"Actingciiiirse, is not, correct. The Opposition welcomes the bill. As a matter of fact, we shall try to make it a better bill, and r.u ensure that the meniber for the Ausiraiiaii Capital Territory shall enjoy more power than it is proposed to give liirn. I do not think that we shall have much success in our efforts, but we shall try. I suggest that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Fraser) and the honourable member for Fremantle should get together in an attempt to reach a common understanding about Canberra. The honourable member for Fremantle said that Canberra was not a socialist city but that it was, in fact, conHis first two phrases pointed to the trolled by monopolies, and he cited examines to prove his point. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro may, of course, have his own reasons for expressing a different opinion, hut he said that the conditions which existed in Canberra should be a warning against the disabilities which flowed from totalitarian governments. The two honourable members canuot both be right. tency between totalitarian government and monopoly? is, by inference, a totalitarian State, because in a socialist State everything is controlled by the central government. The speech of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro came rather strangely from him because he is trusting that the selection committee may ultimately succeed in getting him the job as the nominated candidate. He reminds me of the maiden "" who wouldn't and then -who would "". He now finds that owing to the dispensation of providence and the Electoral Act he may be forced to take some other attitude with regard to Canberra than that which he had shown before. I shall have something more to say about that as I proceed. I repeat that the remarks made by the honourable member came rather strangely from a. member of the Labour party, who has signed a pledge to work for the socialization of production, distribution and exchange. with the bill? Canberra and the disabilities from whicb as a socialized city it suffers, is a warning to all of what may obtain under totalitarian government. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro has signed a pledge to support socialism and now will have to protest against the things that socialism is likely to bring about. Honourable members generally can see therefore the horns of the dilemma on which the honourable member is poised. The honourable member alleged that the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) had made a false statement. honourable member as one who deals with veracity lightly. He said that the honourable member for Henty was reading a speech. All honourable members know full well that the honourable member for Henty did not read his speech. quarters of it. member for Henty did not even do what other honourable members do with the approval of the Chair-refe r to copious notes. The honourable member for Eden Monaro said that the honourable member for Henty's speech had been prepared by Mr Ulrich Ellis. BothI and other honourable members know the honourable member for Henty well enough to know that because of his long experience and his interests in Canberra he was giving the House his own opinions. But when the honourable member for Eden-Monaro seeks to put his case to the selection committee any avenue that may lead to success is the right avenue for him. The honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) stated that the member who will represent the Australian Capital Territory will be of great assistance to the Minister for the Interior( Mr Johnson). Although it has heen supposed that, by proxy, all honourable members of this House are members for the Australian Capital Territory, the Minister has sat in the blissful peace of retirement on the treasury bench with scarcely a question directed to him, about Canberra and, in fact, with scarcely any mention being made of the disabilities of Canberra.

I am afraid that that blissful state will be rudely shattered when the member for the Australian Capital Territory takes his place in this Parliament, because I can see that honourable member "" needling "" the Minister to a very great degree. I am interested in the bill itself because it sets out exactly what are the advantages that will accrue to the memher who will represent the Australian Capital Territory and also the disabilities inherent in his representation of that electorate. It might be as well for us to consider those disabilities, because I suspect that the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory will find himself in a similar position will have a limited representation. It to the honourable member for the Northern Territory. He will find himself absolutely frustrated in giving expression to the views of the electors of the territory, or indeed in taking any active part in the machinery of government. We have only to look at the circumstances surrounding the electors in Canberra and compare them with those of other cities to obtain some idea of the disabilities that are likely to flow from the measure. I understand that at the time the last census was taken there were about 17,000 people listed in Canberra. The Minister informs me that that figure represents a voting strength of from 9,000 to 11,000. In the Northern Territory, where there is a similar eet of circumstances and an elected representative who suffers under disabilities similar to those that T propose to tralia, with a population of 17,000, and a enumerate shortly, there is a population of approximately 10,000 representing a voting strength of about 5.000 to 6,000. Those figures mean that the representation of the Northern Territory is entirely different from that to be provided for the Australian Capital Territory. Canberra has double the number of voters and approximately double the number of people that the Northern Territory has. Let us pursue this aspect further, because it is interesting to try to obtain some idea of the relative value of the vote of a resident of Canberra and that of a resident of Tasmania. In Tasmania, after the next general election for this Parliament, that State will have approximately fifteen parliamentary representatives including ten. senators and five members of the House of Representatives. The number of electors in Tasmania to-day is approximately 158,000. A simple sum on the part of honourable members will show that Tasmania will have a representative, with full powers in this Parliament, for every 10,600 of its electors, whilst the Australian Capital Territory have fifteen representatives in this chamber. terms of parliamentary representation. There will be ten senators and five members of the House of Representatives. Canberra, with 9,000 to 1.1.000 electors, seems to me that the Government has not been at all generous in giving representation to Canberra. It should give the Australian Capital Territory representation in a much wider and more generous form, because if it believes in democracy it should wish to see exercised to the full the maximum democratic value of each individual vote. Let us look at the disabilities that the honourable member representing Canberra will suffer under in this House. Clause5 (1) of the bill readsSubject to the next succeeding sub-section, the meniber representing the Australian Capital Territory sball not be entitled to vote on any question arising in the House of Bepresentatives. Therefore, in the capital city of Ausvoting strength of between 9,000 and 11,000, the people are to have no voice in matters of national importance, althougli in Tasmania every 10,600 of the electors will have an elected parliamentary representative and a voice in matters of national importance. Clause5 (2) statesThe member representing the Australian Capital Territory may vote on any motion for the disallowance of any Ordinance of the Australian Capital Territory and on any amendment of any such motion. That means that the parliamentary representative of the Australian Capital Territory will be nothing but a glorified cipher. The member for the Anstralian Capital Territory will not be able to vote on legislation other than ordinances of the Australian Capita] Territory.",57,Second Reading

Sub-clause 3 of clause 5 readsThe presence in the House of Bepresentatives at any time of the member representing the Australian Capital Territory and the fact that he is a member of the House shall not be taken into account in determining whether at tliat time a suflicient number of members is present to constitute a meeting' of the House for tlie exercise of its powers., That sub-clause provides further proof that the member for the Australian Capital Territory will be only a factotum and a mere cipher in this democracy. Sub-clause 4 statesThe member representing the Australian Capital Territory shall be incapable of being chosen to be the Speaker or the Chairman of Committees of the House of Bepresentatives or to perform the duties of the Speaker or the the Australian Capital Territory. Chairman of Committees. Some honourable members may consider that the member representing the Australian Capital Territory will not suffer any disability through being debarred from occupying any executive position in the House..

Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Scully). I have spoken most feelingly about other limitations which will be placed on the powers of the member representing the Australian Capital Territory, and the honourable gentleman does well to remind me that the new member, although he will not be able to vote on legislation of national importance, will not be prevented from moving the gag. I . sincerely hope that, in future, an honourable member who has limited voting powers' in thischamber will not exercise his right to move the gag. Subclause 5 readsThe member representing the Australian Capital Territory shall not be counted for the purpose of ascertaining whether tliere is an absolute majority in favour of any question in respect of which an absolute majority of either House or both Houses' of the Parliament is reqiidred under section fifty-seven or section one hundred and twenty-eight of tlie Constitution. Although the member representing the Australian Capital Territory will give the citizens of Canberra and, incidentally, Jervis Bay,, a voicein this House, he will be debarred from voting on matters of national importance. He may make interesting and valuable contributions to debates, but he will be prevented from supporting his views with a vote. Canberra is reaching maturity as a city.

If he considers that the ten senators who will represent Tasmania after the next election will be of no value in the functioning of the parliamentary machine, he should be courageous enough to say so. The position is that ten senators and five members of the House of Representatives will represent 158,000 people in Tasmania or approximately one representative to 10,000 electors. The representative of the Australian Capital Territory will represent between 9,000 and 11,000 persons, but he will be frustrated in that he will be prevented from voting on any legislation other than ordinances of the Australian Capital Territory.

However, he has magnanimously stated, at long last, that he will represent the electors of the Australian Capital Territory as long as he can, whilst continuing to perform Jais duties as the memher for Eden-Monaro. I have no doubt that the residents of the Australian Capital Territory will be most grateful to the honorahle gentleman. Members of the Opposition can assist the Minister .for the Interior to improve the bill, and I urge him to examine our suggestions most carefully. I have submitted an unanswerable case in respect of the right of the member for the Australian Capital Territory to vote on all measures. [ 9 . 5 4 ] Ulrich Ellis, who, as a member of the Advisory Council of the Australian Capital Territory, has succeeded in forcing the Government to provide for the representation of the citizens of Canberra and Jervis Bay in this House. Mr Ellis will be remembered in history as the gentleman who has forced the issue. No one knows that better than the Minister for the Interior( Mr Johnson). did not know that Mr Ellis existed. fectly well of the existence of Mr Ulrich Ellis. His persistent campaign in the Spotlight has forced the Government to grant the residents of the Australian Capital Territory representation in this tion to the disabilities which the people of Canberra suffer from. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Eraser) has been in a difficult position for some time. I understand that the Australian Labour party branches in Goulburn and in the Australian Capital Territory have rejected him, but he again seeks refuge in the new constituency of Eden Monaro. The Government should be ashamed for having denied to the people of the Australian Capital Territory representation in this House for so many years. As the elected member for the Northern Territory, I object to the remarks of the Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Harrison), who has stated that the new member for the Australian Capital Territory will be merely a cipher, a factotum. I propose to tell a short story which is pertinent to my own position as the member for the Northern Territory. About ten years ago, when the representatives of the press were still allowed to mix with honourable memhers, I overheard one of -them ask, "" What is the use of having a member for the Northern Territory when he .is not permitted to vote on matters other than those relating to the Northern Territory?"" A colleague replied, "" The memher for the Northern Territory may not have a vote but he has a mighty voice"". I believe that my voice has been heard to good effect in the interests of the Northern Territory; and should the I thrice congratulate Mr honourable member for Eden-Monaro gain the honour of being the first member to represent the Australian Capital Territory in this Parliament, I am certain that he will not be merely a factotum. I hope that he will make his voice heard as effectively as that of any other member in the Opposition, which, of course, will then be the present ministerial party.

168,Mr Blain,"The Minister knew perEllis in forcing the issue, the Government has seen the light, and to some degree has recognized the right of residents of the Australian Capital Territory io parliamentary representation. Eor the benefit of honourable memhers, I propose briefly to trace the development of responsible colonial government from the legislative council. Unfortunately, this Government gave to the people of Canberra only an advisory council. Previous governments established a legislative council in New Guinea, but, later, that body was abolished. 1 was surprised to bear the honourable member for Martin( Mr Daly) decry the principle of legislative councils, particularly when this Government recently established such a body in the Northern Territory. The Government speaks with two voices in this matter. Although it is opposed to the principle of legislative councils, it acceded to my advocacy of the last twelve years to establish such a body in the Northern Territory. I admit, of course, th.at the Government, true to its policy of socialism, has ensured a majority of government nominees on that body. 1 quote the following from the Developmeni oj the Legislative Council 160G1945 by Martin WightTlie constitutional development of the British Colonies, like that of England itself, is extraordinary for its continuity. The system under which Virginia and New York, .lamaica and Nova Scotia were governed in the Eighteenth Century changes by slow and lingering gradations into the system under whicli Nigeria and Ceylon, Jamaica and Kenya ure governed in the twentieth. The Thirteen Colonies gained their independence by revolution ancl war. ( Mr Lazzarini) I ask the honourable member to confine his remarks to the bill. deal with the place, of the legislative council in the development of the democratic system of government. Clause4 sets out the qualifications of the member for the Australian Capital Territory as follows:( H ) He must be of thc full n-ge of twenty-one years: I hope, that, the honourable inember for Eden-Monaro can fulfil that qualification{li) He must be a. subject of the King, either natural born or for at least five years naturalized under a law of the TJnited Kingdom or of the Commonwealth; (c) He must have been for three years at the least a resident within the limits nf the Commonwealth as existing at the time when he is chosen; and («-) He must be eitlier(i ) an elector entitled to vote at the election of members of the House of Representatives; or (ii) a person qualified to become such elector. Clause5 provides that the member representing the Australian Capital Territory shall not be entitled to vote on any question arising in the House of Representatives excepting on any motion for the disallowance of any ordinance of the Australian Capital Territory or on any amendment of any such motion. I shall refer to some of the problems with which the member for the Australian Capital Territory will have to deal. First, there is the necessity to' bring the planning of Canberra up to date. Some weeks ago the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) said that Canberra does not function as a city should, whilst the noted British town-planner, Sir Patrick Abercrornbie, remarked that Canberra is not a city at all but a combination of suburbs arranged in the form of a wheel. Sir Patrick Abercrombie also said that a town cannot function unless it is the centre of some industrial life. Next year. I propose to take the opportunity to deal in detail with the development of Canberra from a town-planner's point of view. At present the city is growing most rapidly around the railway station neat. . Kingston. It is an axiom of townplanning that growth cannot be prevented around a town's railway station. However, nothing is being done by thc authorities in Canberra to provide a civic square at Kingston. There was a good reason why no provision was made on the original plan for a square in that locality. The Griffin plan, which some honourable members regard as sacrosanct, contemplated that when the proposed railway from Yass to Jervis Bay, via the NationaI Capital was constructed the station would he at Civic Centre. I do not believe thai that railway will ever be constructed. A mighty work lies ahead of Canberra's first representative in this Parliament. 1 trust that he will have some knowledge",60,Second Reading

170,Mr Blain,"It was my intention tool' the principles of town-planning, ancl will strive to have Canberra developed on scientific principles, thus silencing for ever the nonsense that the Griffin plan is sacrosanct. Mi-. JOHNSON (Kalgoorlie-Minister for the Interior) [10.4] -in reply-The honourable meinber for Henty( Mr Gullett) commenced his speech by complimenting the Governinent for having introduced representation in this Parliament to the people of the Australian Capital Territory. The honourable inember did not keep to the complimentary vein for long, but turned his attention to a lot of irrelevant criticism, which, in his own interests, would have been better left unsaid, because he had no* justification for most of it . It was wide of the mark and not in accordance with facts, as was stated by the honourable memher for Eden-Monaro( Mr Fraser). I frankly admit that the representation to be given to the citizens of the Australian Capital Territory is limited and that the new member will have restricted rights in this assembly. But we are giving the people at least some representation and voice in the Parliament, whereas the anti-Labour parties, although they were in power for nearly 25 years before Labour assumed office, made no effort to give them any representation at all. The honourable member for Henty showed utter ignorance of the facts about Canberra. regulations and said that people were not allowed to build without the permission of the Department of the Interior. That is true, but that procedure is not confined to Canberra. The practice in every city and town in Australia is the same. municipality. locality a. person desires to erect any building, he must submit the plans to the local authority for its approval. The lionorable meniber for Eden-Monaro unmasked the honourable member for Henty when he declared that the latter had spoken as the proxy of some one outside. The honourable member for Henty was astray in what he said about tree planting and shops in Canberra. H is statement that the ownership of the Canberra shops is a government monopoly is absurd. W it h the exception of a section of a block at Civic Centre, which was built by the Government, all the shops in Canberra were built ancl are owned by private enterprise. Week after week, 1 receive deputations from people in Canberra asking me what I can do to break the monopoly that private enterprise holds in Canberra. That is the this legislation to give reply to the honourable gentleman's charge that the Government has built shops and holds the monopoly ownership of them. Another illustration of the fact that he spoke without knowing the facts was provided by his remarks about the need to vary the Griffin plan, a subject upon which the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Blain) also had something to say. Only recently the Government entertained at a dinner, which was attended by the Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Harrison) and the honourable member for In d i town-planner, Sir Patrick Abercrombie, who, in a speech, praised the Griffin plan and said that it made all the provision necessary for the establishment of a. great capital city that would be free from the congestion that disfigured other Australian capital cities. Unfortunately for tbe people of Australia generally, he did not spend much time in Canberra. Tbe Government would have been glad if he had been able to spend a He criticized the building few days in the city so that it could have benefited from his vast experience in town planning. What he said at the dinner, however, completely vindicated the Griffin plan. Another point of criticism was that the Government was building too many small houses in Canberra. I concede that that critiI t is the same in every cism has some justification: but what, was thc position that confronted the Government when it came into office? Owing to thc failure of our anti-Labour predecessors to provide housing for the citizens of Canberra when they had the opportunity to do so, we had. almost overnight, to create a huge organization to undertake the gigantic task of building homes for the people. So that we should make the best use of the available men and materials, we",61,Second Reading

The housing situa,tion in Canberra is a legacy left to us by past, administrations that ignored their duty to. public servants and other residents af the city. ""We are taking the first step towards breaking down the existing trade monopoly in Canberra by buildr ing "" corner"" shops. All. the matters that I have dealt with are really irrelevant, I suppose, because the purpose of the bill is to provide for the representation of the people of the Australian Capital Territory. Any irrelevancies were introduced by honourable gentlemen opposite, and, on behalf of the Government and the department that I administer, I could not let them remain unanswered.. The honourable memher for the Northern Territory said, I think, that a gentleman named tTlrich Ellis forced the Government to introduce this legislation. I have a list of the members of the first deputation to wait on the late Prime Minister, Mr Curtin, asking for. representation for the Territory, and Mr quoted, by him do not furnish any real Ellis's name is not on it. The deputation was led hy the honorahle member for Eden-Monaro. On behalf of the Government, Mr Curtin promised that the matter of the representation of the citizens of the Territory in the Parliament, would be investigated and that suitable action would be taken at the earliest possible moment. I am proud to be the Minister privileged to give effect to his promise. The members of the deputation were Mr A. D. Fraser, Dr. L. W. Nott, Mr K. J. Andrews,. Mrs. R. Stevenson, Sir Shakespeare, Mr A. Crawford and Mr government authorities. However, the S. Rhodes. Minister has completely misunderstood me. WhatI stated was that Mr Ulrich Ellis was the spotlight which focussed attention on the need to appoint an advisory council. ( Mr Lazzarini) -No point of order is involved, and the Minister may proceed with his speech, introduced it was welcomed hy the Oppotics are not available to me at the moment, sition, which undertook to co-operate in but I believe that the smallest constigiving effect to the Government's purpose tuencies, would be the.se of Tasmania, by supporting, the measure and proposing, any amendments which it. might, consider desirable. Therefore, I do not propose to delay the House much longer.

Canberra? number of Tasmanian electors is approximately 158,000. The honourable member for Indi mentioned the number of members of the House of Representatives and of senators elected to represent Tasmania, but he did not point out that the people of the Australian Capital Territory are not entitled to be represented in the Senate. For that reason the statistics basis of comparison. Certain honourable members criticized the lack of local government in the Australian Capital Territory, and I admit that in that respect the bill has some shortcomings. However, entirely different considerations are presented by the proposal to provide local government for the Australian Capital Territory from those which. obtain in constituencies in the various States. In the shires and municipalities in the States almost every citizen is required to pay rates to cover Robert Garran, Mr A.

Furthermore, it complies with the requests: made by very representative deputations which put the case for residents of. the Australian Capital Territory to the former Prime Minister, the late Mr Curtin, and also to the present Prime Minister( Mr Chifley). Both Ministers gave assurances that Labour would give to the people of Canberra representation in the National Parliament so that their grievances could be ventilated, and that was as far as the right honourable gentlemen believed they could go. I commend the bill to honourable members and I trust that before very long the Australian Capital Territory will qualify for representation by a member of the Parliament, who will be entitled not only to speak but also to vote on all matters concerning the National Capital, which has such a great future before it.

No honourable member wiO deny that it is our duty to furnish every possible assistance to Great Britain. We are mindful of the fact that our liberty is due in no small measure to the great sacrificesmade by the British people during the war and in the postwar period. Indeed, it is remarkable., having regard to the tremendous sacrifices made by Great Britain during thewar, that that country is still able and prepared to play a leading part in the rehabilitation of Western Europe. Great Britain's interests in Western Europe are very great. First, it. must encourage the rehabilitation of the trade of Europe, ancl in that it is playing its part handin-hand -with the United States of America.

As part of that arrangement, it.was provided that Great Britain should release, I think, the sum of £78,000,000 sterling r.o Western European countries, and, in addition, agree to unlock balances of sterling aggregating £55,000,000, which had previously been blocked, in accordance with arrangements 'between Great Britain and other countries. The fact that Great Britain was prepared, despite its desperate circumstances, to make .ivailable £133,000,000 sterling to the Western European countries to aid them in their rehabilitation, itself reflects Great Britain's belief in its ability to exto Australia. Under our arrangepand and endure. This proposed grant of £10,000,000 Australian currency to aid Great Britain has the complete approval of memhers on this side of the House. But it is not sufficient 'for us merely to approve. In terms of money, the grant is not sufficient. A mere £10,000,000 is but a drop in the total ocean of Britain's needs. If we are dealing only with the amount, I should say that £10,000,000 is insufficient, having regard to the problem that Great Britain has to face. I prefer to approach the matter, not so much from the point of view of currency as from what Australia can do to aid Great Britain. It is my belief-and I cannot imagine that this belief would not be shared by the Prime Minister( Mr develop the consequences of that course Chifley)-that increased production is the key of assistance to Great Britain, and the key of assistance in the rehabilitation of the countries of Western Europe. It is upon this particular aspect that Government policy has fallen down. Let us examine where we stand in terms of international currency, which has a bearing upon the economy of Australia. We are short of dollars. During the last twelve months we have been reducing the dollar deficit, which has always existed in the life of this country. Before the war, when sterling was readily convertible -to dollars, that matter presented no difficulty, but since dollars have become a hard currency of the world, and it is not possible to readily convert sterling to dollars, that is a real problem of this country ifr. Spender. countries, too. that, 'but I am concerned particularly with how we are to approach such a problem here. In the last twelve months, in terms of dollars, we have cut down our imports to such a level that .1 believe it can truthfully be said they are below our basic needs for production and the expansion of our own economy. We have reduced them to the lowest possible proportions, with, I think, very ser ions consequences to tlie economy of Australia. The question that arises from that is whether we propose to continue, indiefinitely, these restrictions, and if so, what will be the consequence ment with Great Britain as I understand it, that country desires Australia to live within its current income and, in short, is reluctant to see us draw upon the overseas balances of sterling which we have created. MJ-. CHIFLEY -That is the accumulated balances. stand to our credit. We are, therefore, confronted with the need to live within our current income, in respect of sterling, and also in respect of dollars, and to reduce our imports from, the dollar area-:. That has a veiy serious bearing upon our ability to produce. BeforeI go on to of action I shall make a few observations about tlie lag of production in this country, because that is of first-class importance. Our primary products may safely be said, taking the picture by and large The honourable member must limit his remarks to the measure being debated.

If he does not behave himself I shall name him. ud dress myself to the problems before ihis country. This bill is for the purpose of granting £10.000,000 to Great Britain to assist i lint country in its present economic crisis. I have read the Prime Minister's speech, in which he emphasized the needs nf the British people. The Prime Minister also referred to the economic crisis through which that country is passing, and stressed that it is the duty, and indeed, the privilege of Australia, to make a contribution to the Mother Countiy at this time. No one will quarrel with what the Prime Minister said in his speech or with the proposition that a grant is needed, any more than any one quarrelled with thc bill to grant £25,000,000 to Great Britain that was introduced last year. The problem of aid to Great Britain in its present economic crisis poses the question of the quality as well as the quantity of the aid that this country, as a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations, ought to give to the British people. I have spoken more than once in this House of the need for closer tribution to the solution of this problem. I have said that any contribution that vve make to aid Great Britain will also help us. If on no other ground, at any rate on the ground of self interest it is up to us f.o make the greatest possible contribution, in quality as well as quantity, to Great Britain. I believe, and I think my view is shared by the Prime Minister and almost every honourable member of this house, that in this crisis we stand or fall together. SinceI spoke on this subject on the last occasion I have been abroad. I went, as a private member, for the specinc purpose of trying to gather information from sources in the British Commonwealth, and particularly Great Britain, on how best we can help the Britisli people in their crisis, and, by conversations with public men and others in that country, to discover what we can do to get closer together.

One becomes surer sti 11 that by doing so we shall it. The United States of America has make a contribution to the welfare of this country as well as that of Great Britain. I should imagine that no one will argue that Great Britain does not require assistance. The crisis through which the British people are passing is not one that has suddenly descended upon them. Some of us think of what we call the dollar crisis of the TJnited Kingdom Government as something extraordinary, accidental and new. But it is a truism to say that from the very that the industrial. revolution developed in the United Kingdom and changed it from a primary producing country to a country with great secondary industries, and crisis with which it is now faced began to develop. Directly its production so its population began to expand in accordance with not unknown economic and eugenic laws. When its population expanded, its production began to increase still further. As its production and national wealth increased, it began to send its surplus wealth overseas and make investments in other countries. That is the origin of what we now refer to as Great Britain's foreign investments. Although most people probably did not recognize it at the time, many of us now .know that from the moment when Great Britain began to invest large amounts of surplus capital in Argentina, the United States of America, Canada, Australia aud other countries, it began, in one sense, to dig a grave for itself, because the very act of investing large sums of money abroad stimulated the trade of those countries and enabled them to enter into competition with it. The essence of what we may call the British economic system, which functioned admirably for nearly 100 years, is that there shall be take as well as give. The great thing about that system was that it worked. It did so because Great Britain did not close its doors. It traded freely with other conntries and admitted their products in exSir. Beale. change for its own goods. There is a striking distinction between the British economic system, which underpinned the economy of the world for almost 100 years, and the system that has superseded not been willing, or, shall I say, has not yet acquired sufficient wisdom, to trade freely with the rest of the world. It is learning its lesson in the hard way. It has tried to ameliorate the difficulties that have developed from its insistence on one-way trade by means of loans of one kind or another, but the fact is that while it says that it wants to sell its goods to other countries it does not want to accept goods from those countries. Hence, there has arisen what we call the moment dollar crisis. This problem, which has now developed into a roaring crisis, was brought to a head by the violent impact of two world wars upon the British economic system. Partly during the first of those wars and certainly during the second one, Britain began to increase, was obliged to spend its external credits. To save the world in 1940 and 1941, it sold £2,000,000,000 of its foreign investments. The enormous income derived from those investments .had enabled Britain to bridge the gap between its import and export trade and to balance its budget. On top of that, certain x other crises developed. One of them was the uncalculated ancl perhaps incalculable fact that Europe did not recover after the war. Most economists thought that trade would develop in Europe when hostilities ended, that its economy would return to working order and that Germany, Erance and Italy would be in a position to buy goods from British manufacturers. Owing to the vast and unthought-of disorganization caused hy the war, that rehabilitation did not take place. That was an additional factor that struck at the British economy and caused it to quiver and shake and almost crumble away. Faced with that situation, the British people have had to take extraordinary measures. They have had to deny themselves in a way that no people ever expected to become necessary. They have had to reduce their purchases from abroad. Because of the nature of their economic organization, they still find it necessary to buy most of their food from abroad. Tbey have had to cut down on those purchases and ration themselves. Being short of machine tools, and enormously short of capital equipment, they are now in the position, in Kipling's words, of trying to rebuild their economy with worn-out tools. They have had to try to restore their manufacturing industries and sell their products abroad in order to obtain enough money to enable them to buy the things which their industries have needed. The situation has been aggravated by the fact that the European countries have not been able to buy their goods and that the TJnited States of America, for what might well be said to be understandable reasons although one may not agree with them, has not been willing to buy British goods in exchange for American goods. Thus, Great Britain has found itself short of capital goods, desperately in need of food which normally it does not produce but brings from abroad, and with a gravely disordered European neighbour which, as the Prime Minister has said, it has found necessary to under-pin by means of its own extraordinary efforts. All of these circumstance have created a crisis which nobody could have contemplated and which has put Great Britain in a more economically unsound and disordered position than it has ever been in before or, please God, will ever be in again. It is uot enough for us in Australia merely to nod our heads and say, "" That is too bad, but we cannot do anything about it "" . Upon the premise with which I began my speech, I say that we stand or fall together in this crisis. That applauded him. I have mentioned is why, I believe, the Government has seen fit to bring down this bill, and why we must give not only this very modest degree of aid but also greater aid in terms of both quantity and quality. The British people have made extraordinary efforts on their own behalf. I noticed only a month or so ago, when I was in England, that British exports had risen 40 per cent, above the pre-war level. Considering that it is making its effort, as I have said, with worn-out tools, that is a very courageous and magnificent effort. I had the privilege to attend the trade union congress at Margate at the invitation of a member of the trade mi union movement of Great Britain. At that gathering, I listened to a speech by Sir Stafford Cripps, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, answering a series of resolutions which had been placed upon the notice-paper of the congress by the trade unions, which were represented by over 1,000 delegates assembled in the hall at Margate. All of those resolutions demanded greater returns from the proceeds of industry. They sought increases of wages and a diminution of dividends. I well remember how Sir Stafford Cripps entered the hall at eleven o'clock on that morning and commenced to speak dispassionately, without any window-dressing or propaganda. The theme of his remarks was: "" There is only a certain sized cake. If you want a bigger share of the cake, you must make a bigger cake."" He pointed out that dividends declared by public corporations in Great Britain in the previous year had amounted to approximately £300,000,000 and that salaries and wages paid by the same corporations over the same period amounted to over £4,000,000,000. As a matter of arithmetic, he explained that, if every worker in the community.shared equally in the distribution of 25 per cent, of the dividends of those corporations, a diminution which he said would be ruinous and unthinkable, the return to each one would be no more than 4d. in the £1. Therefore he said, "" If you want a bigger slice of cake, you must make a bigger cake "". It is a tribute not only to the personality of Sir Stafford Cripps, but also to the 1,000 delegates who listened to him, that, when he finished his speech, the audience rose as one man and that incident in order fco indicate that the courage and resolution of the British people in this crisis have been nothing less than superb. Therefore, anything that we can do in Australia to aid them, qualitatively or quantitatively, will be to our honour. What can we do ? We should not look at this problem only from the point of view of the need for a mere cash contribution. We should realize that the best sort of contribution that we can make to the recovery of Great Britain is a closer integration of our own political and economic efforts with those of Great Britain. matter of external affairs or the relations between the various units of the British Commonwealth, but as a matter of Australia's specific relations with Great Britain in a specific crisis. There are plenty of illustrations on all hands of the disintegration of the relations between Great Britain and the various units which we have been accustomed to think of as forming the British Commonwealth. As all honourable members know, it is an undoubted fact that one unit, Eire, does not exist any longer as a unit of the British Commonwealth. We have also received indications recently that India, Pakistan, South Africa and Canada are in some respects drifting away from Great Britain. Those are elements of what wo might call disintegration. hand in Australia, and also in New Zealand, we have units which do not show signs of drifting away from "" the British system "", as Paul Maguire so well calls' it. WhatI mean by the British system is tbe system under which certain units are not foreign to one another. All members of the British Commonwealth, of course, are independent nations in one sense, but in another sense they are not foreign to each other. We have common aims, and a common interest in pursuing those aims. Australia has not only a duty but also a great opportunity to walk closely hand in hand with Great Britain in relation to economic, political, financial, defensive and trade matters in such a way as to restore the economy, the prestige, and the power of the Mother country and, at the same time, restore and enhance our own power. As Australians in an Australian Parliament, our fundamental purpose must of course, be to increase onr own power ancl prestige. My thesis is hut the most effective way in which we can do so is by a closer integration of ou«efforts which those of the other countries constituting British Empire, but especially with Great Britain. As an illustration of how we can more closely integrate our efforts with those of Great Britain to our mutual advantage, I should like to see established in units of the British Commonwealth. \ustralia relations. I should like to see in this House a Minister for Commonwealth relations working either in co-ordination with Mr Heale. I am treating this, not as a or in subordination to the Prime Minister or the Minister for External Affairs. It should be the principal task of a Minister for Commonwealth relations to ensure the closest co-ordination between Australia ancl Great Britain, and the other units of the British Empire. Such a Minister should know what is happening in all departments at any particular time. have to travel? meinber for Martin( Mr Daly), who is known by a well-known sobriquet because of his travelling activities The honourable member must return toOn the other the bill. ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker, prevents me from making an appropriate answer to the honourable member's interjection. lionorable member must return to the bill. for Martin has asked whether such a.

Mr Deputy Speaker, with some bewilderment. We could make the best possible contribution towards the recovery -of Great Britain, upon which our own, strength and future so greatly -depend, by having the right sort of personalities exchanged between the two countries. It isa sine qua non of proper and effective relations with -Great Britain that there should he a proper exchange of the right sort of -officials between Great Britain and Australia. As an Australian, I believe that officials of the British Government have .a great deal to learn from this country, just as we have a great deal to learn from them. The Minister for Supply and 'Development (Senator Armstrong) has -stated that not once in our history has a British Prime Ministei' or former Primo Minister visited Australia. If that be true, it is a great pity. Australia may be -only a speck in the ocean, or a drop in -the world bucket, as it were, but I believe it to be a great pity that Ministers of the British Parliament and high officials do '.not visit this country. The honourable member is trying to get in .a number of matters which are not related to the bill. The legislation deals specifiby an exchange of officials who deal -oally with a proposal to make a monetary .grant to Great Britain. The debate -should be limited to that subject, and whether the amount is sufficient or insufficient. The honorahle member may not continue to debate matters which 'have no relation to the bill. -in anything. the honourable member that he will not -succeed in his efforts. make a constructive contribution to the problem of how we can make our best -contribution to the recovery and welfare -of Great Britain. The Prime Minister's -speech on this bill covers many of the matters with which I have been dealing. I believe that our best contribution to the recovery of Great Britain can be made by means other than a gift of money. With great respect, Mr Deputy Speaker, I suggest that the Chair cannot rule that L may not discuss any matter other than the grant of money. orable member must confine his remarks to the bill. of money, the most effective contribution that we can make to the recovery of Great Britain is by co-ordinating our activities more closely with Great Britain than vve have in the past. Eor your guidance, Mr Deputy Speaker, may I illustrate how this co-ordination may be achieved? The Minister for Immigration ( Mr Calwell) is very properly agitated over the small population of this country, and is doing his utmost to attract British migrants here. The best way to achieve that objective is by an exchange of officials with Great Britain on the right level. We have not done so in the past. The honourable member is endeavouring to return to a subject which, the Chair has already ruled, is not related to the bill. sations that I had while I was abroad, I am persuaded that one of the most important contributions that we can make to the recovery and welfare of Great Britain is with matters of common interest. We should endeavour to effect exchanges of officials of the right sort and with the right personalities. There are many matters arising out of this debate to which I should like to refer, hut I confess that your rulings, Mr Deputy Speaker, are almost as inhibiting to me as they were to the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender). orable member must not reflect on the rulings of thc Chair. If he has any views on the bill, he should express them while he has the opportunity to do so. He will not have that opportunity for very long if he continues in the present strain.",69,Second Beadino

Great Britain is not merely a nation of 45,000,000 or 50,000,000 people living in a misty island in the North Sea. That nation has developed a great colonial empire with possessions dotted in extremely favorable strategic positions all over the world. It was because of their strategic value that those possessions were chosen by the statesmen and rulers of years gone by. Great Britain and its colonies and possessions have at their disposal vast resources of raw materials, which are more profuse and better distributed than are those of any other country. One often hears of the greatness of the TJnited States of America. I venture to suggest that geologists, demographers, and scientists who study these matters, could tell us clearly and truly that the raw materials of Great Britain and its colonies, and the members of the British Commonwealth, are greater than those of the TJnited States of America or of any other country or group of countries. That is an additional reason why we should stand together and not say ""Britain is finished; let us wipe her"". We should accept the plain, blunt, economic as well as patriotic fact, that not only our welfare, but also our very existence as a nation of only 7,000,000 people, depend upon our association with Great Britain. . We should not permit our foreign policy, trade policy, or economic policy to deviate by one hair's breadth from that agreed upon with the TJnited Kingdom. tribution of £10,000,000 towards the solution of Great Britain's sterling problem-it is a sterling problem as well as a dollar problem-is , as the Prime Minister has pointed out, as only a drop in the bucket. Above all financial considerations, we require complete co-ordination with the TJnited Kingdom and that can be achieved only by exchanging officials of the right type, closer trade and relations, a free interchange of ideas and agreement on questions of policy. Only in that way can we make a worthwhile, effective, and ultimately, triumphant contribution to the recovery of the TJnited Kingdom as well as to our own welfare. adjourned. That the House do now adjourn. I bring to the notice of the Government a matter of very grave importance to the farming industry of New South Wales. I direct the attention of the House to the manner in which a deputation arranged by the Wholesale Co-operative Society of New South Wales through Mr George Booth, member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for Kurri, was received on the 4th November last by the Minister for Shipping and Euel (Senator Ashley). On the 23rd September last, I asked a question in this chamber relating to the reduction of imports of power kerosene, lighting kerosene, and distillate. For the year ending the 31st March, 1949, the quantity of power kerosene that the oil companies are permitted to sell in Australia has been reduced hy 59,528 tons or 19.9 per cent., lighting kerosene by 29,290 tons or 25.8 per cent., and distillate by 2,394 tons or 2.1 per cent, compared with the actual sales for the year ended the 31st March, 1948. You will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, that when I raised this matter in the House some weeks ago, there was a slight disagreement between us. I shall not refer to that matter now, but the rural cooperative societies in New South Wales This conare alarmed at the reduction of imports. Those societies have a wide membership. According to the New South Wales Pocket Year Booh for 1948, the number of active societies in New South Wales in 1944-45 was as follows:Number. .Members.

226,Mr Abbott (New England) [11.7j.,"Members of those societies are mostly working people. Following my question in this chamber, representations that I made to the Prime Minister on behalf of the co-operative societies, and representations made by Mr Booth, M.L.A., who is also chairman of the Wholesale Co-operative Society of New South Wales, it was arranged that a deputation should meet the Minister for Shipping and Puel on the 4th November last concerning that meeting. I have received the following letter from Mr Doak, seeretaiy of the Tamworth Farmers Co-operative Society Limited who was a member of the deputation:Please find enclosed a copy of the discussion that took place at the meeting between the co-operative societies ancl the Minister for Supply and Shipping on Thursday last at the office of the Minister. Hie remarks were definitely uncalled for and insulting. We felt that he could have shown a little manners and at least listened to what we had to say, but he didn't want to hear a thing and opened his door for us to go four times in a space of twenty minutes, which was the time we spent with him. There were no recorded minutes, but thc copy enclosed is fairly close to detail ae to what was said and can be used by you as you wish. I shall also quote from a letter written to the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) by one of the leading Labour supporters in the City of Tamworth. The address given is Peel-street, Tamworth, and the writer is well known to the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Scully). It is dated the 24th September, 1948, and statesThe quota scheme recently announced, and made retrospective to April, has created very great consternation and indignation amongst the farmers in this area of the State. I pass along to you the following comments in good faith with the idea that you might have a very thorough inquiry instituted to see whether some of the (so-termed major companies have been granted favours at the expense of the Ampol Company. . . . very, sincerely suggested that the quota system is a result ot such influence. . . . That is the influence of the larger oil City Council since 1925, plays golf and companiesUnless thc matter is handled to the satisand faction of the farmers, the outcry will develop address is 669 Burke-road, Toorak. into a very unpleasant set up. I propose now to read some of the remarks made by the Minister to the depuwhether he knows anything about oil, or tation which waited on him on the 4th whether it was because he lived in Toorak, November. Members of the deputation was a memher of the Athenaeum ancl were Mr Sims, representing Curlewis and Gunnedah; Mr Endicott, representing Nelungaloo; Mr Duprez, representing Manilla; Mr Tome, representing Inverell; Mr Doak, representing Tamworth, and Mr Bawden, representing Narrabri and Bellata. The record, that I -have received of what was said at that meeting with the Minister is as follows:Mr Sims introduced the deputation to Senator Ashley and stated that it represented 54 co-operative societies and the interests of the farmers generally. ( Mr Sims took the place of Mr Booth, M.L.A., who arranged the deputation ancl who was absent through illness.) Senator ASHLEY -Let us be f r a n k I havo not time to listen to propaganda, It is Ampol you are representing? Mr Sims endeavoured to explain the case but was continually interrupted by Senator Ashley and explanation was impossible. Senator ASHLEY -You are here as a deputation from Ampol to get an increase in their quota. I can tell you now that Ampol IB going to get nothing from me. Co-operative (consisting of 800 farmers), not Ampol, and I would like some message to take back to the farmers. No reply to this from Senator Ashley Senator Ashley said he though we wore there to state individual cases, and had he known this was not so, he would not have received ns He went on to say, "" Y o u have the wrong story "". you tell us the Tight story. Senator ASHLEY If you interview Sir George Wales, he will tell you the right story. This has been discussed with him and he knows all about it and he agrees with me. He will be in Sydney this week. I do not know what Sir George Wales has to do with the Government or why he should be delegated to reply to a deputation representing rural co-operatives. According to "" Who's Who"", he was knighted in 1937, is a former member of It is the Legislative Council of Victoria, was Lord Mayor of Melbourne from 1934 to 1937, has been a member of the Melbourne billiards, belongs to the Athenaeum Club the Savage Club, and his His business associations are not. mentioned, and the book does not say",71,Adjournment Distillat Eand Kerosene
