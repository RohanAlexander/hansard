0,"House Of Representatives. Thursday, S3 November, 191^. Took The Choir At 2.30 P.m., And Read Prayers. Minister Read In This Morning's Press The Statement Reported To Have Been Made In Washington By Senator Keane, That Aus","tralia wants to secure Britons, Americans and Scandinavians as migrants, but fears that Great Britain and Scandinavia will require to retain all their men to rebuild their own countries ? Is it the policy of the Government to limit migrants to those who may come from Britain and Scandinavia; and ifit be unlikely that those countries will be able to spare migrants, is tion officer mentioned by the honourable the Government sincere in its proposals ? ported statement read by the honourable member, I have no doubt that Senator Keane, realizing the importance of a scientific and well-planned migration policy for Australia, was giving a gentle hint to Americans that we would welcome for settlement in this dominion in the post-war period some of the best elements of the American community, such as those who have proved themselves to be such gallant comrades of Australians in the fighting in the islands to the north of Australia. Senator Keane is quite conversant with the Government's policy, decisions and attitude in the direction of welcoming migration by, preferably, ex-servicemen from the British Isles, and orphan children of British servicemen. Probably Senator Keane has read the statements that have been made by public men from Great Britain who have visited Australia, to the effect that, unfortunately, Great Britain will not he able to spare very many of its people for settlement in any other country after the war; having such a big post-war reconstruction programme to undertake, it will need to keep practically all of its people. I have read some of those statements. I assure the honourable gentleman that the Government is proceeding with its planning for a comprehensive and scientific post-war migration policy. The planning will be carried to the blue-print stage, so that the scheme may be put into operation immediately upon the cessation of hostilities. ask the Acting Prime Minister whether the Government's interest in post-waT migration is to he judged by the appointment of a junior as immigration officer at a salary scarcely in excess of that of a ministerial chauffeur, or is it intended to make a more suitable appointment in order to attract immigrants to this country? salaries of many public servants are decided by the Public Service Arbitrator, and that special appointments are made on the recommendation of the chairman of the Public Service Board. I am not aware of the salary paid to the immigramember, but I shall have inquiries made, and consideration will be given to the suggestion that his salary should be increased. COAL-MINING INDTJiSTRY. conference at Washington, Senator Keane is reported to have said that the coalminers of Australia had done a magnificent job. I ask the Acting Prime Minister to state whether Senator Keane was speaking for himself or for the Government. If he was speaking for himself, does the right honourable gentleman endorse the statement, which is calculated",4,Setup

6,Mr Ryan,"In the course of a pressto encourage the Australian coal-miners in their very thoughtless attitude towards the community of Australia as a whole? statement reported to have been made by Senator Keane, but I know that he is a very intelligent man who makes forthright statements according to his beliefs. He probably had in mind the record low production of coal while the Menzies Government was in office, and compared it with the record high production that has been attained during the period of office of the present Government, as well as the aggregate production of the last three years with that of the previous three years, in order to show that the record under the present Administration has been infinitely better than it was under the last Administration. Prime Minister see the statement in the Sydney Morning Herald this morning that the miners at one coal-mine went on strike because one of them had to stand in a bus for fifteen minutes when travelling to work? ""Will the right honourable gentleman send to those miners a copy of his statement on the maltreatment of Australian prisoners of war in Malaya, especially that part relating to the fact that men were compelled' to work eighteen hours a day and for trivial offences the men had been compelled to stand for hours holding over their heads heavy blocks of wood, in order that the miners may be made ashamed of their traitorous conduct? read the newspapers this morning, but I 3hall peruse the Sydney Morwng Herald and other journals as soon as possible. The honourable member may rest assured that every consideration will be given to his request. Minister if it is a fact that in the State of New South Wales ten coal mines were idle yesterday? If so, does the right honorable gentleman regard this as evidence that the decisions made at the conferences held at Canberra on Monday are not to be observed ? If so, what action is proposed to ensure that the law shall be enforced ruthlessly, as the Government assured the general public it would be? report on the coal-mining industry to-day, but I do know that on Tuesday the number of mines idle in New South Wales was only half the number that were idle on Monday. Prime Minister read the statement published in the Melbourne Age of the 2nd November, headed "" Strike Losses in War Time"", that, according to figures issued by the British Ministry for Labour, the present year has been the worse year of the war in Britain for strikes; that up to the 30th September, 3,291,000 working days had been lost compared with 1,153,000 for the first nine months of last year; and that the rise was almost entirely due to coal strikes? In the opinion of the right, honourable gentleman, is this an indication that even that eminent statesman, Winston Churchill, has found this problem almost unsolvable, and has not been any more successful in dealing with it than has the present Australian Government? It indicates that a war neurosis is operating in all the countries that are engaged in an all-in war effort. Industrial stoppages are deplorable. It is evident that, even in Great Britain and the United States of America, there are industrial stoppages despite the efforts of the authorities to have them eliminated. Minister whether or not the average loss of shifts among the coal-miners of Great Britain was less than two shifts a man last year, whereas in Australia it was nineteen shifts a man. Can the right honourable gentleman explain why the considerations to which he has referred as affecting, .the coal-miners in the State of New South Wales do not affect the coalminers in the other States of the Commonwealth ? man has made an assertion which I do not know to be a fact. I do not try to justify stoppages in the coal-mining industry, or any other industry, at the present time. They are to be deplored. The representatives of both the coal-miners and the coalmine owners were told that, at the conferences that were held at Canberra last Monday.",4,Migration

I assure the honourable member that all statements made by the Prime Minister will be taken into consideration before any decisions are made. MR. FRANK GOLDBERG. for Information say whether it is correct, as has been reported, that Mr Frank Goldberg, an advertising manager of Sydney, is being given an official appointment in the United States of America by the Department of Information? If so, what salary is to be paid to him, and what are the conditions of his appointment'? Did he receive a travel priority, and iÂ« the Commonwealth paying his steamer fare or other expenses? not received any official appointment in the Department of Information. The Government is not paying his steamer fare or other expenses, nor were travel priorities, arranged for him. The Government is not committed to him in any way in respect of an offer he made to me, just before leaving for the United States of America, to try to help Australia while he was in that country. Mr Goldberg is visiting the United States of America for business reasons. He asked me whether he could do anything to help the Australian war effort while he was abroad, and -whether he could assist in regard to migration, post-war trade and the tourist traffic. I told him that the facilities of my department in Washington wmld be available to.assist him, and he said that he would present the Government with a report when he returned to Australia. Beyond that, there is no berg. Any story that he has been appointed to my department for service in fact. Prime Minister gave an undertaking to arrange for a conference before the end of the year' between representatives ot rural producers and the Government in order to formulate plans for the export trade after the war.

I shall be glad to discuss it with the honourable member if he will bring it to my notice. I understand that many other communications are being received by honourable members on the subject of banking. That statement will be taken into consideration with others. whether it is a fact that the commercial banks are circulating their managers instructing them to point out to customers, and others with whom they may come in contact socially, the detrimental effect of the present banking regulations upon the public, and that each manager is required to furnish a weekly report on the matter to his head office? Is it not a fact that the regulations were framed for the purpose of furthering the country's war effort? Does not the Treasurer believe that this action by the private banks amounts to party political propaganda? to my notice a number of letters sent to the customers of private banks, and those letters contain statements, which, in my opinion, are intended to mislead customers. I have seen copies of circulars which have been sent by the private banks to their managers, and these indicate that a campaign is being waged by the private banks to mislead the public into the belief that the banking proposals of the Government, which are to come before this Parliament later, will be detrimental to their interests. Such statements are entirelv inaccurate. Treasurer prepared to answer all the letters which honourable members receive on the subject of the Government's banking proposals ?

Five honourable members hairing risen in support of the motion, step in order that honourable members may have an opportunity to discuss the important announcement that was made in a special statement by the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Forde) yesterday. That announcement was in substance to the effect that the Government was proposing to bring down at a future session legislation to take over the civil interstate airlines of Australia, and it was, therefore, the first announcement of wide interest in relation to the carrying out of a Socialist policy. To-day, questions were put to the right honourable gentleman in order to get further information about this proposal, and I say right away that, as I listened to him yesterday, I thought it was a strange and irresponsible thing to be saying months ahead that certain businesses were to be taken over without",11,Industrial Unrest

97,Mr Menzies,"I have taken thisany regard whatever for what may happen to those businesses in the intervening period' or to the interests of the public they serve, but my feeling in that matter has been reinforced by the attitude of the right honourable gentleman when .questioned to-day. First, he was asked whether he would table for the information of honourable members the report of the interdepartmental committee, which, as every honourable gentleman knows, sat for a long time and investigated the future of civil aviation in Australia. It is no secret that -purpose, a bald announcement is made that committee was carrying on its operations and it is no secret that a great numopposite who applaud the Government's ber of people concerned in civil flying in Australia gave their views to it. One can only assume that the committee was set up in order that the Government might have the advantage of some objective examination of this matter on its merits by people whose official position put them in the way of finding out the facts. When the right honourable gentleman was asked to provide information to this Parliament, and, through this Parliarnent, to the people of Australia, whose money, after all, is involved in the expropriation of those airlines, and when asked to table the report, his answer was: "" Oh, this is a purely private document for Cabinet"" -and I suppose, following practice, for the information of caucus-""it is not a document designed for presentation to the Parliament"". This is an extraordinary thing. I would not mind if people were consistent; but this Government has made a fine practice of producing departmental reports whenever those reports have suited it. minutes, whenever their production suited the Government. But on this occasion, the attitude of the Government is, "" Oh, we are eminently correct. We do not produce the document"". Wc all know why the Government does not produce the document, and it is a great pity that the public will not have an opportunity to read it. The second question which was put to the Acting Prime Minister to-day, and which elicited, a curious answer, was aa follows:"" What is the estimated capital cost of taking over these airlines ? "" That, after all, is a matter of importance. It may not be the last determining factor, but the people of Australia, when they are presented with a proposal to socialize an industry, are at least entitled to know whether an estimate has been made of the cost of doing so; and it is perfectly clear, from the attitude of the right honourable gentleman, that no estimate has been made at all. All that has happened is that suddenly, in the middle of a session of Parliament, and in the absence of the two most significant Ministers for this for the benefit of those honourable members proposal, that the airlines are to be taken over. high principle. of principle, I agree, but. whether it is high principle depends upon whether one is using the word in its sense of elevation or its olfactory sense. I desire to make, in the very limited time at my disposal, five comments on this remarkable proposal. The first of them is that the proposal is unquestionably in accordance with socialist policy. That is entirely intelligible, and those honourable members on the other side of the House who believe in socialism will be delighted with the announcement. But it can hardly be said that the proposal is in harmony with the vote just given by the Australian people. It is very difficult to believe that the recent referendum could have resulted as it did, if a majority of the people of Australia really desired the Government to have power to go into business. Yet the first fruit of. the resounding defeat, of the Government at the referendum, is the production of an extensive measure of socialist enterprise in this country. My second point, is that, the whole proposal is a piece of arrant political confiscation. It is quite true that the Acting Prime Minister, in his short speech, said that the assets of the airline companies would be taken over on fair and just terms. That has almost become a sort of cant phrase. But what are the assets that will be taken over? It is worth asking that question, because the companies in Australia have done work in air pioneering that no government",12,Airlines Formal Motion For Adjournment

101,Mr Menzies,"It is a statementhas attempted to do. Their assets consist partly of plant and equipment, a great deal of which is now growing old in the service under war conditions, and partly of goodwill. But the irony of this 'natter is that these companies have been going through their pioneering days. Their shareholders have met their losses. They have gone through all the literal pains of pioneering air services. from the Government. live, to some extent, on subsidies from the Crown; but just as the time is coming when civil aviation will be able to exist in saying, because I propose to quote from its own strength and when unsubsidized civil aviation will turn out to be not only a great service to the people but also a profitable investment, the Government steps in and says, "" At this point of time we shall take over what you have, and the benefit of your pioneering work. We cannot pay you for it and we will not pay you for it but we shall take over your plant and let you go "". That, I describe as a simple piece of confiscation. My third comment is that this method, So far from helping air development in Australia, will stultify it. I know that some honourable gentlemen on the other side of the House believe that a condition of progress is to abolish competition. But very few people in this world really believe that. In air matters above all matters, we have been shown the contrary by all the events of the last few years. It was open competition, not government enterprise, in the United States of America, for example, which produced the Douglas airliner and enabled the greatest step forward in civil aviation to occur. It was open competition in Great Britain that gave us the Hurricane and the Spitfire and so on up to the Lancaster, and enabled us to avoid defeat in the most vital period of this war. It is the spirit and practice of free enterprise in the civil aviation field that gave to Australia its civil air services and enabled it to survive all the risks and disappointments involved in the establishment of air services at a time when they were regarded as a very dangerous novelty. ' My fourth comment is that this is a irne when the Government should be building up the strength of private enterprise> because private enterprise will have the major share of the work of reconstruction in Australia. I say that now: but I have said it many times and on many platforms. during the depression! it too soon. I know that the Minister for Home Security( Mr Lazzarini) occupies a position of some ambiguity in the Cabinet on banking, but I do not want him to get into holts with the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) about what I am now a speech which his leader made last August at the time when the referendum was in the airTlie Government recognizes that while there is a place for the expansion of public enterprise in industry, it must look in the post-war period primarily to private enterprise to provide for industrial development and to give employment to the industrial population. That is a very clear and very sound statement, It is not what I would call a statement of Socialist belief. It is what I call good Liberal philosophy. Later, the Prime Minister saidIndustry must be enterprising, ingenious and determined, ready to attack excessive costs and inefficiencies wherever they may appear. Continuous scientific investigation of the problems of industry, and continuous application of the results are required. There in two sentences we have the case, not for the crushing of private enterprise in the post-war period, but for the enlarging of private enterprise, and for strengthening and restoring i i , because in this country, and indeed in every other democratic country, it is the largest single arm that we have in reconstructing our affairs) and the fortunes of our country. Yet. at a time when that is so abundantly trite, this announcement is made and a blow is aimed at private enterprise in an industry in which enterprise is of all things the most significant and the most necessary. Clearly, this announcementwill be followed by others. Are there no "" Hear, hears"" from the government benches? What a pity! I was sure that thi.s announcement was to he followed by others. I await with interest the future decisions that will be made. WÂ° have'had an announcement on civil aviation; I suppose we shall have one on",13,Airlines Formal Motion For Adjournment

This kind of policy and this kind of announcement, made, and .to he made, will weaken inevitably the confidence and security that must 'be felt by those who engage in business and invest in business if business is to be able to take up the task of employing hundreds of thousands of peop'le when the war is over. Occasionally, a good deal is said by Ministers about reviving at the appropriate time the willingness of people to invest in industry, and, apparently as a first encouragement they now turn to an industry in which people have invested money with great courage, in which people have conducted public services with great courage, and in which at 'last there is some sign of reward for efficiency, and say, ""We shall confiscate your assefs. We may give you some money to compensate you, 'out we do not know how much it will be. That matter has not been considered yet. We shall encourage people to invest in and develop other industries which will be vital to Australia's future "". I shall say one last thing in my limited time; if this Government's conception of the future progress of Australia is that it can be attained by providing comfortable government jobs for all, which is, after all, the true Socialist doctrine. God help this country ! If the 7,000,000 people are to survive in this country, they should not be imlbued with such comfortable doctrines of life as that; they should possess all the qualities of enterprise, work, imagination, and self reliance, and socialism .cuts across all these. In the case of the civil airlines, T fear that we .shall live to see socialism's had the Leader of the Opposition and most damaging results. Prime Minister and Acting Minister vernment has made its decision on the for Defence) [3.38] I am not surmerits of the casea decision that we prised at the action taken by the believe ito be in the best interests of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) in moving the adjournment of the House to discuss this matter, because by doing so, he reveals himself in his true rale, namely, as a champion of big business and great vested interests in this .country as against the MiitereSits of the people. It is only natural that he should have supporting him in this action a galaxy of political talent, noted for its wholehearted support of vested interests-in terests that are the backbone of the Opposition parties. I make no apology for what the Government has done. In my memory, there has never been a proposal before Cabinet wihich has had more careful consideration, o<r the sarnie unanimous appiwal as this, in fact, it was the unanimous .decision of the full Cabinet. It was out of .consideration for all the interests concerned-w e aire not unaware of the fact that .control of a great public to do so, utility such as this is a very important question, transcending, at least so far as tiie Government is concerned, the realm of party polities-that this announcement was made. The Leader of the Opposition knows quite well that for some time all the interests engaged in civil as'iatiom in Australia have been pressing itiic Government for a declaration of its policy towards this industry. Frequently we have 'been asked, "" Why do you wait any longer before making a statement"". As honourable members are aware my colleague tbe Minister for Air and Minister for Civil Aviation( Mr Dr.a'keford), who is at present in the United States of America, was asked questions frequently in this House. Also there were numerous deputations to him from interested companies, and many -requests for a proclamation of Government policy. They said, "" Why allow the companies and people to remain in doubt?"". Well, God knows nobody is in doubt any longer. Apparently the gravamen of the charge against the Government is that the decision went the wrong way. No doubt his colleagues been on this 6ide of the chamber, the decision would have been",14,Airlines Formal Motion For Adjournment
106,. Mr Eorde (Capricornia,"Acting in favour of vested interests. The Gonation. It is a historic and momentous decision, and one on which the Government will stand. The complaint that there should have been prior notification of this decision is without justification. This early notification will serve as a clear indication to the airline operators that the services which they now run are to he nationalized. It represents due notification of Government policy, and will obviate the acceptance by the companies of further contractual obligations which might increase considerably the value of the assets to be acquired, and further complicate the acquisition of these public utilities when the time arrives. Had a statement not been made at this juncture, the private companies would have had reason to believe that they were to be permitted to carry on and expand and develop their undertakings. It would have been most unfair to these people and to the people of Australia had the Government not announced its decision aÂ» soon as it was made, and where could it be better announced than in this Parliament. Once again this afternoon the old bogy of the *' socialistic tiger "" has been raised. Whilst the Leader of the Opposition may have succeeded in convening in Canberra a largely attended conference of representatives of all the bits and pieces of defeated political parties in Australia, and in giving them a new name, he has not succeeded in putting forward any new propaganda against the Labour party. I remind the right honourable gentleman that 40 years ago, even greater men than he, such as the late Sir George Reid, demonstrated their great histrionic talent complete with table-thumping, in their efforts to paint glowing pictures of the evils of socialism which would result should the Labour party be ever trusted to govern. The same performance was repeated when the establishment of the Bank was proposed by the Eisher Government in 1910-13. of the proposal claimed that there was no need for a Commonwealth Bank; carry on all the banking required in this country without unreasonable ference with its rights and privileges. Mr Forde. It was said, "" This bank is doomed to failure. This nation cannot carry on banking successfully"". It was also said that the notes to be issued would be known as "" Fisher's flimsies"" and that Â£1 notes would be worth only 5s. each. Propaganda of the same sort in relation to interstate airways is being indulged in to-day. honourable gentleman may not engage in n dissertation on banking. of criticism that was then used. It is being used to-day, when the Government proposes to take over a great public utility in the interests of the people of Australia. A canard has been circulated to the effect that the decision of the Government was taken behind the backs of the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) and the Minister for Civil Aviation( Mr Drakeford). The fact is that the Minister for Civil Aviation was a member of the Cabinet suib-committee which dealt with the matter. Indeed, it was his agendum, and his name appears at the foot of it. It was prepared by him and his department after a searching investigation, and was submitted to Cabinet. Further, he was advised of the decision of the Cabinet, and of the terms of the announcement that was to be made in this House, and in reply he cabled his whole-hearted approval and his blessing. The matter was before Cabinet in December, 1943, and again in 1944, and on both occasions the Prime Minister was present. The Cabinet agendum was fully known to that right honourable gentleman before his visit to Western Australia, and before the departure of the Minister for Civil Aviation for America. This criticism of national control of interstate airways falls down under the facts that are available in regard to private operators. I liken this proposed control to the Government control and ownership of Commonwealth railways in this country. No political party dare advocate the sale of railways Opponents to private enterprise. This proposal is bound up with the defence of Australia, and the development of New Guinea and that private enterprise could the territory from Darwin to Tasmania. This country must be served with airinterlines. The work is of national importance and is too big for profit motivated",15,Airlines Formal Motion For Adjournment

108,Mr Eorde,"I am showing the sortcompanies. There has been a merger of Australian National Airways Limited and. Airlines of Australia, and it is known that further mergers were in contemplation, one of them involving Guinea Airways Limited. All the evidence before the Government showed that experience and actual results in airline operations pointed to the fact that an organization operating a multiplicity of routes would operate them more economically than would a multiplicity of companies, each operating separate routes. With .one operator, there are savings in administration, and administration does not increase in ratio to development. There are savings in spare aircraft, engines, equipment, traffic staffs and supervision, buildings, workshops, advertising, training of crews and ground engineers, and many other expenses, some of which are due solely to rivalry between -separate companies. From tbe economic viewpoint, there is a clear case for the amalgamation of the existing private operators. But the matter goes much deeper than financial results, and involves post-war development and the influence of international operations on internal operations. It is undeniable that the outcome of the present Air Conference in the United States of America will be a plan for international airways which will have an important bearing on Australia's aviation future.

Let us give some of the facts to the people of Australia, as to the annual commitments of the Australian Government, by means of subsidies to these airline companies, in order to determine whether the people of Australia are indebted to them or whether the companies have reason to feel deeply grateful to the people of Australia and the Australian Government for the assistance that they have received.

Short shrift would be given to any such legislation, and to any government which dared to t r y to turn back the hands of the clock 'by handing great public utilities to big vested interests in this country. Take, for example, the British Overseas Airways Corporation established by the Chamberlain Government. The British Broadcasting Corporation, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation are Government owned and controlled. I believe that an overwhelming majority of the people of Australia stand behind the Government in its action in this matter. I have never felt so certain about anything in my life as I am that the Government is now doing the right thing. There is a lot of talk about the interdepartmental committee. I cannot give the whole of the conclusions that were reached by the committee, but I shall give some of them. They wereThe merging of airline companies will continue in Australia as a matter of necessity. The airline interests claim that they have developed, at their own risk and expense, airline businesses.

I have asked that the document he tabled, and I ask, further, that the Hansard notes of the relevant discussion be secured and examined. rests upon the opinion which the Acting Prime Minister expresses regarding the document.

I understand that such documents may not be tabled.

I know that the decision does not suit honourable members opposite. They feel that it represents a forward step in regard to public utilities. They realize that this undertaking will be an outstanding success, that the Government, with the facilities at its disposal, and with the substantial number of neAv Douglas airliners which have been brought from the United States of America recently, will be able to give an expanded and improved service to the public and that the development of the country and improved service to the people must be given priority over dividends for shareholders.

144,Mr Fadden (Darling Downs,"Leade r of the present Government. Does thethe decision that the Government should assume control of a major private enterprise, namely, the civil aviation companies. In his Hurstville speech, the Attorney-General made these further pertinent observationsThe Commonwealth Constitution gave no general power to nationalize industry. There -WHS a limited power over expropriation, subject to just compensation. The power of expropriation was limited to specific Commonwealth purposes, but there was no general power to nationalize industries. Tlierefore, the charge of socialization against ject in these wordsthe Curtin Government had no foundation. In fact, this statement was used in a Labour party election advertisement, which, carried a photograph of the Attorney-General and bore the caption "" D r . Evatt ends an argument"". Here are some other quotations which w ill show the emphatic nature of, the declarations made by the Prime Minister and the Attorney General. On the 11th May, 1943, the Prime Minister saidWe are not fighting this war on text books written by K a r l Marx, nor on the text books by Herbert Spencer. 1 am concerned only with the economic measures necessary for the prosecution of the war. . . Surelyi t is not seriously suggested by any member of the Government or of the Labour party that the decision of the Government to nationalize interstate airways has been taken in the interests of the country's war effort, or indeed, that it is anything other than an act of appeasement for the benefit of those socialistic members of the Labour party who have for so long been clamouring for socialism. I know that this decision represents a great victory for certain members of the Government, and some of the "" boys "" are up in the air about it . The Acting Prime Minister made it quite clear that tbe nationalization of interstate air services is to be permanent. Therefore, it will continue long after the war has ended. How does that square with the Prime Minister's assurance that there would be no socialization of industry or dislocation of fiscal policy so long as the war lasted ? On the 23rd July, 1943, the Prime Minister saidThe Labour Government has' not, socialized Australia and does not intend to do so just because we are at war. Shortly afterwards, on the 16th August, at Perth, the Prime Minister, in reply to my assertion that we should get socialism with a vengeance if his party were returned to power, had this to sayThe Government's proposal is to organize Australia not for the purposes of socializing or capitalizing but to get the utmost strength to defeat Japan. The Commonwealth Government has no power to socialize anything even w it h its war-time powers. On the 19th August, the Prime Minister made a further declaration on the subThe Commonwealth Parliament has no power to socialize industry. I say further that my Government has not socialized any industry. 1 say further that mj' Government will not during the war socialize any industry. The reason is that all the physical things requisite to war can, under the National Security Act, be directed for the purposes of war. Therefore, all the talk of socialization in this election campaign is irrelevant. So, from the quotations I have made, there emerge these facts1. The Attorney-General, while stating in August last year that there would be more room for private enterprise and business initiative after the war than ever before, in November, 1944, endorses government action designed to put several private industries out of business. 2. The Attorney-General, who said in August, 1943, that the Commonwealth Constitution gave no general power to nationalize industry, apparently takes the view in November, 194'4, that there is no legal obstacle to nationalizing the airline companies. 3. The Prime Minister's view in August last year that the Commonwealth Parliament had no power to socialize industry is obviously not now held by him or by his colleagues because he is stated to have had f u l l knowledge of the Government's intention to take over the airline companies. 4. We have striking evidence of a deliberate breach of f a it h and of the Government dishonouring the pledges that the Prime Minister and his Attorney General gave to the people. J [Extension of time granted.] The country was given definite pledges that 'there would be no socializing of or interference with industry, particularly war. industry, during the war. The answer is supplied in the Acting Prime Minister's declaration and the bill which will come before Parliament. The Acting Prime Minister to-day stated, that this matter had been considered consistently by the Government since as far back as 1942. So, obviously the intention to take over the airlines and introduce that form of socialism was known to every member of the Government, including the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General, during the last general elections, and the referendum campaign. With regard to the economics of this matter there is another point. The Acting Prime Minister stated, speciously, the economic cost of maintaining the airlines and endeavoured to mislead the House and the country into believing that the figures which he gave were in connection with subsidies only until he was questioned by the Leader of the Opposition. I . say to the Acting Prime Minister and to the Government that if the Government did not get value for the money expended, not only on subsidies, but also on the carriage of mails, which brought more revenues to the postal department, it had the right to bring the matter before Parliament long before now. It would have announced its intention to socialize the airlines on the occasion of the last general elections. ter for Home Security) [4.21] I do not intend to spend much time debating this motion. I am astounded that such a motion should, have been moved. Yesterday there was an announcement of Government policy, and in a long parliamentary life, this is the first time such an extraordinary attitude has been taken. The whole matter can be dismissed with a couple of sentences. It was discussed by Cabinet after exhaustive inquiries and research over a long period, and the man will not last. decision was reached unanimously that the interstate airlines of Australia should years in this House and, if God spares be nationalized. the Prime Minister. Minister fully aware what was being will gradually become the most popular done. with the decision. mous decision of Cabinet, and also a unanimous decision of the party in both Houses. It will be carried into effect. Whatever emerges from here or anywhere else, nationalization of the airways will be accomplished. It seems to me that the right thing for honourable gentlemen to do would have been to wait until they had the proposed legislation' before them and then discuss the matter, but so anxious are they, particularly the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies), immediately any attack is made on rapacious monopolies to rush to thendefencetime, and I do not suppose that it will be the last time, monopolies have been, defended by the honourable gentlemen of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition talked about "" this policy of socialism "". This is a matter of the linking of a further transport system with the already nationalized transport systems of this country, tlie railways, tramways and motor-bus systems. The Opposition parties were in office for years, but made no attempt to remove the postal department from national control. The right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) wants to extend the socialized electricity systems. He has written a book about it. ""Socialism"" is a catch-word now just as it was in the late Sir George Reid's day. It is a wonder that honourable members of the Opposition have not used the tag "" communism "". They have never dared to abolish national control of various public services which form a part of the economic life of the country, because they k-now that any government which attempted to do so would not last. me, I shall outlast the honourable member, am.

'The tramways in every city, even in the -cities of the most conservative State of the Commonwealth, Victoria, where, -owing to the gerrymandering of the -electorates, Labour has little chance of attaining power in the legislature, the railways and tramways are socialized. The people have invested huge sums in .the railways and tramways. The development of this country by means of the railways has involved the taxpayers in -vast losses. The development of railways was not attractive to private enterprise, .and it did not want to enter that field, ""but, because of its character, air transport became a means of profitable investment.

It will stimulate it, and it will make it possible to give more efficient The Acting Prime Minister misled the :and safer service to the public than ever private enterprise could give. National -control of air transport will stifle one thing, the development of monopolist -control of'the air, which is what the right 'honourable gentleman and his colleagues -desire. Australian National Airways is already endeavouring to monopolize air transport in this country and is about ?to absorb Guinea Airways. 'Qantas is entering'into mergers to .enable it to become :a monopolistic concern. The anxieties of honourable gentlemen opposite on behalf of ^private air transport companies arise from the fact that from those companies money flows ""into their party funds. Perhaps some honourable gentlemen have shares in -the companies or are thinking of investing ""ii them. Those are the reasons why they ;are fighting the action of this Government to take control of the development -of air transport in Australia, which must ^become a most profitable investment for the people as a whole, because it will be -one of the chief forms of transport in the -early post-war years. When the New 'Year comes, the proposed bill will go through this Parliament and the Commonwealth'Government will control in'terssta'te 'airways. I am prepared to gamble :that --if :a miracle happens and honourable gentlemen opposite, within the next two years, as forecast by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Harrison), regain office it will not dare to allow the control of nir transport to revert to private hands. My last word on this matter is that it is vital that the Government should control air transport in the interests of the railway systems of this country, in conflict with which it is inevitable that air transport will come. The only way in which both systems of transport may be made solvent and the taxpayer protected'against exploitation by monopolists is by taking air transport under government control in order that our transport systems may be co-ordinated. Acting Prime Minister( Mr Eorde) declared that the proposal of the Government to take over interstate airlines in Australia is historic and momentous. Tf. certainly is, and it will be long remembered in Australia's democratic decline. House on two matters. When he referred to subsidies paid by the 'Commonwealth Government to aviation companies, he included the amounts paid for the transport of mails, totalling hundreds of thousands of pounds, as if that were unjustified expenditure. He said also that the proper authorities were consulted about the Government's proposal. When I questioned him, he rudely replied that I was -easting :a reflexion on the Royal Australian A i r Force He cannot spealc for the Royal Australian Air Force, nor can any other honourable member in this chamber.

No one has played a .greater part in the bomber war than he has in enabling bombing by precision to be carried out. So the Minister misled the House on two vital matters. He stated that the Government had consulted the proper authorities about, its proposal, hut this was denied by those controlling the civil airlines in Australia. He also misled the Hou3e about payments to civil aviation companies for the transport of air mails.",22,Airlines Formal Motion For Adjournment
154,Mr White (Balaclava) [4.30].,"Th eCivil aviation in Australia has as fine a record of achievement as in any other country. In fact, there was a time when Australia led the world, and the length of our airlines, before the greater range of aircraft developed, exceeded that of any other country. Australia's record is not only an individual but also a corporate one. I recall historic names such as Sir Charles Kingsf ord Smith, Sir Ross Smith, Sir Keith Smith, Hinkler, Butler, Melrose and Hudson Eysh, the man who founded and developed Qantas. If any honourable member has travelled in other countries, he w ill know the high reputation of Qantas. should read Front Line Airline, the war record of this company, whose pilots, in Australia's emergency, brought across the Pacific such aircraft as the Catalinas. I do not believe that monopolies should be encouraged. When I was a Minister, 1 always endeavoured to clip the claws of monopolists, particularly trade union monopolists who tried to monopolize the labour market. I should not like to see civil aviation under one control. There are big aviation companies in Australia, including Qantas and Australian National Airways, and smaller companies such as the MacRobertsonMillar Aviation Company. Who would say that the small air service between Alice Springs and Wyndham, operated by a young man named Connellan, has anything to do with a monopoly? Former governments approved the establishment of these small airlines for the purpose of preventing the growth of a monopoly, because aviation, unlike a railway, is a for m of transport which can :be switched from place to place. Small operators can come ro the rescue if big operators are u n f a i r ; civil aviation is now controlled by a but nothing has been adduced to show that the big operators are u n f a i r ! I wish that the Government would be frank about the report of the Interdepartmental Committee on Civil Aviation. When I asked on many occasions for the report, my requests were met with evasions and refusals, and the document was not laid on the table of the House But the Acting Prime Minister read bits and pieces from it to suit himself, without allowing members of the Opposition to see Mr White. it, and declared that the report was confidential. The only document available to the Opposition is a report on civil aviation in Australia and New Guinea in 1940-41, issued by the Department of Civil Aviation. Portion of that report, readsThe loading on tlie regular services has been extremely heavy-in excess of 70 per cent, in some cases-and owing to the reduced number of aircraft in use those available are of necessity in use over long hours daily. Notwithstanding this pressure it says much for the organization of the civil companies and the skill and care of the pilots that not a single accident involving death or serious injury has occurred on any regular airline route for the Honourable members second year in succession, and during this year over C7,000,000 passenger miles have been flown. This in itself is a valuable contribution to flying morale and sets a standard of achievement. That is a governmental report on civil aviation companies, whom the Government is now endeavouring to destroy and which have not been invited to express their views upon the Government's proposal. I can imagine the confusion in which civil aviation companies will conduct their business during the next six months while the Government is f r a m in g legislation to give effect to its proposals. Some honourable members opposite frankly admit that they are Socialists, and others go beyond even that. I agree that some things can be conducted better by the Government than by private enterprise. English Socialists do not adopt the rabid for m of socialism that is so noticeable in some honourable members in this chamber. They believe that we should take into account the efficiency of the service, and that a post office or the like can be conducted better under government control than by private enterprise. As a matter of fact, government department; and can be conducted by the Government and free enterprise in partnership. But to-day, the Go : vernment w ill blot out all that efficiency and pioneering work by men who are renowned throughout the world. They will leave Australia if the Government's proposals are given effect. Not many months ago, I met Captain P. G. Taylor on the steps of Parliament House. He was going to another part of the world because there was not enough work for h i m here. The Government should give private enterprise an opportunity to expand. I understand that Ansett Airways, one of the smaller companies, has submitted to the Government plans for its expansion. Let me make it clear at this juncture that 1. have no interest in any aviation company except the Australian Aerial Medical Service, which I played some part in pioneering and which depends on private enterprise and a government subsidy to-day to carry out this humanitarian service. I inform -honourable members opposite, who discovered, aviation only recently, that this aerial medical service has saved more lives than have been lost in civil aviation in Australia. For over 30 years I have sponsored and advanced anything advantageous to aviation in Australia, because I believe that aviation can be of greater use to this great country, with its sparse communications and great area than to any other country. Let us not be guided by dogma, or swallow socialism 1 Let us examine factual matters. I am sure that some supporters of the Government believe that the proposal to take over airlines in Australia will be detrimental to civil aviation. Mr ""WARD -No, we are unanimous. ter for Transport ( Mr Ward) sees visions of himself controlling every form of transport, including horses and jinkers. We have an example of his capabilities in the "" splendid"" railway service between Goulburn and. Canberra, about which I have asked many questions. For fifteen years I have tried to induce the Government to put into operation a reasonable air service with this capital city. was a Minister for some years, so he coidd not have exerted much influence with various governments. some of the small airline operators getting their charter, in order to discourage the growth of a monopoly. I should like to know, too, what the Government proposes to do with the Douglas aircraft which it recently permitted one of the private companies to purchase in the United States of America. Will the Government take over those aircraft? This proposal is most drastic because the civil aviation companies operated with great efficiency and initiative and had an excellent record of safety. But honourable members opposite will curb them, and lay the dead hand of governmental control on what should be the most advanced form of comnmnication in this country. The Minister for Air( Mr Drakeford), who is now in the United States of America, expounded this socialist policy to other nations, but they scoffed at him and rejected his ideas. So the Government is trying out the scheme in Australia. [Extension of time granted.] This is a time in our history when Ave should be looking to the future. We must encourage migration in order to enable us to hold this great country for all time against any aggressor. We should also encourage the investment of overseas capital in Australia for the purpose of assisting our industrial expansion, .creating employment and increasing our prosperity. Buti f the Government embarks on an out-of-date policy, honourable members. can be sure that Australian airmen will look elsewhere for employment. Thousands of members of the Royal Air Force desire to migrate to I know that the MinisAustralia after the war, and they will find employment here if private enterprise is allowed to display initiative and is not checked by the Government, although it must be guided by the Government. Buti f civil aviation companies are taken over by the Commonwealth Government, investors and airmen will have to look elsewhere. Let the Government heed my warning and thoroughly explore its proposals before attempting to give effect to them! This is not a political matter but it will have a vital effect upon the progress of Australia. formation ( Mr Calwell) is a socialist, and will socialize anything that lies within his power.

They must earn their fee from the vested interests in this country who subscribe to their political funds. When private enterprise is challenged,honourable members opposite must rush to defend it. But in the opportunities presented to them, they have not shown us the great advantages which, they say, will accrue by retaining private ownership and control of our interstate airlines. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) referred to the report of the Inter-Departthey will realize that the Government is mental Committee on Civil Aviation and asked that it be tabled. Departmental officers do not determine government policy. They advise the Government, but it is for the Government to say whether that advice shall be followed in every detail. Actually, great disadvantages could overtake the people of Australia if this Government had not been courageous enough to adopt this proposal for taking over interstate airlines. The Acting Minister for Air( Mr Lazzarini) pointed out the difficulties that will arise in the post-war period if those air services remain under private control. He drew attention, to the many millions of pounds of government funds now sunk in State railway services. I am amazed to think that any member of the Australian Country party should oppose this proposal. What would be the position when the war ended? It is recognized that aircraft could not carry what is regarded as low grade freight. They would take only the cream of the traffic, with the result that unlimited competition by privatelycontrolled airlines would cause the railways to operate at a considerable loss. That loss could be offset in two ways: either by heavier taxation, or higher freight charges which would be detrimental to country interests. The Leader of the Opposition was disturbed because in taking this action, the Labour party is implementing a portion of its policy. In a democracy surely there is nothing wrong with a government, Parliament implementing the policyapproved by the people at the polls?.' Actually, this decision shows the Government's desire to keep faith with the people. The Leader of the Opposition spoke of referendum results, but I do not regard the result of the last referendum as a complete rejection of the proposals advanced by the Government. I am strongly of the opinion that a great deal of public support was not forthcoming for the Government's proposals because many people thought that the Government was too hesitant in putting its policy into operation. The decision to nationalize air services will have an exhilarating effect upon the people, because prepared to put into effect the policy which was approved at the last elections. The Leader of the Opposition said that he would deal with five points. With these five points, and the various points of order raised by honourable members opposite, I am reminded of a steera point here and there and a lot of bull in between. However, the first point made by the right honourable gentleman was that the Government's decision amounted to confiscation. I fail to see how that argument can be sustained. The Government is merely doing what it is empowered to do by the Constitution, namely, acquiring plant for. Commonwealth purposes on just terms. The Leader of the Opposition then referred to the assets of the private companies now conducting airline services and sought to establish that the equipment used by these organizations, although it had rendered a wonderful service during thewar years, was now getting old, and that,, as a result, compensation for its acquisition would he fixed at a low figure. That may be quite true. In view of the profits that have been earned by these aircraft* a high valuation may not be placed upon them, but I am sure that if the airline-",25,Airlines Formal Motion For Adjournment
160,Mr Ward (East Sydney,"Ministe rcompanies are treated as well as the honourable member for Parramatta, Sir Frederick Stewart, was when he -disposed of his bus services in Sydney, -they will not be disappointed. Just what are the assets 'of this industry? Prom the speeches of honourable members -opposite one would gather that all these -assets had been furnished by private -enterprise, but the fact is that the Government has more money invested in -civil aviation in this country than all the Parker Limited, with 74,999 shares; the private airlines combined. Under the present arrangement, the Government provides air terminals, radio location facilities, and ground staff operators. Also, by means of subsidies, the Government has enabled private companies to establish certain air services and keep them in operation. Honourable members opposite are not very much concerned when it is a question of sacrificing the assets of the people; it is only when the assets of their friends are affected that they become alarmed. I have a clear recollection of what happened to the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers, which represented a huge public investment. formed by the parties now sitting in opposition, was quite prepared to sacrifice that asset, and also to make such i\ loose agreement with the purchaser that the full purchase price was never obtained. These are the gentlemen who claim now that the Government's aim is .to abolish competition in air services. In. my opinion it is a very good thing that competition in these services should be abolished, and I shall deal with that matter in a few moments. The Leader of the Opposition excertain country areas, where operations pressed concern about the treatment would not be profitable because of limited which was to be accorded to the pioneers population, and population can be of air transport in this country.

The real pioneers have been swallowed up by big vested interests. operating. these struggling pioneers amongst the shareholders in Australian National Airways. For instance, there is Huddart Union Steamship Company of New Zealand Limited, with a similar number; Holyman Brothers Proprietary Limited, also with a similar number; the Adelaide Steamship Company Limited, with 75,000, and the Orient Steam Navigation Company, with 74,998. Perhaps the Leader of the Opposition was speaking of men named Webb, Souter, and Johnson, who each have one share. The right honourable gentleman said that control of the airlines must be left to private enterprise for the purpose of reconstruction when the war ends. Has he even heard of private enterprise initiating an unprofitable air service to A government any part of Australia? Of course not. Left to itself, private enterprise will undertake only profitable lines. If losses are unexpectedly incurred, they want tlie Government to make up the deficiency, and if they operate at a profit they want to keep it. all to themselves. That has been the history of private enterprise in control of air travel in this country. What would happen after the war if air services were to remain in the hands of private organizations? The result would be that air services would not be established to On the Anybody might would be taxed to pay for the proprivately controlled organization.

164,Mr Ward,"Let us look for some ofabout the welfare of the residents of Watson's Bay? No, it ceased to provide a service. To show the advantages of government control as against privately owned enterprise, I next cite the Sydney buses. When they were made a government undertaking, screeches of protest were heard from a few peopleI do not include among them the honourable member for Parramatta, who did so well out of the deal-bu t although anti-Labour governments succeeded the Labour Administration which assumed control of bus services in that city, no attempt was ever made to restore the services to private ownership. To-day the bus service in Sydney is operating more efficiently than ever before. I come now to the question of safety in air travel. This is a matter to which reference has not yet been made. It is quite true that the present air services have operated very successfully, and that they have a great safety record; but I point out that the men responsible for that record are the pilots operating the aircraft, and the ground staffs, who make the aircraft serviceable. At every opportunity, I have discussed this matter with the men operating aircraft, and on no occasion have I met any one who has not been in favour of government control of these services. Apparently, the honourable member for Balaclava would have us believe that the wealthy individuals who sit behind the scenes collecting profits and taking no risks are responsible for the safety of the airline services, f contend that safety would be increased under government control. Private companies operating for profit make profit their first consideration, and are prepared country, but were purchased overseas t,o take chances and risk lives in a manner which a government service would not tolerate. Aircraft have been lost because of overloading. Why? Simply because private enterprise wanted to get the maximum profit from its investment. that? formation from pilots in the airline services. Men actively engaged in those services have told me that planes were lost in Bass Strait in the early days of the service to Tasmania, because it is believed they were overloaded. They were carrying too big a passenger load, and were not able to carry sufficient petrol, the result being that they were forced down into the sea before completing their journey. With the Government in control, safety would be a major consideration. Pilots would not be asked to risk their lives and those of their passengers by leaving in unfavorable weather. Under private control that is what has happened. Therefore, I say that it is to the advantage of the people of this country that there should be government control of civil airlines. [Extension of time granted.'] To-day, the carriage of mails is regarded as of very great importance, and the tendency throughout the world is that air transport should be used for this purpose. The transport of mails is a government responsibility, and is a highly remunerative undertaking. Being a government responsibility, is it wrong that a government should use a government airline service for the purposewherever required? If we failed to have a governmentoperated and controlled airline service at the termination of; the war, probably we would not be able to maintain an aircraft construction industry in this country. It is important for the defence of this country that we should build up an industry for the construction of all types of aircraflt. What has happened with our interstate shipping services under privatecontrol and with anti-Labour governments in office? When vessels were required for those services they were not built in this because they could be obtained more cheaply. So, at the end of this war, if the airlines remained under private control, aircraft to operate them would always be purchased, overseas, with the result that the aircraft construction industry would never be firmly established in this country. On the other hand, if we link the operation of civil airlines and the construction of aircraft in Australia, there will be a suremarket for the locally produced planes, and. the success of the industry will be assured.

All the ad/vantages are on the side of the action the Government has taken. All that honourable members, opposite can say, is, "" This is socialism "". Why do they not tell us in what manner this decision will injure the people of this country?

All that they have said is that these wealthy interests who at present control interstate air transport pioneered the industry. I have already -ihown that the pioneers have disappeared. Some honourable members who sit opposite recently held what they termed a unity conference, at which was established the same old party under a different name.

AlthoughI know that it is unnecessary to do so, T say to my colleagues that, we shall have nothing to fear if we do what is in the interests of the people.

Already, in a campaign in defence of the private banks, an initial contribution of Â£50,000 has been made, 3imply because our friends opposite are afraid that this may be the first shot in a big fight which will include the taking over of other activities. They may rest assured that this Labour Government, elected with an overwhelming majority and still retaining the support of by far the largest proportion of the people of this country, is not going to be deterred from giving effect to the policy of which the people approved.

To him, it matters not whether his statements are true or untrue. If he lacks a few facts, he manufacturesthem as he proceeds. I shall remind the House of one or two things. The honourable gentleman spoke of air accidents.. He knows that every accident is inquired into by a properly constituted tribunal,, which determines the cause of it, and that never has there been any determination of the kind that he has mentionedA certificate of airworthiness is issued to every flying-boat which takes to theThe manufacture of aircraft in. this country during the war was made possible only because the industry was established by a government consistingof and supported by honourable members who sit on this side of the House. These considerations have no weight with theMinistcr for Transport. He has referred to the advantage of Commonwealth control. When the Constitution Alteration (Civil Aviation,) Bill was before this House, he spoke and voted against it ; yet now he renders lip service to thisnew project, and comes forward as a "" Simon Pure"" who has always supported Commonwealth control of aviation. I dispose of him with those few remarks, because he is not worthy of further comment. The Acting Prime Minister( Mr Forde) is a man of standing in this House, and has the prestige of hisposition to uphold. We were entitled to expect from him a balanced statement of government policy, and arguments in. rebuttal of those adduced by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies), butwhat did we get? His speech consistedof platitudes, and evasive and grossly misleading statements. Having quoted from a confidential document, he had not the courage to table it. What doesit contain which the Government desiresto hide?

167,Mr Harrison (Wentworth) [5.2],"personnel may be carried. That is the reason for the payment of subsidies by the Government, and for the marked inflation of the amounts paid. There are two reasons for my support of the Leader of the Opposition. One is, that in my opinion the statement of the Acting Prime Minister will destroy the confidence of the people in government integrity. What is my reason for that belief? It is that from time to time. I have heard the Prime Minister( Mr the will of the people mu3t prevail, is Cur.tin) say that he had no intention, during the period of the war, to introduce socialization in Australia. party that sits opposite won the last elections on that stand. The Attorney General (Dr. Evatt) took the Leader of the Opposition to task when that gentlesits opposite. The old saying still holds man challenged the Prime Minister in regard to the possibility of his introducing socialization if he were returned to power, and stated that there was no such intention, yet he supports a decision of which socialization is part and parcel. I believe that the Prime Minister is a man of his word. Has he consented to this proposal? From time to time, he has assured the country that there was to be no socialization; yet, while he and the Minister for Civil Aviation( Mr Drakeford) are absent from the Parliament, the leftist side of Cabinet has taken the bit completely in its teeth and has reduced to naught all the assurances that have been given. The Minister for Transport said the departmental officers do not determine government policy. Yet from time to time, different bureaucrats appointed by the Government voice in public places the need for socialization and, indeed, affirm that it is to be introduced. When Ministers have been asked whether or not these have been statements of governcharacteristic of what private enterprise ment policy, they have glibly replied that they are purely the personal opinions of the bureaucrats who have expressed them. Transport claims that these bureaucrats do not determine government policy. Of course they do; this is the direct outcome have heard much about the profits that are of the influence that they wield. When the Acting Prime Minister states in this House that the will of the people must prevail, he must mean that in all sincerity. Mr Harrison. regard to socialization and nationalization was expressed very forcefully at the last referendum. They then indicated quite clearly what they expected the Government to do. They refused to give to it the power to introduce a scheme of socialization or nationalization. In the light of what the Government has now done, the declaration of the Acting Prime Minister, made with all the sincerity of which he is capable, that in a democracy farcical. The people meant what they declared when they defeated the proThe posals of the Government at the referendum. Socialization of industries, and nationalization of banking, if practised, will boomerang upon the party which good, that those whom the gods wish to destroy they first make mad. I believe that this proposal is aimed at the destruction of private enterprise Again and again it has been said truthfully that in peace-time private enterprise has provided employment for between 80 per nent. and 90 per cent. of. the people. This proposal is designed to drive the first nail into the coffin of private enterprise, which pioneered the airways of Australia. That adventurous experiment did not fall upon the shoulders of one or two persons. The Minister for Transport has referred to vested interests. One small company of which I have knowledge is Ansett Airways, which has 1,050 shareholders with an average holding of 222 shares. Is that a monopolistic concern? Does it consist of bloated capitalists, or of a body of Australians who have been prepared to apply some of their material substance to tlie development of an air service? Let us consider the growth of the airways of Australia, because it is has done generally. In 1927, 423,235 miles were flown and 1;087 passengers were carried. In 1938, the numbers were The Minister for respectively 9,654,67S and 106,339, and in 1941 they were 8,345,842 and 170,262. [Extension of time granted.'] We alleged to have been made by these huge capitalist concerns. Let us consider the position of the particular company that I have mentioned. In 1940-41 it had a deThe will of the people in ficit of Â£25,117, and in 1941 -42 a profit of Â£77,374, the net surplus for the two years being Â£52,257. Can that be said to be an undue return for the money invested and the wort that was undertaken in the pioneering stage? I shall cite one example of a government-controlled concern j order to show n what the taxpayer may expect. The Victorian railways, a State-owned undertaking, wrote off Â£30,000,000 of the taxpayers' money in 1937. Every government-controlled undertaking in Queensland, where there has been a labour government for years, showed such a. substantial loss that they had to be closed. That applies also to New South Wales, in which Cockatoo Island Dockyard is a classic example. This is characteristic of every industry on which the dead hand of the Government presses. Canada has adopted nationalization in some degree. The Trans-Canadian Airways have been nationalized, and in 193S the loss was 111,005 dollars, while in 1939 the loss was S1S,026 dollars. That is an illustration of what happens whenever a government -assumes control of business undertakings. Political pressure is exerted to influence policy, and to secure preferment in the appointment of staff. Before the contiinission took charge of Cockatoo Island Dockyard, politicians were always sending their friends along there for jobs. Du ring the general election campaign, and again during the referendum campaign, the Government assured the people that it would not nationalize industry, or introduce socialistic measures. Now the Government has broken its word to the people. I warn the Government that this .must be the last step that it takes in applying its nationalization policy before receiving a mandate from the people. If honourable members opposite value thenpolitical Fides, and I take it that they do, they must realize that they will have to and safety of the Australian public must account to the people for this base act of treachery, which is so directly opposed to the pledges ofi Ministers during the election campaign and the referendum campaign. and Minister for External Affairs) courts, and everybody will agree that the [5.18J -The House is considering a very valuation of assets usually includes a fair great question, but the Deputy Leader allowance for the goodwill of the enterof the Opposition ( Mr Harrison) did not prise taken over. discuss it at all. Indeed, he indulged in a general discussion of the functions of the State. The answer to his argument is plain: There are some utilities which the Go venom era t not only can, but should, operate to the .exclusion of private enterprise. There are others, such as retail businesses and most wholesale busisiesses, which the Government should never attempt to control because it is unfitted to do so. Between those two extremes there' arise questions of time and place and circumstance to be be taken into account when any proposal for nationalization is under consideration. It is impossible to generalize on this subject. Therefore, I propose to coaifine my attention to the particular matter of interstate air services. I tell -the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Eadden) that what the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) and I said during the general elections campaign was correct. Our opponents were saying that the Government would confiscate private concerns without paying anything for them. right honourable member said it, but it was being said from one end of the country to another. I said that there was no general power in the Commonwealth Parliament to nationalize industry. What does that mean ? It means that any power must be related to the specific heads of power in the Constitution. I said also that there would never be confiscation of property. The Constitution guarantees payment for property on flair and just terms. I said, and I repeat, that after the war there would, be opportunities for expanding private enterprise. I still believe that to be true, but that does not mean that an enterprise which involves the defence for ever remain in private hands. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) said that the assets of the aviation companies would be taken over as mere plant. There is no justification for saying that.

Reference has been made to those who pioneered aviation services in this country. I agree that -enterprise has been exhibited by those who started some of the services, and they are entitled to credit for what they have done; dry years.

It is the duty of, the Government to develop it because, obviously, services will have to be extended to New Guinea, Papua and other Pacific territories. I believe that the decision of may be expected from any rain that falls the Government .to undertake this work is wise. Fair compensation will be paid to those whose property is taken over.

This Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully) explained to Parliament in ""terms which need no emphasizing the magnitude and dire effects of the drought. In the record of our agricultural and pastoral industries certain drought years -stand out as years of terrible hardship and loss both to persons and the nation. Two of those which stand out most prominently are 1902 and 1914. The -present year, as the Minister for -Commerce and Agriculture has stated, bids fair to equal those others, both for the severity of the drought itself and for the extent of the area affected. I have examined the rainfall figures in some of the affected districts, which comprise the south-eastern corner of the continent with the exception of the coastal fringe. Not only is the rainfall for this year at a record low level, but this very dry year is one of a series of unusually western Riverina centre, has an average rainfall of 11.78 inches. The rainfall so about equal to the average rainfall for Oodnadatta. Moreover, the record low rainfall of 4.56 inches this year follows an almost equally disastrous experience last year, when the rainfall was only 5.53 inches. Over the last, five years the rainfall has been below the average in four out of the five. Narrandera is what might -be described as a favorable wheat-growing area, the average rainfall being 17.22 inches. This year, only S.6S inches hav<fallen so far, and we know that little good between now and the end of the year. Moreover, the rainfall for each of the five years just past has been below the average. At Echuca, in the central Murray Valley, the average rainfall i*16.92 inches, hut this year only 7.19 inches have fallen. Last year, the rainfall there was only S.86 inches, yei Echuca is generally regarded as one of the safe areas of Victoria. The rainfall this year was substantially less than the average rainfall at Alice Springs, and for the last five years it has been considerably below the average. At Mildura, the itself is an irrigation area, but it is the year, the rainfall has been only 3.5 inches, and last year it was no more than 6.54 inches. Honourable members wall realize that such a rainfall is practically useless in a district subject to such hot dry winds as prevail in that area. Charlton, in the very heart of what wheat-growers would describe as a safe wheat area in Victoria, has an average rainfall of 16.79 inches, but this year only 6.74 inches have fallen, while last year the rainfall was 10.7 inches. Over the last five years less than the average fell in four of them. The",31,Airlines Formal Motion For Adjournment

173,Mr Mcewen (Indi) [5.25j,"Th eposition is much, the same in South Australia, and it is also bad in certain areas of Western Australia. Surely a drought of such wide extent and such unprecedented intensity ought to be accepted as a matter for consideration by this Parliament. Unhappily we find, however, that the legislation brought before Parliament deals not with the area or the people affected by the drought, but exclusively with people engaged in certain industries in drought-affected areas. That is my first criticism of legislation which I hoped I should be able to support wholeheartedly. If this Parliament is provoked by humane feeling, which would be complete justification for this measure, the benefit should be extended to all people in the drought-affected areas who are suffering losses, whether they are growing wheat or raising sheep or fat lambs; but this bill is confined exclusively to those in distract myself or the House by unduly the cereal-growing industries. The Minister's speech reveals a Minister who says, "" Here is a national calamity with tremendous loss of production and revenue, and the Government should aid "". Taken from that point of view there is justification for the proposed relief, but this drought has fallen, not only on growers of wheat, oats and barley, but also on sheep, cattle and fat lamb raisers, and, if the national good, or, in reverse, the national calamity, from which this bill results, is the justification for this proposal, there is no reason why it should be confined to those engaged in cereal production. SoI find myself at the outSet completely unable to comprehend the motives of the Government in restricting this financial assistance to so limited a group of people. Then, to crowd limitation upon limitation, the Government says that this assistance is to be extended only to those able to remain in the industry. I take the strongest exception to legislation which, under the guise of drought relief, excludes, if not the majority, at least a very substantial proportion of the people who are enduring the ravages of this drought. As my leader intends to enlarge upon that aspect of the matter-in fact, he intends to direct the attention of the House to it very pointedly I do not propose to go further with it, but I am sure that the Government would [74] do right if it accepted the fact .that the assistance proposed is far too limited. This is a Government which has claimed that it interests itself in persons rather than industries, and it is very difficult for any one to sayI am not one who desires -to say it-that industries ought to be given prior consideration to persons. AllI say is that the fates of industries and persons are inextricably interwoven. It occurs generally in industry that industry is most efficiently carried on by the bigger operators. the farming industries. whether it be wheat-growing, wool-growing, dairying or any other form of primary production. This Government has deliberately embarked on a policy of assisting the wheat industry and I will not considering that. It has deliberately embarked on a policy of aiding persons, that is the small growers, rather than a policy of encouraging the industry as a whole, not by selecting the major operators, but by giving them equal treatment with the minor operators. So, here we instantly find a complete conflict of policy. In dealing with the wheat industry in general, this Government says, "" We will help the majority of the persons, the smaller operators, and we will actually prejudice the major operators, who, through history, have shown themselves to be the more efficient "". Good! That is the Government's policy. But here we have a complete reversal of policy under which it says, "" We will not help all persons, because we will first exclude those persons completely driven out of business by the drought. We will confine our assistance to those who are able to show that they have remained in their industry, and we will exclude all those engaged in live-stock industries in the droughtaffected areas "". You cannot make the two march together. That certainly suggests that the Government should have another look at this policy. My second criticism is on the financial extent of the assistance proposed to be given in relation to the losses involved and of the means of the people concerned. Four States are named, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and",32,States Grants Drought Relief Bill 1944 Second Reading

175,Mr Mcewen,"Of course it is,Western Australia. In those States we have the overwhelming proportion of the cereal industries. named as a recipient under this hill. It is named for future reference. man will agree that Western Australia is in mind. In those four States we have for practical purposes the whole of the cereal industries and the whole of the cross-breed sheep industry, which means the fat-lamb-raising industry. A drought of unprecedented proportions following drought after drought is upon us, and what is to be found by the Government of Australia ? Â£1,500,000! Why, I could not have dreamt that such a paltry amount would have been thought adequate. Memory is inconvenient on occasions, but I remember that in the year in which I entered this House, when the total income of the Government was less than Â£50,000,000, a grant of Â£3,500,000 was made to the wheat industry with the commitment of an additional Â£1'2,000,000. This year, when the Government's revenue runs into hundreds of millions of pounds, astronomical figures, and when we have an unprecedented drought, the Government thinks it is meeting the situation by proposing to vote a paltry Â£.1,500,000 to cover the distress in what is 75 per cent, of the agricultural area of Australia. It is not enough. The Government ought to have another look at that. I am astounded to find that the Government proposes that the payment of this Â£1,500,000 shall be conditional upon the State Governments providing an equal amount. The State Governments have had their revenues pegged by the uniform income tax legislation and have no new field of revenue open to them. Yet, the party and are to come in pari passu with this millionaire Government, and the distressed people are to receive assistance only if the State Governments give equal assistance on the same conditions. honourable member's colleagues say that wheat-growers would have had stolen the State Governments were getting too from them an amount of not less than much rebate? interjection, I should be glad to reply toil. The drought relief proposals in< extent and in the amount of assistanceare ill conceived and completely inadequate, and they certainly call for the withdrawal of this measure in order that: if. may be redrafted on more generous lines calculated to meet the needs of the situation. We all know that, although this goes under the name of drought relief, it is to afford relief to certain cereal growers. Those who grow oats and barley exclusively are not to any substantial extent within the drought-affected area. Oats and barley are, of course, grown in ,the area, but those who grow oats and barley exclusively are not within it. So the bill really becomes a proposal to assist the wheat-growers. Why do people need financial assistance from the Government? Because of their financial circumstances. Victoria are seriously affected. Ma-.

Why do wheat-growers need assistance? They should have been, able to build up some reserve if the claims of the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture and his colleagues about their magnanimity in the last few years are justified. But these people require assistance, very largely because in previous years tlie price of their product was extraordinarily low and, more recently, they have had a combination they are to be brought to of bad seasons and a denial of the payment to which they were justly entitled. When I referred to this matter on a previous occasion, I directed attention to certain aspects of the position of the wheat-growers.

I ask the honourable member to connect his remarks with the bill. deals with the consequence of drought to persons concerned in the production of cereal crops, and that clearly embraces the circumstances of persons engaged in growing wheat. If wheat growers were wealthy and had bulging bank balances, it could reasonably be argued that Consolidated Revenue should not be drawn upon to aid them. But who have been paid certain amounts and have indeterminate balances due to them. Earlier in the day, the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, happily, was able to inform us that certain additional payments are to be made to wheat growers. I have no doubt that if he had not been able to state that an additional Is. a bushel on certain wheat and 6d. a bushel on other wheat was to be paid forthwith to wheat growers, the measure of the necessity of these people would have been assessed as being greater than it is now. WhatI propose to make quite clear is that these people should be paid, not an additional Is. a bushel, but an additional few shillings a bushel. orable member is trying to evade my ruling.

I have, in my experience, known bills to be amended, and I hope that this bill will be amended. amended, but the proper time to speak to an amendment is when the amendment is moved. to forecast an amendment and to explain the justification for it? I thought that the customary practice in this chamber was to permit an honourable member to explain the justification for an amendment before he moved it, and I merely hoped that I would be permitted to explain the justification not only for amending the measure, but also for the withdrawal of the measure. Would you, Mr Speaker, be kind enough to advise me whether it is necessary for an amendment to be moved before one explains the justification for it, or whether practice permits the making of a case before the amendment is moved? that the bill is very specific in its terms. It provides for the expenditure of a certain amount of money for the purpose of granting assistance to cereal-growers in certain drought-stricken States. Thet honourable member might argue, for instance, that the amount specified in the bill is not sufficient to provide the relief required, or that the amount is excessive; but the main purpose of the bill is to provide for the distribution of the money. Speaker, for your explanation, but I am not yet sure about the matter. I desire to intimate that I intend to move an amendment. Before doing so, I wish to explain the motives which prompt me to take this serious step. My amendment, if adopted, would necessitate the withdrawal of the bill.

Whilst the bill provides assistance to droughtstricken producers of cereal crops, the amendment suggests that the scope of the bill should be widened in order to include other sections of primary industry. In discussing the proposed amendment, he may refer to drought relief in respect of stock losses, but not to the price to be paid for wheat in the various pools. obliged to submit another amendment. I contend that there should be a fairer apportionment of any moneys voted for drought relief among persons entitled to assistance. The amendment, which I read, is for the purpose of bringing within the ambit of entitlement persons engaged in primary industries other than cereal industries, and increasing the total amount ofi the vote. One can visualize the Government, acting upon such an amendment, introducing another bill which would pay regard to the needs of droughtstricken persons in the live-stock industries, and those of cereal-growers in the apportionment of the money. From that standpoint, I desire to refer to the financial circumstances of wheat growers at present, and what they would be if the producers received tion of their wheat, which has been compulsorily acquired by the Commonwealth Government. No less an authority than a member of the Australian Wheat Board has made an important declaration on this matter. This wheat is either the property of the growers who are the not their property, they still have an interest in it. If sold for export, the wheat would bring a substantially higheT figure than the growers now receive. I refer to the wheat produced in excess of the requirements of Australia.

203,Mr Mcewen,"Then I may beMrM c EWEN That all the words after ""That"" be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words:"" this House is of the opinion that the bill is incomplete in that the amount provided is inadequate because it fails to make provision for producers of other primary products who have been adversely affected by drought conditions and that financial provision should be made for such cases, having regard to the circumoffered for sale and the auctioneer stances of the persons concerned."". The purpose of my amendment is to make clear the deficiencies of the bill, namely, that no provision is made for the relief of live-stock owners who have been adversely affected by the drought, and to secure the withdrawal and redrafting of the measure for tlie purpose of including such farmers. The live-stock owners to whom I refer include all the graziers raising cross bred sheep, and all the f a t lamb raisers. These people for m a very important section of the primary-producing community, and their losses, and diminution of production due to drought conditions, w ill have a very substantial effect upon the national economy. From the industrial and national aspects these people are no less entitled tp assistance than are the wheat-growers, and it is quite beyond my comprehension why they should be specifically excluded from this measure. If , on the other hand, the Government's object were to assist persons in distress, obviously it could be shown that thousands of stock-raisers were suffering just as acutely as the wheat-growers. I should not like my remarks to be construed as indicating that the financial assistance now intended for the relief of wheat-growers should be taken away from them and paid to some one else. I admit freely that the wheat growers are in a bad way; but any one who reads the daily newspapers or attends stock sales must know that thousands and thousands of sheep are being sold to-day at prices which literally provide no return whatsoever to the growers. It is not uncommon for buyers attending sheep sales at Newmarket, Shepparton or Echuca, to see sheep, which, although aged, are still capable of breeding another lamb or two, sold, not for shillings, but for pence Thousands of farmers are confronted with the choice of k ill i ng their sheep on their property, or watching I m o v e them wither away and die. This is occurring, not only in the less-favoured areas, but also in parts of Victoria and the Riverina district of New South Wales, which for generations have been regarded as safe areas. I have attended Newmarket stock sales lately, and have seen sheep which, although aged, could not be described as "" old crackers"", struggling hard to obtain a bid of more than 2s., 3s., or 4s. a. head. The national and individual loss is tremendous, yet, notwithstanding a comprehensive speech by the Minister for Commerce and A g r i culture ( Mr Scully), the National Parliament is not invited by the Government to vote one penny for the assistance of stock-owners unless they happen to be cereal-growers also. A few days ago I read in the Melbourne Herald of a farmer in the Mallee district of Victoria who, finding that he could no longer maintain his horses on his property, was sending them away for sale. A t the same time, his wife was sending fowls to the market, and jocularly they had a bet as to who would receive the better return, the farmer for his draught horses, or the wife for her poultry: The wife won. That is illustrative of the state of affairs which exists to-day over a huge area of Australia, and without labouring the point any further, surely it justifies the Government accepting the advice which I am now offering, namely, to withdraw this measure and recast it to include provision for assistance to live-stock owners. Undoubtedly, the wheat-growers are in a desperate position. The normal wheat crop for Victoria ranges . between 36,000,000 and 40,000,000 bushels a year. Latest estimates of this year's crop vary fro m 3,000,000 to 5,000,000. {Extension of time granted.] It is very doubtful whether there w ill be any wheat at all delivered to the Australian Wheat Board in Victoria. A t best, there will be very little. That is something upon which there is general agreement. An almost identical state of affairs exists in South Australia and in the Riverina district of New South Wales. Wheat-growers would be very greatly assisted if they were to receive additional disbursements from wheat pools holding wheat grown in earlier and more bountiful seasons. I have included in my amendment tbe words, "" having regard to the circumstances of the persons concerned"". brief, the circumstances of the wheat growers are these: Their wheat has been acquired compulsorily, and is realized by the Government. After the Government has recouped itself, wholly or in part, the wheat-growers receive such additional dividends as are available. There are quite substantial quantities of wheat, and certainly substantial money values, still undistributed in respect of the numbers 5, 6 and 7 pools, that is, wheat from last year's harvest and from the harvests of the two preceding years. By reason of Government policy, much of the wheat that has gone into pools from these three harvests has been sold at figures very much lower than could have been obtained had the best offer been taken. Wheat for human consumption in Australia is sold on a basis of 5s. 2d. a bushel f.o.r., ports, east of Suez at a price which justiwith an average of lOd. a bushel for costs and leaving about 4s. 4d. a bushel; but the additional wheat used for human consumption in Australia has not been sold in accordance with the directions of the realizing authority, namely, the Australian Wheat Board. That organization, 1 am quite sure, construes its responsibility as tlie trustee for the Australian wheat growers, as an obligation to realize on their behalf to the best advantage. The board is composed of able business men experienced in the wheat trade, and the elected representatives of the wheat growers themselves. Naturally these individuals would assume that their first duty as trustees for the Australian wheat growers would be to sell this vast and valuable property to the best possible advantage; but it board to do this. The wheat has been sold very largely as directed by the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture and by the Government. At least as much wheat as has been sold for human consumption by Australia's 7,000,000 people has been sold at 3s. 3fd. a bushel bulk, by direction Government, for stock feed in this country. of 6d. a bushel as a Government subvention. What is the value of that wheat? Wheat-growers believe that they are entitled to its value. It has had a variable value according to the circumstances > of In war, but it has an exact and determinable value to-day. Not very long ago in this HouseI forecast that the next sale of wheat for export on a bulk basis to the United Kingdom would bring at least 6s. 6d. a bushel. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture interjected on that occasion, ""That is ridiculous "". I assured the Minister that subsequent events would prove whether or not my statement was ridiculous. I have asked the Australian Wheat Board for information regarding current sales, and I have been informed that wheat sold for delivery to the United Kingdom or west of .Suez is realizing 5s. 3Jd. a bushel f.o.b., or 5s. 9d. a bushel bagged basis', f.o.b. Out of the last sale of approximately 19,000,000 bushels, 5,500,000 bushels has been sold to the Government of the United Kingdom. for delivery to India or fies entirely the forecast which I made some time ago, namely, 6s. 6&d. a bushel f.o.b. for bulk wheat, and 6s. llÂ§d. a bushel f.o.b. for bagged wheat. When I ventured the opinion that it was worth 6s. 6d. a bushel, the honourable gentleman who administers the affairs of the wheat-growers said that I was ridiculous in making such an estimate. Mr .SCULIY -The statement then made by the honourable gentleman was entirely different in substance from that which he has made to-night. of Hansard will prove that, in respect of this matter, I to-night am merely stating as a fact, that which I ventured as an opinion six weeks or so ago.

I am not arguing that Added, to that is the sum it ought to be sold to India, and that our stock should be allowed to die; obviously, that would be an indefensible attitude to adopt.

The Minister made it abundantly clearthat the concessional price being received for sales of wheat for breakfast foods, stock-feed, and power alcohol, would not be taken into the calculations to ascertain the final realizations of the pool. The Government would make up the difference between tlie prices received for concessional sales and the prices received by the Australian Wheat Board on export sales, and the home consumption price. They were thoroughly satisfied.

He has said thisIf the amount to be paid by the Government to the Wheat Board to bridge the gap between concessional prices for stock-feed He did not touch on the wheat for breakfast foods and power alcoholand the average export realization be taken . as ""the correct principle, then the Government will have to pay to the board approximately Â£0,850,000 on the stock-feed item alone. {Further extension of time granted.] Mr Teasdale continuedIf, on the other hand, the current realization of wheat sold in the free market east of Suez There is scope for an unlimited sale of our surplus wheat therebe taken as the basis, then the Government, approximately Â£!),850,000 on account oi the two pools 6 and 7.

If the Government really' wants to help the wheat-growers, and to place them in a position to carry on their industry, the proper thing is to pay to them for the product seized from them the value which they could get for it . That is not raising the consideration that the Australian public enjoyed for many years a loaf of bread made from wheat grown by these same people and sold for as low as Is. Sd. and Is. 9d. a bushel. then in office? opposite, who represent wheat-growing electorates, are not well-informed. The honourable member for Grey( Mr Russell) will be sorry that he asked that question, because the price that I have mentioned was paid in 1930, when the right honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) was the Prime Minister of this country. In the same year, Mr Scullin promised the wheat-growers of Australia 4s. 6d. a bushel; and Mr Lang, then Labour Premier of New South Wales, promised them 7s. 6d. a bushel. I am not saying that the fact that the Australian people are being fed to-day with wheat grown for a gross return of 5s. 2d. a bushel, which provides a net return of 4s. 4d. a bushel, is unjust, and that they ought to pay the 6s. l l f d . a bushel which could be obtained in India. It would be logical to argue that Australian people, having enjoyed the lower price, ought now to pay the higher price; but I am not using that argument, because, as my friends-man y of them newcomers and perhaps not long to remain-wil l not remember, it was a government drawn from members who now sit on this side of the House which introduced a stabilization plan, although it is claimed by honourable members who now sit opposite that their Government was the originator of it. Hansard and the statutes will show that a measure for the stabilization of wheat was placed on the statute-book on the initiativeof, the Menzies Government. When one is touring the electorates, it is not pleasant to be told that the present .Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully) has stabilized the wheat industry. The truth of the matter is that the wheat-growers themselves, in their organization, devised the formula for the stabilization of the wheat industry. Honourable members who now sit on this side of the House wound their way through the tortuous intricacies of the Constitution in order to establish a home consumption price fo.r wheat by means of the flour tax, in face of the recorded votes against it of every member then belonging to the Labour party. It was honourable members who now sit on this side of the House who established the stabilization plan, and it was the Scully plan which destroyed stabilization. It was the Scully .plan which created a state of affairs under which only the small growers received even the comparatively low price of 4&. a bushel. Evidently it was the Government's intention to create a peasantry. Any man who sowed^even 200 acres in wheat was to be regarded as a capitalist, and received only 2s. a bushel for all the wheat he produced in excess of 1,000 bags. The figures which I have produced, supported by those of Mr Teasdale, showed that the wheat growers of Australia have, as the result of this Government's policy, had not less than Â£10,000,000 stolen from them. If the Government wishes to assist the farmers it should ensure that they receive a proper price for their products. The Government should withdraw this bill and introduce another in which provision is made for the giving of relief to distressed farmers, other than cereal growers. It should be able to provide assistance from the almost unlimited millions at its disposal, and thus do the fair thing by the producers of Australia. one who comes to this House fresh from the farm quickest to return to it. able member that in 1904 my father was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Victoria, and he is still a member of it.",39,States Grants Drought Relief Bill 1944 Second Reading

214,Mr Lemmon,"I remind the honorI can at least claim that, lite the racehorse, Peter, I am 'bred on staying lines. I feel deeply concerned for my fellow producers still on the farms when I hear statements of the kind which emanated this evening from the Deputy Leader of the Australian Country Party( Mr ments greater control over the allocation McEwen), a man who is supposed to represent the primary producers. A t this time, when the nation is gripped by the d,ual tragedies of war and drought, it is altogether to be regretted that a responsible menrber of this Parliament should state that the primary producers have had Â£10,000,000 stolen from them. In an effort to support his argument he goes back over a period of three years, to a time when it was impossible for us to sell our wheat overseas-.whe n it was practically impossible even to ship it from Australia. Then he went on to say that if we had all that wheat now, and could place it on the market now open to us, we could get a very fine price for it. He has even changed the basis of his own argunienit. He used the same argument in this House some time ago, and when I challenged his assertions, he said that the Â£10,000,000 he was talking about represented a ""steal"" over a period of eighteen months, but now he places the period at three years. The honourable member referred to stock feed, but I remind him that a large proportion of the wheat sold as stock feed was big producers who went out. That does bought back by the farmers themselves. The Minister said that the plan for distributing relief would be prepared to suit the farmers, and that is a commendable arrangement. I agree with the purpose of the amendment in that I believe that assistance should be given to farmers to enable them to save breeding ewes and cattle. However, the Deputy Leader of the Australian Country party merely told us some harrowing stories about the farmer who was able to sell his poultry for more than he could get for his horses; he did not tell us how the position could be remedied. So far as I could make out he could do no more than suggest that the farmers should feed their starving stock on Â£1 notes. I believe that, where water and feed are obtainable, farmers should be assisted to obtain supplies so that they may save the ewes, and thus the fat lamb industry for next year, and dairy cattle, so that the dairying industry may ibe preserved. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) gave notice that he intended to move an amendment in committee to clause 5 in order to give to State Parliaof relief money. I hope that the Minister will be very wary in considering such an amendment. I remember that when the Commonwealth Government voted money for the relief of farmers during the depression, and handed it over to the State Governments for distribution, some of them made the money available in the form of loans upon which the farmers had to pay interest. Just recently, when the Premier of Victoria thought that the Commonwealth Government proposed to provide the whole of the Â£3,000,000 for drought relief, he was very anxious that the money should be distributed in the form of a grant; but when he found that the States were expected to subscribe half the amount, he was just as anxious that the money should be distributed in the form of loans. The Deputy Leader of the Country party said that the quota system put a premium on inefficiency. I remind honourable members that, during the economic drought that afflicted the farmer at the time of the depression, it was the small f armers who came through, and the not support the assertion that the big farmers produce more economically. The Scully plan did not destroy stabilization; it assured its success. Under that plan every producer receives the world parity price, whilst for the first 3,000 bushels of his crop he receives the fixed price of 4s. a bushel. The big man has what he always had, a world's parity with something morea guarantee of 4s. a bushel and 3s. a bushel for any excess quantity for what he produces. Thus the Scully plan represents a foundation upon which the industry can safely rest. The Leader of the Opposition says that those growers who produced more than 3,000 bushels represented only 30 per cent, of the total number of growers. I challenged that statement at the time. The latest figures available, those for 1941-42, show that, of a total of 38,655 growers, 18,266, or 38 per cent., were in the category that produced more than 3,000 bushels. Since then the number of large growers has decreased, so that I should say that the percentage is now nearer 50 per cent. I congratulate the Government on bringing down this measure, which demonstrates its practical sympathy with the primary producers, and indicates that the Government recognizes the importance of the rural industries to Australia. government of this type should, in my The financial assistance for which the bill provides will enable the farmers, when the drought breaks, to return quickly to the plough, and once again play their part in producing the rural wealth of the nation. [8.45] -On e would think, listening to the honourable member for Forrest( Mr ment. The effects of a Labour GoLemm'on), who has just addressed the House, that the Government had strained itself almost to the stage of political hernia and financial hernia in order to assist the wheat industry, but ihe facts are very different. The Government has waited for a second devastating drought before it has done anything at all. Last year, over wide areas of South Australia, and a good quarter of Victoria, and a fair part of New South Wales, there raged a devastating drought, which has been succeeded this year by one of the worse droughts in Australian history, one which has affected four of the mainland States. Even Western Australia, which is rather fortunately situated, has had a severe "" caning"" this year. This bill, however, deals with only one aspect. It deals only with the effect of the drought; it does not relate to the causes underlying the difficulties of the grain-producing industry of Australia. The Deputy Leader of the Ausattempted, by his amendment, to steer the discussion in a different and important direction. I agree with the honourable member that this drought has affected not only the cereal-growing industry, but also the live-stock industry. In accordance with custom, the drought has been accompanied by very severe frosts. In three of the States, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, the frosts were of such intensity that during the winter severe damage was done to the citrus industry. Then, unusually severe frosts occurred in October, resulting in whole areas of vines being 100 per cent, lost. In other cases, losses of apples, plums and other fruits were as high as 90 per cent. Those matters are not dealt with under this bill at all. A drought situation is very difficult to control. I do not want to be over-critical, but a country which is fighting a war and has a opinion, be spared the difficulties of drought. The honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Pollard) will know that in farming areas there is a saying, "" It never rains but what it pours "", and, consequently, the Australian primary producer has to face all that is meant by war, drought and a Labour Governvernment are shown by the necessity to introduce this bill. It is my intention to say something about the underlying causes, which will have to be faced by this Parliament, in association with the State Parliaments, 'before we shall be able to properly appreciate what the drought position a-eally means to Australia and, before we shall be able to devise measures which will enable us to meet the difficulties with which the Government is faced. Rainfall is the most important factor in this country, but, unfortunately, rainfall is a very doubtful quantity over very large areas of Australia. We have been in the habit of talking rather glibly about our huge land resources. Certainly we have the land, but not the rainfall necessary to make it effectively and consistently productive. There is a certain periodicity in the rainfall returns which tells any student of agricultural matters that about every thirteen years we run into a major drought. I can just remember the 1902 drought. Then came the 1914 drought There was a big drought in 1927, 1928 and 1929-the e years of it ! Now we have the drought of 1943 and 1944. Whether this year will be succeeded by another next year remains to be seen, but, if we are faced with, a three year drought this time, as we were in 1927-28-29, I shudder to think what will be Australia's position twelve months hence, and for some time after that, in regard to grain, dairy products and meat.",40,States Grants Drought Relief Bill 1944 Second Reading
215,Mr Archie Cameron (Barker),,42,States Grants Drought Relief Bill 1944 Second Reading
216,Tralian Country Party ( Mr Mcewen),"The next thing that strikes one is that if one looks at the map of AustraliaI am afraid there is not much study of geography in this Parliament-is that our country can be divided roughly into five types. First, there are small areas in various parts of the interior which can be classified only as desert. There can be no argument about that. Then, well over half of Australia must be classified as arid, because the average rainfall is under 10 inches, and that rainfall is not consistent. If we had a consistent 10-inch rainfall over that area, it would be a very different matter, but we do not have it, and, in many cases, k is well below 10 inches. Then, we have another belt of kind, which is ]mrely pastoral country, pastoral because it can maintain a consistent number of sheep. Inside that we have our real agricultural country which normally would not be affected by legislation of the type that we are discussing to-night. Still further inside that, we have, our intensive agricultural areas. Those are dotted in various places according to the location of irrigation, and they do not conform to some of the conditions which apply to the other four areas. Dealing with settled areas which will the affected by this bill, most of the money will be expended in what one may call light rainfall and light soil areas. begin, in the west and then there is a semicircle starting in South Australia atid running across the gulfs and the River Murray-the River Murray is crossed twice-righ t up into New South Wales. That is the country which will be chiefly the subject of the benefits, such Australian wheat industry. The subject of as they are, which this bill will provide. A lot has been said lately about soil erosion. There cannot be any effective discussion of the drought problem unless we are prepared to face the facts in regard to soil erosion. within the Opposition ranks last year. and I have seen erosion in the Labour ranks. I have seen a Labour party of 30 members before the elections come back with only four members. I shall see that again. I shall be here to welcome the remnants of this Government. As I was saying, however, there are many factors which one must consider in dealing with drought and soil erosion. It is utterly impossible for the Commonwealth Government to deal effectively with the drought problem by way of assistance unless it is prepared to deal with the underlying causes of drought conditions in Australia. We have to recognize that a good deal of land has been cut up in four of the agricultural States for the growing of wheat and, to a lesser extent, oats and barley-whic h as a matter of fact are only sidelines in this country-in areas in which the Lord never intended wheat to be grown at all, in many cases owing to the insane policy which usually emanates from the Labour party. Emanating from that side, we frequently get-w e have it in New South Wales todaya hue-and-^ry in favour of cutting lip large estates. My experience over a long period of years has been that in too many cases the result of that policy has been that good stations have been cut up to make bad. farms. That applies in every State. In those areas in which wheat-growing can be carried on, the light soil and light rainfall country, I think the first question to be settled is that of rainfall. After that there is the question of soil. A lot of the money that will be expended undier this bill will go into areas where the soil is not fit for Those areas continuousproduction of wheat, at any rate production on the scale on which the farming community has carried it on in years gone by, not always, owing to the wishes of a lot of the farmers, but owing to the conditions that they must face because of the economic structure of the Soil is very important. If you have light soil and high rainfall there is a certain amount of risk in cultivation because the soil may be washed away, but, where you have light soil and light rainfall, you run up against the difficulty that you may clear too much of your timber or subdivide your ground perhaps not enough, or fallow too consistently. You may sow too many crops on ground which is stubble ground. Furthermore, there is a tendency in a lot of such country to burn stubble which should be ploughed in.

I could tell that it was New South Wales dust, because it was so red. I say to the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully) I do not know where he got the title of Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, because "" Agriculture "" is not mentioned in the Constitution honourable member saw was the result of the ravages of private enterprise. tell the Minister for Home Security( Mr Lazzarini), who knows no more about agriculture than he knows about finance, that the great bulk of this land is not privately-owned but is Crown leasehold. For the benefit of the Minister, whose education has been so sadly neglected and delayed, I point out that the States laid down in those leases certain covenants with which the landholder must comply in order to retain nants. break the covenants, the State has its remedy, and in all States but two, we have governments of the same political colour as this Commonwealth Government. One of the things which must be That is the principle which undertaken by governments in much of this country, is the provision of cover.

In a great many cases, the country under discussion now has been cleared too much. Too much timber and too much undergrowth has gone from This is a matter dealing it. In some cases, the areas which were allotted by the Crown were too small. In other cases, the areas allotted were subdivided, and farms which were established on too small an area were brought into production. Those things bring their own difficulties, such as the difficulty of over-capitalization. In addition figure, and the interest burden became too great. A good deal of that is due, not to Government action, but to the fact that many farmers believe that they can get more out of the soil than the fellow next door, and they are prepared to pay Â£1 or 10s. an acre more than the land is worth.

228,Mr Archie Cameron,"I amthese competitions where men have paid much more for ground than it was worth. As soon as conditions arise such as those which we faced in .South Australia from 1927-29, followed by good crops but record low prices, there must be a break. One of the criticisms which I offer against land-holders in this country-and I speak as one of that class, if I may use the Murray Pine, which is one of the that word, though not in the sense in which it is used by other honourable members opposite-is that they endeavour to take too much out of the soil without putting anything back. In order to get a quick crop, the stubble and grass is burnt off the ground, instead of being ploughed in for the purpose of building up the soil. Then, again, too much of this country affected by drought has been denuded of all cover. There seems to be an insane desire in this country to destroy trees. I fully appreciate the reason. Our grandparents came here to a perfectly virgin continent and everything they saw around them was scrub and forest, and, therefore, an axe was one of the most popular implements on the place. In all too many cases, the axe and the scrub roller are still popular in Australia. Afforestation is not popular. The tendency is to destroy everything in the way of timber, shrubs and grasses without putting anything in their place. In this connection, I greatly admire the work of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research; but I believe that the number of men engaged on the job is not sufficient for the task ahead of the Commonwealth, and that the money allotted is not sufficient. These men must virtually scour the world in order to select suitable grasses, shrubs and trees that will thrive under certain conditions, perhaps with a little protection and assistance, in some of the country which we have completely denuded of the native flora. In my opinion, one of the worse features of Australia's light soil country contributing to the devastating effects of drought, is vermin such as rabbits. The destruction done by cattle is not great. I have a violent objection to them at certain times. Sheep have their own particular way of going around and destroying native flora, but the rabbit leaves practically nothing. That is the reason why in great areas of pastoral and light agricultural country in Australia practically all the trees, shrubs and herbage have disappeared. The moment a seedling appears above the ground, the rabbit bites it off. So many of our trees will not continue to grow once the main stem has been bitten off by a rabbit or any other animal. I refer in particular to best soil holders that we have. As soon as the centre stem of a seedling is bitten off, the tree ceases to grow any higher. The seedling has not a very high food value for the rabbit, but such vermin will eat anything green. That applies to many of the shrubs in this country and to many of the native trees in the light rainfall areas. Consequently, we get the indisputable fact that the Diamentina and the Cooper, two rivers that carried flood waters from north-western Queensland into Lake Eyre for unknown centuries, have not flooded since 1914. The reason is that the rabbit became Â« pest in those areas 30 years ago, and denuded the sand ridges of the cover which the Almighty, in His wisdom, placed on them; and sand began to drift, so that the rivers became blocked and the flood waters which formerly went into Lake Eyre are now wasted in areas of sand and rubbish in the north-eastern portion of. iSouth Australia, and in Queensland itself. Perhaps those remarks are outside the scope of this bill, which is to grant relief to drought-stricken producers of certain cereals. speech on soil erosion. to show that soil erosion is one of the biggest problems connected with drought, and unless the Government is prepared to tackle the problem, all we shall get every few years will be demands on the Parliament for money to assist droughtstricken producers. ""Whilst this bill is satisfactory for the purposes for which it is drafted, it does not deal with the underlying causes of these drought conditions. Those conditions are not improving. They are growing worse every few years, due to causes which I have described. vernment which will ever take measures to combat soil erosion.",44,States Grants Drought Relief Bill 1944 Second Reading

ARCHIE CAMERON -If there is any truth in the theory of reincarnation, I am sure that the Minister for Information will be a bantam rooster, because he is a great one to crow. I never take the attitude that one should criticize the Government or any legislation without putting up some constructive proposals for consideration. I have had some years' experience-al l too many, I am afraid, for my pocket--of farming in the areas which I have been describing. The destruction of vermin, the conservation of soil, the limitation of fallowing and the absolute prohibition of fallowing of certain types of soil if that soil is to be held, are matters that must receive attention. But there are certain things which I should like to make compulsory for every land-holder in that type of country to do. One is the provision of fodder. Hay is perhaps the commonest. In some areas, the provision of ensilage is quite feasible but in very few areas do we see that attempted. ""WhatI am about, to say may savour a little of party politics, but I recall that in 1940 the then Minister for Commerce, Sir Earle Page, introduced legislation for the provision, of fodder reserves in Australia. honourable gentleman ever did about i l was done about it. The right honourable gentleman went overseas on a mission of importance, and displayed such competence that the Labour Government kept him in London for over a year. He.was the best man that the Government could find for the job. The Government must tackle the problem of fodder conservation. Admittedly, constitutional limitations may restrict its activities in this respect, but I believe that those limitations were overcome in the legislation introduced in 1940. I 3ee no reason why next year the Government should not proceed to give effect to the principle laid, down in that legislation and approved by a previous Parliament. They would go a good way towards overcoming fodder difficulties. Mr ""WILSON I remind the honourable member that this Government did attempt to do that, and provided a grant for the States. honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Wilson) is one of the chief defenders of the Government, and politically is bound to defend a Government which he helped to assume office, I am prepared to discuss that matter with him. and not indulge in party politics for politics sake. something that I know nothing about. The provision of fodder is most important. I am quite sure, speaking with some knowledge of the farming community, that the legislation introduced in 1940 would secure all that I want. I would be prepared to go so far as to make the cutting of a. certain percentage of crops for the conservation of fodder, one of the necessary conditions attaching to the holding of land in the country that I have been describing. That should, be compulsory, but I doubt whether the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Pollard) would agree. difficult, to administer, and that would necessitate increasing the army of bureaucrats, about which the honourable member right has complained. them inSouth Australia already. They are called District Agricultural In spectors. They go all over the place, and could administer the scheme. Another thing which should be compulsory on all holdings in that type of country is the keeping of one year's seed wheat in reserve on the farm. That is not done today. I realize that this may be difficult in view of the financial circumstances of many growers in these districts. Usually they are no sooner over one drought than they are into another, or they strike a period of low prices. However, I contend that the conditions which I have mentioned should attach to the holding of land, just as in the time of Henry VIII . it was laid down that in order to establish the linen industry in the United Kingdom, every farmer holding 60 acres had to sow a quarter of an acre of flax. There should also be a definite restriction upon the number of stock carried by any holding.

238,Mr Archie Cameron,"We have done through the State Governments. that the matter is one which could be brought before the Australian Agricultural Council, of which the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture is chairman. T know some of the Ministers who are members of that council, and I am sure that any such proposal would receive a sympathetic hearing. There is no better Minister for Agriculture in Australia than Mr Wise, of Western Australia. Another practical man who has just taken over the job of Minister for Agriculture in South Australia is Mr Canberra on two occasions lately did not Jenkins-. The next suggestion which I have to make is that there should be a restriction on fallowing. There are certain types of light soil in low rainfall areas which should not be fallowed. The object should be to provide that soil with cover. Experiments should be carried out to ascertain the best type of grasses for this purpose. several grasses obtained from the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, and I have found one, a grass from central Asia, which has produced reasonable -results. The value of soil under covering grasses or shrubs will not be great, but if that is not done the economic value of the country Under drift will be nothing at all. In addition, the. d r if t soil will spread over adjacent areas, for the permanent betterment of the covering good soil, and reducing still further the capacity to control that type of colintry. The covering of soil, whether by grass, Shrubs or trees, will have to be made compulsory. I shall deal with one other aspect of the matter. When we come through a drought period of two years, such as that which has afflicted the northern part of my electorate and portions also of the electorates of the honourable members for Wakefield ( Mr Smith) and Grey( Mr history by introducing this measure. It Russell), we find that the drift has been blown over heavier soils in surrounding -country. The drought may be followed by two or three good seasons, duringwhich the drift will grow good crops, but when the dry weather returns, crops on this land will die quicker than any other <srt>ps. Furthermore, that drift will again start to move, usually towards the northeast. I recall when one of my neighbours walked off his farm in 1928, his brother-in-law said, "" It ' s no use. Your farm will catch you up on the track"". That virtually is the position. This job is not finished when Parliament a.grees to the expenditure of this money. In fact, that is only the beginning of the job. Real measures must be taken to conserve the soil of this country. I am not referring to Central Australia, because four-fifths of Central Australia does not have the agricultural conditions which produce the difficulties with-which we . are faced to-day. The dust which has blown over come from Central Australia; it came from the Riverina, the northern portion of the Wimmera, from South Australia, or from somewhere along the western slopes of New South Wales. Central Australia is not cultivated, and it never will be. It is purely pastoral country. It will carry a bullock to so many square miles, or in some areas, a sheep to so many acres. I have experimented with That is not the type of country in which drift and drought problems are encountered. These problems are to be found in the light soil and low rainfall areas which under certain conditions will grow wheat, oats, barley, rye, and other similar crops. Unless the Government is prepared to tackle the problem in the manner which I have suggested, and deal not in palliatives which may ease the position for perhaps twelve months, but in a concrete way country, money voted Under legislation of this kind, acceptable though it may be to the recipients, will be practically wasted. It is regrettable that nature should have treated this country so unkindly that it is necessary for the Government to come to tlie assistance of a large section of primary producers in drought-stricken areas. Once again, the Government is making ni'a'de history first in this regard by granting assistance to unfortunate individuals wbo suffered losses in the recent disastrous bush, fires in Victoria.

I was interested to near the honourable member for Indi state a case for some assistance to be rendered, through the medium of a grant of this sort, to the people, who, by reason of drought, have suffered and probably will suffer losses of stock. It is true that many sheepowners in this country have suffered and will suffer severely in the present drought. Probably, some of them have suffered and will suffer as heavily as those whd are wheat-growers. But it is also true that many of them are both wheat-growers and lamb-raisers, and when they receive assistance on account of the drought having effected their wheat crop they will be given a substantial amountto meet the position which they face in regard to their stock. Giving illustrations with a view to showing how these people are suffering, the honourable member made a statement which implied that the stock markets, particularly the store stock markets, in Australia to-day, are at a very low ebb in relation to prices. That statement is untrue. I challenge the honourable gentleman to go into the Parliamentary Library now, and peruse the coliuntis of the Melbourne Herald, in which are published the market reports for store sheep within the last month. Invariably, the heading is, "" Store sheep market firm"". tion of graziers who have been burnt out in the western district, in addition to the comparatively sound financial position of many of the primary producers of this country as the result of the policy of the present Government, which includes the payment of a bounty of 6d. a bushel on certain wheat, many stock-owners are able to. hold their stock on their farms. That was riot the position in former drought, years. Recently, a farmer told me that he had sold his wheat, had received full payment for it under the Scully plan, and had boughtback 300 bags at a concession of 6d. a bushel. I can remember some of the past droughts; I passed through them. Invariably, under past governments, the Mr Pollard.. farmer was in such an unfortunate position that he had many of his sheep on lien from the auctioneers. ""When unfavourable seasonal conditions were encountered, and the risk looked to be rather dangerous, his banker Or his nuctioneer would whisper i i i his ear, "" Bill, old boy, the skies are looking bad. i^ou owe me Â£300 on these sheep. Yo'i had better put them in the market nest week "". .Faced with the knowledge that, if he hung on and the position became worse his indebtedness to the auctioneer might increase, and he would not be able to discharge it, the unfortunate farmer would send his sheep to tbe market. To-day, these people, comparatively, are financially strong. That is one of the reasons why, during this drought, they are not. rushing sheep into the store stock market and sacrificing them as they did on previous occasions. sold for 3d. a head recently. about sheep being sold at 3d. a head. The honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) knows as well as I do that sheep sold at that price are not worth taking out of the yard. Recently, I went to the Bendigo store stock market with the intention of taking advantage of the drought. My experience of past, droughty conditions has been that invariably the farmer flooded the store stock market and sheep were picked up comparatively cheaoly. There were three pens of store sheep in that great marketOwing to the competi-ol d "" crackers "" which one could not drive outof the yard; They realized from Is. 6d. to Is. lOd. a head, and that is all they were worth. The position of men who have stock of that sort has been cited by the honourable member for Indi in order to stress the financial sufferings of the stock-raisers in this country. Not only have I studied the stock market reports, but I have also visited the store stock markets. At Newmarket, I have seen good lines of weaners, breeding ewes, and store sheep of any kind^ realize good prices.

I congratulate the Government upon the introduction of this legislation which will prove to be most helpful to those suffering from the effect of the drought. In directly, it will be of benefit to persons other than farmers inasmuch as it will create a sense of security among those who are economically dependent upon the wheat industry. I listened with great interest to the constructive remarks of the honourable member for Barker( Mr must be dealt with on a national basis. Cameron) on soil erosion. I do not propose to embark upon a discussion on soil erosion and its attendant problems, but I am heartily in 0 agreement with much of what the honourable member said. carrying out of many of his suggestions would involve the creation of a very wide-spread bureaucracy. State officials would have to place all sorts of restrictions upon individual farmers, and the farmers have always resented official interference of any kind. Official's would have to be given authority to tell the farmer how many sheep he should carry, what crops he should grow and how he should grow them. In fact, the bureaucratic idols which it would be necessary to set up would far exceed in number the wicked images which the honourable member and his colleagues succeeded in casting down during the recent referendum campaign. However, although I recognise the difficulties of administering any scheme for controlling the erosion, I recognize also that some action is urgently necessary. I believe that when the time comes for the Government to act it will do so in the same practical manner in which it has dealt with so many other problems. of the Australian Country party) [9.49]. amendment moved by my colleague, the honourable member for Indi( Mr McEwen). The introduction of this measure is an indication that the Governmenit realizes the seriousness of the drought, but it also indicates that, in the opinion of the Government, the drought is confined to the States mentioned in the bill. The bill provides that relief shall be paid, only to the growers of cereal crops. As a matter of fact, the drought is not by any means confined to the States mentioned in the bill, and, of course, its adverse effects are felt by many farmers other than cereal-growers. Under this provision, the Commonwealth is to provide Â£1,500,000, and the States of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia are between them to provide another Â£1,500,000. So widespread is the drought that the matter This drought, which is having such disastrous effects throughout Australia, is all the more serious in its effect because of the waricreated difficulties under which farmers are compelled to However, the operate. A further consideration is that the drought has come upon us at a time when we are obliged to feed, not only our own citizens, but also members of the Allied Forces in this area. In addition, we are required to send supplies to the United Kingdlom and. other countries. The purpose of the amendment is to enlarge the scope of the bill. We submit that the amount provided is not enough to give adequate relief to those affected by the drought. It cannot be denied that industries other than those covered in the .bill should receive consideration. The honourable member for Ballarat said that governments supported by honourable members on this side bf the House had never given any practical assistance to the wheat industry, and he applauded the present Government for having granted Â£200,000 last year for the relief of bushfire victims in Victoria.

249,Mr Fadden (Darling Downs,"Leade rthis side of the House made available over the years the following assistance to the wheat-growers:Year11134-35 1935-36 193839 193940 .. 2,486,000 194.0-41 1941-42 The 1940-41 budget, which I presented to this House, provided Â£2,770,000 for drought relief to .the wheat industry, and there was a condition that repayments should be made by the States in four annual instalments, commencing .three years after the making of the grant, the Commonwealth to meet interest charges in full for the first eighteen months. Under the proposals now before the House the Government proposes to make available only Â£1,500,000, and certain States are to provide between them a similar amount, although this is the most disastrous drought since 1902. answer to the charge that non-Labour governments did nothing to help rural industries. It is obvious that the production of beef, mutton, lamb, pork and dairy products, as well as vegetables and wheat will be seriously affected by the drought. The Government is providing assistance for cereal-growers, but it is essential that relief should also be afforded to other classes of primary producers who have been hit by the v drought, and who normally play an important part on the food front. Drought relief should be tackled on a comprehensive scale, and the matter is one of extreme urgency. Unless we are favoured with extraordinarily good falls of rain in the near future the whole of our rural production will be adversely affected, and the Government will, perforce, have to revise its food goals. The starting point of all measures for social justice must be rural production, because everything is based upon it. Rural production must be stabilized if the Government is to be in a position to discharge its national and Droughts, and the problems arising out of them, should receive the earnest consideration of the Government and the consideration should not be on party lines. This should be a national matter. Mr Fadden. In the first speech I made in this House in 1937, I referred to the problem of drought, and said that an authority Â£ should be set up to grapple with it. If .. 4,049,000 the drought continues there must be food .. .. 1,915,000 shortages in Australia. Farmers will not .. 1,808,000 be able to comply with the request of .. 2,770,000 the Government to produce more food. .. 3,770,000 For some years now they have laboured under the difficulty of a man-power shortage, and now they are afflicted by drought. A recent suggestion commends itself to me, and I offer it to the Government for its consideration. It is that a survey should be made of stocks of grain, hay, chaff, mill-offals, linseed meal and other kinds of fodder now available with the object of ensuring that they are used in such a way that Australia as a wi>ole will derive the maximum benefit. Another proposal is that servicemen in camps and depots throughout Australia should be made available for emergency farm Those figures are an effective work. When I discussed fodder conservation in 1937, I emphasized the need for Parliament to concern itself with the matter of drought alleviation. I quoted the experience of Queensland, because figures dealing with that State were the only ones available to me. As far back as 1894 there were 7,000,000 cattle in Queensland. The. economic depression which followed, together with the drought of 1902, had the effect of reducing the number of cattle in that State to 2,500,000 by 1903. By 1921 the number had again risen to 7,000,000, but by 1928 it had declined to 5,000,000. Notwithstanding the activities of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and the relief measures which were applied from time to time, the number of cattle in Queensland to-day is only 6,500,000, or 500,000 less than in 1894. In the case of sheep, there was some variation. A peak .of 21,700,000 was reached in 1892. This dropped to 7,200,000 in 1902. In 1921 it was reduced international responsibilities. from 23,000,000 to 16,000,000 by drought, increased to 20,700,000 in 1925 and reduced again to less than 17,000,000 by the 1926 drought. In 1935 drought caused a decrease of 2,500,000, bringing the flocks down to 18,000,000. The latest figures place sheep flocks in Queensland a!23,200,000 at the 31st March, 1944a decline of more than 2,000,000 compared with March, 1943. According to the Queensland Economic News the most significant feature of the operations in 1943-44 was the steep decline of the number of sheep, the sharpest fall being in tbe central west, .flhe north-west and the far west. The journal goes on to say that there are strong indications that in Queensland the number of sheep will continue to decline, one of the factors being the drought which prevailed in the Roma and south-western divisions throughout the autumn and winter months. According to the Commonwealth Statistician's approximate figures about 3,300,000 sheep were lost through drought in Queensland in the year ended December, 1935; 396,000 in 1936; 622,000 in 1937; 1,200,000 in 1938 and 758,000 in 1939. Over a nine-years period between 1926 and 1935 approximately 2,000,000 sheep a year were lost in Queensland, definitely as a result of d.rought, and if we go back that the Government should, without furto 1937 Queensland had fewer sheep than in 1S91 and 500,000 fewer cattle than in 1895. ""When these losses of valuable Stock in Queensland are considered in conjunction with the losses in other States the decline in the national wealthto Australia. The Australian Country producing capacity of the country must he brought into bold relief. Only production will stabilize this country's economy. Having regard to the Government's financial policy, Australia obviously must look to increased production to prevent insolvency through disastrous inflation and to stabilize purchasing power. If our economic stability is to be maintained something must be done to check the disastrous losses caused by drought and soil erosion. The preent Government is not fully alive to the seriousness of the position. There is no use in tackling the enormous problem of drought and soil erosion piecemeal. It must be tackled withdrawing the bill for redrafting. The on a. national scale without delay. The Government has brought down a bill providing for the distribution of a meagre Â£1,500,000, to which certain State governments must add the same amount, making Â£3,000,000 in all, but the disbursement of the money will be limited to the growers of cereal crops, although the disastrous effects of the drought are' apparent through every branch of primary production. The importance of the stability of our rural industries to the nation's economic well-being is such that no expense should be spared in solving the problem. Drought and erosion have destroyed valuable natural assets and reduced production to the danger point. Therefore, the Australian Country party considers that ibis measure does not go far enough, and ic is for that reason that we have submitted an amendment to the House. Actually, soil erosion is a menace equal to that of an enemy. It is even more menacing in that while Australia can vanquish an enemy, the menace of soil erosion will become more acute unless it is attacked with foresight, realism and vigour. To do this it is essential that Australia should have the benefit of the experience of American scientists and engineers with a first-hand knowledge of the problem. It is imperative, therefore, ther delay, send Australian scientists and engineers to the United States of America or invite that country to send scientists and engineers here to advise and plan to combat this menace party, with its knowledge of the effects of drought, is not prepared to accept without protest the amount of relief proposed and the means of distribution, and consequently we have placed before the House the amendment so ably expounded by the honourable member for Indi. support in principle the amendment moved by the honourable member for Indi of introducing it into a bill for assistance to cereal-growers who are so urgently in need of assistance that I would deprecate the delay that would be involved in supreme consideration is to provide the proposed relief to the cereal growers as quickly as possible. Therefore I hope that there will be no delay in the passage of the bill. From wheat areas in my own electorate and other parts of the country, I am receiving communications urging me to press upon the Government the need to give, as expeditiously as possible, the relief proposed by this",51,States Grants Drought Relief Bill 1944 Second Reading

251,"( Mr Mcewen), But I Doubt The Wisdom","bill whereby Â£3,000,000 will be provided by tbe Commonwealth in conjunction with certain States. The amount is not over-generous, and I should, have liked to see it raised, but in all the circumstances, I accept it as reasonable, for it will provide fairly substantial assistance to those who have suffered from this severe drought, especially those who are in their second year of drought. Last night the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) adopted a very co-operative attitude and suggested that the measure should be debated on non-party lines. That was a commendable approach to the measure. From the political point of view, it was a wise approach because, after all, the record of governments with which the right honourable gentleman was associated with were not wonderful in respect of assistance to the wheat industry. It is true that previous governments have provided substantial relief to wheat farmers by way of bounties when, wheat prices have* been low, and also by the provision of moneys for adjustment of farmers' debts. As drought conditions occur at all too frequent intervals throughout the Australian wheat-belt, I believe that it is essential, as an adjunct to stability in the industry, that a growers' provident fund be established to which growers could have recourse to tide them over periods of drought instead of having to appeal to governments for assistance. A simple and effective scheme would be to make a deduction of a fractional amount from each bushel of wheat marketed each year, and to place this in a general fund which the Commonwealth Government could supplement by a similar amount. The amounts contributed in this way could then be credited to each individual grower and shown in a pass book. ""When drought or other similar visitation occurred, and only then would the wheat-grower be permitted to have recourse to this fund, except in the case of retirement from the industry or the death of the wheat grower, whereupon the full amount remaining to his credit in the fund could be released, I suggest also that the fund be exempt from all forms of levying or distraint during the whole period in which the grower-contributor is actually engaged in the growing of wheat and is a Mr Wilson. registered wheat-grower. I suggest also that the fund be exempt from taxation, at least until death or retirement. This plan would, I submit, confer a further needed degree of stability, on both the large and the small wheat-farmer, in that it would provide ready finance in adverse seasons, and when farmers did not draw upon the fund it would accumulate to form a retiring or superannuation fund of considerable value to the recipients in the latter years of life. As the fund accumulated it could be suitably invested after the estimated liquid requirements for administration and seasonal needs were provided for. Administration could be handled comfortably and cheaply by such bodies as the Australian Wheat Board or the Wheat Stabilization Committee. That is the principle of a plan which I have always had in mind as something which would obviate our having to come to the Government pleading for a substantial sum of money to assist wheat-growers .who have met with adverse seasons and consequently, as on this occasion, are not financially able to carry on. Such a fund would remove the wheat industry from its dependence on politics. The industry has been the subject of political moves for many years, and it would be all to the good if it could be removed from that undesirable atmosphere. We have seen exhibitions in this chamber of the industry being made the plaything of party politics, and it would be infinitely better for every one concerned, and from the national standpoint, if the matter could be lifted from the sphere of party politics. I propose to enlarge on the idea which I submitted for a provident fund for primary producers. Assuming that there was a marketable crop of 120,000,000 bushels actually delivered, a levy of Id. a. bushel imposed on the growers would produce an aggregate sum of Â£500,000 in that year. With a similar contribution by the Government, the total would be Â£1,000,000. ' On that basis, in five years, the total fund would reach Â£5,000,000, plus increments from the investment of the funds. A grower who marketed 1,000 bags, or 3,000 bushels, would contribute, at the rate of Id. a bushel, the sum of Â£12 10s. After five years, with 'the addition of the government subsidy. his credit in the fund would be Â£125. Five years is the period during which we would not expect a recurrence of drought. It is a fairly conservative estimate. I regard the grower of 1,000 bags as thy -smallest wheat producer. A grower who produces 1,500 bags, or 4,500 bushels, would contribute Â£18 15s. a year, and in five years his credit with the government subsidy would be Â£187 10s. A wheat grower with 2,000 bags, or 6,000 bushels, would pay Â£25 a year and in five years, with the government subsidy added, his credit would be Â£250. I give those examples in order to indicate the sums which would accrue for the benefit of the average wheat-grower. Increments from those investments would be added, and with the effluxion of time,*if the fund was drawn into international schemes. Therenot drawn on, would amount to a considerable sum. Those are ideas which I submit to the Government in all sincerity as a method by which we can put the matter of drought relief out of the sphere of party politics in the future. It is a simple plan, and the details could easily be worked out. The Government's contribution maj"" appear to be considerable, but it already pays out from Consolidated Revenue huge sums for superannuation schemes, invalid and old-age pensions and other social services. A provident fund for primary producers should be brought into the same category. These people are performing a national service of great importance, and should be afforded the protection of a provident or insurance scheme. Previous governments have had their own methods of providing assistance to primary producers in times of drougnt and low prices. Whilst the sums provided have been substantial, the benefits have not been continuous, and we must aim at something, as the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) said, which will give them a final degree of stability and' will place the industry on a firm footing in future. Surely the objective must be to get away from these appeals for assistance, which have to be made from time to time in this Parliament and other Parliaments, and to put the industry on a basis where the money will be automatically available to the growers in time of drought. I realize that money is not the only requirement for the purpose of obviating drought. We must also include some form of fodder conservation, and the storing of reserves. On previous occasions I have dealt with the principle of the normal granary so ably advocated by the Vicepresident and Secretary for Agriculture of the United States of America, Mr Henry Wallace. A plan should be evolved to have a continuous supply in reserve, so that in the event of drought We shall always be able to meet our commitments at home and maintain our markets abroad. The wheat-growing indiistry is becoming more and' more international in outlook, and as a country which plays a major part in the export of wheat, Australia is gradually being fore, we must carefully examine the whoie problem in order that we shall be better prepared for adverse seasons: Prom the standpoint of finance, the wheat-growing industry is marginal to a very great degree. Some little time ago, a bill was introduced into this Parliament to establish a mortgage department of the Commonwealth Bank, and we hoped that it would have been a useful unit in re-organizing the finances of ho4 farmers. After all, the majority of the wheat-farmers, as has been shown byinvestigations, are still in precarious financial circumstances, To-day they are able-disregardin g the drought--to meet their current commitments and to carry on in a reasonable manner. Many of them are not entirely "" broke "". They still have a little reserve, largely as the result of better prices for wheat, wool and lambs during the past two or three years. That is one thing for which we are very grateful. But we must have some re-organization of farm finance, and I trust that the matter will be taken into consideration and plans evolved for the better stability of the industry in future. It is vitally important that that should be done. The honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron), who made a very good contribution to the debate, referred to soil erosion. That danger has been brought home to all of us recently by the disastrous conditions that we are experiencing, with the lifting of the soil in dry areas where the ground is hare of any herbage. The soil is blowing through the air, and we are face to face with a serious problem, the magnitude of which is not so widely realized as it should be. Only those of us who live in those dry areas appreciate the menace. I hope that the Government, in planning for the future, will take into consideration the necessity for providing much larger sums of money to combat soil erosion than have been provided in the past. The reason for this trouble is largely economic. Land has been cleared under our system of economics, and has been made available, and the competition for the land whether to buy, rent or select it has been keen. The value of the land has been artificially raised by this competition, and, therefore, it becomes necessary for the owner or the lessee to get the utmost from the soil either by stocking or cropping it. So we get intense cultivation in those areas, which are largely marginal, where wheat and sheep are produced in conjunction. That leads to soil erosion. If we could have a system of leasehold rather than freehold, where the Government would own the land and fix the proper productive value and charge the lessee accordingly, we should overcome much of the trouble caused by overstocking, overcropping, overcultivation and overclearing. The last-named is the basic cause of the trouble in our lighter soil areas, which comprise the majority of the wheat-growing lands of Australia. I hope that these matters will not be made the plaything of party politics, but that this Parliament will apply itself in the future to deal with them on a purely national basis. I am in complete agreement with the plea made to-night for the granting of assistance to\ primary producers other than cereal-growers, who are suffering as a result of the drought. of thousands of sheep and other stock have perished, and others have had to be sacrificed at very low prices. Restocking will be a great problem for people on grazing properties. The ability to carry on will present another problem. SoI urge the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture to provide relief for that section as well as the cereal-growers. Mr Wilson. Whatever is done in that direction will have my support. But I should not like to jeopardize or delay the passage of this measure, or to have it withdrawn and redrafted as suggested by the honourable hope that at a later stage he will see the wisdom of not proceeding with the amendment. ber will have to vote on it. tation in doing so. The honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Pollard) explained the difficulty of introducing any proper scheme for establishing reserves of hay and other fodder. Reference was made to attempts by former Ministers for Commerce to achieve that result. I interjected when the honourable member for Barker was speaking that two or three years ago the present Government had made available to the Sta es tlie sum of + Â£500,000 for the purpose of financing schemes for fodder conservation and retaining stocks of hay on a basis to be worked out by them.. I do not know to what extent the States availed themselves of that offer, but it is still within the ambit of their activities and authority to evolve such a plan. Some of the States did not accept the offer, but others did so, though I am not aware to what degree. But there we have the problem of trying to arouse sufficient interest in a scheme, such as conserving fodder. It is a difficult job, and must be left largely to the farmers themselves. Regarding other sections that have been affected by adverse seasonal conditions this year, I was reminded by the honourable member for Barker of the severe blow that has been dealt to many citrus-growers. In my electorate in particular, large areas of citrus trees have been completely wiped out by severe frosts. Many returned soldier settlers and others in those areas Hundreds are practically bankrupt as the result af that disastrous visitation. I plead with the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture and with the Government to ensure that something will be done for that section of the primary producing community also.

254,Mr Wilson,"I shall have no hesi"" Â£10,000,000 steal"" I can only say that I regard it as purely political piffle. Certainly it is not based on fact. I accept the assurance given by the Government to the representatives of the industry and to myself that when the pools are .finalized, whatever it has cost to subsidize the sale of cheap stock feed, will be made up to the growers. I believe that assurance will be honoured. alcohol schemes? very little power alcohol has been produced in the distilleries set up for that purpose. I understand that a halt has been called because wheat is not in sufficient abundance to justify its use for the production of power alcohol. The establishment of the power alcohol industry was recommended by a commission appointed by a previous government, the idea being to produce power alcohol only when them was ample wheat available, which was the case at that time. I understand that the payment of a subsidy has been taken into consideration also, and is covered by the undertaking given by the Minister. alcohol has been produced at Wanracknabeal ? know. In my view, the first essential is that the money provided under this measure should reach the people whom it is intended to benefit as quickly as possible. Their need is most urgent. I trust that the measure will have a speedy passage and that the Government will urge the States concerned to speed up the machinery of distribution. compliment the Government upon the introduction of this measure. The drought which is now being experienced over a large portion of this continent is the worse, in my time, not only in my own electorate, but in all the affected areas. During the last few weeks I have travelled from Deniliquin, in the south of my electorate, to Brisbane, and the only areas which I saw in good condition were the irrigation districts and the land along extreme conditions, they have been comthe Clarence River. I fear that when a final assessment is made of the total wheat acreage which has failed entirely, it will be found that the amount of money required to compensate growers will exceed the sum provided in this measure. Indications at present are that many millions of acres will not produce any wheat at all. Possibly the financial assistance required will be Â£6,000,000 if farmers are to be paid the cost of planting. After all, some farmers in Western Australia are being paid 12s. an acre not to grow wheat, so surely farmers whose crops have failed completely are entitled to receive, by way of compensation, the actual expenses incurred by them in planting. The position of the wheat industry to-day has been covered adequately by previous speakers, and I shall not delay the House with repetition, nor shall I refer to what was done or was not done by previous administrations. I contend, however, that this Government has done more for the primary producers of Australia in its comparatively short term of office than was done by all preceding governments in all my experience as a primary producer. It has shown that it has a sincere understanding of primary industries. The argument advanced by the honortrue to a certain degree, but if relief were extended to the wool industry, where would the line be drawn? Probably we would find that money was being paid to wealthy pastoralists. Sheep farmers who have lost heavily in the drought have my deepest sympathy, because nobody likes to see his work and his investment lost; but to extend the scope of this measure to the wool industry would be most difficult. Practically all the fat lamb raising is carried out in the mixed farming districts, so that most farmers engaged in this activity will benefit. To use the argument advanced by the honourable member for Indi, some farmers have already received assistance, in that they have been able to re-purchase at a low price some of the wheat which they have sold. That is the case all over my own electorate. Farmers kept a certain quantity for fodder, but because of the pelled to buy back some wheat.

260,Able Member For Indi ( Mr Mcewen) Is,"way breeders of cross-bred sheep and fat lamb raisers are already receiving some benefit. My sympathy is mainly witb the wheat-grower. I compliment, the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture also upon the inclusion in this measure of provision for assistance to wheaten and oaten hay growers. It is the first time in history that this action had been taken. most difficult for individual farmers to conserve fodder, and in any scheme for the post-war rehabilitation of rural industi'ies, I suggest that consideration be given to the establishment of governmen table land and allowing land in good rainowned fodder conservation farms in districts subject to drought. The conservation of fodder of any description is an expensive That applies particularly to hay because it must be put into stacks of from 100 to 300 tons. Smaller stacks are useless if the hay is to be kept for any length of time. Most individual farmers do not conserve fodder to-day because their finances will not permit them to do so. Some of them may keep fodder for six or twelve months and then be compelled to put it on the market to enable them to meet their commitments. It is the responsibility of the nation to carry out fodder conservation schemes in areas which are affected by drought. It has always seemed to me to be wrong to cart hay and chaff from fodder-growing areas such as Junee, Coolamon, Wagga, Marrar, Matong and Ganmain to other parts of the State or Commonwealth. Why not establish government fodder conservation farms in all districts where it can be grown, and thus obviate the expensive business of transporting stock-feed from one centre to another? Fodder conservation of course is bound up largely with water conservation, which has been sadly neglected in the past. Our present drought troubles are due in no small measure to the lack of foresight on the part of previous governments. is a more or less serious drought in some part of the Commonwealth. Present conditions of course are the worse in history. I agree with the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Wilson) that every time there is a drought, wheat farmers have to come cap in hand begging Mr Langtry. for assistance. One reason for this is that at existing land values and interest rates wheat-growing has never been a payable proposition. In ,1930 the Royal Commission on the Wheat Industry found that the average. price of wheat at country sidings for the previous 25 years had been 4s. l i d . a bushel,, the result being that in the first It is low-price year growers were unable to carry on. That indicates that the industry was never on a sound financial basis, due partly, no doubt, to the fact that we' are attempting to grow wheat on unsuitfall areas to remain in very large holdings. I suggest to the Minister for Comundertaking. merce and Agriculture that the drought relief provided in this bill should be doubled, or, alternatively, that we should wait until the final figures of crop failures are known, and then provide sufficient money to compensate all growers on reasonable terms. -Unde r this measure the Commonwealth proposes to grant to four States Â£1,500,000, under certain conditions, for drought relief to the growers of cereal crops. I was very glad to hear the honourable member for Indi( Mr McEwen) move an amendment to the motion for the second reading of the bill, because this drought which the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully) has referred to as a national disaster, and which is widespread throughout the Commonwealth, affects not only cereal-growers but also other primary producers. To show how widespread it is I would like to read the report of the Wool Growers Council, dated the 14th November, on seasonal conditions throughout Australia:New South Wales -Extremely dry conditions still prevail over the greater portion of New South Wales, with the exception of Now England and some of the higher districts north of Tamwor.th and around Werris Creek Almost every year there as far as tlie top of tlie Hunter Valley.

262,( Mr Mcewen) So That The Incidmeans That In The Five War Years The Total,"an official document issued by the Acting Commonwealth Statistician, dated the 13th November, 1944, a summary of the wheat situation. On page 2 it saysThe decline of 4,200,000 acres from 1941-42 to 1943-44 was due to the continued restriction which the poultry farmers of the Comof wheat sowings under the Wheat Stabilization Plan referred to later. The document later points out that the area under wheat has continually fallen, and that there have been restrictions in Western Australia, with the payment of compensation to prevent sowing. The present position, which the Government should have anticipated, has been allowed to drift to absolute disaster. The number of sheep in Australia to-day is higher than it has been for many years, and the number of .beef cattle also is very high. The Government should have realized that this country would not always be a "" Garden of Eden "", with a reliable rainfall. It ought to have profited by the biblical story in regard to conserving during seven goods years to meet the needs of seven lean years. done while the Government supported by the honourable member was in power. have not prevailed throughout the whole of the period since we went out of office. The present Government has been in office for three years, during which there have been good seasons when it would have been possible to conserve fodder. The wheat position has been allowed to drift, not because of lack of warning. A copy of a letter dated the 28th February, 1942, addressed to the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture by the Flour Millers Association of New South Wales, statedi t is the opinion of my members that there should be no restriction of production of wheat in States which have adequate and satisfactory storage and stacking facilities. One reason for this opinion is that nature has a habit of remedying things agricultural due to seasonal changes, and if we were to have derful planning was that the board was Â» failure or destruction of crops, as Victoria and Queensland recently had failures, in a year following one in which the carry-over had been reduced to small dimensions, compared with population, the consequences could be serious. The consequences of the present drought are going to be extremely serious, because the growers of sheep and cattle, and the people engaged in dairying will suffer by reason of the position that has arisen in the wheat industry. Only yesterday, a deputation waited on the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Forde) in Canberra to place before him the desperate plight in monwealth find themselves to-day because of the failure to provide pollard and bran for their poultry, and the reduction in the flour mills, since the 1st November, from three shifts to two shifts. All this has arisen through complete lack of foresight on the part of the Government in preparing supplies for the future. When it came into office, there was in existence a Commonwealth Fodder Conservation Board. That board, although established in September, 1941, apparently did not do very much, or was prevented from doing very much by the actions of the Government. Its function was to examine the need for and to implement fodder conservation schemes. It was disbanded about March, 1943, having held eight or ten meetings. No funds .were ever made available by the Government, which sets itself up as a helper of the primary industries, and a far-sighted and all-seeing Administration. It did not do anything to assist the Fodder Conservation Board to implement its plans, or even co-operate with the States by the provision of funds that would have enabled fodder to be conserved. I understand that the Premier of New South Wales and the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture agreed to co-operate financially in a scheme propounded by the board about February, 1943. I do not know why the financial provisions of that scheme were not carried out. Nothing was done, and the position was allowed to drift into the desperate state in which we find it to-day. Publicity was given by the Fodder Conservation Board to the fact that funds were to be made available, and people were advised that loans would be provided, yet the next move in this wontold that no funds were available. The Government had a warning of what was likely to happen. On the 7th July, 1942, a meeting held at Science House, Sydney, and convened by the Australian Institute of Agricultural Science and the Australian Veterinary Association, was attended by MrE J. Eggins, chairman of the",59,States Grants Drought Relief Bill 1944 Second Reading

264,Mr Abbott,"Drought conditionsFodder Conservation Board, many other gentlemen engaged in primary production, and expert advisers from the Department of Agriculture. Suggestions were made with a view to enabling farmers to conserve fodder. It was stated that funds could be provided, out of which they could be paid for the conservation, and when the fodder ultimately was sold they could receive the difference between what they had already been paid and what was paid by the buyers! Mr Bartlett, of the Department of Agriculture, referred to the need for realism in the problem, and suggested the adoption of a plan which could be implemented within the next eighteen months. He proposed the payment to wheat-growers of an advance of 35s. a ton on hay in sheaf, and Â£2 5s. a ton on baled hay. Other speakers suggested the payment of as much as up to Â£5 a ton for baled hay. These proposals were placed before the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, but were never implemented. To-day, we are reaping the whirlwind. Two things were necessary for a successful fodder conservation scheme-man power and a guaranteed price for hay. Neither was available. It was only after a great battle that we were able to secure the release of any men at all for the primary industries. Even now, a comparatively small number has been released. ment. Minister for Munitions ( Mr Makin) has himself been one of the worse offenders, in that he has refused to release after their release. This doctor discusses labour to those ancillary industries which are essential to .the great primary industries. For instance, I had a great struggle with him and with the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr The captive realizes very quickly the loss Holloway) in order to obtain the release of two men for an undertaking engaged in the manufacture of horseshoes. A fair number of men has been released recently to the dairying industry, but on many pastoral pro|>erties old men and women are still struggling to carry on. They are fighting a losing battle, and stock arr dying because there is no one to feed them. The Government should withdraw this bill, and it should lose no time in introducing a measure which would provide a system for all primary industries adversely affected by the drought. I do not want to deprive the cereal growers of one penny, but I want to see justice done to all sections ofi the primary industry. adjourned. AND.

I asked the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Frost) some time ago what it was proposed to do for them, and he told me that they did not come within his province until they were released from the Army. I suggest that ordinary repatriation measures will not suffice for men who have suffered such hardships. I was greatly impressed by an article I read recently by a medical officer who had himself been a prisoner of war, upon the need for special treatment for these men the problem under four headings, the first being what he describes as "" the breakingin period "". He saysof friendly association, the loss of his own reputation and prestige, the absence of the sunshine of his own propaganda, and the power of the opposing propaganda. The lot of the man who was taken prisoner in France after three weeks of exhaustive retreat may well serve as an example. Within a month he was switched from the pleasant life of a pseudo-peace-time army into the grip of Nazi persecution. Bewildered by the falsity of his own propaganda and disillusioned as to the mig'ht of his own country, hungry and fatigued to the extreme, he was moved into Germany.",60,States Grants Drought Relief Bill 1944 Second Reading

269,Mr Barnard (Bass) [11.5],"W eHe refers to the sufferings endured by prisoners because of lack of clothing, shortage of food, and the mental depression which overtakes them. He then goes on to say that there is. a second period which begins immediately after their release, the period of convalescence. It is hard for such men to acquire a normal outlook again. There follows, he says, a lengthy period of boredom, and this seriously interferes with their rehabilitation into ordinary civil life. The final phase is the repatriation period, and the doctor recites his own experiences in support of his argument. He statesThe returning prisoner of war is ill-equipped for the difficult period of recreational relaxawithin the next few months. tion, and he is without the sheet-anchor of his daily routine; he has laid aside his habits of recreational relaxation, and he has lost the art of working for his living. With these handicaps he must readjust himself to his return to normal life. Should domestic trouble and unemployment further burden him he may succumb to his adversities and relinquish the struggle. It is reasonable to suppose that at this point a little help from someone who understands the position may be of great assista nee. Finally boiled down the doctor points out the need of a united effort on behalf of P.O.W. personnel who need that help to restore them to their old selves, and chiefly the report mentions the need for "" The establishment of a prisoner-of-war club in all large townswhere ex-piisoners may foregather and know that, should they require advice, there is some one attending each club who understands their difficulties and is willing to help them."" These advice centres may also be used by relatives seeking advice in handling returned prisoners, some of whom may prove difficult at home and refuse to receive any form of help. The writer has himself experienced what he describes, and he is anxious to safeguard others from the dangers which he foresees. I know of one man from my own district who has returned after having been a prisoner of war for four years. He was in Italy, France and later in Germany, and has just been repatriated. He is a single man, and has begun on that difficult period when he must rehabilitate himself in civil life. It is good that the prisoners of war recently rescued from the Japanese are, as the Acting Prime Minister told us, to be given leave, and released from the Army if they so desire when their leave is up, but I want to know what special provision is If r . Barnard. being made to enable them to settle down once more to a normal way of living. The Government should announce its policy on this matter. If there are domestic difficulties because of the long absence from Australia of prisoners of war, it is the duty of the Government to make the way easy for them. I hope that the Acting Prime Minister will give this matter his attention. If anything is being done we should be told of it, and if nothing has been done, then the matter should not be further delayed. Prisoners of war are already coming back, and I hope that they will be returning in greater numbers [11.15] I take this opportunity to place before the Government the facts of a case which I was not allowed to discuss before because it was sub judice. It concerns a young dairy-farmer who, on his return to his farm on the 9th May, was met by an inspector of the Liquid Fuel Control Board, who asked him where he had been, and was told that he had been to the railway station with a load of pigs. The inspector said: "" You have not drawn your petrol tickets. How did you get petrol to go?"" The farmer was honest enough to say he had taken it from the 6 gallons which he gets every two months for his cream separator, and that he would replace the 2 or 3 gallons when he had the opportunity to collect his tickets and buy the petrol. On the 20th .September, a summons was issued against him. This man, with the aid of his wife, has to milk 75 cows every morning and night as well as rear a young family. He is a good, honest, hard-working citizen who, his neighbours tell me, has not had a holiday for six or seven years. He had never been involved in court proceedings before. I took up his case and endeavoured to have the proceedings withdrawn. I was told to submit the matter in writing to the Liquid Fuel Control Board, Queensland, which I did. On the 13th NovemberI received the following reply:I have received your request for the withdrawal of the summons. The matter was considered by the board at a recent meeting and it was decided that it could not .accede to your request and the prosecution must proceed.",61,Adjournment Australian Prisoners Of War Petro L Rationing Australian Army Treatment Of B Class Personnel
270,Mr Bernard Corser (Wide Bay),"I could do no more than make inquiries by telegraphing the town at which the case was to be heard. I was amazed to receive the following reply:Case heard November tenth, fine total cost Â£3 8s. The reply of the Liquid Fuel Control Board was dated three days after the case had been heard! The only charge that can be levelled against this man, is that, in order to deliver his pigs to the railway trucks, he used some of the petrol to which he was entitled for his cream separator. In most districts of Australia, dairy-farmers receive their petrol for trucks, farm machinery and cream separators in one container each month and use it according to requirements. This young fellow has taken his conviction, very much to heart. I ask that the Minister concerned take action, not only to remit the fine, but also to wipe out the conviction, because it represents an injustice. Coal-miners and others are able to escape scot-free when they commit major offences, but this man has been proceeded against to the point of conviction for a technical breach of a stupid regulation, one which would not have been drawn up by any man -with common sense and a realization of the difficulties of people who live long distances from post offices. It is a crime that the victim, whose wife's four brothers enlisted in the Army, one being killed on active service, should have been taken to court and fined. criminal. hope that the conviction will be expunged and the fine remitted, that a practical man will be appointed to draft reasonable regulations, and that in future they will be properly administered. I have received from a constituent of mine a newspaper extract and certain correspondence disclosing an alarming state of affairs at a military establishment at No. 7 A.B.O.D., Gaythorne, Brisbane. The newspaper extract is as follows:BASE MENTA KE THE STRIPES. Allegations that former front-line soldiers had been degraded in rank because ""base wallahs"" in the unit already had all the stripes available, was made at a meeting of the shipbuilding sub-branch of the Returned Soldiers' League last night. The meeting carried a motion recommending that men in base jobs should be replaced by servicemen with long service who have been graded B class medically. MrK . Beaty said that ho knew of eight Oth Division men who had been "" B-classed"" into base jobs because they were medically unfit to remain in the fron t line. Two N.C.O.'s among them had been degraded in rank because "" base wallahs"" in the unit already had all the stripes available. A colonel in this unit had never been to any war and another senior oiiicer had served as a batman in the last war. ""The A.I.F. men were all entitled to wear the ribbon of the Africa Star and had been through the blood and dust and misery of two or three campaigns,"" said Mr Beaty. "" When the}' were posted to this unit under cold-footers they were utterly disgusted."" If preference to servicemen was being considered it should start in the Army, said Mr Beaty. Tlie sons of politicians should not have preference before fighting men. One politician's son who had never been overseas had a big Packard car to call for him every night. "" COLD-FOOTERS."" "" Cold-footers "" and "" indispensables "" who were occupying base jobs in the Army should be cleared out and positions made available for men who had fought and had been relegated to B class because of wounds or medical grading. "" The men I refer to were all members of a commando unit,"" said Mr Beaty. "" They have been posted to a haven of scamps and coldfooters and are being given a most unsympathetic deal. "" Deep down in their hearts these base wallahs think that the returned man is no good any more."" Mr P. W. Taylor said that men in base jobs should be sent to the fron t or should be -And treated as a fired out of the service to make room for men who had returned from active service and were still being held by the Army. A recommendation to the South-eastern District of the RSL. that inquiries be made of all employers in Queensland for a pledge on the question of preference in employment to returned servicemen was also carried. I propose to read only extracts from my constituent's letter to me. Referring to his son, the writer saysHe is 24 years old. He has been overseas, was at the Alamcin engagement, came back with the Oth Division, hurt his knee at Milne Bay. He has had the cartilage removed from both knees. He is now B class. I think the question is a matter of preference to returned men with the military. Make what use you like of the letter. He goes on to sayI feel he is getting discontented as it is the first time he has complained in four and a half years.",62,Adjournment Australian Prisoners Of War Petro L Rationing Australian Army Treatment Of B Class Personnel

273,Mr Abbott (New England) [11.20].,"He enclosed a letter from his son at No. 7 A.B.O.D At the present we have the RSL. and Covricr-Mail strongly behind ns and now another paper has taken up our complaint, but we want some one down there to more or less get to Forde. As you can see by this clipping, there's a reference made to returned men having to take orders from a bunch of ""coldfooted base wallahs"". This is quite correct, and I can verify the fact by stating a couple of men have admitted that they've never been away and never intend going. Yet .these chaps are young and A l , and hold goods jobs here. One's a sergeant, aged 28. Secondly, the politician's son. I have seen his car call for him of an afternoon. Incidentally, the car is a Vauxhall and not a Packard. Two days after this article appeared, the politician's sou's discharge came through. Until recently, he was A l and never been away. Yet returned B class men with dairy farms and other csscn.tial jobs have been trying for discharge from this unit and have been knocked back. The majority have, anyway, and the "" not approved"" sign was used by our own CO. Thirdly, there's a lot of drafts leaving this depot for advanced units, and most of the men sent are returned A.I.F. B class, some wearing the Africa Star, while single A class "" chocos"", who've been here since joining up are kept here. The majority of these "" chocos "" are cither living at home or have their homes round Brisbane. Oned r a f t lef t to-day and, out of the eight men, seven were returned, one nearly blind in his right eye. Fourthly, the 21.C. had cause to correct me over a paltry mistake the other day, which I didn't mind, except for the fact .that he got abusive and used language that certainly wasn't l it for the A.WA.S.'s ears. These girls sit just outside his door and must have heard him. 1 complained to him next morning about ihe way he spoke, and he told me if I didn't like it, I could go .to tbe CO. and he would take up his case, too, but so far as I know he had nothing to take me up about. Next, returned men are not wanted here, and I overheard one officer say some time ago that "" the returned men are not worth so and so "". I won't use the exac.t term. This same chap stated "" a certain chap would never make a soldier"". Yet this same soldier was an original 9th Division man. Again, I and others hold two stripes and we have to do sweeping, clean windows and lamp shades. As a matter of fact, that was my job to-night. Now, about leave, although I am due for mine the first week in January, I can't have it over Christservice? mas, because the warrant officer, who is on subsistence and lives at home, is taking his at that time, and I have to take a back seat and wait until the middle of January when he eomes back. Incidentally, this man has every Christmas at home, but it doesn't matter to them that most of the returned men have never been home over the past four years for Christmas, I mean. He goes on to say that they are "" all fed up "". This letter and the complaints Mr Abbott. in the press disclose a bad state of affairs, and I ask the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holloway) to place the facts before the Acting Minister for the Army (Senator Fraser) in order that a proper inquiry may be made so that soldiers returned from overseas shall not be asked to remove their stripes in favour of A class men who have stayed at home. I ask that B class returned soldiers be stationed in their own States. This returned soldier says that that is an order which is not being observed. It must be a most unhappy camp, indeed! Such a state of affairs is bad for the discipline of the Army, and if the conditions are as stated they should not be allowed to continue. Question resolved in the affirmative.
