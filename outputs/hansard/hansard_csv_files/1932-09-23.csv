Personal Explanation In Connexion With An Incident Which Occurred Shortly Before Midnight. Motion Of The Prime Minister ( Mr Lyous) Allotting The Time For The Discus","sion of the Financial Emergency B ill , I saidMany honourable members who desired to apeuk to the second ruading were nimble tn do so because of the action of the Government in applying the closure, although there had been no undue prolongation of the debate. The motion now before the Chair means that honourable members will not have an opportunity to give the bill the consideration that it deserves. The Government has acted in a dastardly manner. At that point you, sir, called me to order. I have rend my actual words, and I leave it to honourable members to determine whether there was anything disorderly in what I said. I have been a member of this Parliament since the beginning of federation, and during that as acted as Temporary Chairman of Committees, and have also occupied the chair ns Deputy Speaker. During my long parliamentary career I hove always endeavoured to assist in maintaining order, and I do not think it can be said that I have e.vor acted in a disorderly way. When I was called to order you, sir, su.idThe honourable member, as tin experienced parliamentarian, who has on IMHIIV occasions acted as Temporary Chairman of Committees, must know that the Standing Orders require him to address himself to tbe motion before the Chair, which is that a certain time shall he allotted to tlie remaining stages of the bill, hut, as the time allowed for ihis debate has now expired, the question must be put forthwith, "" Tliat the motion tic agreed to "". I challenge those Ministers who treat this matter so lightly to show that in the few words I bad uttered I did uot deal with the question before the Chair. If we are to be governed by "" Rafferty's "" rules we shall not get anywhere. [ZB] -Orde r I to you, sir. I feel aggrieved at having been called to order when my remarks were relevant, and I leave it to honourable members to decide whether, in their opinion, I was right or wrong. ber for Newcastle ( Mr Watkins) called on me this morning, appearing much concerned because he was In speaking on the called to order by the Chair in tbe circumstances he has mentioned. 1 had not then seen the Hansard report of his remarks. The first portion of his remarks appear to be quite in order, but his concluding statement that the Government had acted in a dastardly manner was, he must admit, unparliamentary. It was these words that prompted mo to call him to order. If I unwittingly did him nn injustice, I express my regret. personal explanation in connection with the vote I recorded on the motion moved by the honourable member for Angas( Mr. Gabb) for the reduction by 40 por cent, of the allowance of Ministers aiid members of this Parliament. I express my surprise that any honourable member should time, abuse the privileges he enjoys under our you said, Mr Speaker, have Standing Orders by moving a motion which he knows there is not the slightest chance of being carried. As a result of his motion one of the ablest members of the Cabinet has resigned. I express my sympathy with the Minister who has resigned from the Cabinet on such a irivial question. ber, when given permission to make a personal explanation, is not entitled to refer, as the honourable member for Kalgoorlie is now doing, to something that arose out of a previous debate.

Motion agreed to. 1932. In committee: (Consideration resumed from tbe 22nd September, vide page 724). Clause 12 (Definitions). General) [10.40] -This clause proposes to amend section 34 of the principal act in respect of the dennition of income. The amount of the income of an old-age pensioner has to be estimated in order to ascertain the amount of pension to which he is entitled. Prom the income so estimated for the purposes of the act, certain receipts are excluded. At present, payments by way of gift or allowance from mother, father, son or daughter or legally, adopted son or daughter are excluded. It is proposed in a later clause of the bill to provide that certain relatives-hus band, wife, mother, father or childrenshall, in certain circumstances, he subject to the obligation .to contribute to the cost of the ponsion of an old-age or invalid In order to bring this provision with respect to income into accord with the provisions which make it possible to require contributions from relatives, the list pensioner, the latter would receive only, of relatives is altered in the amendment circulated. this clause without making some reference to the general scheme of which it is a part, and, therefore, I mention now that a subsequent amendment requires' sueli relatives, if in a position to do so, having rate of his pension affected. But there regard to all the circumstances of the case, tp contribute towards the cost of the pension paid to the old-age or invalid pensioner. It is not, however, the intention to provide that where the relatives oro already contributing, the pensioner shall be subjected to any disadvantage in respoct of such contributions, in the diversion of any portion of such contributions into Consolidated Revenue. The effect of this and other provisions is this: That any allowance received from the named relatives will not be taken into account in estimating the pension. That is to say, that the husband, wife, father, mother or children of the pensioner may make any contribution towards the support of the pensioner without affecting the amount of the income for pension purposes. It has always been the law, in the case of applicants for an invalid pension,'that a pension shall not be granted if relatives are adequately maintaining an applicant for a pension. It is proposed that the same qualification shall be introduced into the provision relating to the granting of old-age pensions. That is to say, that in both cases, if relatives do, in fact, adequately maintain the applicant, no pension ' is to be granted. Under the law as it stands at present, a relative may furnish a person with an income of £20 n week, and this will not disentitle him to receive an old-age pension. We propose to alter that by providing that, if a person is in fact adequately maintained, he shall not be eligible for an old-age pension. But the provision will be retained' which relates to the effect upon the amount of pension payable of allowances from relatives. Take the ease in which a son allows,' say, 12s. 6d. a week to a father. At present the receipt of that money does not pensioner. decrease the amount oi pension paid. If it were taken into account, and the son were required to pay the money into Consolidated Revenue instead of to the say, 15s. instead of 27s. 6d. That is not It is impossible to discuss desired, and it will bo prevented by the amendments that are t« be proposed. In the case that I have mentioned, the pensioner will be entitled to continue .to receive the 12s. 6d. without having the are other provisions which make it possible to .obtain a contribution from relatives who are in a position to make it, regard being had to the persons dependent upon them, and also to any",9,Papers

10,. Mr Latham (Kooyong,"Attorneyamount that they may have already paid. Let us consider the case of a man in receipt of thousands of pounds a year, whose father is an old-age pensioner, who could quite easily support his father entirely, and yet pays him only 12s. 6d. a week. Such considerations do not arise in determining eligibility. what would he the rate of pension? week. But, under later clauses of the hill, if such a wealthy man does not agree to make a contribution towards the cost of the pension, he can be compelled to do so. He would certainly be ordered to pay into Consolidated Revenue the 2s. 6d. needed to make up the 15s., and, if the magistrate thought proper, the whole of the 15s. The point that I wish to make clear is that the bill does not in any way prejudice a pensioner by reason of contributions from the relatives named in the measure. a wealthy son is not to be regarded as income, will not the father be entitled to a pension of 17s. 6d. ? that, while the normal rate of pension shall be 15s., in cases where there is no other-income and the pensioner is wholly dependent on his pension it shall be 17s. 6d. That principle also applies where there is other income, but it is less than 2s. 6d. a week. A pensioner with no relatives helping him, but with an income of Is. a week, would receive 16s. 6d. a week. Where there is a contribution by the named relatives, that is -to be taken into account as part of the income. Consequently, if a son gives his father 2s. 6d. a week, the pension will be at the rate of 15s. a week, and if his contribution be Is. a week, the pension will be at the rate of 16s. 6d. a week. The result of these provisions, therefore, is that there will always be a minimum income of 17s. 6d. a week. 10s. a week the pension will still be 15s. a week. Attorney-General( Mr Latham) has left the impression that this bill will not reduce the pension in cases where the contribution by a son to his father amounts to 12s. 6d. a week. That is not correct. For the first time it is proposed by this bill that the contribution of a son to a father is to be regarded as income. has been circulated removes the right honourable member's objection, hecause such contributions are to be excluded from income. gentleman say that if a son is contributing 12s. 6d. a week the pensioner will receive 15s. in pension? members to realize that under clause 14 a contribution by a son will be taken into account in determining whether a pensioner has other income; and if he has, his pension will be only 15s. a week, which is a reduction of 2s. 6d. a week on what he is receiving to-day. If the contribution of 2s. 6d. a week in some cases, certainly. dictory of a statement by the honourable member for Martin( Mr Holman) that I have read this morning, in which he said that no cut whatever was being made in pensions. The honourable gentleman could not have read the bill. No one can calculate exactly the number of persons who will be affected. There is no data in the department that would enable such a calculation to be made. The only guide that we have is the report of the department, which states that 50,000 pensioners are not receiving the f u l l rate of pension. Those persons must have an income from different sources of more than 12s. 6d. a week. Surely it is fair to assume that at least another 50,000 have incomes of less than 12s. 6d. a week. Any pensioner who has an income of 2s. 6d. a week or more will be reduced to a pension of 15s. a week. Consequently it would be a very low estimate to say that from 100,000 to 150,000 persons will have their pension reduced immediately by 2s. 6d. a week. I come now to the amendment which adds to what is to be regarded as income. The Attorney-General has said that this principle is already in the law. I dispute that. To some extent the principle of contributions being made by certain relatives to invalids is in the law. But",10,Financial Emergency Bill

Consequently a son or a daughter must be maintained by the parents, and a husband must maintain his wife, and vice versa. Now, however, a new contribution is being introduced, and provision is being made for what is not the law u any part of Australia with the exception, I believe, of some obsolete legislation in Queensland. I understand that there is a provision in an obsolete Queensland act, which has never been in operation, that children are legally liable for the support of their parents; but the insertion of such a provision in our old-age pension law would be entirely new. The moral duty of children to support their parents stands unchallenged, but I certainly challenge the statement that any such legal duty is at. present incorporated in our old-age pension law. Then, again, nothing in this bill defines tht meaning of adequate maintenance. suppose the subject will be dealt with by regulation tration. entirely unfair for the Parliament to pass this provision for the guidance administering the law. ""Will persons who are on tlie basic wage be required to contribute to the support of their Perhaps persons in receipt of less than the basic wage may be required to do so.

Mr Scullin. Early this morning I said that the only on an entirely bit of logic in the speech made by the principle. In connection honorahle member for Angas( Mr Gabb), principle in moving his amendment in relation to husband must parliamentary allowances, was the statement that honourable members who refused to vote for a double cut in The their own emoluments should also refuse to vote for a double cut in pensions. The honourable member was right when he claimed support for his amendnient from all those who intended to vote for the reduction of the pension. I voted against the amendment because I thought it was unreasonable, but this proposal is far more unreasonable. ; member is misleading the committee. What amount would have been cut from the parliamentary allowance under the amendment of the honourable member for Angas and what amounts would be cut from the pensions under this proposal? ber for Balaclava is apparently quite prepared to make a double cut. in the pensions, but is not willing to make a double cut iu his own allowance. Under the Premiers plan it was decided to reduce pensions by 12-4 per cent,., ministerial allowances by 25 per cent, and the parliamentary allowance I by 20 per cent., but there is no analogy between the two cases. A reduction of 12£ or departmental adminisper cent, in the pensions is far more In my opinion, it would be serious than a reduction of 20 per cent, in parliamentary allowances. without fixing standards It is deplorable that it should be made of the department a criminal offence for a pensioner to f a i l 'to notify the department within 30 days that sonic little property or certain gifts parents? have been made to him. To enact that such an omission shall render a pensioner liable to imprisonment for a month or to a fine of £10 is a totally unjust thing. Can it be expected that old-age or invalid pensioners will be able to comply with a law like this? Yeti f they f a i l to do so they w ill doubtless be told that ignorance to the maintenance of their of the law is no defence. It is difficult We know that to-day whole enough for pensioners to make the returns Our old-age which the department now requires, but pension department has it would be impossible for many of them, but if on their own initiative, to furnish the such department with the extra information which will be required under this bill.

This is the worse example of draconian legislation that I have ever seen. am anxious that there should be no misunderstanding on this point. The amendment which has just been circulated makes it necessary for us to consider four documents in dealing with this matter, and that is rather difficult to do. The definition of "" in c o m e "" in the Old-age and Invalid Pension Act states that income shall be deemed not to include payment(d) By way of g if t or allowance from his son, daughter, step-son, step-daughter, grandson, grand-daughter, or legally adopted son or daughter, But under the amended provisions that part of the definition is to be dropped and a new paragraph d is to be inserted, which reads(<i) By way of g if t or Allowance from tlie husband, wife, father, mother or child of tliat person. 1 am unable to see how alters the position. proposed amendment of clause 14. the following proviso:Provided also that for the purpose of the last preceding proviso the income of a person shall be deemed to include any payment by way of g if t or allowance from the husband, wife, father, mother or child of that person. have less income than 17s. 6d. a week. posed amendment, I can see that there is a difficulty. the honourable member withdraw the press statement that he made in regard to pensions? do that, for that statement dealt with the bill as it then stood and was made before this amendment was circulated. In any circumstance, the income of a pensioner is protected at 17s. 6d. a week. not have a pension of that amount. Under existing legislation there is no provision for tlie deduction from taxation returns of gifts made by children to'relatives in receipt of a pension. Seeing that legal provision is now being made to oblige certain relatives to contribute towards the support of their parents, I ask the Government to undertake that such gifts may be deducted fro m taxable income. It has always seemed to me cruel that the deduction of such amounts has hitherto been disallowed. General) [41.15 | -The point raised by the honourable member for Forrest( Mr. Prowse) will receive consideration when we are dealing with the Income Tax Assessment B ill ; it could not properly be dealt with in this measure. There will be considerable difficulty in adopting this suggestion, hecause the spending of money by parents in supporting their children might, with equal justification, be regarded as the fulfilment of a moral obligation, and we could hardly deduct the amount so spent from their income. I had hoped that I had made it clear to the honourable member for Martin( Mr. that amendment Holman) that if this legislation is adopted, no old-age or invalid pensioner altered by the will have an income of less than 17s. 6d. a week. That is the governing principle in clause .14.

39,Honourable Member F O R Martin ( Mr Hol,"a wonder that the honourable gentleman did not try to persuade them that their position would be improved under this measure. His remarks this morning suggest that he did not know the precise nature of the Government's proposal; though in his press statement he claimed to know all about it. Will any honourable member say that a pension of even f l a week met all the requirements of those who were forced to live under it? Recently the inmates of the Waterfall Sanitorium sent to me and, I assume, to other honourable members also, a statement of their circumstances, and asked that their position be not internotice, regardless of their political fered with under this legislation. The majority of those persons have spent the greater part of their working lives underground, with the result that their health has been shattered. They aTe now forced to spend the remaining years of their life in that institution, and, as my friend the former member for Werriwa( Mr and will really be regarded by this meaLazzarini) used to say, "" are daily expectorating away their lives."" Under this legislation their allowance of 5s. a week, fixed by the Financial Emergency Act, will be cut down to 3s. 9d. Apparently, this "" humane"" Government considers that 5s. a week is too much for these unfortunate people. outside assistance, it will be considered as income. which they receive from friends or relatives will be taken into account by the department in assessing the amount of allowance to be paid to them. This treatment is calculated to deprive them of help from friends. Consequently, they will be unable to obtain additional comforts during the few remaining years of their lives. dependent "" make that very clear. class of pensioner to be penalized by this legislation is the person who has contributed a few shillings a week towards superannuation benefits and receives a small income from this investment. Any payments in this form will be regarded as income. Similarly, assistance given to invalid pensioners will penalize them, although, in many cases, such assistance is absolutely essential to their comfort and happiness. are juniors. but I know of a number of young people, some of whom are entirely incapacitated, and need attention continuously from relatives in their homes. It would be most unfair if any monetary assistance which they receive from relatives were debited against their pension allowance. These'are factors of which honourable members should take convictions. If we consider all such cases from the purely humane standpoint, we must be forced to the conclusion that this amending legislation will operate most harshly against a considerable number of unfortunate people, some of them have sunk low in health sure as outcasts of society. Sometimes, I feel that the more humane course would be to remove them from the earth than to treat them in the way that is now proposed, because of the mental anguish which they must suffer from the knowledge that their condition is so hopeless, because they do not know from week to week what may happen to them. I also object to the inquisitorial nature of the application forms which will have to be filled in by persons claiming pension benefits. Before the department will pay a pension, it must be satisfied as to the financial position of relatives, and as these may be scattered throughout all the States of the Commonwealth, a pension applicant may be unable to furnish the necessary information. Consequently, the pension may be withheld from him indefinitely. Even under existing conditions there is considerable delay, because the Deputy Commissioners must comply with the strict letter of the law and the regulations framed under it. It will be almost impracticable to operate this amending legislation, because, while the Deputy Commissioner may have certain discretionary power, his decisions which involve payments will be subject to strict scrutiny by the Auditor-General. For that reason he will always take the extrasafe course. Another of the necessary",13,Financial Emergency Bill

This provision may operate harshly in many cases. For example, a man may lie engaged in a certain industry and, through some unfortunate accident, may he forced to apply for an invalid pension. If within a period of five years preceding his claim he had transferred property of the aggregate value of £100, lie would probably be ineligible for pension benefits. ;>4o makes it clear that he will not be ineligible in the circumstances mentioned hy the honourable member. will happen in such cases, and I repeat that it will be most unfair to throw the responsibility on the Deputy Coaninissioner. measure will cover many aspects of family life not touched by the parent act. thousand times the difficulties of applicants. under the present act we hear numerous complaints of the use of this discretionary power by the Deputy Commissioner, and, as the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin) has said, the source of irritation will he intensified a thousandjudiciously and wisely. There were never fold. Under clause 13, the Government proposes to set up a new police force, the purpose apparently being to try to run these unfortunate people off the earth. That clause authorizes the Deputy Commissioner to delegate certain powers vested in him, and I suppose we shall have around the pension-offices in all the States an army of au army of individuals who will roam the cities and the Countryside endeavouring to secure information. This bill will give every scope to the practices of informers. It is my experience that this practice of informing prevails to a greater for contributions, from certain relatives. degree in respect of pensioners than in respect of any other section of the community. Immediately certain information is forwarded to the department, the pension ceases, and the pensioner is called upon to disprove the charge preferred against him. Even now, with the limited scope given by the existing act, for many reasons which are not always bona fide--perhaps because of some family quarrel, or a squabble among neighbours-ther e are some individuals unjust enough to forward to the pensions office charges against persons in receipt of pensions. In such cases, it is the practice of the department to adopt the method of warfare, by applying economic pressure. It suspends the payment of the pension, and throws upon the pensioner the onus of proving that what has been charged against him is contrary to fact. Moreover, he does not know who has made the charge against him. Although the informer may be the greatest "" crook"" possible, the pensioner may lose his pension, and is, in any case, put to considerI n its amended form, the able inconvenience to disprove the charge preferred against him.

The clause also requires a return giving particulars as to the relatives, but not as to the relatives' property; the latter would be quite unreasonable, and is not required. If honourable members will look at the proposed amendments they will see that every attempt is made to deal with the matter of contributions by relatives without bringing any relative before a court, and that the only relatives brsught before a court, are' those who, having been given every opportunity to contribute, refuse to do so, although, in the opinion of the Deputy Commissioner, they are in a position to contribute. The Deputy Commissioner may, not shall, send notices to relatives asking them to make a voluntary proposal for a contribution, or to submit a declaration as to means and ability to contribute. If the matter is arranged on the basis of a voluntary proposition, either immediately or subsequently, the whole thing is settled; there are no court proceedings. respect of cases in which there is either a refusal to make any proposal, or a refusal to make a declaration as to means and ability to contribute, or the proposal made is, in the opinion of the Deputy Commissioner, not a fair one, having regard to all the circumstances.

It is true that, In regard to in certain instances, the pension will not be reduced; but, in my opinion, the majority of pensions will be reduced. Such inforthem. with the honourable member. From the experience I have had in dealing with pension cases in my electorate, I feel sure that there will be thousands of pensions cancelled as a result of this legislation. Rather than submit to the humiliating conditions imposed, by this measure, the pensioners will allow tlieir pensions to be cancelled. As the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) has pointed out, quite a large staff of inspectors will be needed to police the act, and, as all honourable members are aware, the aged people of this country will not stand for inquisitorial methods on the part of the department. They will surrender their pensions rather than be subjected to humiliating inquiries by inspectors into their affairs. I have in mind the case of a son and daughter who, being anxious to assist their parents, paid £300 for a home, and had the property transferred into the names of the parents. If this bill becomes law, that property will be taken over by the Commonwealth Government These are taken only in to recoup it for the amount of pension paid to the parents, although they have paid no portion of the purchase money. Such a provision, it seems to me, is mostunfair to sons and daughters who are anxious to assist their aged parents. The infirm workers of this country are very badly off.

However, we now have to devote the limited time at our disposal to the remaining clauses of the bill, which will be taken en bloc, and, therefore, any suggestions made will necessarily receive short shrift. I think it was the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Eiordan) who said that honourable members on this side of the House represented 90 per cent, of the capital in Australia. If the representation of a large number of invalid and old-age pensioners is of any merit, the. electorate which I .represent will not take second place to any other. In these circumstances, I am keenly interested in the subject of pensions. I was strongly opposed to the Government's pension proposals as outlined in the budget speech, not because I think that the country is in a position to continue to pay unnecessarily high rates in connection with its social services, but because the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) mentioned in that speech that there was a possibility of the Government inaugurating a contributory pensions system. In those circumstances, I think that the existing rates should have been allowed to continue until a modified system was brought into operation. Some of the opposition to these proposals has been based largely on fallacy, and my view-point has been changed since the Government amended its pension scheme. When the pension system was first, introduced many years ago, it was considered by some persons disgraceful to accept a pension. instances. parents to be in receipt of a pension. That objection has now been overcome, and as the recipients of pensions have become more numerous, the expenditure bas increased. In this connection I am reminded of the lines of PopeYet seen too oft, familiar with her face, Consolidated Revenue be deducted^from We first endure, then pity, then embrace. the 12s. 6d. he was contributing? Unfortunately, the pension system has in some instances been abused. Some say that the abuse has been exaggerated, but although it is difficult to prove that abuse quired to contribute to the Consolidated is taking place, we have every reason to suspect that persons uot entitled to pensions receive them. I strongly support, what has been said concerning the sympathetic way in which the act is administered by the Commissioner. We are justified in assuming that he will exercise similar discretion in administering this measure when it is enacted. It is only those who have abused the privilege who will be inconvenienced. Those who have done so should be dealt with. The way in which the law is being amended will automatically prevent abuse. Instances have been mentioned in which persons, just before reaching the qualifying age, have disposed of their capital in order to become eligible for a pension, but such conduct on the part of some is not a reason why genuirie cases should be penalized. The Commissioner is able to deal with those who make false declarations. There are not many who will adopt the role of informers. false declaration that is no justification for reducing the rate to genuine persons. not be affected. It is only fair that persons who are able to support their relatives should do so. The Attorney General( Mr Latham) referred to the position of a rich son who might be contributing to the support of his parents. If a man were contributing 12s. 6d. a week towards the support of his aged parents and that was the full amount he was able to con tribute, then, according to the Attorney-General, a pensioner would still receive a pension of 15s. But in another portion of the bill provision is made for an inquiry to see whether the son should contribute to the Consolidated Revenue in order to make uo portion of Children did not like their the pension. quiry will not affect the rate of the pension. affect the son?

The only escape for many of these unfortunate persons, who are suffering from tuberculosis, is death. Those who are cared for in such institutions receive only bare sustenance. The amount they get in pension is used to purchase fruit, soap, socks, shaving gear, tobacco, wool and cotton for mending their clothing, newspapers, material, and almost everything else, with the exception of food.

Honourable members persistently interrupting, bers do not want an explanation of points that have just been raised, I have no wish to force it on them. I shall therefore, resume my seat. I still have considerable difficulty in regard to what constitutes the income of a pensioner under this proposed legislation. Take the case of a person who is living in a house that he owns. He has no source of income other than the pension. At the present time, he receives a pension of 17s. 6d. a week. There is a mortgage on his property, the interest, on which, together with the rates and taxes writing levied by different authorities, are being discharged by his son. Let us suppose, for the sake of argument, that those payments by the son amount to 12s. 6d. a week. Will they be regarded as the income of the pensioner? which the honourable member refers, the payments are made to a mortgagee or a municipality, and in no sense are regarded as income for the purpose of determining the rate of pension.

It would seem, therefore, to be a waste of time for us to discuss the measure, for the Government does not intend to be influenced by any arguments against it . But when we remember that only a few days ago the right honourable gentleman said that the Government intended to insist on the reduction of the pension to 15s. a week, even to the extent of making it a vital test, and that it has now decided that 17s. fid. a week may be allowed in certain cases, it, would seem to be possible that if a sufficiently strong case could be put forward, even the Government and its supporters might be led to review their position. ficient, time has been allowed for the discussion of the matter. In dealing with this measure it is necessary for honourable members, as pointed out by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin), to consider not only the bill before us, but the two financial emergency acts now in operation, and also the several principal acts which this measure seeks to amend, and the fifteen proposed amendments which have been placed on the table this morning. It is only too obvious, therefore, that in the limited time allowed very few honourable members can possibly understand all the exceptions, qualifications and provisos that are being introduced. It is impossible properly to understand this bill in the short time that has been allowed for its consideration by the GoT h a t is so, but I vernment. That has beeu amply demonstrated this morning by the fact that two legal gentlemen on the other side of the House have admitted that they do not understand what the Government is seeking to do. It would have been far better I understand that the had the Government followed precedent and arranged for the consolidation of these new proposals with the principal T h a t is so. I have acts, so that we could have had the whole matter clearly before us. As an honourable member who was prevented last evening from doing my duty to my constituents through not being allowed to speak on the second reading or committee stage of this bill, I wish to protest against the application of the guillotine to the measure. The method by which this was done prevented any discussion whatever at the committee stage of the bill of the proposed alteration in the conditions governing the payment of the maternity allowance, and of the reductions in Public Service salaries. On those two i m portant matters, not. a word was said for or against. It does not seem to be clear to the supporters of the Government, that under the provisions of this bill the invalid aud old age pension is actually being fixed at 15s. a week. If the proposed amendments of oui pensions law are read in conjunction 1 with the provisions of the Financial Emergency Act and the amendments to it, it w ill be seen that we are providing Unfortunately, however, insufthatTlie amount of pensifTn sliall in each case be at such rate as, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, the Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner who determines the pension claim deems reasonable and sufficient, but shall not exceed the rate of BV.) per annum in any case, nor shall it be at such a rate as will not make the pensioner's income together with pension exceed £71 10s. per annum.",20,Financial Emergency Bill

100,Mr Maxwell,,21,Financial Emergency Bill
101,Mr Latham,,21,Financial Emergency Bill
102,Mr Baker (Oxley) [12.20],"'-LastTherefore, the pension is now fixed at 15s. a week, although, in certain cases, provision is made that an amount not exceeding 17s. 6d. a week may he paid. One such proviso is contained in the amendments tahled this morning. It reads as follows:Provided further that where by virtue of tlie provisions of this act a pensioner or claimant is eligible for a pension at the rate of thirty-nine pounds per annum and is in receipt of an income of less than 2s. Od. the amount of pension may be at such rate as the Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner who determines the claim deems reasonable and sufficient but so that the amount of the pensioner's income together with the pension shall not exceed £45 10s. per annum. There is, therefore, no' definite assurance that a pension of 17s. 6d. a week will be paid even in such cases. That is to be the maximum, but the Commissioner or the Deputy Commissioner may determine that 15s., 15s. 6d., 16s. or any amount less than 17s. 6d. a week may hepaid. In my opinion, the amended proposals originally submitted to us. This will be discovered by otlier honourable members when the administration of these new provisions is commenced. Although the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) has said that the Government cannot indicate definitely whatamount will be saved under these provisions, the right honourable gentleman has indicated that the budget must be balanced, and that £1,100,000 must be saved in our pensions expenditure, no matter how hard and cruel the making of the saving may be. to remit taxation. Mr ""BAKER -That is so. An amount of £1,200,000 is being deliberately given back to certain taxpayers. When the amount of the old-age pension was originally fixed, it was a bare subsistence allowance, not fixed in accordance with the decision of any court, or in relation to the^basic wage. It was never suggested that the amount should be affected by the rise or fall in the cost of living. But the Government is now introducing a totally new principle in providing that the miserable pittance that is allowed shall rise or fall according to the cost of living. It is also provided that relatives shall be forced to contribute to the maintenance of their needy parents. As pointed out by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin), there is an act on the Queensland statute-book, entitled "" The Interstate Destitute Persons Relief Act,"" under which a father or mother may sue a child over the age of 21 years for upkeep, if the child is able to contribute in this way. There is also a provision that a child under the age of eighteen may sue a parent for upkeep. But that act is practically a dead letter. I do not think that there has been a single case under it, because, although there may be a moral obligation upon relatives to care for other needy relatives, no one likes to j -de such matters in public. ,ara Every effort is made to keep them as private as possible. People would rather suffer silently than take action under such an act. One of the most vicious principles of a most vicious bill is that, on the death of a pensioner, the amount of pension he has are worse than those received shall be the first charge upon any property he may leave. That provision cannot be condemned too strongly. I am more than surprised that any government in this enlightened age should seek to enforce it. Honourable members seem to regard our discussion of this bill with as little concern as they would the proceedings in an ordinary debating society, for they appear to have overlooked that its provisions directly .affect a quarter of a million Australian people, and indirectly affect a million. This should be realized by those entitled to vote on the bill. It should also be realized that an effort is being made to inflict great hardship on the section of the community least able to bear it, and the section which is unable to fight for itself. That we are dealing with flesh and blood seems to be overlooked. The Government has determined that it will make its budget balance, no matter what may be the cost in suffering and hardship to the needy people of Australia. I wish particularly to protest against the intended treatment of inmates of public institutions. These people have already suffered severely, and it is now proposed that the paltry amount of 5s. a week received by them should be reduced to 3s. 9d.",21,Financial Emergency Bill
103,Mr Makin,"And later it is intendedThere is only one other point upon which I would like to touch. At present a person has to be totally and permanently incapacitated before he can claim an invalid pension. If the act were construed strictly by medical men, a very small percentage of persons, applying for the invalid pension would, get it, because of. the difficulty of proving total and permanent incapacity. The act is in need of ttmendment in the direction of leniency, not severity. I hope the Government will reconsider the position of invalid pensioners before it is too late, and I appeal to those honourable members who posed as rebels during the earlier stages of the debate to support us now in the fight against the Government's attack on those persons ""who. are least able to look after themselves. in the appeal made by the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) on behalf of blind pensioners. They should not be subjected to further cuts. The majority are able to earn something, and under this bill any property which they may possess will affect their pension payments. persons will be looked into by the Government, but it must necessarily be considered in conjunction with many other hard cases. to draft an amendment, and I was about to ask the Attorney-General for an undertaking such as that which he has just given the committee, namely, that pensions payable to the blind will be reconsidered and the necessary amendments made when the bill is before the Senate. I was not satisfied with the original proposals. There has been, however, a reconsideration of the whole position. I took part in the discussion, and as a result it was agreed to restore the full pension of 17s. 6d. to persons wholly dependent upon it. They represent 80 per cent, of the total pensioners. able member get that percentage? the budget disclose that approximately 77 por cent, of old-age pensioners, and 80 per cent, of invalid pensioners, draw the full pmount of 17s. 6d. a week. sarily mean that fehey are wholly dependent on the pension. The honourable member has forgotten that a person may have an income of 12s. 6d. a week and still get the full pension. Mr ""WHITE -Only if the income is earned. Government's proposals, the f u l l pension will be restored to SO per cent, of the persons drawing the pension. ThatI regard as a satisfactory compromise which I , among others, agree to accept, and having accepted it, I intend now to support generally the proposals of the Government. The position of blind pensioners is exceptional. For this reason I hope that during the week-end the Government will reconsider its decision and make the necessary amendments in another place.

Clauses 19 (Amendment of Wine Export Bounty Act 1930-31) and 20 (Temporary Suspension of Gold Bounty with a view to Payments). and Treasurer) [2.15] -Unde r the Wine Export Bounty Act of 1930, a bounty of Is. 9d. a gallon was payable on fortified wine exported. By the Financial Emergency Act 1931 the rate of bounty was reduced by 20 per cent, to Is. 4*d. a gallon. To provide the funds necessary to pay the bounty, an increase of 5s. a gallon was made in the excise duty on fortifying spirit, aud the amount so derived was paid into a trust fund, out of which the cost of the bounty was defrayed. Portion of the fortified wine made in Australia is consumed locally, and portion exported, and whether or not the amount derived from the duty is sufficient to pay the bounty, is dependent upon the volume of the exports and the proportion of the total manufacture consumed in Australia. Exports have been relatively very considerable, with the result that there has been a heavy demand on the fund, and the Consolidated Revenue has had to be drawn on to make good tbe deficiency. If the exports continue to be a heavy drain on the fund, then, of necessity, the amount required from Consolidated Revenue to complete the payments will continue to increase. The Government felt that some limit must be placed on the amount thus provided year by year. Consequently, the bill lays it down 'that the total extent to which the Consolidated Revenue shall be called upon to contribute shall be not greater than £96,000 a year. That wa3 the amount involved in the year 1930-31. Clause 19 proposes to amend sections 4 and 6 of the Wine Export Bounty, Act '.930-31. The amendments embraced by paragraphs a and b of sub-section 2 of the proposed new section 52A of the Financial Emergency Act, are minor ones. The first provides for the insertion of the letter "" A "" after the figure "" 62 "", in sub-section 2 of section 4 of the Wine Export. Bounty Act. That section readsThe account established in pursuance of tin's section sliall be a trust account within the meaning; of section (12 of the Audit Act 1901-20. there will be no necessity to make any The.insertion of the letter "" A "" simply makes that reference complete and perfect. The amendment covered by paragraph b is necessary, in view of the new subsection provided for subsequently. It amends sub-sectiou 6 of section 4 of the act, which at present readsI f the amount standing to the credit of the trust account is at any time insufficient to pay any bounty and drawback payable under this act, tlie amount of tlie deficiency shall be payable into the trust account from the Consolidated Revenue .Fund, which is hereby appropriated accordingly. The amendment modifies the operation of that provision to the extent rendered necessary by the terms of the proposed new sub-section 6A, which is provided for by paragraph c That sub-section limits to £96,000 the amount that in any financial year shall be available from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The total amount paid by way of bounty in 1930-31 was £165.000, of which £69,000 was derived from the additional excise duty of 5s. a gallon, and the balance from Consolidated Revenue. The object of the proposed new subsection 3 is to amend section 6 of the Wine Export Bounty Act. That section readsThe rate of bounty payable under this act shall be Is. 9d. per gallon. Then follow two provisos which have no bearing on this matter. The rate of bounty now is Is. 4fd. a gallon, due to the 20 per cent, reduction effected last year. The proviso that is to be added by the proposed sub-section 3 will enable a lower rate of bounty to be struck in any year in which the excise duty and the contribution of £96,000 from Consolidated Revenue are not sufficient to meet the requirements. From the evidence that we have been able to collect, it does not appear that the amount thus raised will be exceeded. On the figures for the first three months of this year, it seems perfectly clear that the £96,000 plus the receipts from the excise duty will be sufficient to cover requirements at the rate of Is. 4£d. a gallon. The ex-Minister for Commerce( Mr Hawker) has gone very carefully into this matter and has conferred with representatives of the industry. He is firmly convinced that further reductions in the rate of bounty payable. If there is, whatever is required may be done by regulation. regret that this matter is being rushed,",26,Financial Emergency Bill
132,Mr Lyons (Wilmot,Prime Minister,28,Pairs
133,Mr Forde (Capricornia) [2.23],"Iand that we have not the time to give it proper consideration. The wine bounty came under the administration of the Department of Trade and Customs when I was in charge of that department, and it fell, to my lot to investigate the conditions in th« industry and to introduce in this Parliament two measures dealing with the bounty. I am sorry that the Government has seen fit to interfere with the bounty. As the Minister concerned, I gave it as my opinion that, no matter what government might be in power when the act expired in five years' time, the principle of the bounty would not be interfered with, 'because the industry itself was being -called upon to bear the costs. s .am concerned as to the effect that -the limitation of the amount payable :from Consolidated Revenue will have on 'employment in the industry, and on the jprices that will be received by the grape; growers in it. The purpose of the bill is to limit to £96,000 the expenditure from 'Consolidated Revenue. Last year the expenditure from that source was £130,000, and from the trust account £70,515, a total of £201,000. The wine industry is to-day a very important one to Australia, but particularly to the States of South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales. There are 12,500 persons, including grapegrowers, directly employed in it, and their dependants total another 15,000. When the Scullin Administration took office, Ministers were besieged with representations from the industry, which was then in a very parlous condition. The reduction of the bounty by the previous Government had made the outlook very uncertain for the grape-growers who felt that they would not be able to market practically half of their crop. Shortly after that government assumed office, I introduced a Wine Export Bounty Bill, which provided for the payment of a bounty of Is. 9d. a gallon on fortified wine exported from Australia.' That measure repealed the Wine Export Bounty Act 1924-28, under which the rate of bounty payable on fortified wine exported, was Is. a gallon, with the exception of wine sent to Canada, on which the rate was Is. 9d. a gallon. The original act, which was passed in 1924, was amended in 1927, to provide for the reduction of the bounty from 4s. to Is. 9d. a gallon. At the same time, it was notified that a drawback at the rate of Is. 3d. a gallon would be allowed on and after the date upon which the reduction became operative. The total amount of bounty and drawback received by exporters was, therefore, 3s. a gallon, as against 4s. a gallon under the original act. In 1928, the wine industry was again reviewed, and Parliament passed an amending act providing for the reduction of the bounty to Is. a gallon. Under that act the total amount of bounty and drawback received by wine exporters was 2s. 3d. a gallon. I Summarized, the main provisions of the bill, that I , as Minister for Trade and Customs, introduced, had the following effects:-1 . It increased the rate of bounty from Is. to Is. 9d. a gallon; 2. It provided for a trust account, into which the additional excise duty of 5s. a gallon on fortifying spirit should, be paid. The wliole thing was financed by that increase in the excise. 3. It provided that the rate of bounty fixed should operate for a period of five years. 4. It tightened up all the conditions relating to the rates paid for grapes aud fortifying spirit used in the industry, and in the manufacture and export of wine. 5. It made provision for conditions of employment and rates of wages with respect to the labour employed in the manufacture of fortified wine, and in the production of grapes used in that manufacture. At this time the industry was on the verge of bankruptcy. The blackest of pictures were painted of the conditions which prevailed. It was pointed out that the ruin which faced the grape-growers was due principally to the reduction of the bounty by the previous Government. The Scullin Government -realized the need for financial assistance for the industry, and it increased the duty on fortifying spirit from 5s. 6d. a gallon if made from doradilla grapes, and 6s. a gallon if made from other grapes, to 10s. and l is . a gallon respectively. It was provided that the industry itself should find the money for the bounty, and that * the whole of the revenue from the old rate of duty on spirits for fortifying wines, which averaged about £350,000 a year, should go into, revenue. Unfortunately, the trust fund was not sufficient to meet the whole of the bounty that had to be paid last year, and Consolidated Revenue was drawn upon to the extent of £130,000. Since the original bounty act was passed, the quantities of fortified wines exported and the amounts paid in bounty each year have beenGallons exported. ] 024-25 1925-26 1926-27 1928-29 1929-30 1930-31 1931-32 (o) £69,130 from Trust Account and £95,8.78 from Consolidated Revenue.

The Prime Minister is seeking by these provisions to limit the amount of money drawn from Consolidated Revenue to £96,000 a year. I sincerely hope, however, that the Government will treat this industry sympathetically, and that it will watch the interests of the grape-growers in particular, because if they had not been protected in the past by the fixing of the price of grapes, I am afraid that they would have been exploited by' the big wine-makers in Australia. I should like the Government to do something more to encourage the marketing of our wine overseas. I know that the Wine Overseas Marketing Board is doing certain work in this regard, but, as the Prime Minister has told us that he does not expect that more than £96,000 will be required from Consolidated Revenue, although £130,000 was required from this source last, year, it seems to me that there is room for apprehension. We have been told that, as a result of the Ottawa agreement, we may expect to build up our ""wine exports to Canada, and that greater efforts will be made by the leaders of the wine industry to build up our sales in London. As a result of the depression in Australia, the local consumption of wine has decreased by 33-J per cent., and this decline has made it extremely difficult for the large and small interests engaged in this industry to obtain financial accomftlr. Forde. modation. The glut of wine in Australia has been a serious obstacle in this regard. The future success of the industry depends largely upon the lifting from Australia of a substantial quantity of the surplus Australian wine and the placing of it on the market overseas. Great Britain consumes 15,000,000 gallons of wine annually, of which 10,000,000 gallons is sweet wine, which could be supplied by Australia. I should like the Bounty Prime Minister to give us an indication paid. that it is the intention of the Government to do something to exploit this potential 142,085 . 28,417 market.

As the Prime Minister has suggested that there will be no increase in the demand on Consolidated Revenue this year for the purpose of this bounty, he must be assuming that there will be no increase in our exports of wine. If that is so, what is to happen to the 27,500 people dependent upon the wine industry of Australia for their living? No one can deny that the wine bounty has had a beneficial effect on the industry. Before the first bounty act became operative, Australia was exporting practically no wine to Great Britain. wine, but not much sweet wine. room for. a substantial increase in our export of sweet wine. We should be able to supply a substantial part of the 10,000,000 gallons of sweet wine that Great Britain is at present purchasing mostly from Portugal and Spain. I regret that the Government should have seen fit to interfere with the arrangement made by the Scullin Government. The beneficial effect of the legislation passed by that Administration has been much appreciated by the grape-growers.

HARRISON (Bendigo) [2.42] I wish to deal with clause 20 of the bill, which relates to the gold bounty. At a time when Australia was in the depth of the worse depression she has known, when unemployment was rife, and when many mines had ceased operations on .account of the poorness of the reefs being worked, and the cost of production, -due to high tariffs, and so on, a bounty was provided on the gold produced. This was done at a very opportune time for the industry. The par value of gold at that time was £4 5s. per fine oz.; but, in Australian currency, it had an added value of 6s. 7d. per oz. Consequent upon the provision of the bounty, a number of mines opened, and I believe that new -capital was invested in certain low-grade propositions, with the result that profitable working was possible. I u 1931, when .gold had appreciated, due to the depreciation of the Australian £1, to £5 9s. Id. .an oz., or an increase of 17s. 7d. an oz. over its value when the bounty was instituted, England went off the gold standard, and by doing so caused an automatic premium in the vicinity of 70 per -cent, to accrue to the value of the gold won in Australia. From that time, due to the accretion in the value of the Australian £1, the price of gold rose, in Australian currency, to £7 6s. an oz., or an increase of £2 14s. 6d. above the price when the bounty was first instituted. 'The mining industry consequently received the greatest fillip it had had since the 'nineties, when the Western Australian gold-fields were opened. Undoubtedy, a certain amount of capital -was released as the result of the high price of gold, new mines were opened, moribund mines brought into production again, and employment increased in very many gold-mining centres. In Victoria, . before this year's boom, if I may so call it, it was conservatively estimated that only 10,000 men were engaged in the goldmining industry; but since then the number has increased Throughout Australia. I suppose there are in the vicinity of 50,000 men engaged in gold-mining at present. Our production figures have grown from 467,000 oz. in 1930 to 000,000 oz. last year, and these figures are still increasing at a substantial rate. Gold is being won, not only by big companies, but also by many fossickers, who have gone out into back country to search in the gullies and creeks. These men are living an extraordinarily hard life in their endeavour to remain independent. But they would sooner live in this way than he dependent on the dole. I am afraid that many fossickers have been misled as to the value of the gold bounty, not only as it was originally introduced, but as it was subsequently reduced. In my electorate, I suppose there are more fossickers than in any other electorate in Australia, with the possible exception of Kalgoorlie, and 1 am continually meeting the statement that the bounty is worth 20s. an oz. Of course, people who say that indicate that they have confused the bounty with the premium on gold, aud have not really studied the question for themselves.. They do not appear to realize that the bounty is payable only on the jjroduction in excess of that for the last three years. As a matter of fact, the average value of the bounty during the period in which it has been payable is only about 3s. an oz. A comparison of that figure with £7 6s., the price of an ounce of fine gold, shows that the bounty is really worth very little. The total yield for the Commonwealth last year increased by 25 per cent. . In Victoria alone, the production almost doubled, the yield being 44,000 oz. as compared with 24,000 in the previous year. There was a similar percentage increase in Queensland, and in the Northern Territory the output was approximately 50 times greater than iu the previous year. The decision of the Government to withdraw the bounty temporarily has not affected the market. In vestors may he assumed to be fairly good judges of the condition of the industry. It is significant that the market for mining shares still remains high. In many cases, there has been a definite advance, indicating that the actual price of gold enormously. rather than the payment of a bounty has been responsible for the buoyant condition of the share market. The bounty averages about 3s. an oz. Undoubtedly, it stimulated the industry at a time when help was most needed, aud this being so, 1. am going to depart from my -accepted principle of not advocating the payment of a bounty except for defence and health reasons, and will admit that, in the case of the gold-mining industry, the effect of a bounty was the exception which proved the rule. Some figures dealing -with production in the Bendigo, Eaglehawk, and Marong districts in my electorate show that in the first seven months of 1932, 1,700 men won 4,3S7 oz., giving an iiverage output of approximately 2-J 07.. This worked out to about £20 worth of gold for each prospector, and the bounty payable in respect of if was approximately !)s., or i d . per man per day. The position, from the point of view of the bigger companies is, I think, well indicated in the short .extracts which I propose to read. In the Melbourne Herald of recent date there appeared the following:The Chairman of the Hercules and Ironbark Gold Mining Companies ( Mr Angus Mackay) said to-day that while the gold bonus has been in the Melbourne Argus, we have the of some help to the Bendigo field, the suspenfollowing statement:sion of the bounty on new production would have very little effect in Victoria. The premium and exchange on gold prices were most valuable aids to the industry. The Government of the West Australian Gold Producers had made a sound move in deciding that the suspension should be temporary, and bhat paygive a reasonable basis of discussion, and he ment should be resumed if the price of gold fell to £5 a.n oz. Apropos of that statement, I may tell the committee that when representations were made to the Government with regard to this matter, I suggested that, to save the industry from again getting into the slough of despond, and having in view the fact that the Government was determined to reduce the bounty payable, it would be advisable to re-eommenee payments'when the price was £6 per oz. in London, and fix payments on a sliding scale. Mr A. G. Palmer, the legal manager of companies, also states that the amount received from the bounty by Bendigo ventures has not been large, but has been of some little help to the industry. The Mayor of Bendigo, who is closely in touch with the industry, is reported in the Melbourne Argun of the 1st September, 1932, to have statedft. would be ungracious to expect that the Federal Ministry, in the present parlous concoveries leading to a heavy increase in Mr E. F. Harrison. dition of the nation's finances, would continue the gold bounty. When the bounty wasenacted, gold was at about £4 10s., but now it is, nearly £7 an oz., and the industry would not be imperilled by the suspension of the bounty. The Chairman of the Bendigo Stock Exchange who, one would imagine, has hi3 fingers on the pulse of the industry is also reported to have said thatThe suspension of the bounty would have little influence on the mining industry. W it h the present high premium on gold the industry could well afford to make the small sacrifice. But perhaps no one in the industry can speak more authoritatively about the effect of the bounty than Mr C. de Bernales, the chairman of the Western Australian Gold Producers Association. Mr de Bernales, who is now in London, was prominently identified with the proposals brought forward by the Scullin Government, and at about that time was a familiar figure within the precincts of the House. In a cabled report from Loudon, appearing: Commenting on the proposals in the budget regarding the gold bonus, Mr C. de Bernales, Association, said that the plan appeared to would advise the industry to agree, if the plan were duly embodied in a parliamentary measure. He is of the opinion that the withdrawal of the bonus would not adversely affect London investors who are favourably disposed to supply large amounts of capital to develop low-grade gold mines in Australia. In the face of these statements honourable members must admit that the Government acted wisely in coming to the help of the industry at a critical period in its history; but we may now expect it to carry on without this help in the altered circumstances, due, in part, to Great Britain going off tlie gold standard. I am glad to know that the Government's decision several Bendigo gold-mining is to suspend the payment of the bounty temporarily, aud not to do away with it altogether. We may, therefore, hope that if the industry experiences difficult times again, prompt action will be taken to re-enact the bounty. But I should liketo utter a word of warning. I do not know whether it has been stressed already, but if recent activities in the gold-mining industry should result in important disproduction, the estimate of Commonwealth over £130,000 to be provided out of liability under this act would be very Consolidated Revenue. Assuming that tlie severely affected. should not have supported the Governapproximately £40,000 of the total ment's proposal to pay the bounty but for £201,000 required would be a f a i r l y the fact that the gold-mining industry had severe cut. But certain circumstances been severely hit by the tariff, and in make the reduction very much less than many otlier directions, and I now direct it would appear to be at the first scrutiny. attention to the fact that the reductions In the first place it is considered to be in this form of government assistance most unlikely that the export of wine affect chiefly the States of South Ausduring the current year, will equal in tralia and Western Australia.

But the stocks in bond in 1930 and the stocks of wine held by the wine-makers on which duty had already been paid, and which are therefore beyond the control of the Customs Department, exhausted. It is therefore quite certain that, given approximately the same consumption of wine as occurred in Australia last year, there will be a much larger contribution of excise payments to the trust fund. reduced vote from the Consolidated Revenue will, therefore, not represent a substantial 'deficit in respect of the amount required for the payment of the bounty on wine shipped as the result of actual sales. In fact, it is possible that there may be sufficient receipts in trust fund to cover, together with the vote provided, the whole of the requirements for the bounty at the full rate of Is. 4$d. On the other hand, there may be some deficiency in this regard during the current year, because it is not possible to obtain actual statistics of rhe stocks of wine held by wine-makers and withdrawn from bond after the payment of the duty. exist the wine-makers will naturally use them to as great an extent as they can, hut there is a general impression that they are nearing exhaustion. If mo3t of them are not used up at. the present time there is no doubt they will become exhausted in the near future and the trust fund will then be replenished with sufficient funds to meet the full payment of the bounty. It may moan a certain amount of delay in meeting some of the claims towards the latter part of this year until the trust fund is replenished again in the way I have indicated, but it should not, and in fact will not, lead to any serious delay. The effect of this legislation therefore will not be to cause any reduction of the rate of the bounty. On the contrary it will protect the revenue sound, it would he impossible to move in this particularly while securing the payment of the bounty against the receipts which are absolutely Ifr.

Very influential sections of the winemakers are anxious that the whole basis of the excise artd bounty payments should be reduced, and this is a matter which has been receiving considerable attention. There is a division of opinion as to whether such a-drastic change should be made, but there is nothing in the present are rapidly becoming bill to prevent the proposal being considered. If payments are continued at the present rate until the alternative schemes have been thoroughly investigated and discussed by all sections of the industry, it will not prevent the ultimate The adoption of some other system if there is a general agreement that it should be adopted. I conclude by supporting these provisions of the bill, because I consider that it is essential to protect the revenue in a. year like this against a rush of shippers who send wine out of the country for speculative purposes, and because the limitation proposed will have no detrimental effect upon the wine industry, nor increase the difficulties from which the industry is now suffering. On the contrary, while safeguarding the revenue in a most difficult period, it should secure to the industry that stability which is so essential to the making of contracts and the carrying on of trade. order. The honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) has moved an amendment proposing that the gold bounty should become payable when the Australian price does not exceed £6 an ounce, whereas the bill provides that it shall not become payable when the price exceeds £5 10s. an ounce. The honourable member's proposal, I submit, is to increase a charge upon the public revenue beyond what is proposed in the bill, and I submit that s it is not in order for any member other than a Minister to move to increase a charge upon the public revenue. not increase the cost of the bounty as pror vided for in the act.

It posed by a non-official member in any committee on any bill. I take it that the reference is to a rate, tax or duty already existing and not one which is proposed. The honourable member for Swan does not propose to increase the existing charge; his amendment would lead to a reduction of that charge. I contend that it is in order. question is whether the amount of £5 10s. mentioned in the clause of the bill can.be increased without increasing the charge on the revenue. readsNo amendment for the imposition or for the increase of a tax, rate or duty shall be proposed by a non-official member in any committee on any bill. It appears to me that the amendment would have the effect of increasing the charge on the revenue as proposed in the bill. I , therefore, rule that it is not in order. Although the amendment moved by the honourable member for Swan( Mr cent, by which the exchange decreased Gregory) has been ruled out of order, I trust that the Government will accept it as a direction, or at least a suggestion, that the measure should be amended in the direction desired by those interested in the gold-mining industry. The psychological effect of removing, or, as the Government term it, suspending the gold bounty for an indefinite period, will he detrimental to the industry. As mentioned by the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr E. P. Harrison), the amount paid by the Government last year in the form of a bounty was equivalent to 2s. 7d. per ounce or a total of over £80,000. The present improved position of the gold-mining industry is due largely, I admit, to the exchange position. The industry is not aiming at making profits for the time being. the industry are enlarging their plants, and the honourable member for Denison( Mr Hutchin), who professes to have I think that the point some knowledge of mining in Tasmania, particularly with respect to the treatment of zinc, shows an ungenerous spirit in is true that when this bounty was introduced by the present Treasurer when a member of the Scullin Government, the exchange rate was against Australia to the extent of about £9, and that later the rate was increased by 30 per cent. On the adoption of the Premiers plan a little over a year ago, the gold-mining industry had to submit to a reduction of approximately 50 per cent, in the bounty although reductions made in the case of other industries did not exceed 20 per cent. price by 100 per cent. desire to make my speech in my own way. The reduction was 50 per cent, in accordance with the scale agreed upon, and the bounty payable was to be 10s. an ounce on the quantity of gold produced in excess of the average production for the years 1928, 1929, and 1930. The total amount of the bounty paid last year, as I have said, was approximately £80,000, but provision was made that for every 3 per the bounty was to be increased at the rate of Is. per ounce.

In discussing this subject we have to review the whole position and consider the circumstances in which provision was first made for the payment of a gold bounty. Ever since 1925, I and other honourable members interested in the gold-mining industry have advocated the payment of a bounty on the gold produced. During the war those engaged in producing primary products, including base metals, received advanced prices to the extent of 200 per cent, or 300 per cent., while the price of gold remained stationary at £4 4s. 1LM. per fine ounce. But now, when the gold-mining industry is coming into its own, the representatives o-f Western Australia and honourable members on this side of the chamber are its only friends. without a bounty? member for "" Cash and Carry"" or whatever lie terms his business, is making suggestions concerning an industry of which he knows nothing. Por a period the gold-mining industry was in danger of going out of existence. Over £630,000,000 worth of gold has been produced in Australia, and of this amount about £300,000,000 worth has been raised in Victoria. Indeed, the discovery of gold was responsible for the rapid development that occurred in Australia, more particularly in Victoria, in the early 'fifties. Between 1925 and 3930, only two gold-mines in Australia were paying dividends, but many other mines were losing to the extent of £2,000 or £3,000 a year. Western Australia has produced over £100,000,000 worth of gold. paying dividends but for the favorable exchange rate? tually the Government decided to give some assistance. In 1903, there were 16,000 employees in the industry, but in the course of time that number was reduced to 4,000. This had a depressing effect on trade generally. In consequence are willing to take the chance of making of the decline in gold-mining the population on the eastern gold-fields of Western 14,000, but to-day, largely as a result of the favorable exchange rate, there are 3,000 more working miners there than there were two years ago. Fully 10,000 "" fossickers"" are seeking gold because they realize the benefit to be derived from the gold bounty. It is truej. as the honourable member for BendigO' states, that some have an exaggerated idea of the value of the bounty; but Australia has never received a better advertisement than it has in connection with the gold bounty. It. has been declared to the world that the Commonwealth Government is paying a bounty on gold. The Government's policy, in this respect, has been supported by the financial journals of Great Britain, which are directing attention to the great possibilities of the industry. Although only 2s. 7d. an. ounce has been spent in the form of a bounty.. Australia has received a wonderful advertisement, and has been brought under the notice of investors throughout the world. Fully £800,000 has been spent by the Wiluna Gold Mining Company partly as a result of this paltry £80,000. which the Government is not prepared to continue. Notwithstanding that heavy expenditure on the part of the company, the Government has taken from it no less than £100,000 in the form of customs duties on machinery that is of such a highly technical nature that it is not yet manufactured in Australia. It 'takes everything and gives nothing. In response to the pressure of the Country party it has reduced duties on many commodities used in rural production, but has done very little to assist the gold-mining industry the importance of which is, atr The Golden Mile in toe moment, equal to if not greater than that of any otlier form of primary production,. The bounty provided by a Labour Government is now being removed by a Nationalist Government after it had been in existence for only eighteen months. It is the duty of the Government to assist prospectors rather than to discourage them, as, by so doing, it enables them to earn a few shillings and prevents them from going on the dole.

In connection with the production of gold, it is necessary to instal highly technical machinesmachines which the operators understand -and while some hundreds of thousands of pounds have been spent on Australian machinery an unnecessarily heavy duty is imposed on those portions of the plant which have to be imported. The honourable member for Bendigo stated that Mr de Bernales was agreeable to the suspension of the bounty; but that gentlestand, however, that the honourable man is iu close touch with Australia's Acting Minister in Groat Britain, who apparently told him that the industry would have to take this or nothing. Mr de Bernales always advocated a bounty of 20s. an ounce when the industry was in a serious condition, but after conferring with the world's greatest wordspinner, has apparently realized that it is impossible to get more. The future of the industry depends on increased production. The large amount of money expended in gold-mining must be protected, and further expenditure must be incurred in order to secure satisfactory returns. point Government, whoso leader recently told us that for the first two months of this financial year, there had been a surplus of £2,000,000, to continue the bounty at the present rate, as by so doing clauses 6 to 10.

We have a great deal of important legislation to put through, and, if possible, we should avoid all-night sittings because good work canuot be done in that way. There is no reason in the world why we should not .sit at' least four days a week, and when urgent legislation, including the tariff, is under consideration, we could sit even on five days. While it may be incumbent on Ministers to spend every week-end in Sydney or Melbourne, or in some other part of Australia, it would, I think, be much better if we could devote a little more time to legislation in Parliament, and so expedite business and. enable honourable members to get back to their constituencies. provisions of the bill which we have just passed, certain of our invalid and oldnge pensioners will be entitled to 17s. 6d. a week and others to only 15s. It will be impossible to ascertain who should get 15s. and who should receive 17s. 6d. a week until some investigation is made into individual cases. I consider that pensions should be paid at the existing rate until such investigations are complete, and would suggest that the Government should earnestly consider delaying the issue of the proclamation bringing the act into operation until such an investigation is made. ter and Treasurer) [4.13] -In reply to the right honourable the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin), I can only say that I regret as much as he does the necessity to rush legislation through this House; but I havp, on other occasions, told honourable members that it is essentia] to pass without delay our financial measures in order to effect the savings which we anticipate will be'made under them. So far as is possible, the Government will avoid the application' of the Standing Orders limiting debate. If , in the heat of moment, I did the right honourable the Leader of the Opposition the injustice of saying that he wasted the time of the House, I regret it. On reflection, I admit that he was not one of those who took action to delay the passage of the bill. I , 'therefore, regret that I included him in the criticism. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway) has asked if he may. present a petition dealing with the payment of invalid and old-age pensions. It could not be considered by the House, of course, but if the honourable member will present if to me before the next meeting of Cabinet on Tuesday, it will be considered by the Government. The honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) has suggested that Parliament should sit on four days in each week. I have already pointed out that it would be difficult for members of the Cabinet to prepare business for the Housei f Paidiament were sitting on four days before Parliament assembles knows that that is not always possible. Soon, we shall have to submit to this Parliament a very comprehensive tariff schedule arising out of the agreements made at Ottawa. These alterations will require very careful consideration. Before they are presented, we may have to ask Parliament to give us even more time than is provided by the ordinary week-end adjournment. But immediately they are ready, I see no reason why we could not then adopt the suggestion of the honourable member and sit on four days each week. The honourable member for Bass( Mr^ Guy) has asked that some consideration be given to the position of invalid and old-age pensioners before we apply the reductions authorizing the amending legislation which has just been passed. He suggests that inquiries should be made into the circumstances of pensioners who will be affected by the new provisions.
