Within the last few days the Treasurer has expressed pleasure at the fact that the Labour party, whilst in power, were able to provide out of revenue for our naval and military defence schemes. I now find him fighting for the right to borrow for naval and military purposes. Where does the right honourable gentleman stand ? What position does he really take up? Would he favour the cost of naval and military defence being provided for out of revenue, or does he really think that it should be provided for out of loan? Leaviug that point, I would remind honourable members that for some time the Government have been telling us that the whole question of Tariff reform has been placed in the hands of the Inter-State Commission, and that the Tariff cannot be dealt with in any way until the Commission has investigated every case that could possibly come before it in respect of trade, commerce, and industry. We now find the Minister of Trade and Customs and his colleagues expressing a readiness to rectify Tariff anomalies immediately. They propose to go to the country with a cry of that sort. How unfair and untrue it is. The position is that the Government and their supporters will try to gull the public in this way, and if they are successful at the polls they will do nothing with the Tariff. They will have three years of office, and studiously refrain from resurrecting the Tariff question. to office again. Another change in their attitude is in respect of constitutional amendments for the purpose of electoral reform. We have heard so much from the great brains of the Liberal party as to the sacredness of the Commonwealth Constitution that it is surprising to learn that they are prepared now to favour such an amendment of it as will permit of electoral reform in a certain direction. They propose a proportional scheme of representation for the Senate and preferential voting for the House of Representatives. They also state that they are in favour of the initiative and referendum. But what has been their attitude all along to the Referenda Bills that have been sent down from another place? The Leader of the Opposition asked this afternoon that an opportunity should be given this House to deal with them; but his request was refused. The Government will not give us that opportunity, and are not prepared to give the people a chance to vote upon the referenda questions. What, then, is the meaning of this change of front on the part of the Ministry in respect of electoral reform? Is it that they have found themselves handicapped by the present electoral system in their efforts to defeat the Labour party. Their hopes and anticipations were that the Labour party would never enter the Senate. Sir William McMillan, speaking at the Convention, referred to a position in the Senate as likely to be the blue ribbon of Australian political life. It was thought that no one would dare enter those sacred doors who had not wealth enough to cover the country, and whose superior position did not place him on a pedestal; that we, the hobnailed people, would not dare to enter there. Now that we have entered, and the people recognise our status, they desire the alteration of the Constitution to provide for the initiative and referendum. But I must leave that subject, because my time is limited, and there is another to which I wish to make reference. The Prime Minister said a day or two ago that he knew nothing of a report of which we have heard much in the press recently, a report relating to a property wortli nearly £1,000,000, and for which £75,000 is asked to make it effective; I refer to the Fitzroy Dock. It has been said in the press that I bring in the Fitzroy Dock as Mr Dick used to bring in King Charles' head. Well, King Charles is dead, and I do not mind kicking his skull about. Mr King Salter, reporting on the position of affairs at the dock, has thrown on the shoulders of the men",18,Returning Officers

I say that the inefficiency is to be placed, not on the men, but on the Naval Department. The inefficiency that he speaks of, and any consequent in j u r y to the vessel which may be launched a couple of years hence, is not the fault of the men, certainly not of the Australian workmen employed on Cockatoo Island. challenge the Naval Department and MrK in g Salter to refute my statement that 90 per cent, of the men on tlie Island today have been brought from GreatB r i tain. MrK in g Salter wishes to introduce the old-world methods of working, and these men say, "" We have obtained improved conditions in Australia, and are not going back to the slavery that we suffered in England."" piece-work, but he wants something more. Mr Justice Heydon, when, for the first time in the history of our people, piecework was imposed on the engineering trade, found that we were so bitterly opposed to it that he tied up his award in such a way that no employer would take advantage of it . In the first place, the normal wage earned under the time system must be paid. Further, men must have 5 per cent, additional for piecework, whether the output is greater or not, and must be permitted to earn up to 50 per cent, above the normal rates before any attempt is made to reduce their pay. The employers do not want a piece-work system that safeguards the interests of the men. They want a system under which they can take the smartest man at a trade or calling, and make him a sort of bell-wether of the flock, every other man being forced to work at the same rate, or receiving proportionately less. This has been the damnation of the engineering trade in England. The VickersMaxim Company has a bonus system ; Hawthorn Greenock Company, the Palmer Company, and Thames Limited pay time rates. The Yarrow, Clydebank, and John White companies pay bonuses. The Dumbarton and Cammell-Laird companies pay piece-work, but as to Parsons and the Wallsend companies I have no information. MrK in g Salter came from Chatham Dockyard, which is known as the scrap yard of England, and a "" scab"" yard. He seeks, not alone to introduce piece-work, but to get all tlie "" s c a b "" labour he can, building the vessels with low-paid labour. work. HaveI not seen it myself? I have known vessels to be built w it h lead I rivets inserted instead of steel. Vessels have been turned out of some dockyards in that way. Such a thing must not happen here. If the M in ister of Defence, or the Ministry, attempts this sort of thing, we shall not be afrai d to close down Fitzroy Dock, whether vessels of war are built or are not built. The inefficiency for wbich the men are blamed is the fault of the Defence Department. There are two destroyers on the slips to-day almost ready for launching; but when MrK in g Salter wants they are launched they w ill have to be tied up to the wharf. They cannot put the boilers in , because they have not yet got the plates out, and hundreds of tons of machinery have yet to come from the Old Country. Neither MrK in g Salter nor Mr Cutler, but the Naval Board, is to blame for any inefficiency, and for not getting out material which would enable the work to be done efficiently. What is the position of the Brisbane? She is practically plated up efficiently but for one great heavy plate whicli has not been brought out yet. They are boring holes to test the strength of the basement on which the slip is built, to see whether the launching w ill go off effectively, but when the vessel is launched, they w ill not have machinery to put into her.

They w ill not pay these rates except to new-comers. comers ? come from England, whether working men or officers.

Treasurer to be more friendly towards our old people. They would be delighted if he closed, his career as Minister by doing something of the kind that I am about to propose. Many of them have had to go into State institutions, because the pensions were not sufficient to enable them to live in comfort. When these old people forfeit their pensions and go into institutions the Commonwealth makes a profit of 2s. per head. . That amount might very well he paid to the oldpeople in the institutions. When a pensioner is not receiving sufficient to pay rent and keep himself in food and clothing, he makes application for admission into one of the State institutions; and if he is drawing a pension he has no trouble in getting in. The Commonwealth pays the institution 8s. per week for his keep, and that 2s. which the Commonwealth thus saves might very well be paid to the pensioner. Many female pensioners, too, are obliged to enter these institutions, and they are treated in the same manner. If the Commonwealth would pay the 2s. which at present is saved, the Government would be doing a great service to our old friends, which the whole of the people of Australia would be grateful for. I believe the Treasurer will agree to something of this nature, because this matter has been discussed frequently in this chamber, and if a vote were taken almost every member would show his sympathy with an increased pension to our old friends. Many of our invalid pensioners, who have to buy medicine, find the 10s. a week allowed by the Commonwealth insufficient to maintain them in ordinary comfort.

107,Mr Sharpe,"It might suit therate, take into consideration the possibility of giving"" an increased pension to our invalid friends. claims of the blind people were brought before the Chamber, and I think the Treasurer expressed the opinion that the .Commonwealth is not treating them with anything like liberality. Other members have expressed similar views, and it is due from the Government that they should formulate some scheme to pay the blind people the f u l l amount that is being paid to the old-age pensioners. The number of blind people who are eligible for a pension is about 2,700, and, as many of them are at present receiving a pension, the proposal I am making will not mean a very heavy increased expenditure. pensioners are all contributing to the revenue of the Commonwealth, and many of them have paid a good deal more in taxation than will ever be returned to them. Many countries of the old world have a contributory system of pensions; but in 'Australia our revenue is sufficient to provide our aged and invalid people with a pension without imposing any additional taxation on them. pensions on a contributory basis? have suggested that. I say that the country is rich enough to provide for a f u l l and sufficient pension from revenue. A matter of serious importance is the number of blind people who are to be seen begging in the streets; and, if only to remove those people from that form of obtaining a livelihood, the Government should long ago have taken into consideration the possibility of providing them with a pension. In some of the institutions a few of the blind people are earning decent wages. If they are earning 10s., they receive a pension of 10s. per week; but if they get a rise of 2s. 6d. or 5s. per week, that amount is taken off their pension, so that there is no inducement to them to become energetic. Many, who are not energetic, are receiving a f u l l pension; and I say that it is the duty of the Government to pay the blind people a f u l l pension without any restriction in regard to their earnings. Erom the few speeches made on this subject last session, I had come to the conclusion that the Government intended bringing forward some scheme which would provide pensions for our blind folk. We know that if the [83] Government could, by any means, bring forward a measure to place pensions on a Last session the contributory basis, they would do so. ral said he would do it if he had his way. way in that matter. The people of Australia do not desire our aged people to contribute towards their pensions. There are many people in Australia who are drawing handsome pensions, and who have not contributed in any way to such pensions. No one objects to them drawing pensions, because, no doubt, they have rendered valuable service to the community, but their services were not more valuable than those which many of the old age pensioners rendered. They contributed The aged, blind, and invalid all they possibly could to the country, and made it possible for the people following them to produce greater wealth and bear heavier taxation. The Government have an idea of introducing a B ill to provide pensions for members of the Military Forces, but our first duty is to see that our old-age pensioners are properly treated, seeing that to them we owe much of our present prosperity and the development of the country. That is why I say it Y o u do not suggest would be a pity to allow Parliament to close without some reason being given by No ; but our opponents the Government as to why they are not making more adequate provision for the old-age pensioners. would not allow us to do anything. vernment not resign? majority resigning? not a majority or they would have brought forward these measures.

Many of them who have had years of service are being gradually passed out, thrown on one side, and scrapped, as it were, for newcomers. How can we expect a body of Australian workmen to sit down and remain silent in circumstances such as those ?

I am very pleased to know that there is now a telephone line between Dalgety and Bendock, but I should like to be informed wby the persons interested were treated by the Department differently from the way in which persons in other districts were treated? there has been no distinction made. have here a newspaper cutting giving the particulars-that it was estimated that there would be a loss of from £20 to £25 on the line, and that the inhabitants of the district to be served were asked to guarantee £200, but that when there was a change of Government, the honourable member for Gippsland induced the Department to forego the guarantee. In nearly every other case in which application has been made for telephone construction, especially by honourable members of the Opposition, guarantees have been demanded from the districts interested, to meet any possible loss. Why was an exception made in the case of the district to which I have referred? member's time has expired. tors failed, and the guarantee could not be recovered from them, but that was before I took office. There are one or two matters to which I wish to call the attention of the Postmaster-General. In last night's Herald, JOHN FOBBEST -The honourable and this morning's Age and Argus, are published statements regarding payments made in Sydney in connection with a wireless telegraph plant. Some little while ago, during a debate in this chamber regarding the purchase of material by this Government without calling for tenders, the Postmaster-General interjected that the last Government carried out a great deal of work in connection with wireless telegraphy without calling for tenders, of which he had said nothing. I do not know whether the interjection referred to purchases from the Maritime Wireless Compaiy Limited, and shall be glad if the honourable gentleman will give us some information on the point. It is stated in tbe newspapers that Mr Haldane, the Chief Accountant of his Department, was «ent to Sydney to examine the books, and, according to the Herald-the statement does not appear in tbe Age or the ArgusMr Haldane is of opinion that sufficient was not paid for the material obtained. We are told that the Government has now settled tbe matters in dispute. I should like to know whether anything more has been paid. I raise no objection to any increase in the payment if , after the examination of the books by Mr Haldane, it was thought right to increase it ; but I would point out that the facts show that the last Government made an arrangement which was not in any respect disadvantageous to the public. The Postmaster-General told the representatives of the Age and Argus that wherever possible he called for tenders for the supply of material. That was the practice of his predecessors. He said, too, that the business of the Department cannot be conducted expeditiously without occasionally purchasing material for the supply of which tenders had not been called. He told the press representatives that some of the material required is patented, and can be obtained only from one firm, and that other material is made only by one or two places",28,Returning Officers

The manconsiderable ner in which this coup has been effected virtually annihilates the Senate as an independent voice of the people. It may be surmised that connection with the majority of Ministerial followers had no idea of what they were doing when creating their artificial dead-lock. All that they prodecided that the bably saw was a means to an end of breaking up a powerful Labour majority in the Senate. For this single purpose the expedient was not The Postmaster-General is a busiwithout its merits, since Labour could scarcely hope, in the balance of parties in the constituencies, to maintain such a lop-sided House as that which exists at present of twenty-nine Labourites to seven Fusionists. But little as the Conservatives guessed at the radical nature of the change they were bringing about, the Attorney-General was fully aware of it . Nor has he been guilty of any concealment about it . When he went down to Warrnambool some few months since, he gave the cue to what was in his thoughts, in presenting a forecast of the extinction of the Senate as a part of the Constitution. then showed how very little use to the people the Senate is, and asked the electors to contemplate its being set aside as an expensive encumbrance. doubts about the value of the bicameral system did not affect to be horrified at Mr Irvine's plain indication of the direction in which his aspirations were travelling. Conservatives blenched a little, but forbore anything more than a mild expostulation. What the true reformer of Parliament sees is that, with the more direct association of the people with legislation through the means of the referendum and elective Ministries, there is not much need for a second Chamber of Review. The referendum makes the people themselves perpetual reviewers of the work of Parliament, and the experience of the world is that the populace can do the work more cheaply and -effectively than any second Chamber can do it . There w ill not, tlierefore, be any cause for wailing amongst true reformers over the fate which has overtaken, not only this Senate, but all other Senates, in being made, as the Governor General has made it , a cipher in the Constitution. But, for a l l that-far-reachin g and perhaps salutary as this action of the Government and the Governor General may become-the change has been brought about by quite improper means. A great alteration in the Constitution, as this must prove if the Governor General's -fiat be consummated, should have been put to the people in proper form, and adopted only after their verdict had been given. No Minist r y, or majority in one Chamber, in concert with the Vice-Regent, ought to have any right altogether. It docs not follow at all that to or power to radically modify the Constitution have parliamentary government we must have -.as it stands. We have only to reverse in a Governor General appointed by the authori-thought the state of political parties to see ties in England. . . . It seems to me that how f u l l of significance this argument is. Let the better way to harmonize colonial with I m us suppose a Senate with a large majority of ""Liberals and Conservatives in it .

The argument is too clear to the machinery of government if permission need any reinforcement. In that case it would were given to the colonies to elect their own ' become conspicuous that the Senate as a check Governor General. on legislation has been abolished. The proposal put forward by Mr Irvine in Warrnam-bool w ill have been effected. In that day ConCook's views prior to Federation. servatism w ill see that it builded in reform -far better than it knew. I have not time to elaborate these views, which represent mine. A little while ago, at an Australian Natives' Association Conference, I spoke about the non-necessity for sending State Governors to Australia, and Mr ""Watt, who was the Premier of Victoria until yesterday, in criticising my remarks at Malvern, said that HeI had stated that Governors should be born, bred, and elected in Australia. I may explain that at tbe conference to Liberals who have growing which 1 have referred I was dealing with State Governors. I said that I could agree with that part of the programme The of tbe Australian Natives' Association that said that Governors should not be sent to us from the Motherland. I pointed out that prior to Federation I had not held that view, but that since Federation I did not consider it necessary for State Governors to be sent to us from the Motherland. I said that they should be elected, not merely from those born in Australia, but also from those' who had come to Australia many years previously, and rendered long and distinguished service to Australia. ThenI went on to say that while I did not in any way commit myself to the views I was about to express, in view of what had been done, and in view of the tremendous effect of the decision of the Governor General upon our Constitution, tbe views of the Prime Minister of Australia, Mr Cook, were worthy of being considered. AndI quoted what those views were. These are the words of the present Prime MinisterNowI take leave to dispute that statement perial interests would be to allow the people Mr P. P.

I do not think that it was out of the way for me to say that. -During the reign of the present Government I have not been able to get any satisfaction in the matter of postal accommodation for the district I represent. There is urgent need for a post-office at Botany, and there has been a great deal of correspondence over it. If I go to the Home Affairs Department I am told that the matter is in tlie hands of the Postmaster-General. If I go to the Postmaster-General he ;smiles, and says, "" I shall do what I can,"" and then in a few days tells me that the matter is in the hands of the Home Affairs Department. Between the two Departments I can get no satisfaction. At the Kensington end of my district there is also ungent need for a new post-office. It is a growing resiwork without taking up all the time that dential suburb of Sydney, and the people there are anxious to have facilities for doing their business and telegraphic communication. No finality, however, can be ;got from tlie present Ministry. The same remarks apply to a post-office site that was almost decided upon before the last Ministry went out of office. Tenders had been called for a site, and they had been received, but twelve months have gone by and nothing has been done. The Prime Minister, as head of the Department of Home Affairs, has the assistance of the Honorary Minister and the Vice President of the Executive Council, but yet there is nothing but chaos in the Department. It is time Parliament bad some explanation as to wby there is this chaos. Ministers .are trying to save money so that they can show a decent financial statement when the Treasurer comes to explain his financial proposals. Mr P. P. ABBOTT -The electors will uot believe that story. my constituents to believe it. In the whole of 'the district I represent there has not been a shilling spent by the present Government, whereas during the time of the Eisher Government two urgently required post-offices were built, and the Department were making provision for others. The present Government have come in to starve public works. They have refused to vote the money to carry on the services of the Commonwealth, and so far as Sydney is concerned, they have done nothing towards its progress, nor that of my particular district. more money spent in Sydney than in any other part of Australia. part of Sydney, and I can assure the Postmaster-General that I have heard nothing but growls from my constituents because things cannot be done. I do not blame the Postmaster-General-h e does his best-bu t between the Postal Department and the Department of Home Affairs there is something wrong. No matter what Government comes into power after the next election, in place of allowing the two Departments to fool away time in selecting sites and getting valuations and having repor.ts sent along, a Committee should be appointed to do the the two Departments now waste upon doing it.

There is a compact with the people of New South Wales, and it was canned out, as far as possible, by the late Government. Parliament has never grudged money for this purpose; but, although the Government have been twelve months in office, we have almost a state of chaos. I protest against the people's money being spent on roads where the traffic is so little as to permit of the grass growing. should like to suggest that workmen's cottages be provided in the Territory, so that the men may not be obliged: to live in tents during the present very cold weather: They are prepared to pay rent for proper housing, the provision of which would induce them to take their wives and families, there, and thus help to swell, the population within the area. The Government, however, are trying to save money, and thus we find an unemployed' trouble brewing, not only there, but in all the laTge cities. A Government whose only policy is to "" mark time "" ought to be sent about its business. When the honourable member for Darwin was M in ister of Home Affairs, the ]3resent Prime Minister and the Honorary Minister constantly attacked him for not pushing forward the public works at the Federal Capital; but those honourable gentlemen are now dumb, and it is only right that the public should be made aware of the apathy of the Government. When the Fisher Government were in power, they passed a Workmen's Compensation Act, on a non-contributory basis, under which a workman who was injured received two-thirds of his wages, while, in case of death,, his dependants were given a grant of from £ 2 00 to £500. A man from my district was employed to go on a barge to the Northern Territory,, and at the port of destination he was drowned. I placed the . facts before the Minister, pointing out that there was a widow and. small family without means, and suggested the advisability of putting the Act in force; I received the reply that the matter would be inquired into, and, later, when I asked the reason for. delay, I wasinformed in another letter that thelaw authorities considered that the woman had no case. I do not think that it is right for the G'overnment, under such circumstances, to take advantage of any legal flaw, having, regard to thc intention of Parliament when the Act was passed. It certainly is not creditable on the part of the Government to flout an Act of Parliament in the way they have done; but, although personally and otherwise, I have kept this case to the front , I have not been able to obtain justice for these poor people. I can only say that I sliall make as much use as I can of this case when I am before the electors. The Labour party are looking forward witli pleasure to the coming election, because they firmly beI lieve tliat it will result in a change of Government, thus affording an opportunity for the prosecution of a vigorous, strong policy, with ' the object of developing the resources of the countiry..

It is certainly significant that when we' have a reactionary Government in power we should, for the first time, see an. unemployed difficulty looming ahead. It reflects no credit on any Minister to so conduct the business of his Department as to retard the employment of the people, for this only means a lessening of the-production of wealth.

The honourable member for Barrier also dealt with the question of postal districts. I agree with him State boundaries in this matter an improvement would be effected.

Surelyi t should be possible to make BrokenH ill the administrative centre of the district! And so with Deniliquin and Albury. be made the centre of a postal district extending 50 miles into Victoria, and 50 miles into New South Wales. A t present, however, each State is dealt with separately. Some time ago, in connection with certain work at Albury, there was a shortage of material, and a delay of sometliing like two months occurred in obtaining supplies from Sydney. sent to the Sydney office were overlooked, and there was a shortage of stock there. On the other hand, we had plenty of the required material in Melbourne, and when I learnt of tlie facts I wanted to know why the stock had not been obtained from this city. I was told at once that it was a New South Wales matter, since A l bury was in that State. I have given in structions, however, that in such circumstances material is to be obtained from the nearest available source. It is, after all, only a question of bookkeeping and of subsequent adjustment between the State branches of the Department. As to the question of calling for tenders for works, to which the honourable member for Barrier referred, I may explain that the practice I follow is to obtain first of all an estimate of the value of a work proposed to be carried out, and then to invite tenders for it . If the tenders are higher T h a t is the than the departmental estimate, I cause the work to be carried out by day labour; but if they are lower, I accept a tender for the work.' The honourable member for Ballarat asked me a question regarding the cost of undergrounding wires in that It is not a city. In that case the tenders were something like 25 per cent, higher than the departmental estimate, whereas in connection with an Adelaide work the tenders were below the departmental estimate. Taken aa a whole, I think that the system works very well. the time wasted. that if we could disregard doubt tha'E work is done by contract quicker than by the Department. if any trouble arises in tising for tenders for a work the Departwith the Department at ment could carry it out. South Wales, the Department is eighteen months in arrears with its works. If we do not call for tenders for them, we shall not be able to make up this lost ground. We have not sufficient engineers and other officers to supervise the carrying out of all A l b u ry might such works by the Department. Department have an officer to supervise work done by tender! overseer on every job, but in New South Wales at present we have not sufficient officers to enable the Department to carry Letters out all these works, and therefore, if honourable members desire telephone and telegraph lines to be constructed in tlieir districts, they must put up with the tender system whether they like it or not. As to the complaint made by the honourable member for South Sydney, I may say that when I was last in SydneyI paid a visit to Kensington, which is in his electorate, and found there was room for postal improvements there. There ought to be a new post-office. I may say, however, that I have been endeavouring to give the first call to people in the back-blocks who are without postal facilities. A t the present time, when a district which has, say, an allowance post office, begins to grow, the municipal council quickly agitates for a post-office.

There are several important questions to be discussed. One of these, which relates to the reduction of foreign postage on letters, w ill affect Australia very materially. Its adoption would involve us in a loss of from £50,000 to £100,000 a year, and for that reason I do not propose to support it . We have to look to ourselves, and cannot afford to be too generous to outside people. It is proposed that we shall carry an ounce of mail matter for the price that we are now charging for half-an-ounce. If that reform were adopted in respect of foreign letters we should be asked to do the same in respect of the local service. The Postal Department is losing something like £500,00 0 a year, and it is not fair to ask the people to submit to taxation in order to permit of concessions abroad. rather than the Postal Branch of the Department that is a losing service. be a losing service.

223,Mr Hughes,"I do not pretend toplunder the public that it has been described by interested politicians, but that, on the contrary, it is often the best and cheapest means of getting work done. Coming now to another matter: On the 28th May last, I stated that the method of dealing with applications for employment uncier the Home Affairs Department at Jervis Bay was opposed to, and destructive of, the alleged policy of the Government, upon which Ministers had secured the simultaneous dissolution of both Houses. It has been reiterated repeatedly by Ministers that no distinction has been, and would be, made between applicants for employment who belonged to industrial or other organizations, and other applicants. On the 28th May I read to the House letters which completely shattered that position, and so that I may deal with the subject now to better advantage, I shall read those letters again to the Committee. The first letter is as follows:Commonwealth of Australia. Resident Engineer's Office, Naval College, Jervis Bay, 12th May, 1914. Memorandum for I am in receipt of your application for employment, dated the 10th instant, and should l>e this matter. We are now gravely assurad glad if you would furnish me with the name of your union and also further particulars cf your experience. (Sgd.) The Attorney-General asked, "" B y whom was that written?"" I repliedBy the Resident EngineerMr Jeffrey is, I think, the name; but the name is not so important as the astounding nature of the communication. I venture to say that in the history of the Commonwealth Public Service this is absolutely unique. On the 19th of the same month there came from the same gentleman to this applicant the following communication :"" Naval College, "" 19th May, 1914. "" In reply to your application for employment here, I have to inform you that there are no vacancies at present. Your name has, however, been filed for future reference."" The Minister was admittedly a little disturbed by this revelation, and inquiries were promised. On the 10th June, the honourable and gallant member for North Sydney addressed a series of questions on the subject to the Minister of Home Affairs, to which replies were furnished by the Assistant Minister. We must assume that these replies afford the only explanation possible of the amazing gulf between the protestation and the performance of Ministers; between their platform oratory and their administration. The first question asked was1. Why was the applicant asked for the name of his union T This is the answerSmith was asked for the name of bis union, because in his letter to the Resident Engineer, while stating that he was a unionist, he did not state to which of the two unions he belonged. There are two painters' unions in Sydney. I am informed that there is a federated body registered throughout Australia under the name of the Federated House and Ship Painters Paperhangers and Decorators' Employees of Australasia. A disagreement occurred, and the New South Wales branch then registered under the State Act in the name of the Amalgamated House and Ship Painters Paperhangers and Decorators' Employees Association of New South Wales. The federated body then formed another branch in New South Wales, which, I understand, has not yet obtained registration. That explanation was put forward with all seriousness by a Minister whose Government has made the prohibition of preference the corner stone of its appeal to tbe people, and has secured the infliction on this Parliament of the severest penalty that could be imposed for daring to question its sincerity and its action in that the reason why Ministers have abandoned their principles and broken their pledges, is that there are two unions, one of which is a federated body. What an astounding anti-climax! Professing to recognise no union, and to refuse preference to any unionist, they yet meticulously inquire which union an applicant belongs to! Public money is to be expended, we are told by Ministers, without regard to anything except the value given by tbe employees to the Government. Neither creed, colour, political opinions, membership of an industrial association, nor anything else has any influence in the making of appointments. That being so, why was this man asked whether be belonged to a union? That he was asked such a question damns the Government's position. We are told that the question was asked because there are two unions, and a man might have been appointed who belonged to the wrong one. What can the question mean if it does not mean that the Government wished to ascertain whether the man belonged to a union? It was found that he did belong to a union, and lie was turned down. Those two facts are perfectly well established. Another applicant, who belonged to a union, did not say so, and was appointed. Under the Constitution, no discrimination is to be made because of any one's religious belief. What would be thought if an applicant for employment were asked, "" W h a t religion are you? Not that we want to know, because we do not care two straws, but you might belong to the wrong religion."" Membership of a union, we are told, has nothing to do with the making of appointments to the Public Service. ""Sheep and goats are treated alike. W h y then was the question asked? Why, indeed! that suggests itself to the fertile minds of the Ministeri n charge of the DepartmentI suppose Mr Jeffrey is still there; unhappily it would be impossible to sack him even for this f r i g h t f u l indisfriend. The letter means this, if it means cretion-appear s from the following questions and answers2. Was Smith's application subsequently refused T The answer is "" Yes."" 3. If so, whyf Answer Because, in the opinion of the Resident Engineer, his statement of experience was not satisfactory. The reply sent to Smith was on a stereotyped form to the effect that there were no vacancies at present. Then comes question 4Isi t correct, as stated by the honourable member for West Sydney, that the late Government never asked the name of an applicant's union ? To that the reply was givenUnder the late Government the Works Branch was instructed to write to or inquire of the Secretary of any Trade Union if any men were required, or if men applied at the office they were asked whether they belonged to a union. Tbe last Government had a right to ask whether an applicant was a unionist or not. It believed in preference to unionists, and it acted in accordance with its beliefs. ference would not be given to unionists, and then ask whether a man is a unionist before appointing ment says of preference, not touch, taste, nor handle the accursed thing."" alike. Why then was Smith asked, "" Do you belong to a union?"" and why, when he had replied, ""Yes,"" Mr Hughes. down? We are told that he was turned down because he had not sufficient experience. What had the name of his union to do with tliat? SupposeI were applying for a position, say, as paperhanger or undertaker-that after the election I may officiate at the political obsequies of my esteemed and distinguished friends opposite, is the one thing that bears me up in the hour of our affliction-and being asked my religion, I replied, "" I am a Primitive Methodist."" What would be said if the reply was, "" Had you been any other kind of Methodist, it would be all right, but a Primitive Methodist will not do, because The only reply it is proved by the factj of your being a Primitive Methodist that you have not sufficient experience at your business ' ' ? That is absurd, but not more so than the so-called explanation of my honourable anything at all. Smith was asked which of the two unions he belonged to. This long and meandering dissertation on the internecine struggles of these two unions is f r i g h t f u l l y interesting, but absolutely irrelevant. W h at does the departmental reply mean ? That Smith's experience, or lack of it , is adduced from the fact that he belonged to the wrong union. Could any honourable member tell what experience a man has or has not by the fact that he belonged to this or other union, or this or other religion? Such a thing, is absolutely absurd. It is a perfectly proper thing to ask a man what his experience is, but it is a perfectly improper thing to ask a man what union he belongs to, when the Government do not believe in preference to unionists of any sort. The question continuedIs it correct, as suggested by the honourable member for West Sydney, that every applicant for employment is now asked the name of his union f And the Minister's reply wasNo, it is not correct. The Government has no_ objection to its employees belonging to It did not announce that preanions, and throws absolutely no bar in the way of the employment of unionists. The principle of every artisan having an equal opportunity for Government employment is the only him! This Governinnovation it has introduced. An instance of "" We will this is the case of the employment of Painter C. York at Jervis Bay mentioned below. All applicants are to be treated The charge was that the resident engineer asked this man Smith what union he belonged to, and the answer was he turned now is, "" We do not care whether you belong to a union or not. "" But that is not the answer the Minister gave. He says it was most important to know which of the two unions he belonged to. Then we are told the late Government sent out these same notices, and what of it? because we believe in unionism. But they do not. How comes it that the Government, after being in office for twelve months, sent out a notice asking a man what union he belonged to? is perfectly obvious on the face of their own statement that the Government lack courage to tur n down unionists as such, and are making a hollow pretence of disci imiuating between unions, which is an odious thing to do, and which they have no right to do. I do not know anything at all about these two unions. I have not heard of any quarrel between them, and, indeed, that is not a matter which concerns us. All we are concerned with is whether Smith is a competent painter. No evidence has been adduced to show that he was not, but the evidence is clear that he was a member of a union. York, also, was asked whether he was a member of a union, but he did not say ""Yes."" he said nothing. Like Br'er Fox, he "" lay low,"" and he has got a job. Smith told the truth in saying that he belonged to a union, and he was told, "" Because you belong to the wrong union, we shall not employ y o u . "" I do not want to delay the Committee any longer. ing up the Government's own statement of the case. That is the best defence they can give. They do not deny that, practically twelve months after the Government took office, this man Smith was asked to what union he belonged. If they say that they were using the same forms as were used by their predecessors, that answer is absolutely no excuse for doing what they did. A man is charged with larceny, and he pleads that, "" The man who used to live in this place before is doing seven years for larceny; he has only been out of the house about twelve months, and it is very hard, to get out of the ways of those who went before us."" That is the kind of defence the Honorary Minister makes. He does not deny that Smith was asked if he belonged to a union, and that he was turned down: but he states that the man was turned down because, in the opinion of the resident engineer, his statement of experience was not satisfactory. The statement of the resident engineer, so far as it is expressed in the correspondence, is that the real reason why Smith was turned away was that he belonged to the wrong union. The Government were It was right that we should do so, afraid to engage a man who belonged to the weak union, lest the men belonging to the other union should leave them. It is to this pitiable extremity that my honourable friends are reduced. They It face nothing. They side step every difficulty. The idea of preference to unionists is repugnant to their souls, but they have no objection to unionism; far from it-excepting , of course, in certain circumstances. I will leave it to the electors of this country to decide between us. There tlie matter stands, and no further explanation by my honourable friends can get over the facts I have given. Those letters remain as proof positive of the reliance that is to be placed upon the statements, promises, and platform mouthings of my honourable friends. Minister of Home Affairs) [6.10] -The honourable member for West Sydney has He knew the Government, so made a characteristically amusing statement in regard to this matter, and in a characteristic declamatory way he said that he was content to allow the charge to stand where it is, and allow the people of Australia to deal with it . I hope that by the time this matter has been I am takproperly considered, apart altogether from rhetorical tricks and amusing distortion, the public will say that this charge does not stand, any more than any other of the charges we have been hearing lately, but that this charge lies. AndI am going to show honourable members why. I would remind honourable members that when this matter was brought before this House on a previous occasion it was then the Government, and the Minister especially, who were charged with giving preference to non-unionists. The Government and the Minister personally were held to be responsible, and to have personally connived at this most atrocious of all forms of preference preference to artisans who would not join and subscribe to the unionist movement. That charge was repudiated immediately by Ministers in this House, and, in view of the statement to which we have just",37,Wynne The Y Are W E Are Deeply Grateful To The Post
224,Mr Kelly (Wentworth,"Assistantlistened, I take it that that charge is absolutely and entirely withdrawn; for the honourable gentleman referred all through to what a resident engineer distant 500 miles from Melbourne had done, and he suggested in one of his utterances that this man should have been "" sacked "" for doing such a thing ! It is no longer the Government, but a Government oflicer, who is held wholly and solely responsible for all the trouble. from that point. I desire now only to say that when the country finds its with the statement tliat the Government have been giving preference to non-unionists, I would like the statement of the honourable member, who is the president of the new union which has weighed side by side with the constant charges made by the secretary of that union, the honourable member for Cook, who for many weeks has been accusing me in this House of having given a stronger and more straight out preference to unionists than any previous Government have ever given! One honourable member, who is president of the union, accuses me of giving preference to non-unionists, and so that honourable members opposite may toss the doubleheaded penny with complete success, another honourable member, who is secretary of the same union, accuses me of going to the other extreme, and giving preference to unionists to an extent never previously attempted. passing, because it is now admitted that whatever charge the honourable gentleman out of the letters of the men and the answers of the Resident Engineer, he now, by his very utterances, confesses that the primal charge against Ministers was unfounded, and ought not to have been made. Now let me look into the of discrimination honourable asks, "" What works oflicer whether to one union or another union?"" not want to say anything that damage one union as against and for that reason, until the honourable gentleman has driven me to it, I have not said orsuggested anything that would' have had anysuch effect. But I will say just this, that there are painters and Mr Kelly. painters, as the honourable gentleman knows j there are ship painters and house painters. When one wants house painters he does not want ship painters. In one of these unions there is a greater number of ship painters proportionately than in. the other union. The application of the man Smith opened w it h the statement that he had started his training in the Brooklyn Navy Yards, United States of However, I pass America, and thereby showed conclusively that that man was by origin a ship painter and not a house painter. painter or a house painter? the man's application justified the assumption that he was by origin a ship painter. do w it h the question? assumption in.the mind of the Resident Engineer that the man belonged to a particular branch of the painters' trade whichdeals specially w it h ship painting. who paints a ship could not paint a house? cannot cover a house w it h paint, but he cannot do that class of work as well as a regular house painter. works officer that the sole idea underI only refer to this in lying the request to know which of t h e two unions the man belonged to was that one union contained a greater proportion may attempt to twist of ship, painters than the other. tlie same union as Smith. his references are satisfactory.

The fact is that in any decently-regulated Government Department priority of application accounts for something; in fact, accounts for most things, and this other man, who was taken on two days after Smith was notified that he was not required, had applied nineteen days before Smith thought of going to that job. two days after. after. If the honourable member would only apply his fertile brain to the simple problem, he would find that the notification to the other man to go on dutyon which he acted two days after Smith's letter was dated-must , of necessity have ante-dated Smith's letter by at least a fortnight. Yet this is the sort of absurd charge that is levelled against this Government. with the man's competence? say that his union was the deciding point, and then you say that priority of application was the deciding point. with one tricky effort on the part of the honourable member, he tries to catch me on another.

He means-wh y did the Resident Engineer ask tbe man to what union lie belonged? It was for this reason-the letter of application started with the statement that that to do the man had begun his trade in the First you Brooklyn Naval Yard, and the Resident Engineer assumed from that that the man was a ship-painter, and, as he bad previously had a number of instances of men from one of those unions in which there was a large proportion of ship-painters as against house-painters, he wished to know whether the man, who had not mentioned the name of his union, belonged to that union which had so many shippainters in it. That is the whole thing, lock, stock, and barrel. That is the reason why the Resident Engineer asked that question, and I can assure the honourable I ask honourable memmember that quite a number of unionists are not ashamed of their profession. Quite a number of men applying for work under t>he present Government state that they are unionists, and there is no other case that honourable members can produce where a man, who has described himself as a unionist, and given bond fi.de testimonials, has not been employed by the at page 1263 of present Administration. the Committee why tliey are not ashamed. they know that we do not, discriminate",41,Department Op Home Affairs

If honourable members will consult Hansard of this session, on page 1969 they will find the whole thing clearly set out in a statement which is in no way coloured by me, but is a straightforward departmental answer. I would have preferred not being asked to say why the Resident Engineer wished to know to which of the two unions this applicant for work belonged, but, since the honourable member has dragged it from me, and has in sisted on my saying it , the union cannot hold me responsible for . any effects that may accrue to it as a result of any statement. I have made in this place. I am sorry to have had to make it , but the honourable gentleman has insisted on getting it. I think I have said enough to explode the honourable gentleman completely. I I believe hope we shall not have any more of this sort of nonsense. I wish that honourable members would decide in advance the exact form of attack they are going to make on the Government, and not let us have the same farce that we have had lately of Mr Catts, the honorahle member for Cook, on one side of the fence barking against us--the most amazing thing in natural history-denouncin g us for granting preference to unionists, while another Yes , it is really true.

We may take it , therefore, that the present balance of £800,000 will disappear, and that the year will close with a deficit of about £1,000,000.

267,Mr Archibald,"T h a t is a praci t is right that the people at large should know the position. I prefer that the facts should be put in a plain way so that plain rhen and plain women may understand them-muc h better than they would if they were presented with that financial juggling with which we are so familiar. According to Talleyrand, language was in tended to conceal thought, and it would appear that figures and their manipulation were intended to cover up deficits. Private members this session have had very little opportunity to bring grievances before the House, and I am availing myself of the present occasion to call attention to the curious attitude adopted by the Government in regard to the appointment of the Permanent Returning Officers. In three of the cases within my knowledge-that of Hindmarsh, Boothby, and Richmond-the old Returning Officers had been in the service of the Commonwealth ever since its inception, and are experienced and well qualified men. The two men in South Australia are now in the service of the State Government, and likely to remain there; for whatever may be the f a u l t of the Government of my State, they would not be guilty of throwing a d r if t men who have served them so f a it h f u l l y. In answer to all my questions regarding this matter, I am told that the decision does not rest with the Government, but with the Public Service Commissioner-thi s Czar. Mr P. P. ABBOTT -That is correct. much to the credit of the Government, or to this Parliament. Mr P. P. ABBOTT -We cannot override the Commissioner. exists by virtue of an Act of Parliament, to be superior to Parliament and to the Constitution? Is he at liberty to run rough-shod over the country, making appointments that are without justice and positively a disgrace? He has gone out of his way to do an infamous and a dirty t r i c k ; and what is the excuse, if there is an excuse? The excuse is that all appointments must be made from the Commonwealth or the State service. If the men I have referred to were not servants of the Commonwealth, in the name of heaven, what were they? None but a man who would split hairs for the purpose of doing injustice would discover an Act of the character, or have thought of one, much less have put it into execution. applications ? on their merits? member would see the position if he had any sense, though, God knows, he has not much! Would a merchant or a manufacturer, for example, be justified in turning away an accountant who had served h i m f a it h f u l l y, and appointing another man i i i his place, simply for the love of doing so? Surely the honourable member is not so blinded by party spite that he cannot see justice and equity? I s this what the glorious Liberal party has come to-prepared to cheer and back up anything this man is prepared to do? believes in political influence? matter of these appointments looks very significant. I do not say there is any political influence, but it looks very much like a case of "" Take your time from me, boys,""; and the honourable member, no doubt, knows what that means. I now desire to turn to the question of what the Government calls the "" p u r g in g "" of the rolls. It bas been recognised ever since the initiation of Federation that a marinera term which covers the engineer, captain, and all on board down to the trimmer in the stokehold-by virtue The n it is not of the fact that ""he lives on a ship, is entitled to register w it h that ship as his place of residence in the home port. But it has been discovered in some wonderful way-o n the principle of "" T a k e your I s this man, who time from me, boys""-that this is all wrong, and it has been decreed that mariners must register for somewhere else than the ship. Where is a man to register for when his home is on a ship, and he lives on it , sailing all around the Australian waters? Because of the very fact that a man is at sea, tbe satellites of the Liberal party would strike bim off the roll. f u l work for his country! work than the lackeys of the Liberal party w ill ever do.

Its very existence shows the utter incapacity of the men who are presiding over the affairs of this country. The fact that a mariner's name was on the roll at a port would suggest to any sane and intelligent man that there was a reason for its being there. But no; some abstract idea jumps into the Chief Electoral Officer's head, and he issues a regulation. What this is for he does not know, and he does not care-h e has to "" purge "" the rolls. A very strong protest is justified against the attitude of the Government in regard to the double dissolution. I am not going to refer to the Governor General, or repeat comments that have been pretty freely made in this connection. I am willing to assume, for my argument, that the Governor General, with section 57 before him, had a great deal to justify the position be has taken up. ways of governing a country by either party. Public men can try to raise the standard of public life; have some regard to ideals, and, in calling history to their aid, adopt the morals of the best men, and not the worse. The aim should be to get the best out of our Constitution, and not degrade it. I unhesitatingly say that the present Government never intended to do anything of a useful character from the hour they took office; and the record shows absolutely nothing to their credit -onl y one continuous folly and failure. It is a matter of indifference to me whether we on this side win at the next election ; but from my knowledge of the Australian people, I am certain that they will not tolerate any Government who drag their institution down from that standard which they desire to preserve. Mr P. P. ABBOTT -What about the 57 of the Constitution, which I am sure last election ? that matter later.

I bave given the bonorable member for Kennedy his quietus. He ought not to have said what he did, in view of the plain statement that I had put before the Committee already. Great things are expected from members who have held high positions. For many a day we obeyed the honourable member for Kennedy as Speaker, and I did not expect that he would misrepresent matters. him again. though I do not say that for any personal objection that I have to the honourable member. Many misstatements have been made during the debate, and during the year that we have been in office. There are two statements that have been made continually with which I propose to deal. One is that wben tbe last Liberal Government left office, and was succeeded by the Fisher Government, there was a deficit of £450,000. That has never been disputed. about it, but we have a good defence which has already been put before the country, though it has not been continually repeated. That we left a deficit of £450,000 is being said all over tlie country, as if we had been a spendthrift Government, and had brought the Commonwealth into debt. As honourable members opposite insist on reiterating this statement, I may be excused if I go into ancient history to give the exact facts. We have been told that the Fisher Government, when they came into office, found a deficit of £450,000, and three years later left office with a surplus of £2,653,000. That parrot-cry is heard all over the land. but the facts are capable of explanation, and I shall explain them. I have no hesitation about making these remarks, because I am speaking the truth, and honourable members cannot get away from the truth. I have no wish to equivocate in -any way. Those unacquainted with the facts might believe that it was the financial wisdom and economical ""administration of the Labour party which brought about this apparently great improvement in the finances of the Commonwealth; but, as I shall show, the facts do not support that belief. It is well known to all who take an interest in these matters that the Commonwealth began to pay old-age pensions before the funds under its control sufficed to meet its expenditure. The date on which the pension liability commenced was 1st July, 1909. member's Government started with £200,000 in hand. we had £650,000 in hand; but that was not enough. you how to save money. to refer to that matter now. I considered that the money was being illegally taken from the States. It was thought proper to begin paying pensions on the. 1st July, 1909, although the funds available did not then suffice. On the 31st December, 1910, the Braddon provision, under which the Commonwealth bad to pay to the States threeWe have never said much fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue, ceased to operate, and it was intended to make some temporary arrangement to cover the period between July, 1909, and that date. My late friend, Sir William Lyne, who was then Treasurer, when cross-examined as to how he would get the money, said that he would be a little short, but that he would finance the business somehow. It was well known that the one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue which was retained by the Commonwealth would not be sufficient. But the expiration of the Braddon section was at hand, and it was felt that we should be able tofinancethe business in some way",47,Department Op Home Affairs

321,Sir John Forrest,"I do not wishuntil it had expired, when there would be more money available. The permanent division of the Customs and Excise revenue between the Commonwealth and the States had long been the subject of animated discussion, and in August, 1909, nearly eighteen months before the Braddon section was to cease to have force, the Deakin Government remained in office, Deakin Government entered into an agreement with the Governments of the States, under which they were to receive from"" the Commonwealth 25s. per head of their populations, instead of three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue. At the time the amount was looked upon as a small one in comparison with what had been formerly received; and it was small, but the Governments of the States were led to agree to the arrangement by the proage pensions before the expiration of the mise of the Deakin Government that the people should be asked by referendum to agree to an alteration of the Constitution which wonld secure the per capita payment for an unlimited time. The Governments of the States also agreed that a proposal to alter the Constitution to tersite always take great credit for what minate the Braddon section on the 30th June, instead of the 31st December, 1910, should be submitted to the people. They agreed, further, that the deficit which was ried without a dissentient voice. One expected to result in 1909-10 from the payment of pensions by the Commonwealth, should be borne by the States to the amount of £600,000. Thus the Deakin Government made provision for the inevitable deficit. Every one knew that there must be a deficit if we did not get money from the States or elsewhere. In April, 1910, tbe people rejected our proposed amendments of tbe Constitution. Sir JOHN"" FORREST -I , am not now discussing that, though I advised it. The deficit, which amounted to about £450,000, could not be legally recoveredfrom the States, and it was therefore carment inherited a surplus of £2,261,673 ried forward. The Labour Government subsequently, by force of law, instead of under an agreement, did exactly what was contemplated by the Deakin Government. The Labour Government provided for the payment to the States of 25s. per head of population, but only for a period of ten years, and thereafter until the Parliament should otherwise provide. The deficit of £450,000 was brought about solely by the early payment of old-age pensions. £1,500,000, and we had about £650,000 brought forward from previous years towards paying the £1,500,000. The early payment of old-age pensions was the sole cause of the deficit. Had the and had their proposed alteration of the Constitution been agreed to by the people, there wpuld have been no deficit. Indeed, the Labour Government met it in practically the same way that the Deakin Government proposed to meet it. So much, therefore, for any credit that the Labour party may assume for getting rid of the deficit. The Deakin Government made ample provision for the payment of oldBraddon section, but the people did not sanction our proposed alteration of the Constitution. Had they done so, and bad we remained in office, we sbould have had ample funds to meet the deficit on tbe 30th June, 1910. Honourable members oppothey did, but they do not give us credit for having introduced tbe old-age and invalid pensions legislation, which was carwould hardly expect them to be continually talking about this deficit of £450,000, which was incurred to enable old-age pensions to be paid many months before the' Braddon provision expired. do it. the Deakin Government do it , you have no occasion to say so much now of the deficit which resulted from what we did. A great deal has been said about the surplus of £2,653,223 on the 30th June, 1913. I do not know why such a song should be made about it, because it must be remembered that the Fisher Governfrom the year 1911-12. During the year 1912-13 the Fisher Government received as revenue £1,477,413 more than the Treasurer estimated, and expended £1,175,810 less than he estimated. the Opposition is never tired of referring to the surplus of £2,653,223 which was in the Treasury when he left office.

I went on to sayThe Government do not intend to interfere with the expenditure to which the country is committed. We intend to administer the affairs of the Commonwealth on safe and economical lines, doing justice to all, and showing favouritism to none. We will do our best to restore public confidence, to stimulate enterprise, and give security to the whole people. That is what we promised this House when we came into office, and I submit that we have carried out that promise faithfully. MrM c DONA LD (Kennedy) [8.43] I congratulate the Treasurer on the caref u l manner in which he read that speech. The honourable member read a speech the other day in which he carefully avoided telling the people that he would finish the year with a deficit of £1,819,000.' He led this Committee to believe that there would be a surplus of £824,000 at the end of the financial year, and it was on this point that a discussion took place this afternoon. I ask the honourable member whether he has a deficit of £1,819,000 on the year's transactions ? protect the Treasurer from interjections, to an undue number of which he is subjected at times. I now ask the Treasurer to assist me in keeping order, and I also ask the honourable member for Kennedy not to put his questions directly across the table, because by doing so he invites interjections in reply. MrM c DONALD put my questions directly to the Treasurer, but as he accused me this afternoon of saying something which was not. correct, I wish to prove that it was correct. Until I got the answer from the Treasurer a moment ago, he did not tell the Committee that there was a deficit of £1,819,000 on the year's transactions. On the other hand, he has referred to an alleged surplus of £824,305. Let us read the right honourable gentleman's words, so that there will be no mistake. Honourable members are very generous with other people's money. Considerable savings have been made in other Departments; and, as far as can be foreseen at present, the accounts at the close of the year will probably be as follows:-Accumulate d surplus at the 30th June, 1913, £2,643,305-thi s figure is audited, and, therefore, exact; revenue for the year, as estimated, £21,462,000, and, with the surplus, making a total of £24,105,305; expenditure for the year as now estimated, £23,281,000, showing an estimated surplus on the 30th June, 1914, of £824,305. What was the Treasurer's object in saying that there was a surplus of £824,305 -becaus e he must have known that his statement was not correct, and that he did not have a surplus? The object was to make the country believe that he had so carefully supervised the expenditure as to have a surplus of £824,305. He has admitted that the last time he was in office, in spite of the fact that he took over a surplus of £600,000 from the Fisher Government, after nine months in office there was a deficit of £500,000. In other words, the Fusion Government went to the bad at the rate of over £100,000 a month. The Treasurer went on to explain that the late Government had l e f t a surplus of £2,643,000, and put it into Trust Fundsf or old-age pensions and naval construction; but the right honourable gentleman, in dealing with old-age pensions, instead of paying them out of the current revenue of this year, has exploited those Trust Fundsi n order to make good an amount equal to £1,819,000. In the next breath he claimed credit for having paid the old-age pensions six months I did my best to earlier than they would have been paid had not the Braddon section been repealed, whereas there was not one man who did more to jrrevent the Surplus RevenueB ill being passed than the honourable member. He and his friends ""stonewalled "" tlie measure night after night, in order to prevent the Government .getting the necessary money to enI do not wish to able the old-age pensions to be paid. The Treasurer should be the very last to talk of what he did in respect to old-age pensions. He should be honest in the matter. A f t e r telling the Committee that the Fisher Government left a surplus of £2,643,000, the right honourable gentleman went on to explain that there was an amount of £328,248 that should have been charged to the year 1912-13, b u t which was passed on to the year 1913-14. W ill the right honourable gentleman say that there is not a similar amount to be passed on from this year to next year? It is done every year.

If one could find out what particular quality of magnifying glass would suit, the honourable gentleman's political visio.i, we might discover something that would really secure some attention and action. For many years, Queensland and New South Wales, at very heavy expense, subsidized a line of steamers which gave direct access to Canadian markets. That contract was taken over by the Commonwealth Government at Federation, and, by yearly extensions and short contracts, was carried on u n t i l 31st July, 1911, when it expired. tiations were proceeding between New Zealand and Canada, and New Zealand had been able to arrange some Tariff advantages amounting, generally speaking, to about £d. per l b . on food stuffs. Queensland and New South Wales, who had succeeded in creating and developing a very satisfactory business, found themselves faced with the difficult position that New Zealand was arranging a shipping service with Canada, which was intended [84] also to include the two former States, and would place their goods on the Canadian market at an advantage of i d . per l b . generally. On the 27th September, 1910, the press published a cablegram from SirW i l f r i d Laurier to Sir Joseph Ward, the Premier of New Zealand, to the effect that he was asking the concurrence of the Commonwealth Government in an arrangement that would include New Zealand, as well as Queensland and New South Wales. Only one tender was received; and in November, 1910, the honourable member for Wide Bay, who wasthen Prime Minister, stated that a communication had been received from Canada requesting concurrence; but, in view of the advantageous reciprocal Tariff arrangement New Zealand had with Canada, he was not in favour of heavily subsidizing a line of ships which would place Queensland, New South Wales, and the other States at a disadvantage. So the matter has been going on, and there is the fact that the contract expired three years ago. The business that had been built up by Queensland and New South Wales was practically sacrificed. ting another shipping contract? cause of the failure to enter into reciprocal relationship with Canada and New Zealand. pire when the honourable member for Barrier was Postmaster-General? ter of Trade and Customs evidently wishes to insinuate that the honourable member for Barrier was to blame for the stoppage of the contract, and for the dislocation of trade; but the opposite is the case, as is shown by one outstanding fact. The then Minister of Trade and Customs, the honourable member for Yarra, was in comNegomunication with both Canada and New Zealand, and before he l e f t office, in 1913, he had practically completed an arrangement with the two Dominions. All that was necessary was the signature to the arrangement in regard to the advantageous reciprocal relationships.

The attitude of the Brisbane merchants, and of the then Government, was, and is yet, that unless Australian goods are to be admitted to Canada on an equal basis with those of New Zealand, it would be utterly foolish and bad business to pay £70,000, which would only have the effect of helping a competitor to enter our markets. idea of subsidizing a line of steamers to enable a competitor to cut our business, under such circumstances, would be absurd; and I am sure that the Minister of Trade and Customs would not now be willing to enter into any such arrangement. office in June, 1913, and I have read the replies given up to June, 1914, on this question. We have been told that the matter is ""receiving attention,"" aud "" under observation "" ; and if we live long enough we may possibly find the Government doing something. If the Government do not do something within the next three months, they will not have another opportunity, for they will have to give place to others who will, at any rate, make an effort.

They say that since the Commonwealtli is not a party to the contract, it is not interested in it. In view of the efforts which are being made by the great steam-ship companies trading between the Northern and Southern Hemisphere every Government ought to be alive to the commercial importance attaching to the opening up of new markets. The present Government, however, seem to be quite indifferent to all these matters. Australian industries can perish for -want of Tariff protection, and Australian industries may perish so far as oversea markets for tlieir produce are concerned, because the Government The are utterly indifferent. We have here an opportunity for a reciprocal arrangement of the most tempting character with Canada. Just before he left office, as Minister of Trade and Customs, the honourable member for Yarra arrived at a most satisfactory agreement with the The present Government took Canadian Minister, who was then visiting Australia. That agreement, I am sure, would have been acceptable to the Parliament and to the country. But for all we know, it is still unsigned. The Liberal Government are paying so much attention to political niatters of comparatively small importance that they have no time to give to these great subjects of national moment.

The point that I this International Postal Conference will be of tremendous and that if the Government deem it necessary to be represented at all, they ought to be represented by some one who occupies an official position, or by a member of this Parliament. When the Conference meets the honourable member for Balaclava w ill be neither Postmaster General nor a member of this House. That is au unfair position in which to place the representative of Australia. It is unfai r also that the Commonwealth should be represented by a man who w ill have no standing so f a r as the Parliament is concerned. If the bonorable gentleman bad intended to remain in Parliament tbe Government could not have made a more acceptable appointment. He will render good service to the Commonwealth in any event, but we shall largely lose the advantage of his presence at tbe Conference, in view of the fact that when he comes back be w ill only be able to make to us a. written statement.

The present Government have decided that five adjudicators shall sit in London and adjudicate. bere? point I want to make. What is wrong with Australians that the designs for the Federal Parliament Houses cannot be sent to Melbourne to be adjudicated upon on the spot? overlooking tbe fact-deliberately , perhaps-that an Australian architect is Chairman of the Adjudication Board. of representatives of architectural assoto the advantages of competition in these ciations which met in Melbourne was invited to nominate a gentleman to proceed to London. It did so. Whether the best man has been selected is immaterial; but this gentleman is going to London, with all expenses paid, and is to receive £10 per day while engaged on Commonwealth business. It would have been ten times more useful, and would have cost little more, to have brought the pare with those of ancient times, when four adjudicators from the other side of the world to Melbourne, so that they could visit the site before adopting any design. Designs, plans, and full particulars were sent all over the world, and architects generally were invited to submit designs for the Federal Capital city. Mr Griffin, an American gentleman, secured first prize, and was invited, very properly, to come over here to look after the work. When he came bere, be found that a departmental Board bad adapted three or four of the selected designs, and from them had evolved a general scheme. As soon as he went to Canberra, however, and saw the country for himself, Mr Griffin discarded the Departmental Board's design, practically discarded his own, and based upon it a new design altogether. This shows that, notwithstanding all the details that could be supplied on paper, it was not possible to secure such a conception of the work required as is gained by an actual visit to the Territory. The building of tbe Federal Parliament Houses is a work of vital importance. If the architects who are adjudicating on the designs had been brought to Australia, had visited the Capital site, and had studied the contour of the country and its climatic conditions, having all available meteorological data submitted to them, they would have been more likely to choose the best design. As it is, what do they know of Australian conditions? We have it on record that a gentleman of very high standing in London was commissioned to design the new Commonwealth buildings there, but that, when his plans came to Australia, the Commonwealth architect pointed out so effectively how they could be improved that the Government sent him to London, with tbe result that the rental value of the building was increased by something like £3,000 annually, and the plans were entirely remodelled. I have considerable doubt as cases. have a distinctly Australian architecture? ment have our architects to develop an Australian style of architecture?

374,Mr Lairdsmith (Denison) [9.34]. Made Out To Be.,"The Leader of the Opposition has promised that, if returned to power, he will establish a Commonwealth-owned steamer service between Tasmania and the mainland. All that the present Government has done is to tie up the Commonwealth for seven years, increasing the subsidy of the steam-ship companies from £13,000 to £15,000. admit that the service between Melbourne ancl Launceston has been improved, but we need a better service between Sydney and Hobart, the great bulk of the tourists coming from New South Wales, where there seems to be more money than in any other State. bart last week, a merchant showed me two letters, stating that goods had been brought to the wharf at Melbourne for transport by the New Zealand steamer calling at Hobart, and had been refused, with the result that they had to be sent by way of Launceston, at a considerable increase of cost. the opinion that the goods were not taken because the steamer would arrive at Hobart ou a Saturday, and the company did uot wish to pay for overtime. Surely we are not to be penalized because tlie waterside workers have obtained something like reasonable conditions. For the information of the Postmaster-General, and to show the interest which the people of Tasmania are taking in this matter, I quote now from the Launceston Examiner of 30th MayThe references in the Senate to the matter cf steam-ship fares, as reported in yesterday's Kxamincr, naturally came in for a fair share of local attention. The means ancl the cost of transport between Tasmania and tbe mainland are a subject of prime importance to the people of this State. The interest consequently is easily understood. Although no information of a definite character is yet locally available, there is reason to believe that before long there may be an increase in the fares and freights between the ports of Tasmania and those of the mainland. The new Tasmanian mail contract was mentioned in the Senate on Thursday, Senator Findley inquiring whether any provision was made in it to safeguard citizens against any increase of fares. Senator McColl asked that notice be given. Locally it is understood that the new contract contains a provision that tliere shall be no increase unless it has the itpproval of the Postmaster-General; but, it is pointed out on behalf of tlie companies, that if they can prove to the Postmaster-Geneday that their expenses have been heavily increased, and particularly when that has been done by one of the Commonwealth's own Courts, it is very reasonable to suppose that be would allow such extra charges as might be Mr Laird Smith. shown to be required to give the contractors a fair profit. So far, the announced increase applies only to the mainland coastal trade, but it will be a pleasant surprise if Tasmania escapes. Up to the present Mr Cramond, the local manager of tbe Union Co., has not been advised of any contemplated alteration. The local manager of the Huddart Parker Steamship Company Ltd. (Hon. J. W. Evans) left yesterday on a visit to Melbourne. He goes I on the company's business, and will be absent a fortnight. I hope that the Postmaster-General will use his iufluence to prevent the freights and fares being further increased on that steam-ship route. Such an increase will be penalizing us to an extent greater When1 was in Hothan we can bear; it will be penalizing the merchauts of Tasmania, and the people of that State will suffer considerably by reason of the huge rates that vvill be charged. There is another matter I should like to draw attention to. Last year a huge area of land was purcliased on the river Derwent for the The merchant was of purpose of constructing a naval base, but the land to-day is in the same position as it was when taken over by the Government. Nothing has been done, and the people are wondering, why the land should be allowed to remain idle. The loss in interest on the purchase money is considerable, and surely the Government might have taken some steps to prepare for the enormous work of making a naval base on that site. I suppose this is one of the means by which the Government have made a savinga saving by cheeseparing and restricting expenditure on necessary works. If members on the Government side were free to speak they would say that a cheeseparing policy has been pursued, and that the development of Australia has been seriously retarded. Isi t any wonder that the Treasurer claims to have effected an enormous saving ? I was astonished to hear the right honourable gentleman say that the Government had restored public confidence. W ill anybody who has given serious consideration to this question say that the public ever lost confidence? Why should these people lose confidence in the Fisher Government, who accounted for every penny of expenditure that they incurred, and who were under the rigid supervision of an Opposition who stuck us up night after night when we were trying to get our Estimates through? Complaint was made at that time about certain information not being given, but this Committee is asked to vote over £3,000,000 to carry on the Government services for the next three months without having even a schedule submitted to show how the money is to be expended. Had this been done by a Labour Government, what criticism would they have been subjected to ! We are supposed to meekly accept the short Budget given by the Treasurer without any criticism, bu t we find that as we criticise the right honourable gentleman brings down another Budget. Which Budget is correct, that made a few nights ago, or that made by the Treasurer to-night? I desire to know in whafc way the great saving whicli the Treasurer claims has been made? Before the honourable member for Gippsland entered this House he went about the country denouncing the financial waste on the part of the Fisher Government. Yet we now find him sitting silently behind a Minister who alters his Budget statement within a few days. an expenditure of £840,000 on ""contingencies. tingencies, which the honourable member for Gippsland told the country the Fisher Government had ing the door and keeping the Auditor General out. But the right honourable member for Swan has been honest enough to say that the accounts had all been duly audited, and everything was straight and above board when he assumed office. the right honourable gentleman been Prime Miuister, as well as Treasurer, he would not have found himself in the hole he is in at the present time. strong man like the right honourable member been Prime Minister, he would have had a complete supervision of the whole of the Departments, and would not be in the hole into which he has been pushed by Ministers letting the Teesdale Smith contract, and incurring other expenditure that the right honourable gentleman knew nothing about until he was informed by his officer. No Treasurer can be supposed to read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest the whole of the enormous expenditure of this country; he has to trust to his Ministers, and they have led him into a hole. Yet to-night he spoke about restoring public confidence, and the honourable meinber for Gippsland listened paralyzed. "" D i d I not tell y o u , "" he says, "" t h a t I was r i g h t ? "" and I presume he will go to his constituents and say, "" I heard the right honourable member for Swan, that great financier, say that the Government have restored public confidence."" The honourable member said that there had been a waste of money in defence expenditure. The further honourable members opposite travelled into the back country the stronger were their statements, because there was no press to report them, and the farmers, working long liours, could not combat the misstatements of the honourable members for In d i , Wannon, and Gippsland. The Treasurer claims that he has effected a saving of £160,000 on defence, and that he has made big savings in the Stores Department. Has that Department been cut clown and starved so that the next ""Minister will have to build it up again ? If tliere was proper supervision of the Stores Department-and tiie Auditor-General no doubt sees to that-ther e is no room to make the great saving which the honorahle member has claimed. Then the Treasurer claims to have effected a saving of £200,000 on the construction work. The honourable member for Dalley made it perfectly clear that that saving was "" Donei n . "" brought about by discharging some men and engaging others, so enabling the work to be slowed down. Tliere has been au alleged saving of £200,000 in an expenditure of over £1,000,000, and the right honourable gentleman tells us that the Government have restored public confidence. The honourable member for Kennedy dealt I venture to say that had well with the supposed surplus for tlie present financial year.

385,Mr Sampson (Wimmera) [10.4],"The letter forwarded to the Inter-State Commission is dated the 6th June, and reads as follows: At an executive council meeting of the Victorian Provincial Press Association, held yesterday, the Inter-State Commission's report upon the combination known as Typothetna was considered. In the report it is stated that the Victorian Provincial Press Association is an affiliated member of the above combination, and that affiliation involves co-operation in observing and enforcing the cardinal features of the contract said to bave been entered into between the Melbourne Master Printers' Association, paper merchants, and suppliers of printers' materials in the State of Victoria. W it h regard thereto I am directed by my executive to inform you that the Victorian Provincial Press Association is not now, and never has been, in affiliation with the combination referred to in the report; that it is not aware of any contract between any of the parties; .and that it has never been asked to observe or enforce any of tbe provisions of such a contract; and my executive council therefore fails to see any justification for our association's inclusion as a member of the combination. to accept the Inter-State Commission's report without evidence I am exceedingly pleased to hear the Press Association was never requested to ber for Wimmera. I quite endorse the send any representatives to give evidence sentiments he has expressed. before the Inter-State Commission. It Inter-State Commission makes a big has heen included by the Commission as blunder over one particular item, how can part of the combine without having had we depend on its reports when they come the opportunity of giving evidence, or, so before us ? Some honourable members profar as the association knows, without any fess to be satisfied with a summary of the evidence being presented to the Commisevidence the Commission takes. I have sion that it was affiliated or connected already indicated that I shall not be satiswith the combine, which this letter exfied with anything less than a report plicitly denies. a serious blunder like that? tain that after the evidence is presented. to be presented. report declaring that there is affiliation between the Victorian Master Printers' Association and the Victorian Provincial Press Association, and we have no evidence as to how the Commission has based its statement to tliat effect. The Victorian Provincial Press Association has never been connected with the Master Printers' Association, and knows nothing of any contracts. It is in no way associated with the combine, and it has not been asked to give evidence. We are all most anxious that the Inter-State Commission shall provide Parliament with valuable information in connection with tlie Tariff and other matters, but if reports of this character are to be submitted, they will very largely discount the value of the Commission's reports when they come before us. Tlie Secretary of the Victorian Provincial Press Association has taken the proper course of forwarding this letter to the Inter-State Commission. The association is desirous that the Inter-State Commission shall justify its finding in relation to the Victorian Provincial Press Association, or else withdraw absolutely its report associating that body with the Master Printers' Association. Sof a r no reply has been received from the Inter-State Commission, and, in order to vindicate its position and justify itself to the public, and gain for its denial the same publicity as is given to the report of the Commission, I have been requested to read these letters, and hand them to Hansardf or And . yet we are asked publication. Provincial statement made by the honourable memI f the which is as near a verbatim report as it is possible to get. The Treasurer has given us two small statements in regard to the finances, but honourable members are not yet satisfied, and I add my plea to those already made this afternoon for a very concise statement of the condition of the finances to be submitted prior to the House being dissolved. I do not know whether Ministers agree to a statement made on the 11th March by the Attorney General at the Glenlee State School, in the Wannon electorate, and reported in the N h ill Free Press of the 13th March. This statement has a very important bearing on the manner in which the Government are dealing with the finances just prior to a general election. The Attorney-General is reported to Eave saidWhy, then, is an autumn session necessary?

On Friday last, i u lutely necessary to have a meeting of Parliament by which we can send up the test Bills, and have them rejected, before the time arrives for tbe Treasurer to bring down the statement of thefinancialposition. I call the special attention of the Treasurer to the concluding words. To use a plain phrase heard every day i u the streets, "" Does this account for the milk iu the cocoanut?"" why the House and the country are to be kept in absolute ignorance of the true state of the finances, simply because Ministers desire to get a dissolution and go to the country without showing exactly what the financial position is ?

As far back as the 11th March, we had the Attorney-General saying that it was necessary to bring the test Billsi n and have them rejected, and to get a dissolution, and not to tell the country of the state of the nnances. very serious position we find ourselves in within a few days of an election and of the close of the financial year, when the Treasurer ouglit to be able to tell us the exact financial position. the Budget unti l August, anyhow. be dissolved, and we ought to have a fuller statement than we have had. can. Attorney-Generali n the Wannon electorate explain why the Government were in such a h u r ry to get a double dissolution? The present Government came in to put the right, but tbey bave made a muddle of both. The replies of the Prime Minister and other members of the Government to questions in respect to the Tariff were of Friday last from what answer to the earnest pleadings of the honourable member for In d i it was an arrangement, and a nice b it of play-the Minister of Trade and Customs, with quite a show of enthusiasm, said that should tlie Government survive the general election, aud once more find themselves on the Treasury bench, the anomalies Is this the reason in the Tariff would be rectified on the assembling of the new Parliament. On 14th May of this year the honourable member for Capricornia asked the following questions:1. Has the Prime Minister or the Minister of Trade and Customs invited or instructed the JOHN FOKREST -We did not get Inter-State Commission to make recommendations for the adjustment and revision of the Tariff? 2. Is it the intention of the Inter-State Commission to make any progress report as to the amendment of the Tariff? 3. Is it the intention of the Inter-State Commission to wait until it has completed the taking of evidence on all requests and in nil Over and over again, when States before making any recommendations to Parliament with respect to Tariff amendment or revision? 4. On what date, if at all, was the InterState Commission asked to make an interim cr progress report with respect to the Tariff? To these questions the Prime Minister replied as follows:1. Yes, under date 8th September, 1913. The Inter-State Commission advises tliat2 and 3. Pending the hearing of evidence in It is a all the States interested, the Commission is unable to arrive at any definite conclusions which would enable it to submit a progress report in connection with the Tariff. If , however, as the investigation proceeds, such a course is found by the Commission to be expedient, it will be taken. 4. No special request has been made for an interim report. (See reply to 2 and 3.) On 2Sth May, about a fortnight ago, the Prime Minister, when speaking on the same subject, and referring to some observations of my own, is thus reported in Hansard, page 1645-6When the Inter-State Commission has completed its investigations into the Tariff, the responsibility of this Parliament will commence, and it will be for this Parliament to exercise that responsibility in the light of the information furnished by the Inter-State Commission. . . . Have they not been appointed finances and the Departments for the purpose of informing this House? It is their prime function; but what the honourable member wants is that we shall dictate to them what they shall do, what industries they shall investigate, when they shall report, and what evidence they shall submit. That would be an interference with the proper functions of the Commission, as laid down in the Act, and a very different character on the Government do not intend to lend themthey were selves to any such action.",62,Department Op Home Affairs

The second statement was made, I think, on the motion for the adjournment of the House by the honourable member for Cook. with the statement? it seems to be a direct contradiction of what the Minister of Trade and Customs said on Friday last. the insincerity of the Government on the Tariff issue. The Government speak with so many voices that it is difficult to know what their intentions really are.

Young men of exceptional intelligence, after triumphantly coming through the most severe tests, were denied a chance of stepping higher up the ladder. They submitted applications for transfer to the Instructional Staff, and were prepared to undergo examinations similar to the examinations which the ex-Imperial men are subjected to; but, to their disappointment, the A.A.G. returned their papers, with a memorandum stating that, owing to their not having Imperial service, the applications could not be considered.
