48,Mr Corser (Wide Bay) [11.25],"given under this Bill will be in addition to whatever is received under the War Pensions Act by soldiers, widows, and children. The War Pensions Act will remain unaltered. State Premiers and State Ministers of Lands the Prime Minister made the following statement:has said, it is only right I should submit to this Conference some typical instances of cases in which pensions are being drawn by incapacitated soldiers and their families. The following list, in which I will .not disclose the names, shows interesting details:receives £3 per fortnight; his wife, £1 10s. p'er fortnight; eldest child, f l ; second child, 15s.; and each of remaining six children, 10s. per fortnight; a total of £9 5s. per fort' night (£4 12s. 6d. per week). , with wife and six children, receives, in all, £8 5s. per fortnight (£4 2s. 6d. per week). , with wife and four children; total pension, £7 5s. per fortnight (£3 12s. 6d. per week). has lost one eye; no other disability; : receives 15s. per week; eldest child receives 5s., and second child 3s. 9d. per week; a total of 23s. 9d. per week (wife dead). has lost right eye, and vision in left eye defective. This pensioner,. with his wife and six children, was receiving, altogether, £4 2s. 6d. per week, from 25th March, 1916, until 7th December, 1916, when it was found that he was.not totally incapacitated, and each pension was reduced to three-fourths of the maximum. The amount now being paid is £3 Is. 9d. per week. receives full pension (30s. per week), and has two sisters each receiving 5s. per week. ceives £1 14s. 6d., six children receive, in all, £3 15s. per fortnight. The family pension is thus £4 9s. 3d. per week. granted 30s. per week, and mother granted 10s. per week. On the whole, it cannot be said that these pensions do not conform to Australian conditions. The definite answer I received from the Minister to the question I asked a few moments ago will do much to remove the objection to this Bill as a purely skeleton measure. It should be our desire that our returned soldiers shall not be discharged until some occupation is ready for them. There are many ways in which they can be employed. In Victoria there is an arrangement by which the returned soldiers who desire to learn a trade are taught, and are given so much per week during tiheir training. When they are proficient they are equipped with the tools necessary for the carrying on of their trade. That is a very good system of repatriation, especially when it is operated in conjunction with the War Pensions Act. I understand this Bill to be intended to provide something in addition to the pensions already provided, a means by which the men returning to Australia will be able-to get into occupations. Many will desire to return to their former trades. But it may be shown by employers that some of the men are not as proficient as they were when they left -that because of their sufferings they cannot do the same amount of work as they could do formerly. I am pleased to find the provision that the Commissioners may make good the difference between what the men are now worth to their employers and what they would have earned had they continued at their employment and -not gone to the Front. No doubt many of those who return will seek to get into employment! of that kind. But I am convinced that men who have been living in the open, and have been well trained for the last three years, will have no desire to go into any sort of confinement. They will seek to be placed on the land where they may live an open and free life. Senator Millen indicated in another place that of the soldiers with whom the Department has been able to get into touch, 40,000 have intimated their desire to settle on the land. No doubt there are receives £3 9s. per fortnight, wife remany others who will express the same wish, hut, if even those 40,000 are each to receive an advance of £500 to equip a farm, and £1,000 worth of land, about £60,000,000 will require to be provided. That is a matter which demands the serious consideration of honourable members. Some of the States have not been as fortunate as others in getting population and advancing land settlement. Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia, and New South Wales contain very large areas of first class land, hut for many years settlement has been taking place, and there is not as much good Crown land available as in some of the other States. The pick of the land in Victoria, Tasmania, and South Australia has been alienated. In Queensland, on the contrary, of 429,000,000 acres only 5 per cent, or 6 per cent, has been alienated.

51,Mr Hughes,"In view of what Mr Holmanin Western Australia. Tliere remains a considerable choice of good land in those States, and the Governments are desirous of getting more population. Queensland has given 160 acres free to settlers in the past, and, until recently, paid the passages of immigrants. I cannot see why we should not adopt in Australia a scheme similar to that carried out in Canada, particularly in Manitoba, where every alternate block was given to a company on the condition that the concessionaires constructed a railway. The Queensland Government could give the Federal Government the same opportunity as is being given in Canada to private enterprise, by setting aside alternate blocks of agricultural land for sale for ithe settlement of returned soldiers only, on condition that the money given for that land by the Commonwealth should be applied by the State in constructing roads and railways to these and the alternate blocks. I am not making this suggestion without some knowledge. The Queensland Minister for Lands stated at the Premier's Conference that in the North Burnett district of my electorate there were 1,500,000 acres of land suitable for the settlement of soldiers, and never held office, and which has as one of behind it another area of 1,000,000 acres, making a total of 2,500,000 < acres on which 15,000 soldiers could be settled -freehold system. Very many returned The same report shows that for an expenditure of £875,000 on railways and roads that land could be made available for returned soldiers. Like those of the other States, the Queensland Government have not the money, and cannot now raise-what would be required, to build the railways necessary to open up this land. In these circumstances, would it not bd infinitely cheaper for the Commonwealth Government, instead of raising £40,000,000 for ithe purchase of agricultural land, on which it 'would be possible, after all, to settle only 40,000 returned soldiers, ito make with the State some such arrangement as I .have suggested ? For an expenditure of £855,000, or at the most £1,000,000, it would be able to obtain from -> the 1,250,000 acres of land on which at least 7,500 returned soldiers could be well placed, while an equal area in alternate blocks would be served by the same railways and the State Government could settle an equal number of men upon it . [97] vernment coming into this scheme? agreed to do so, because iti does not see its way clear to give the land and finance the scheme. I -would appeal to the Government fco see if an arrangement of the kind outlined by me could not be carried out. There will probably be a new State Administration within the nexb few months, and I feel sure that, it would consider such a scheme, even if the present Government is not prepared to do so. I have so far mentioned only land available in my own electorate and at the back of it, but I am sure there are many other electorates in Queensland where the same scheme could be followed. The State Government need money to construct railways that would make it possible for our returned soldiers to settle on whab is reallyfirst-classland, practically equal to anything we have in Victoria, and the adoption of. my suggestion wo_uld overcome a very serious financial difficulty. Unfortunately, the' present State Government is drawn from a party which, until some two and a half years ago, had the planks of its platform the substitution of the perpetual leasehold for the soldiers have gone on land prepared by the State Government, and handed over to them on the perpetual leasehold system; bub of that system they are loud in their condemnation. If the arrangement I have outlined were made, the Repatriation Commission could acquire fche land and could secure the freehold for repatriation purposes. Meanwhile, the adjacent blocks could be utilized for the settlement of ordinary farmers or returned soldiers, and even if the leasehold system were retained in respect of the latter, the freehold of the blocks handed over for repatriation purposes would not be withheld. Why should the Commonwealth contemplate the payment of £10, £20, or £30 per acre for land that is no better Queensland Government than would be open to us under the scheme I have outlined at a cost of about 15s. per acre? This land is not more than from 115 to 200 miles from a well-equipped oversea port, and it would be a great advantage to the men to be able to securefirst-classcountry",25,Groom

53,Mr Corser,"S o far it has notat this very low price. I understand that at the last Conference it was suggested that any difference between 3£ per cent, and the price actually paid for the money should be borne equally by the State and Commonwealth, so that if it were possible to obtain this cheap land an enormous saving would be effected. I hope that the Government) will cause inquiries to be* made as to whether the Queensland Government is prepared to make available large tracts of country that would settle, I am sure, fully 40,000 returned soldiers on the terms I have foreshadowed. If they were, it would obviate the necessity for raising money on loan for the purchase of land at a high price. My scheme should suit the State Government, inasmuch as it would furnish i i with money for the construction of the necessary railways, and since it has large areas untenanted, it should be very glad to get this area occupied. Erom a defence point of view it would also be well to give my scheme very careful consideration. The greatest menace to the Commonwealth to-day is the fact that we have in Queensland and Western Australia tens of millions of acres of firstwell as here. class agricultural land with hardly a soul upon it. How long we shall be allowed to hold it without putting it to any use is a question that may have to be settled by the British Empire and its Allies after the war. I think that any such scheme as this would be one of the greatest reasons we could assign when the Imperial Conference sits, that a large area of land was ahout to be utilized by white men, and that almost immediately. offered to every Australian the same right as it has offered to its own citiziens? a half years every man could go and select any piece of land open and get the fee simple of it when he had paid the purchase money and put in a residence of five years, but now he is not allowed to get the fee simple but only perpetual leasehold. Several men may take up blocks. One or two of the men may so improve their land that they will get a good return, but others may not do the same thing. vision of the rents under the perpetual lease system takes place the men who have devoted most energy and time to the work and expended the most money and energy may have their land appraised at a higher rent. Then arises a fear that they may not receive even-handed treatment in the future. Therefore men like to feel that tHey will be ahle to handle the fee simple of a block, instead of a perpetual lease. the Government which did that? new countries, will try experiments, and because gross mis-statements were made such as that the late Government was responsible for the high cost of living, it was turned out. But what do we find today? Instead of the high cost of living becoming reduced it has steadily advanced under the regime of the new Government. I feel that the men on the land will deal with the present Government in a way which, perhaps, they do not expect,, and therefore I expect that in May next we may return to our normal conditions. I hope that the electors will return a Liberal Government, which will steer a course between the two extremes, and see that justice and fair play are meted out to all. That is what we want in Queensland, as son) -Order! I am afraid that the honourable member is getting away from the question. sir, but I was drawn off the track by the honourable member for Brisbane. Although the soldiers may not approve of the class of Government which Queensland has at present-the y may think that they will not get a fair deal in the matter of repatriationI point out to them that in the near future there is likely to be a change which will enable the men to get such treatment as would be acceptable to them and the Repatriation Commissioners. A question has been raised as to whether a Board or Commission sitting at each State capital could exercise a proper control. If men are elected to the Boards who have ability, as well as a kindly feeling for the returned soldiers, they could carry out the business in such a way that it would be distinctly in the interests of the men.

The Boards could just as easily take the necessary steps to see that money had been expended in a fair and safe way. I sincerely hope that this Parliament will do something which will insure that a returned soldier who wishes to settle on the land in Queensland shall have the same facilities for acquiring a freehold as he could have had when he left these shores to fight abroad for Australia. ting land in Queensland are much greater than those offered in the other States at present. facilities are offered in Queensland, but settlers now cannot get a freehold. What they desire is a title. When I was a member of the Queensland Parliament a few years ago, legislation was passed by which men who settled on the land could obtain facilities which were not offered in any other State. Suppose, for instance, that a man selected a piece of land and had sufficient money to pay the first year's rent, which was one-fortieth of the whole. He could apply then to the Agricultural Bank for an advance of £200, to be expended by him in erecting a small dwelling and making other improvements in the shape of fencing and providing water. While he was expending this money, an inspector visited the farm, and the settler then received £1 for £1 up to the advance of £200, which amount, I believe, has since been increased to £500. The settler was also allowed a further sum of £800 on the basis of 15s. in the £1. Altogether, he can now get from £1,400 to £1,500 advanced in that way. The interest was fixed at 5 per cent, on a twenty years' term. The redemption money was payable only after the expiry of the first five years, and for that period the settler had to provide only the interest. These terms exist to-day. It has been held by members of the present Government that the facilities offered to persons to go and settle on the land are quite equal, if not superior to, those which are contemplated by the Eederal Government. tural Bank made any losses? ment of the Bill and the resignation -of fore he was in the position to go to the [97]-*' the late Government, about two and a half yeara ago, the Agricultural Bank advanced a very large sum of money, and there was a small credit balance at the end of the term. What the bank has done since, I cannot say. The land in Queensland is very good, the price is very low, and the facilities to enable settlers to get their produce to market are good on account of our having made so many narrow-gauge railways. We have 1,000 miles more of railroad than has any other State in the Commonwealth. We were able to provide this long mileage by the adoption of the narrow gauge. It answers admirably all the requirements of the settlers. If the Federal Government, through the Repatriation Commission, would get hold of some of the land to which I have referred in fee simple for the purposes of the returned soldiers, and arrange that the money paid for the land should be applied by the Stat© Government only in constructing railways and making roads to and beyond the land, the amount involved in securing land would be about £4,000,000, instead of £40,000,000, the cost set down by the Minister of Repatriation in his second reading speech. I hope that arrangements will be made so that when soldiers return to Australia their pay shall be continued until the Government, whose duty it is to fulfil the promises given to the men here, provide the necessary employment on their discharge from the Army. It is intended to send to America for experts in the manufacture of artificial limbs. These articles are made in Queensland. To give honourable memhers an idea of their excellent quality, I may mention that the manager of a large concern who had his leg badly broken, and who, after it had been cut three times, had to get it amputated to the thigh, got an"" artificial leg made in Brisbane. Some years ago he went to Denmark, and only recently he sent for another leg, because he said that he could not obtain in any part of the world a leg better than the one which was made for him in Brisbane years before. If the Repatriation Commission can obtain the services of a man who is capable of turnquality it should do so. The man I re,ferred to had plenty of means, and there-",27,Groom

No doubt in every walk of life there are to be found just as capable men in the other States, as may be found in Queensland. Perhaps in our State we may be a little more progressive in some things, because we have had to pioneer. In the early days our pioneers were enterprising men, so that since then many energetic persons have carved out a livelihood in the back blocks. Others have come and established new industries, and finding that it was essential to do something better than was done in the other States they have won the necessary notoriety to advance the sale of their' goods. I appeal to the Minister in charge of this Bill to make such representations that we in Queensland will not be forced to put returned soldiers on the land, as has been done at Beerburrum, Queensland, where there was no land available except that which could be taken up on perpetual lease. Returned soldiers went to that district, but they are not satisfied with the conditions on which they hold the land. This has had a' great effect on the success of recruiting, because these men contend that the promises given to them before they left these shores to fight overseas have not been fulfilled. They were promised that if they so wished they would he placed on the land, and it was generally understood that they, would be placed on the land on the same conditions as regards title as were in vogue at that time. son) -Order! The honorahle member's time has expired. -AV e are engaged on an important work. It seems almost superfluous to add that the work has been too long delayed. I take my share of the blame in common with other honourable members. I do not say that the blame attaches to the Government as it exists to-day, but I do say that had the Prime Minister after the election of 1914 taken notice of some of the warnings given by members of the House, he and his colleagues would have set to work' to prepare for the difficulty in which we now find ourselves. In my humble judgment we should have had our repatriation scheme in operation in some shape or form when the first returned soldier came back to Australia, so that instead of now being engaged on -what may be termed the initial effort at repatriation we should be considering' our amending legislation. Our experience with regard to war pensions has shown that improvements may be made every time the Ace comes before the House for review. Isi t not likely, therefore, that we shall find the same need for amending and improving our repatriation machinery, affecting as it will over 300,000 returned soldiers? . I hold in my hand a copy of the ANZAC Bulletin of 8th April, 1917, and issued just prior to the recent elections, and I desire to read from it an extract of the Prime Minister's manifesto to the soldiers at the Front, because I take it that our soldiers, when they come back, will bear in mind the promises made, not only by the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) but also by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor). In his manifesto the Prime Minister wrote as follows:Tlie nnancial obligations of land settlement and general repatriation proposals to which the Commonwealth is committed involve a considerable amount, estimated at £32,000,000, of which £22,000,000 will be required for land settlement and £10,000,000 for other forms of repatriation. The Government propose to raise £22,000,000 by loan, and the remaining £10,000,000 by a tax upon incomes, spread over a series of .years. They hope to insure that close and intimate interest in the repatriation of soldiers which is essential to the success of. the scheme by also appealing for voluntary contributions in money and kind. I do not know if there has been a misprint, but I think the latter amount is altogether too small and insignificant to provide for those who may desire to enter some other avocation than that of land settlement. Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition mentioned, I think, that repatriation would cost this country at least £100,000,000, and I am inclined to the",28,Groom

Although the Prime Minister said that from a Tariff point of view it would be difficult to deal with our industries in Australia, he solemnly promised that, as far as other means could be evolved, something would be done fbr the purpose of reviving languishing industries and of establishing new industries. It is true that a Bureau of Science has been created, and that it has undertaken certain inquiries. But that is altogether too slow a process. In this connection. I wish to quote the ! promise of the Prime Minister, embodied in his manifesto to the soldiers at the .Pront, and which is set out in the ANZAC Bulletin. He said. The aftermath of the war will create problems most complex and difficult. Amongst these is the repatriation of soldiers. The policy of the National Government is directed to the organization and development of all our resources to win the. war, to hold the fruits of victory, and to grapple with the problems that peace will bring in its train. That is the very full and ample promise which was made to the soldiers at the .Eront. Thousands of them have read it, and they are eagerly looking forward to the time when they will return to Australia, under the impression that they will be received in a handsome way, and that full employment will he provided for them. But what have we done in this, direction? Beyond a few little tiddlywinking things, what have we done to establish new industries in Australia ? In stead of establishing new industries, imports are flowing in freer than ever. Only yesterday honourable members received Mr Knibbs' monthly summary of Australian statistics, and from page 27 of that summary I gather that, for the nine months of the year 1916-17, our imports represented the value of £61,436,000. increased prices account for that. small proportion of the increase, but only a^ small proportion. Here we are in war time', with hardly any freight available. Those who wish to bring goods to Australia, whether from Britain or anywhere else, with the. exception, perhaps, of Japan, occupy the worse possible position in the matter of exporting goods from their own countries. nothing coming to Australia except what is absolutely indispensable. the honourable member, and I am sorry that the lessons taught by this war have not rid his mind of his antiquated Pree Trade ideas.

We all admit that this is the paramount duty of the Government at the present time. The repatriation qf our soldiers is a Commonwealth matter, and the Commonwealth can only control it adequately by pressing intq its service the whole of the forces and organisations, within our borders. In the fine speech he delivered in introducing this Rill in another place, Senator Millen covered most of the ground which this scheme pf repatriation opens up, and rendered it unnecessary for this Chamber to enter into a very long discussion upon th.js matter,' however important it may be. Buti t is nevertheless necessary ttiat honourable members should express their views upon the Bill, as well as upon some aspects of it , which may have a local bearing upon .their own constituencies. Whatever obligations may be, oast upon us consequent upon the war-, the money that is required must be raised from taxation and from bqrrowing if we are to build up an adequate fund for repatriation purposes. The Rill aims at accomplishing this. It has been urged thab the measure is merely a skeleton one, andfchafcit does not lay down ft fnll sche.me of organization that is necessary to. give effect to, this great project. I do not think that any Bill cquld embody in detail the whole method pf organization that is necessary tp. deal with all the various trades and processes of trade, with a view to insuring that our returned soldiers shall, as speedily as possible, be restored to such a state of efficiency and contentment as will enable them once more to resume tiheir places in the. civil life of the community. The, Bill, therefore, can only deal generally with the ppwerg which it is proposed tq vest, in the Central Commission, in order that, the whole of the details scheme may be worked out by that body with a view tq meeting the varying circumstances, as they arise It. should be quite possible for the Re? patriafci.on Commission, with the advice; of men experienced in business, crafts, arid industries, to evolve a scheme which will do ju.stice to our returned soldiers. The objectives of the Bill were fully explained by Ministers in .another place and in this .Hpusp. Ifc is proposed that men shall be trained in various industries and crafts, and that the partially incapacitated shall be trained in Government institutions ip such a way as to enable them to earn a comfortable living, as well as the sympathetic treatment of those permanently disabled. I was impressed by one statement made to the effect that in the training of returned soldiers advantage will be taken of existing establishments, and that it is nofc intended to set up separate establishments for their special training, or in the matter of land settlement to establish them in separate colonies. If any other oourse were followed it is possible that fche atmosphere created by the settlement or establishment of the soldiers in separate groups would militate against, their success. I believe that it is wise to make use of tlie experience and advice of those already engaged in industrial occupations and land settle-. "" ment. 'We have important establishments in all of 'the States, branches of which might be taken advantage of to secure the training of our soldiers. The question from the industrial stand-point naturally will be a matter for development. I hope that the Repatriation Commission will be constituted of men of the highest character and experience. In the appointment of the Commission we should take advantage of the services of men of large experience in industrial and commercial organizations. If it were proposed to appoint a Repatriation Commission of officials we. might have a body of men of little practical experience who could claim no considerable achievement in the industrial or commercial world. By taking advantage of the experience of captains of industry in different parts of the. Commonwealth we should be able to concentrate! the best ability of the community for the perfection of bhis important scheme. Later it may be found advisable to. place in control of the scheme, connected witjh the when it has been properly formulated, men who will be able to give the whole of their time, to the work of putting it into operation. One of the most difficult questions with which we have to deal is that of the land settlement of our returned soldiers. The",32,Groom
109,"Mr Sampsqn (Wimmera) [12.32],","Leader of the Opposition ( M i. Tudor) thminded us that it would not be reasonable to expect returned soldiers to make a success of land settlement if inordinately high prices were placed upon the lands allotted to them. That is a phase of the discussion which must be seriously considered iiot only by the State Boards, who will have much to do with this part of the business, but also by the Repatriation Commission. the soldiers should be placed on land upon which they can make a living, even though a high price may her asked for it , than that they should be settled upon worthless land which may be obtained very cheaply. the honourable member that much will depend on the quality of the land upon which the returned men are settled. Some consideration will have to be paid to their preferences for different forms of land settlement. We may hope that the Local Committees, who in this matter will have large powers in the' recommendation of suitable lands for settlement by soldiers who may have gone to the wat from their own districts, will be able at the"" same time to assist the general scheme by promoting local interest in the work and raising local funds to supplement the assistance provided by the Repatriation Commission. The Repatriation Commission will have control of the industrial side of this great scheme, and I . have no doubt will make use of existing establishments throughout the Commonwealth. An effort shoiild be made in connection with the Settlement of Our soldiers oii the' land to' provide land for them in the neighbourhood of or in the midst of rural settlements already successfully established. To give an illustration of the importance of the maiftef, I may mention that the"" State Governrrient have recently established a settlement that is rapidly becoming successful-'Merbeiii^ witliin a few milesfifthe successful settlement a't Mildura. The Uetv settlement was estabEshed on lands held by the Victorian Government, and the overwhelming majority of those who went to that settlement in the first place is likely to be permanently and successfully established there. There is between these two successful settlements an area of very valuable land which' has already been subdivided by the Victorian Government with a view to the settlement of returned soldiers. That sliould be an ideal position for the piifpose, because the returned men would have the benefit of the experience gained by the two successful settlements oh either side of them, and the people of the already established settlements might be confidently expected to take a lively interest in their welfare. Mr S'iNCLAiB -Was not Mildura a failure in the initial stages? It is better that dura had, by experience, to work out their own salvation. All sorts afid conditions of men went there at first, and they had to gain their experience. Settlement was due to Mr Chaffey, the (me man who held on. Chaffey, who may be regarded as one of the great men of the Commonwealth, was not deterred by th& difficulties, of the initial stages of ths settlement, and was successful, with those who remained with him, in developing at Mildura one of tlie finest examples of intense Culture to be found, not only in Australia, but in any patt of the world. supported by having its own packinghouses ? a complete co-operative system in connection With the grading and marketing of their fruit. I hope"" that it will be possible for the Repatriation Commission to maintain some supervision over land settlement by returned soldiers. The different State Governments must have control very iargely in the matter; hut I hope that it will be provided that tbe approval of the. Repatriation Commission will be required before moneys are advanced by the Commonwealth for this purpose. to that effect in the Bill. It is not possible by a statutory enactfn'e'nt to exercise control over State authorities, who' possess sovereign powers, but it should, I think', be possible for the Repatriat'ion Commission recommending the advance! of money for the purchase of land for the settlement of returned soldiers to exercise some supervision in respect of . the quality of the land secured for the purpose, and, generally, the progress of this form of repatriation.

We have no power to acquire land for the settlement of soldiers, although we may hold it for certain purposes, such as 'the building of post-offices. amendment of the Constitution. another matter. If we . are going to ask for power to deal with land settlement in that way, we shall have to go in for a complete scheme of Unification, such as was formulated by the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Bamford) some time ago. The lands would have to be handed over to the Commonwealth, and with them would go water supply, which is the life blood of our agriculture in the arid areas, and probably the means of transport, that is, the railways -_ _ that direction? lieve that certain constitutional amendments are necessary, I am not in favour of going anything like so far as the honourable member indicates. We ought to be ahle to work in harmony with the State Parliaments, which have Land and Agriculture Departments and control the means of transport They are the bodies best qualified to carry out land settlement, but I hope it will be possible, when the scheme gets into practical operation, for the Commonwealth to advance the money and have a general supervision over the land settlement to be carried out by the States. Tudor) referred to the high prices paid for land throughout Victoria. Too high a price has been paid in many cases under the Closer Settlement Act, and in a number of instances land not altogether suitable for the purpose has been bought, but mistakes are hound to be made even in private business in launching new projects, and, notwithstanding those drawbacks, the closer settlement scheme, as now operating in Australia, has given a tremendous impetus in the matter of placing people on the land and the increase of useful production from small holdings. There is a way by which we can avoid the payment of too high a price for land. Senator Millen, who will have the adThat ministration of the great scheme of repatriation, has made a considerable study of the question of land purchase, and we have in the Commonwealth all the material necessary for the purchase of land for closer settlement at prices which will not be beyond its value. The Land TaxDepartment has valuations and the necessary machinery. Every owner of land over £3,000 in unimproved value must send in his own valuation to the Land Tax Commissioner, and this is checked by valuations by the departmental officials. Zealand experience? passed in New Zealand provided that the State could purchase land at the owner's valuation plus 10 per cent. That was done in the case of a big property adjacent to Canterbury, upon which scores of families are now settled. Zealand that owners would put no valuation on the poor land. tions upon which the tax has to be paid, and in our Act there is a penal section that renders a man's land liable to forfeiture if he undervalues it to any considerable extent. If the State and Federal Department coalesces in this mattertaking the owners' valuation as well as that of the officials-w e shall have in this closer settlement business all the machinery and material necessary to insure that land is not purchased at too high a price. should devote some attention to other industries ? I thought, in dealing with this vast question of repatriation, it would be advisable for each honourable member to make some reference to particular classes of industry.

They have the practical experiMany of those who have ence, and will also be moved by practical sympathy in helping the settlers on their way towards success. There is another point -that occurs to I do not for a me. It is idle to suggest land settlement in those portions of the Commonwealth where the price of the land is so high as to necessitate a very large proportion of the money allotted to the returned soldiers being used in its purchase. That would be a severe handicap to the men to begin with; and, therefore, I hold that we must look to the outlying States; where suitable Crown lands are still available, as affording the best facilities in connection with the repatriation of our soldiers; Undoubtedly, there may be special reasons why settlement snould take place in some of the more closelysettled iand better-developed States; but if we can find approximately the same conditions elsewhere, with cheap land and a satisfactory climate, it is our duty to take advantage of the opportunity. I am not able to speak with authority as regards Queensland, but my own State of Western Australia., in my opinion, offers very exceptional advantages in connection with .a repatriation scheme of .the , -kind. Im the first instance, we have in -the south-western portion of the State an -area, roughly speaking, about the size of Viotaoria, where there is .a large -area of Crown lands still available for settlement. InI know that in .another place, a few years ago, a. very i g I l o r a n : '' a n ( l presumptuous individual informed Parliament and the country thab all the best land in Western. Australia had years ago been taken up. Speaking from my .own knowledge of the State, I .give 'that a very emphatic denial. Even after many .years of settlement, there is still .sufficient suitable land in Western Australia to settle all the repatriated .soldiers who wish to go on the land. While I do not suggest that all the men the opinion very strongly .that the Government could not improve ;on the conditions that -can .be afforded iby .that -State to returned soldiers. In Western Australia, 160 acres is given now, practically as a free g if t , to any one who cares to settle; and in the south-western portion oi the State the conditions are distinctly favorable for the taking up of small areas, and for the development of a policy of closer settlement. It has always been to .me a matter of great regret that land settlement throughout Australia has taken place on a diffused principle. One man takes up a block in one district, and another man takes up a block in another, with the result that scattered all over the country there are people living isolated' lives, unable to give their children schooling, unable to have easy access to a doctor, and, in short, practically unable to enjoy the advantages of civilization. If land and climate permit of closer settlement on areas of a reasonable size in a given district, that undoubtedly ought to be the policy, of the Government; and I have not the slightest doubt that such a policy could be carried out in Western Australia. In the southwestern portion of the State, of which I have spoken, there is one industry for which the country is admirably adapted; in fact, I have no knowledge, either from personal experience or from reading, of any other country in the world that offers such exceptional facilities for f r u it prospect of the destruction of those old growing. The soil and climate are admirably adapted for the purpose; there are no droughts, but a long, warm, genial summer, and the quality of the f r u it has . world. We have not yet developed this industry very far, but the few shipments of f r u it sent Home by way of experiment topped the market by several shillings per case. the Western Australian apple is the best sent from Australia. for the honourable member's opinion, which is correct, and which I appreciate, both for its correctness and for the reason of the source from which it comes. There are other small f a r m industries that have exceptional opportunity for development in Western Australia, such as the production of pork and butter. Thesei n dustries could very well be carried on alongside an orchard; in fact, "" small' in Great Britain, can w i th special advantage be utilized to give an immediate retur n while the f r u it trees are gradually reaching the productive stage. While that is the position with regard to those who settle on the land, I am afraid that an even more difficult problem awaits the Government, and those who will work under this B ill , in repatriating men who do not desire to go into the country. There are, undoubtedly, many avenues of employment in Australia thab will be utilized to the fullest extent. The> honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Penton) this afternoon found an opportunity, in reply to an interjection of mine, to suggest! that I am entirely hostile, by reason of certain fiscal proclivities, to the development of manufactures in Australia. Let me tell that honourable member and the House that I am as anxious as he is to develop these, only I think that my method is rather better than his. I dq not wish to begin at the wrong end. I wish to begin at that necessary condition without which no industries of a secondary character can exist; that is, the creation of a market. Having created the demand, secondary industries will come along in their natural course. The honourable member rejoiced at the and out-of-date Free Trade ideas with which he was good enough to credit me; but I remind him that the industrial and commercial situation created by the war already been proved in the markets of the will probably mean an end of high Protection in many countries which have hitherto adopted that fiscal policy.

While many soldiers who do not wish to go on the land will be taken back into their old employment, and many will be absorbed in work for which they have had some training, the untrained worker, the casual employee, the handy man, will give a good deal of trouble. I am afraid that it will be holders' industries,"" as they are called very difficult to get many of this class into civil occupations again. The majority of",37,Groom

The Government should have some mandatory power in order to deal with those employers who wiU not show a very marked preference for returned soldiers. It would do no harm; in fact, it would be a useful power to hold over the heads of those who might hesitate in doing their duty. It would certainly facilitate the work of the various organizations. man who would be callous enough not to employ a returned soldier could not: be compelled to keep one in work, even if he were compelled to take him on. methods of inducing such employers to adopt a more patriotic attitude. I it might be advisable to divide tiheir forces in regard to the two classes of returned soldiers-the men who wish to go on the land, and the men who will look for employment in our big towns. The body or bodies that w ill deal with the former class should consist of persons who are acquainted with rural settlement and all its conditions. A different class of superintendence will be necessary in dealing with the soldiers who do not wish to go upon the land. bhere should be organizations in each of the larger cities confining their attention exclusively to securing employment for the latter class. Special consideration should be given to the soldiers who return crippled and permanently broken in health. While all returned soldiers are entitled to our consideration, some have a stronger claim than others, and those who are deserving of our very best are the men who are maimed and disabled. They should not be left to their own resources at any period of their career unless they so wish it . We should make a special effort to train them in occupations at which their mutilations w ill allow them to work. Afterwards it should be our duty to provide them w it h employment, if they so wish it , success. for the rest of their lives. If the Governmenb do this, if they create organizations which w ill settle a l l those who wish to go upon the land under circumstances which w ill give them a chance to make a living for themselves and their children, if they open avenues of employment in our towns for the remainder, they will deserve the thanks of the community. In view of the importance of the work, I hope that every energy w ill be devoted to making a success of it . I am very pleased to know that the control of the schemewill be in the hands of Senator Millen. No better man could be found for the task. I hope the result will prove that this Parliament is not forgetful of the men who have faced death and mutilation so that we and our families may live here in Australia in the peace and happiness which we now enjoy. seems to me that too much pessimism is displayed in connection with the problem of repatriating our soldiers. A more hopeful tone should be taken. The men who have left our shores filled various, positions suggest to the Government that and occupations before they enlisted, and if there was room for them in Australia before the war broke out, surely there w ill be room for them when they return. They will come back with a broader view of life, and instead of their being a burden on the community, the useful experience that they have gained on 'the other side of the world will make them a better asset to the Commonwealth. They will not returnto be drones. Their manhood will be broadened. They will give a very good In my opinion, account of themselves. I do not see, therefore, that there is cause for any feeling of pessimism. I am rather surprised that the contentions of the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Rodgers) have not received more support from honourable members. The honourable member is deserving of great credit for having devoted much bime, thought, and consideration to the question of repatriation. He has been associated with a scheme which has done a great deal for returned soldiers, and his recommendations should receive more consideration when we are dealing with this subject.

Surely we can devote to it the time necessary to create the broad outlines of the scheme. It is quite right that the Commission should work out the details, but this Parliament should accept the responsibility for the broad outlines of the scheme, and set .them forth in the Act which the Commission will be called upon to administer. I would like to know what would happen when any recommendations forwarded by the Commission are not approved of by the Government. I cannot conceive of the Commissioners under such circumstances continuing to hold office. We must remember that the present Government will not always be in power, and that Senator Millen will not always be Chairman of the Commission, and,therefore, it seems to me that this Parliament should give fche Commissioners a lead, so thafc they may have a satisfactory basis on which to carry on their work I am pleased to know that the Commission will be a voluntary one. Experience has shown that better work is done by voluntary effort than by paid Government officials. We know this from the -splendid work that has been done by hospital committees, Red Cross societies, and committees controlling various patriotic funds. During the last two and a half years many men and women in Australia have devoted a great deal of time to patriotic work. Their successful efforts indicate that the voluntary system of Commissioners set out in the Bill is likely to meet with great success. I hope that in Committee the Government will be prepared to' include some reasonable amendments which will enable the Commissioners to carry out their functions without unnecessary delay. If they have to meet and develop a scheme of their own, time will be wasted', and the work of repatriation will not be expedited.' I quit © approve of the scheme 1 outlined by the Minister, but in order thafc it may be carried out in the quickest time possible its principles should be stated more clearly in the Bill. The first care will necessarily be for the afflicted and innary purposes of settlement land varies in capacitated. I feel certain, that the majority of the men will return full of Mr Mackay. health and strength, and 'will not require to be nursed through all their movements. Honorahle Many will come back with broadened ideas, and will be quite prepared to face tiheir own troubles. Of course, if any man needs assistance, he should be able to get it , but it is a mistake to think that it will be necessary to look after every soldier who returns. The question of land settlement, which is one of the features of the scheme, might fairly claim the careful attention of this House. It has been said that about 40,000 men are likely to go upon the land, but we have no very definite information in that respect to guide us. Having regard to the efforts all the States have made to get men to go upon the land, without verygreat success, iti is a mistake to assume that, simply because certain men have taken part in the war, they will suddenly develop a desire for the rural life. Probably a number of those who worked in offices and factories will wish to strike oufc on new lines, especially when they are promised the active assistance of the Government; but there will be many disappointments in this respect. Even if 40,000 soldiers do engage in land pursuits, the assistance rendered them should be on a generous scale. It has been said that £500 will not go far in giving a man a start on the land. In Queensland, many men who came from other States with barely enough money in their pocketsfcopay their expenses have taken up land, and by thrift and industry have made good. It does nofc take a great, amount of money to make a success on the land in Queensland. That State has 429,120,000 acres of Crown lands, of which 21,091,000 acres have been alienated, or are in process of alienation. A lot of the land is of inferior quality, bufc there is also a ?reat area of good land that might be utilized for the settlement of returned soldiers. Some of this land is distant from a railway, bub if a policy of railway construction and water conservation were adopted the great majority of returned soldiers who are desirous of taking up land could be settled ih Queensland. The Government should certainly offer every inducement, and should be careful that the men are not required to pay abnormal prices for the land. Por ordiprice from 2s. 6d. per acre "" for homestead areas to 25s. and 30s. per acre. It would be a mistake for the Government to buy high-priced land when so much Crown land is available in all the States. When the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Mathews) was speaking last night, an honourable member asked where the vacant lands in Victoria were. We are inviting settlers to come to Australia from overseas, and a statement in this Parliament that no land is available is a poor advertisement of our lai<d resources. In all the States there is plenty of leases. Crown land still unselected, and there is no need for the Government to buy land at high prices. There is no more certain way of courting disaster than by putting inexperienced men on expensive land. A man will stick to his holding if he sees any possible chance of winning through, and he will have that prospect if full use is made of the vacant Crown lands, and men are induced to go into industries that do not require a great deal of study. Both dairy farming and fruit-growing are simple industries to learn. In my opinion, £500 will be more than sufficient for the majority, of men who are likely to take up land. It is not to be supposed that we can place men on large areas to engage in wheat-growing and wool-raising. That, I take it is not the intention of the r Government The idea is to give men a start in a small way, so that they may have reasonable chances of success, and be able to build up an asset for themselves. When the Bill is in Committee, I hope the Government will give consideration to the matters that have been mentioned by honourable members, particularly by the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Rodgers), because I feel sure that the people .expect this Parliament to take, some responsibility for the scheme. An; honourable member on the opposite side stated that the Queensland scheme of repatriation was the mostsuccessful yet evolved. I have no wish to decry that scheme. A t Beerburrum, in my electorate, the Queensland Government established thirty farms, and planted 5 acres of pines on each, and soldiers' have been settled there. The men are quite satisfied with the land, and believe that they will mak*e a success of it . The only dissatisfaction I bave heard expressed is in regard to tbe title. A perpetual lease does not give the holder any hope for the future. A man has not that feeling of security which he would have if he possessed a little bit of parchment. I do not suppose the Commonwealth can do anything in regard to the Queensland title, but when they get the opportunity the duty will devolve upon the people of that State of returning a Government who will amend the land laws so that holders may be able to convert their leases into freehold. If only/for the sake of the returned men the Queensland Government should make some effort to give the settlers a title, which I believe they would prefer to their I hope the Government will throw all their enthusiasm into the matter of repatriation, and give the Commissioners that will be appointed every encouragement to administer the scheme thoroughly, and treat our soldiers as they deserve after their sacrifices and the valuable services they have rendered to Australia. [3.251 -The Government are to be congratulated on the measure they have submitted to Parliament. An objection has been made that the Bill is only a skeleton measure, and that there are not embodied in it principles that will be of any value for the object which the House and the country have in view. In my opinion, the very fact that the Bill is merely a framework constitutes its value and importance. ' Honourable members have had their attention directed to tbe matter of repatriation for the last two years, and naturally there is a great diversity of opinion. If we attempted to embody in any Bill all these differences of opinion, we should have a remarkable measure, fearfully and wonderfully made. The honourable member for Cook( Mr Catts) remarked on the similarity between this Bill and the Act passed lastl year, and he pointed out that very little progress has been made. Neither the Government nor honourable members have given enough credit for the work already done in connection with repatriation. The authorities who have been dealing with the question in the various States have done a great deal of good work. I know that to be so in South Australia, and I do not think that that State's experience is any exception to the rule. We talk a great deal about the necessity for putting the returned soldier upon the land, but if he does not desire to go there, is he to be forced to do so? That question is suggested by the, experience we had in South Australia. The men who were in charge of the work there were certainly men of ability; the idea that the",40,Groom

He will devote the whole of his tame and energy to the work, and there is every reason therefore to anticipate that the scheme will be placed upon a sound footing. In these circumstances it will not be open to the objection levelled at the scheme which ib is supplanting. do not know whether we shall hear any talk of a profligate waste of public money in creating this new portfolio, but those who are acquainted with recenb events in the Allied countries know full well 'that fche importance and urgency of the new work thrown upon Governments result of this war has made the creation of several new portfolios absolutely imperative. is to be presidedover by a Minister who will devote all his time and energy tb ifc is one of the best guarantees we can have for its success.

We hear a great deal of talk as ro closer settlement and intense culture for returned soldiers, but, so far, the experiments we have made with I intense culture in Australia have been only a qualified success. It is not likely to be a great success in Australia, where we still have enormous areas of virgin soil and no pressure of population. The experience of the world is that intense culture is resorted to only when the agricultural areas as. the have been entirely alienated. There can be no doubt that Australia is a wonderful country, and that we can do much that The fact that this Department cannot be done elsewhere. I heard an old man say recently that this is so marvellous a country that the man in the moon in southern skies stands on his head. Par be it from me to say that intense culture in Australia will not be successful; but I think we are disposed to attach too much importance to it in connection with this repatriation scheme.

Our soldiers, when they return, will desire to get as nearly as possible into the occupations which they followed before the war. We have to remember that a large number of them know nothing about farming or pastoral pursuits; and it would be madness to place such men indiscriminately on the land, and thus court inevitable failure. Even with the limited knowledge that I possess of country life, I know that experienced men find its pursuit a heart breaking occupation; and how much more so would it be in the case of inexperienced soldiers ? The mere placing of men on the land will nob solve the problem; they must have a reasonable chance of success, or we shall only create more difficulties for them and for the community generally. should be the aim of the Government, if men desire to go on the land, to find them holdings as nearly as possible in the districts from which they enlisted, so as to in sure them the assistance of sympathetic relations and friends in surroundings with which they are familiar. This would, I think, enable us to deal with some success with men who have a primary knowledge of farming. But we also have to deal with men who have no knowledge of the land, and have no desire for country pursuits; and they represent the most important However, the solution is even simpler than that in. the case of the country soldier. Ifc is to build up and establish industries in Australia, their question problems with which Australia fronted, comprehensively-that of how to defend and hold Under the scheme before us we have an opportunity to assist the returned and, at the same time, pave the way to a policy which will enable us to hold this country, if ever we should be called upon to do so. With that end in view, one of the most important undertakings we could start with would be the alteration of our railways"" to a uniform gauge. It is a work of national importance. Every one admits thab for the purposes of defence it is absolutely imperative that it should be taken in hand as early as possible. absorb thousands of our returned soldiers who are desirous of following that particular class of work, so long as they are Mr Mahony. fiij to undertake it , and at the same time it would be rendering a national service, because the safety of the nation demands that the work should be taken in hand. Another important work that the welfare of Australia demands is a system of water conservation and i r r i gation. If we are bo make agricultural pursuits really successful, if we are to go in for that intense culture to which the honourable member for Hindmarsh' ( Mr Archibald) has alluded, and if we are to make two blades of grass grow where one grew before, and at tbe same timo provide our returned soldiers with an opportunity to settle on the land with success, we should take in It hand this gigantic scheme. It would prove of lasting benefit to the community. When engaged 'in this way, while earning a living for themselves, our soldiers will be doing jusfc as big a national work for Australia as they performed on the fields of Flanders or on the heights of Gallipoli. One of our greatest needs to-day, and one that will be of pressing importance when the war is over, arises from the scarcity of shipping. It is unnecessary to dwell at any length upon the advantages to be gained by the establishment of the shipbuilding problem. industry in Australia for the purpose of building vessels to convey our produce to other countries and bringing their pro-' ducts here in return. We were told a little and thus absorb while ago that it could not be done, but labour. Interwoven with this the spirit that has actuated the men who is one of the most serious have fought the battles of Australia and is conthe Empire at the Front will also actuate and which must be tackled them and their fellow Australians in is the problem building up this industry here. ThouAustralia. sands of mechanics have enlisted and gone to the Front, and the shipbuilding in soldier, dustry will provide them with employment. A t the same time they will be rendering a service to 'Australia. We can also render a .service to the defence of Australia by a policy of fleet construction. Australia's first line of defence is on the water. Our returned soldiers could be engaged in no better work than in the building of warships No better scheme of repatriation could be adopted than that of giving our men work that will be of It would lasting benefit to the country. I hope that the Government, in' carrying out their scheme of repatriation, will give returned soldiers the opportunity of doing work that will kelp to build up this country and place its defence on a firm basis. We should eliminate altogether any tendency to regard the assistance to"" be given as in the nature of charity. Let us employ t'he men who come back fit to work on undertakings of a national character. back physically disabled; having given little short of life in the service of thejr country, we should not deal with in a charitable spirit. "" You have done your work for the community nobly, and you have earned from the nation as a right that which will enable you and your family to live in comfort and beyond the pale of want."" I hope that it will never be said or written of Australia that its Parliament lef t its heroes and the dependants of those heroes to the tender mercies of cold, callous, commercialism, which, I am sorry to say, is so rampant in our community to-day. I hope that ib w ill be written' that no veteran of the Australian Army ever knew the pangs of want upon his return to his home land. The most tragic page in the history of Great Britain is that which tells us that some of the men who won the greatest distinction on the field of babble fighting for their nation ended their days in the workhouse. I hope that the day will never dawn when the same can be said of Australia. Let' us go to work manfully to build up this country, and let us give our soldiers the opportunity to work in that manly fashion in which they performed their duties at the Front. not express very much enthusiasm over this B ill . It seems to repeat the errors of the last measure, of which it is almostl a replica. The faul t of the last B ill was due to the fact that Parliament gave no lead to those intrusted with the task of carrying out the work of repatriation. The present B ill certainly removes the control of the work from the Prime Minister to a new Minister for Repatriation, and constitutes Commissioners in place of the Trustees who have been carrying on the work for the last .twelve months, but otherwise it differs very little from the measure now on the statute-book. The objects of this B ill , as set out by Senator Milleni n his speech, were the objects sought to be achieved under tihe old scheme. Hindmarsh ( Mr Archibald) has spoken . of red-tape. I am afraid that red-tape : Repatriation BiU. 2663 will k ill this measure. No matber how careful the men occupying honorary positions in connection with this scheme may be, they will not be able to move without consulting the Minister for Repatriation. A t the present time red-tape leads to so many delays that the Trustees become Those who come weary awaiting a reply to any suggestion forwarded to the Central Administration. niuch. more complete. it is. A t any rate, there is no scheme set out in the B ill . There should be, for example, a definite proposal of land settlement in the measure, and each State should adopt a similar B ill . If each State pas3 a disbincb measure, there will be no likelihood of securing uniformity. On the contrary, there will probably be a lot of heart-burning. Soldiersi n one State will be placed on the land under much better conditions than those applying to men settling on the land in other States. If any such discrimination is shown, complaints must inevitably arise. I , can see nothing to prevent this Parliament from framing a B ill which will give us some control in this matter, and if any State would nob follow the lines we lay down, we could withhold the necessary funds. Of course, we could not undertake the whole responsibility of land settlement. The States have the machinery for that form of settlement, and that machinery should be utilized, but we could very well set out the maximum amount of money to be advanced, and the conditions as to the rate of interest and the period for which the money would be free of interest. Each State could then adopt similar legislation, and we should have uniformity throughout the Commonwealth. I expect within twelve months to see another Repatriation B ill before Parliament. Some of the brainiest men in Australia were connected with the old scheme as Trustees, and the absence from the A ct of any real guidance nearly broke their hearts. They could not move without consulting the Minister. The conditions will be the same if this B ill becomes law. Having indicated the general lines of policy, it would pay to employ the bejfc brains in Australia for the administration of the scheme.

158,Let Us Say To Them. Mr Poynton,"I cannot see thathelpless to do anything. I do notexpect so much land settlement on the, part of returned soldiers as some honorahle members believe. In Victoria the percentage of applicants for land from amongst the men who have returned is very small. of applicants for land in Queensland. too, the percentage is small. Some soldiers prefer to take the money allotted to them in the form of a house, or furniture, and others as capital with which to set themselves up in a small business. One of the most numerous applications is for financial assistance to start a greengrocery, or some other little business, in competition with other people. Already a number of these men have failed. In the existing Act there is no detailed scheme, nor is there any in this proposal. This Bill follows as nearly as possible the lines of the existwhich we have set them up. The scheme ing law, and I cannot see that it can be amended to give a scheme that will offer any likelihood of success. A lot of platitudes have been talked about what is to be done for the returned soldier, but the matter must be approached with common sense; we must have a practical scheme. Por two years we have been talking about what we will do, but no matured scheme has yet been evolved. It is a remarkable fact that practically the first payment to be made in connection with this scheme is the salary for a new Cabinet Minister. In that respect 1 do not think the project will start under the best auspices. I had hoped that Senator Millen would have brought before Parliament a concrete proposal setting out in the Bill itself the main principles to guide those who will have the responsibility of administering it. The trouble in each State has been that the existing law gives the Trustees no guidance. Even the central body of which I was a member had nothing to guide it , and naturally we hesitated about giving instructions to' others when we, in turn, had to await the dictum limitations will bo imposed by this Bill. strung by having to wait on the decisions of the Minister. Perhaps when a new portfolio has been created tlie Minister will have more time to attend to repatriation, but unless there is a great improvement on the conditions which obtain under the existing Act, the Government will soon be asking Parliament for a further amendment of the law. I quite agree with the remarks made by the honourable member for Wannon in regard to voluntary effort. By our apathy we have lost a grand opportunity of getting assistance in the financing of this scheme. The Minister hopes to get some funds for repatriation by voluntary contributions, but in that respect the Government have never yet adopted any definite line of policy. The proposal to have a "" Repatriation Day,"" like, the "" Soldiers' Day"" in South Australia, was deferred from time to time, and finally the idea of making any public collection was disapproved of. I cannot appreciate any scheme which proposes to borrow money for repatriation .purposes. If we borrow for this scheme, the very men whom we assist will be taxed to pay the interest on the money with will not Cost, anything like the estimated sum of £60,000,000. In all the estimates that have been made as to the cost, we have been groping in the dark. The second estimate made.by the State Governments in regard to land settlement was not more than half the first estimate, and I predict that even that estimate will be found to be considerably in excess of actual requirements. But whatever the Cost of repatriation may be, it will be a mistake to debit it to loan account. There is no sense in taxing our children arid our children's children, and the soldiers themselves, in order to finance a repatriation scheme. being waged for the advantage of pos1 terity ? terity with the cost of the war; but that expenditure is not on all fours with the cost of repatriating our soldiers. able member estimate that the total Cost will be ?

It is not fair to ask an employer to re-emlaunched. We seem, however, to have ploy a man -who is not as efficient as he was before he went away, unless the employer is to receive some assistance from the Repatriation Pund. What right have we to compel an employer to re-engage a man, and pay him a minimum wage, whether he is capable of doing his work or not? The money expended in helping such men, in training others, and in the housing of the widows will not be repovered .i I should like to sea the Commonsoldiers have been supplied with perhaps wealth buy or build houses for the widows, and not charge interest, or expect any repayment. In South Australia, houses are being obtained for returned soldiers with the assistance of the State Bank. The men are allowed the money for so many years free of interest, and then they repay it at a nominal rate per week. In some cases repayment will take fifty or sixty years. I do not believe in borrowing money for repatriation, and asking the soldiers as taxpayers to pay the interest bill as well as the ordinary interest that it will be but a minor one, owing on the money advanced to them, I can see nothing in this Bill to induce enthusiasm in any honourable member. It is merely a recasting of the original Act, which haa proved a failure, notwithstanding the good work done by voluntary workers. I am sorry that I have heard no commendation of the men who did that work. licly acknowledged it on several occasions. a very different outlook upon life. We patriation Trustees did an enormous amount of work without fee or reward. They were hampered because there was no scheme with which they might proceed. No scheme is provided for under this Bill, and I am afraid, therefore, that it is doomed to failure. It is our duty to give it a trial, but I think that, within the next twelve months, we shall have an amending Bill before us. am disposed to he pessimistic in regard to the success qf this measure, and I believe there is some ground for pessimism. So far, we have had rather too much talk and too little work in connection with repatriatfiink that 10 per cent, will be ready to tion. We have had many heated discussions on the subject, but we have not yet started on the road to repatriation. I am satisfied that every honourable member is most earnest , in the desire that a successful repatriation scheme should be clouded the issue with talk, and to have blinded ourselves to the fact that returned soldiers are waiting for us to do something for them. Quite a number of men have returned, and we have not yet attempted to deal with them. Here and there, through the instrumentality of philanthropic institutions, amelioration committees, and local associations, returned a motor car, a horse and dray, or sufficient money to enable them to purchase a small business. Such efforts, however, cannot he classed as repatriation. We cannot hope in that way to efficiently reinstate these men, or to restore them-as I trust we shall do-to an even better status than they held when they left our shores. Land settlement ought to be the greatest factor in repatriation. I fear, however, chiefly to the lack of the facilities offering in the different States. It is estimated' that 16 per cent, of our returned soldiers will avail themselves of opportunities to go upon the land. While that percentage might have thought of going on the land had it been available to them before they enlisted, I think, as has been pointed out by almost every honourable member, that they will return with changed ideas, and must be careful that, because a man does not avail himself of this opportunity to go upon the land immediately upon his return, he is not denied an opportunity to do so later on. It may be two, three, four, or even five, years after their return that many will be disposed to go in for land settlement; and we should provide that, even after that lapse of time, they shall be able to do so. It will take some years for many of them to return to the harness they were wearing when they left. While it is true that 16 per cent, of those who have .gone to the Front stated before leaving that, on their return, they would like to go upon the land, I do not do so.

I began in this wayThe following general principles should, as far as practicable, be observed by those charged with the administration of this Act,, as guides in the distribution of the funds placed at their disposal. I had not got very far then;' but one characteristic in the Australian? which stands out, in my estimation, is one I have mentioned more than once, namely, individuality. I went onEvery effort should be made to safeguard the individuality and spirit of initiative of the rewidened or amplified, or for some more turned soldier for whom provision is to be made, and to prevent the impression that such provision is being made in a spirit of charity. That principle, no doubt, w ill be observed without being set out in the measure; but it would have given the measure a Httle more substantiality in the eyes of those whose imagination does not carry them as far as the stage at which ib reaches the Commissioners. My next point wasCare_ should he exercised in each case to ascertain the former calling of the soldier whose case is being considered, in order that his pre-war experience and training may be utilized in making provision for him. I do not desire to take a biased view of the B ill , in which we are all interested, and which we are all anxious to make as perfect as possible; but I do think it would have been better if the Minister, in the light of the experience he has already had of repatriation work, could have evolved a number of general principles of the sort which, while not binding on. the. Commissioners, would have served as guides to them. in the nature of a series of instructions, .rather than principles to be embodied in the Bill? have agreed on a number of broad principles of the sort, and embodied them in the B ill , they would have been a very useful series of guides to the Commissioners. But I do not attach much importance to this. tion of suggestions. if the Government are careful to appoint a class of men who really have business knowledge and the philanthropic spirit, and who are willing to give a great deal of their time to the careful and detailed consideration of the work-wh o can put themselves in touch with the great variety of human nature to be found amongst our returned, soldiers-the y themselves will embody some principles, pf the sort in their adjudication. of the whole thing. we shall have this advantage, that from time to time-and I do not dread this, as one. or two others seem to do-w e shall be asked to amend this B ill ; because, as the Commissioners, gain knowledge, they will ask for their powers to be either definite directions to enable them to carry on their work. I look on. the B ill merely as a tentative measure-as a first attempt. It confers powers which, no doubt, w ill be carried out in the right spirit. F a r from deprecating the connection of a Minister with the Commission, I think it is an admirable step, because it w ill keep h i m in close touch with the Commission, and w i th Parliament, and maintain an intimate relationship between the two. Some objection was .taken by the honourable, member for Grey( Mr Poynton) to the idea of using loan money for this work ; but, if one applies one's mind to the matter, it can, I think, be seen very clearly that it would he unreasonable to ask one generation to pay for the salvation of the Empirei n which posterity is as much interested as are the people today. This great war, which I take to be for the preservation of the Empire, is not for us, but also for all who come after us. My honourable friends opposite seem, though I am not sure, to take some exception to what I say. They have children, or will haye children, whom they w ill leave behind, and who w ill benefit by this war. We are preserving this Empire not for ourselves; and the proposition is a very simple one. There are hundreds of generations to come after us, and the Empire will have been preserved for our descendants-me n and women-for generations to comeW h y should the money necessary for repatriation not be provided by loan, and the inI believe that terest paid from generation to generation, with a generous sinking f u n d , by means of which the indebtedness will gradually disappear ?

During the Trench wars, in the time of Pitt, the debt which England built up seemed one that would overwhelm her; but, hit by hit, it was brought down, until the whole was, I think, only £600,000,000. £250,000,000 to the debt;"" but that also was being gradually wiped off, until we were faced with the present conflict. That is the principle on which all judicious men would conduct a great enterprise of the sort before us. If we attempted to levy on the people of this generation for the debt which is being incurred in the Mother Country to-day, and incurred here on account of the war, and for the compensation of our men for the obligations under which they have placed us, we should simply swamp the present generation. There can he no doubt at all, therefore, in my opinion, about the propriety of paying for work of this sort out of loan money, provided a generous sinking fund is created, so as to cause the indebtedness to disappear as history moves on. I am very glad, as I have said, that the Minister is to be associated with the Commission, because he will bring us into continuous touch with them and their work. He will learn from time to time where the present provision is found wanting, and give us an opportunity, by this intimate communication, of amending the measure, so as to meet the altered conditions which will develop with experience. The States have been interfering in this matter in a manner which I think is to be deprecated. When we federated, we intended that Defence, in all its forms and incidence, should he handed over to the Commonwealth. It is very unfortunate that the States-whether for limelight, or with a desire to dispose of their surplus funds-should begin to take this matter in hand in conflict with the Commonwealth. It is very difficult to administer a work of this kind when there are two powers, each acting independently of the other, attempting to discharge the same obligations. I can quite understand that, where land is required for some of these soldiers, as we have very little of our own-in fact none, except the Northern Territory and the Federal Capital area-it would be very difficult for us to act without the States. But the Federal Government should exercise extraordinary care in seeing to the Afr. Bruce Smith. character of the land which is being provided by the States. I do not know at present-and whether there is an opportunity for my knowing I cannot saywhat authority has been given by the Commonwealth to the States to obtain land The Boer War added for this purpose; nor do I know what sort of criticism is being exercised in regard to the land which is being bought by the States on the understanding that it is .provided for by the Commonwealth. paying for any land, but merely making advances for improvements and so forth. member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Austin Chapman) the other night, expressing himself in a rather warm manner, alleged that in his constituency some land was being disposed of to the State for settling returned soldiers-lan d of a character which, he said, would not "" feed a bandicoot."" done in South Australia, where land, all under water, is being sold for this purpose at £19 per acre. member only gives another instance. most valuable. say is that if the Commonwealth is satisfied that the best recompense to some of our soldiers will take the form of putting them on the land, I hope the Repatriation Minister will see that the land is of a quality to do more than ""feed a bandicoot."" It would be a thousand pities to allow our soldiers to go on land unfitted for settlement, and there waste a year or two or more of their lives trying to get ""blood out of a stone.""

A t all events, if it has no guarantee, it should have one. The Commonwealth should not leave the matter to chance.

They are not likely to provide any sort of land. that the States will be ahle to give to the matter the concentrated attention that the Commonwealth can give to it.

I do not think that the States are giving, or will devote, the same attention to bhe difficulties of the situation as we are giving to them. that the matter should he left in their hands, because they can give it more attention. may give more land; but success in the settlement of soldiers on the land will not be brought about hy making big areas of land available, unless those areas are made up of good land.

Like other honourable members, I have complete confidence in Senator Millen as the man to administer thi"" scheme; but I believe that the Government will have to come back to the House from time to time, as difficulties develop, and as requirements reveal themselves, in order to have this Bill amended. We know the maxim, "" Who gives quickly gives twice."" We should act rapidly, I have heard honourable members say that we are too sluggish in the matter; that very little is being done; and that we are not acting as promptly OT as generously as we should in this direction. I recognise that there are great difficulties in the way. Some men will ask for help who do not deserve it. Otfhers will be asking for help of a kind which, if given, would be of no assistance to them. All these and uncountable other difficulties will have to be met; and from time to time the changes brought about will need to be represented in some amending Bill. I snould like to know what is to be done in the case of a man who has a pension which, capitalized, would probably represent a pTetty large sum. give help in addition'to the pension, it will be given under this scheme. that this difficulty has been fully considered. I presume that it will be open to the Commissioner to say to a man with a pension of £100 a year, which, capitalized at 5 per cent., means £2,000, "" Y o u have already £2 a week; we cannot, in addition, advance money to enable you to go inbo business and earn anobher £100 a year."" The point -will have to he considered hy those who will be honoured by being appointed as Commissioners. These gentlemen will have to advise fhe Minister of the difficulties as they fencounter them, and, instead of deprecating any amending Bill, I shall welcome it , if it provides improved methods ot administration, based upon the experience, gained during the first year of the working of the scheme. Some honourable members say that there are no principles in the Bill. I hope they will ' endeavour, as I have done, to arrive at some principles which may serve as guides to the Commissioners. If they bring them before honourable memhers when the Bill is in Committee, we may he ahle to build up a little code of directions which will give the measure more substantiality, and make it serve as a better guide to the Commissioners.

If I could have got my particular ideas embodied in it, the opposite policy would commend itself to me, but honourable members might consider my ideas far too Utopian. Some may think that there should be greater co-operative action between the States and the Commonwealth, and we can plainly conceive, on the other hand, that the duty of repatriating our soldiers must be a divided one. The States will compete among themselves for settlers, and as they are in control of land on the land. It is true that many of the settlement, they can give to the matter a far greater amount of consideration. than the Commonwealth can give to it . This question of land settlement will apply only to the smaller section of our returned soldiers, and if land settlement were our only concern, the matter could very well have been left to the States with financial assistance from the Commonwealth; but the more numerous body of soldiers will be those who will not settle upon the land, and on this account the Commonwealth have taken the right step in accepting the full responsibility for repatriation work. There seems tb be a consensus of opinion, not only ""in this Parliament, but' also throughout the Commonwealth, that no better man could be chosen to administer this measure than Senator Millen. His high capacity fits him for the position, and he will not disappoint the expectations of his friends; but his position will be rendered very difficult because Parliament has not seen fit to accept the responsibility of laying down principles for the guidance of those who are administering the scheme. He will be dependent on a central Commission, with Boards in each State, and various Local Committees throughout the Commonwealth. not very much in favour of unpaid boards or Commissions. Some one has said that legal advice given for nothing is worth just what it costs; and in many instances, but not in all, voluntary services may be placed in the same category. The success or otherwise of this scheme will depend entirely upon the amount of sustained interest that can be maintained among the Local Committees. the pivot upon which it will revolve. I was recently engaged, with two other ilfr. Lynch. gentlemen, touring New South Wales on a Royal Commission which inquired into the best) means of increasing the number and prosperity of persons engaged in rural industries. We inquired specially into share farming, and the various conditions under which the primary producers were working; and we took care to ascertain in each district what facilities were available for the settlement of returned soldiers, and what inducements could be offered to the Commonwealth to settle soldiers in any particuhir locality.. To the credit of the various districts, it must be said that the people were unanimous in their desire' to assist in settling soldiers estimates that we received from practical men as to the area which could be considered a living area varied considerably, and that the value placed upon the land which could be made available for the purpose would far exceed the means of any Government who wished to purchase it in connection with any scheme for the settlement of returned soldiers. From £1.500. to £10,000 was mentioned as the value of a living area, and we received suggestions' from some of the ablest and best men in 'their district-me n who had won bheir spurs by a long life of struggle, which resulted in' ultimate success-as to what part the Local Committees should play in the placing of soldiers upon the land. To give the House an' idea of the average suggestions, I will read one proposal. Honourable members will see that in it the principle of local help is strongly emphasized. I sincerely trust thati the powers conferred upon properly organized Local Committeeswill not be limited altogether to the administration of moneys collected in their own district, but that some recognition of the value of their work will be shown by enabling them, under proper safeguards, to I am also assist in the expenditure of a sum of money advanced for the purpose of repatriating soldiers in their midst. The following suggestion came from the Winthe-war League at Burrowa, and was adopted unanimously by the recruiting committee in the sub-district of Werriwa, with head-quarters at Goulburn: After some discussion it was decided that They will be in such districts as Burrowa, the part of the scheme whichmost interests us is the settlement of men on the land, as there are very few openings for other kinds of employment. We should also see that the land is suitable for such settlement, and that the area is a living area. The best way to bring this about would be by the appointment of district committees or boards, and for this purpose the league suggests that the State be divided into districts. That each district be asked to elect a board of, say, five practical men in whom certain funds be vested, and whose duty it would be to inquire into each application for assistance and report as to the suitability of the applicant for the work he wishes to take up. If the applicant could show that he had a reasonable chance of succeeding, lands could be allotted to him at the value fixed by the Crown. The board could then purchase stock as required, and loan them to the settlers on the share system-that is, the settler would return to the district board half the increase of such stock, or half the produce, in such case the land was cropped, or half the value of such increase or produce if he wished to purchase same each year until he has paid back to the district board in such way an amount equal to the value advanced to him by the board, plus 4 i per cent, interest. Then the stock and plant would become the property of the settler, and by that time have proved his fitness as a settler, and be given his clearance by such board. This league thinks that large land-holders could, and would, materially assist this scheme if allowed to do so by placing at the disposal of the district board the surplus stock which they have to dispose of each year, and for which they could afford to take bills for a term of years. These could be loaned to the settlers, and would save a large expenditure of public inoney. These district boards were a great success in South Africa, and were instrumental in settling a large number of men on the landwho would otherwise have drifted into the towns, or out of the country. The expense of these boards to the Crown would not be very great. Many practical men would give their time free to such a work, and the only expense would be that' incurred for clerical work and out-ofpocket expenses, as in the case of shire councillors, stock board directors, or aldermen. These men who acted as members of the boards would be of great value to the settlers by being ab'le to advise them in re tbe working of their holdings, because they would possess an intimate knowledge of the district and conditions the settlers had to live under, what stock would be suitable, and what crops could be grown. If inexperienced men applied to the board, they could be placed with experienced farmers in the district in which they wished to settle for practical training and experience, that will fit them for the. work which they wish to take up. This league would earnestly commend these suggestions to the Minister in charge of the repatriation scheme for his careful consideration. I have quoted thab suggestion in order to show the spirit that animates the people in bhe farming districts of New South Wales, and their anxiety to assist in the [98] great work, of repatriation. I feel confident that if the Local Committees are not given more power their enthusiasm will cool somewhat, as the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Rodgers) predicted, and any such effect would certainly be detrimental to the object we"" have in view, namely, to do our best, consonant with the means of the country, not only for the brave men who have fought for us, but also for their dependants. We also desire to make this country self-sustaining and worthy of the sacrifices our soldiers have made. Ifc is clear thafc the vast majority of the men must be settled in employment which the Commonwealth can largely control. It is true that a vast number of the men will go back to their previous employment, but it is the absolute duty of fche Commonwealth and the States to develop new industries, manufacturing and primary, so that we may be able to find profitable employment; in Which we can give to the returned soldiers a preference that will not only mean a special advantage to them, but Will also give to the community that increase of wealth and progress which is essential if we are to keep our obligations to the soldiers and their dependants It is of no use our promising, like a man intoxicated, wondrous things when our capacity for performance is, after all, very limited. We musb devise methods by which new production' can be brought about, and the preference of which i speak can be given without any wrong being perpetrated on any other class of producer. On the contrary, an impetus of this kind to the development of industries in this new Commonwealth will be beneficial to all. ' I am a great believer in the principle of self-help; I think it is of pre-eminent importance. Whatever our fiscal beliefs may be, we were elected to this Parliament to do the very best possible thing for the country in the most distressing circumstances which have ever confronted it. We have to sink our individual beliefs, even if they are the growth of a lifetime, if ib can be shown that in doing so we ca^i advance the idea which all of us have at heart, however much we may differ in other matters. Stated in the plainest language, even if we have to patch our old clothes and wear them, we must do that to maintain our independence and the progress of the country. If we cannot honour our obligation to the soldiers, their dependants, and the people of Australia, and at the same time indulge in luxuries, entertainments, and pleasures, especially if those luxuries are imported, we must cut them off at the tap. I realize that is a most difficult thing to do. tion regarding the merits of Free Trade and Protection. Doubtless, as a convinced Protectionist all my life, I regard Protection as the right policy. But I do say that Australia, having practically a monopoly of one of the great raw materials essential to the industries of all countries, namely, wool, is in a particularly strong position. In a large measure, we can pay our foreign indebtedness by the export of wool, the production of which, having regard to our almost untouched, because unimproved, hinterland, is possible ' of immeasurable expansion. With wool and minerals^ and other wealth-producing factors, we have something which the world cannot refuse, even if we decline to take in large measure the goods we have been in the habits of buying. We shall be compelled by our own necessities to do much that is disagreeable to many, but surely the essence of this contract which we all have been so glibly talking about from one end of Australia to the other is self-sacrifice, and surely we added to the population on the land in will not ask that that self-sacrifice shall be all on one side. Land settlement is appropriately being kept to the. forefront of the repatriation scheme, because .the State Governments and the people alike are fully convinced that we must have more settlers, and perhaps an opportunity of securing a great accession to the ranks of settlers will be offered by the return of our soldiers. In all humility, I claim to have some little knowledge of the question of land settlement. I commenced on the land about twenty-eight years ago without any money, and perhaps more by good luck than good management, I have succeeded to some extent. I had to battle during some years against the rudest and roughest conditions that settlers have to face. I know that,much depends upon a man's adaptability for work on the land; but I assure the House that, on the average, the Australian laws relating to land settlement have been a failure. Many years ago, Sir William Lyne, speaking in the New South Wales Mr Lynch. Parliament, pointed to the fact that, although up to date, 230,000 selections had been made infchatState, ostensibly for the purpose of promoting permanent settlement, only 28,000 of the original holders remained upon their blocks. A t one time, dummying might be said to rank as a nationalindustry in New South Wales. I shall not enter' upon any disquisiI know that this opens up a big and disputable subject. I have my own ideas concerning it, but I am afraid that this House will consider them Utopian rather than practical, although I hold them with all the fervour of my heing. The fact that although we have a mere handful of population on our 3,000,000 square miles of territory, the State and the Common-. wealth Governments are compelled to adopt a re-purchase system to provide for the settlement of returned soldiers, and have been compelled to do so for many years, to provide for the few men who are ready and willing to face the difficulties which confront the man upon the land, is one of tlie most serious indictments that could he levelled at our land systems. The Age, in its issue of the Sth August last, stated that under the operation of Closer Settlement ActsI am speaking now not of the conditional purchase system, but of the closeT settlement laws of this State-onl y 4,300 settlers had heen Victoria during the last twenty years. For many years I was a member of a Land Board, assisting, as an ordinary layman, in the land administration of New South Wales, so that I know what the closer settlement system of that State -whethe r it be that provided for by the original Closer Settlement Act, the .amending Acts, or the Settlement Promotion Acts-amount s to. On those Boards we used every means at our disposal to see that no unworthy or incapable man. was admitted to the ballots for closer settlement holdings, but the figures in regard to the progress of closer settlement in New South Wales are hy no means encouraging. I have not been in touch with them quite recently, but I believe that over 60 per cent, of the men so placed on the land in New South Wales would be "" on the rocks"" if the law were enforced against them. And this notwithstanding that much of the land purchased for closer settlement purposes is of good quality, and that the majority of those chosen by the Board were good men. Isi t reasonable to suppose that a larger proportion of returned soldiers would succeed than has been the case in respect of the share farmers and othersinured to the hardships of land settlement, and with none of the nerve-destroying experiences of war-wh o have availed themselves of the closer settlement law? Whatever may be the generosity of the Commonwealth or the States, we cannot go beyond our means. This land will have to be paid for by the production of the soldier-settler, or the liability must be met by the Commonwealth and the States. The money must be found in one way or the other, and I therefore think that the Minister controlling the scheme is wise in not attaching too much importance to the proposal to settle a large numher of our returned soldiers on the land to engage in wheat or mixed farming under present conditions. I say from experience that if the proper class of men can be obtained, and the right conditions developed, the industry is one in which men will make progress. I understand, however, that the Minister is inclined to favour small subdivisions for the raising of pigs ""and poultry, and for the planting of orchards. Various opinions have been expressed during this debate as to the probable results of intense culture in Australia. I am satisfied that it will pay, but to insure success it requires something which is not a characteristic of most young Australians-it requires a constant, persevering effort and a readiness to accept sometimes, in respect of protracted periods, little or no return. Sunday and Monday work, perhaps not very laborious, but continuous, and it also requires those settled habits and that persevering industry which are rather a characteristic of the people of older countries, and are displayed even by the people who to-day are our bitterest. enemies. The problem of permanent land settlement in Australia, which is, as yet, unsolved, is the problem that confronts us if we are going to induce our returned soldiers to go on the land. to go on the land. land, then our obligations to those who do not cannot be maintained. New production will have to be stimulated, and new development will have to take place, to [98]2 enable us to meet our obligations. We cannot for ever meet them by means of IOU's. fact that, according to the honourable member, 60 per cent, of our farmers who have gone in for closer settlement find it impossible .to carry on. these views with the object' of urging caution on the part of the Government. The Commonwealth and the States should be slow to commit themselves to the purchase of large estates, involving an expenditure of millions, until we see how far it is possible to evolve and elaborate a better system. Our attempts at' permanent settlement have been almost a complete failure. In support of that statement, I propose to quote a few figures. The Royal Commission to which I have already referred found, in the course of its inquiry, that 81,531,984 >», acres of land in New South Wales had been alienated, and that over 77,000,000 acres were held under long leases. In other words, nearly 160,000,000 acres out of a total of, roughly speaking, 200,000,000 acres in New South Wales would not be available for the purposes of this scheme except by re-purchase or resumption. Doubtless, the portion remaining unalienated is, with the excep1 tion of a few milhon acres, unfit for the purposes of a repatriation scheme. These figures show clearly that we have failed to bring about permanent settlement. Even those who went on good land had to put in a long and protracted struggle, in many cases, until railways were built in It. means their vicinity, markets developed, and better systems of production, especially in regard to the cultivation of wheat, introduced. In the case of those who have made good, the tendency is to retire to the towns, or to the sea-board cities. Very few of the young people remain on the land. Because' of the higher standards and classes of education given to them, the sons and daughters have not the "" old man's"" capacity, or taste or desire, for the struggle oh the land. Wherei t is undertaken, where you find the "" old man "" doing what we speak of as the right thing-lettin g the son have his holding at one-half of its value-w e find them taking one-half of the capital employed in the production from the land, and building terraces in the cities.

Even in connection with those whom we speak of as the ordinary Working farmers -the men who have progressed and have got beyond the working stage-the tendency is to no longer make use of their ability and capacity. Long before their working life is spent, or their energy exhausted, they relax their efforts. A small section become too well off to work, even in this hour of the nation's trial. In this great work of repatriation, the spirit of sacrifice-the spirit we are asking the people to become imbued with in order that we may maintain our part in this war-wil l have to permeate every section of the community The people w ill have to give up the. idea that it is possible to go on financing this country by means .of borrowed money-that we can go on meeting our huge obligations in that way, and that property values will remain. We have,' in short, to take off our coats and get to work. I made a few suggestions in this House some time ago as to what we should do. I said that if we were to do our duty, it would be necessary for us to institute what I termed a system of conscription of wealth and energy; that we should compel every man possessing wealth or salaries above £500, and not exceeding £2,000, to pay \ \ per cent, or 2 per cent, for a number of years, in equal yearly instalments, into a repatriation fund, or what I described as a war wealth fund I suggested that of all wealth over £2,000, including mortgages, at least 10 per cent, should be conscripted; and that land should be actually taken over as required, the owners to hold it at a nominal rental until it was required. There was no need, I pointed out, for there in the ""sweet _bye and bye."" any liquidation. The interest could be But I shall not deal with that particular paid until the money required could be aspect of the subject.

As would be possible for a commission, a land-owner, I held that it would be composed of hard-headed business men, better to sacrifice some few hundred acres of wide pastoral and agricultural exof my land in that way, if it was capable perience, to control the expenditure of of supporting a returned soldier, than it £500,000 or £1,000,000-it has become would be to have huge taxations in the the fashion to speak glibly of millionsway of income tax, and especially land on the improvement of pastoral and agritaxes-which would destroy half, if not cultural properties, on which selected more, of my property value-heaped upon lads, of ages ranging from seventeen to me. This could be done without paralyzMr Lynch. ing any industry, and would bring a fresh producer, or perhaps several new producers, on to my holding. the holding ? details. I invite the honourable member to read in Hansard the speech which I made in this House on 14th December, 1916. That system would mean a greater return -to even the biggest capitalist, whose capital was legitimately employed in this country whilst it would help the legitiL mate worker who does not want to shirk his obligations either in the workshop or anywhere else. I believe the majority of our people in every walk of life are de1 sirous of doing their duty. They have now the opportunity. On another occasion I dealt with particular principles, which I believe would mean the cure of the land evil if applied, not only in the Commonwealth, but all over the world, and suggested that the Commonwealth Government should institute a land system that would help us to solve, not only the Northern Territory problem, but assist us in some measure in dealing with the Federal Territory problem. We have in the Federal Territory nearly 900,000 acres, but, in respect of it, there is a very lax system of administration. Hadi t been properly administered, the Federal Capital Territory would have been almost self-supporting to-day. If one of those hard-headed Scotchmen to be found out West were placed in charge, and given full and plenary powers, he would make the Federal Capital pay without interfering in ' the slightest degree with thebeautiful marble castles and artificial lakes, to cost a million or more, that are to be established",60,Groom

Now, while the public spirit of the people is animated, and the desire for self-sacrifice has been kindled in the minds of most, the initial steps should be taken to do those things which it is essential to do if the country is to develop and our control of it is to continue. I do not wish to say a word against water conservation, because the conservation of water and i r r i gation are essential, but if we expend countless millions on huge schemes, in addition to our present monetary obligations, we shall create a debt which this country cannot survive. It is to fly in the solface of Providence to adopt huge experimental schemes for the stimulation of proof years, half their wages duction by irrigation when there are aluntil they could be ready wide areas on which millions Thus could make a living with the assistwhich-would ance of the ordinary rainfall. Until the I know a gennatural opportunities have been exhausted, and we have a population of teeming millions, huge schemes of water conservation should be dealt with as sparingly as possible. To pin our faith to we are not doing what we them as children give credence to fairy scientific production tales may insure much loss to bhis count r y . I put before the Government of New South Wales, in my addendum to the report to which I have referred, the principles on which I considered that progress t should be made towards the permanent settlement of that State, and those principles apply to all the States. WhatI .said was by way of preliminary to clear away the obstacles raised by the maintenance of false premises. When that is done, we can apply truer and higher ideas which it may be considered too Utopian to voice just yet. In conclusion, I say that, although we have this obligation to repatriate our soldiers, and although the Goverument are confronted with the necessity of carrying out, in collaboration with the British Government, huge schemes for the control of wheat, wool, metals, and other commodities, stagnation should not be brought about, and' we should be careful to see thab financial progress is made, that the prospector wishing to seek a new mining show is enabled to do so. Essential as these large schemes are, they must be subservient to the .one great idea All Commonwealth Governof progress. Away and above everything else, we must realize that, unless we can establish in our people the spirit of cooperation, friendship, self-sacrifice, and mutual dependence, we shall lose the driving power that will enable us to attain the great aims in view. No section of the community should claim the right to dominate or hold in subjection any other. We must t r y by true co-operative effort to do our duty to returned soldiers and their dependants and to the country, which is worthy of every sacrifice. A broad outlook will not rest upon a blemish here and there, but w ill have faith and confidence in the future.

So successful have been the operations of the Bank that unti l a few years ago it had sustained no loss through failurefcomake repayments; but recently there have been losses because of the exceedingly bad years that have been experienced in the western State, when special assistance hadfcohe given. If we are to undertake the work of preparing men to go on the land, money will havefcobe provided to assist in what may be termed the incubatory period, and other things with which I shall deal later will cost us a great deal of money. Some may hold that the necessary funds should be provided from revenue. I hold that a certain amount of revenue should be allocated for the purpose, but we can only do that when we know what the scheme will cost. It would be stupid on the part of any Treasurer to come forward at this stage with a financial proposal for repatriation purposes. I do not think thafc the Ministeri n charge of the work has fche remotest idea , of what the scheme will cost. We must always bear in mind that there will be a big financial exhaustion after the war because of the enormous sums of money which will be needed for rebuilding the areas of the Old World that have been devastated by the war. This will create a very difficult time uv regard to finance in Australia, just at the time when we may expect to have from 200,000 to 250,000 men returning to our shores.

I appreciate the efforts of Senator Millen. I had the pleasure of listening to his speech on this B ill , and there is not the slightestdoubt that he has gone most exhaustively into the whole Question, and that he is keenly desirous of building up a scheme which will not only reflect credit on himself and the Government, but will be of great value to the soldiers. help coming to the conclusion thati there is an element of hypocrisy amongst many men who are in responsible positions.

I have noticed the same sort of thing in connection with the Railway Departments of the States, and it seems hypocritical of Governments to employ eligibles when they are asking other men to go to the war This repatriation scheme is one of great complexity and magnitude, and I confess that I like the proposal of the Minister in regard to the method of I have always expressed the belief that, whilst retaining this scheme, we should destroy ( patronage public will have the same chance of getting Mr Gregory. justice as the son of any member of Parliament, and 1 believe that the system o i control outlined by the Minister, whilst retaining Ministerial control, will m in i mize the opportunities for political patronage.

We have no knowledge yet of what the Government proposals are. State Boards will be the Local Committees, and I would be prepared .to go further than the Minister has proposed in regard to that matter. from the Front he should be able to meet the Local Committee in his own township, and those gentlemen would take a far greater interest in his welfare than would a Committee in a town 40 or 50 miles distant. should be elaborated so that the Local Committees may be more numerous than the Minister at present contemplates. Mention has been made of the liability of the employer who has promised that work will be given to an employee on his return from the war. If a man returns partly incapacitated, how can we ask any employer to engage him at full wages? By putting that obligation on the employer, we should be subjecting him to a special tax. He might be keenly desirous of re-employing the man, but the condition of the latter might be such that .he would not be able to earn one-half or one-third of what he was previously worth to his employer. If a returned soldier is so handicapped, the loss should be borne by the Commonwealth until we are able to build him up and to fit him to do his work with all his former ability. In the main, the response of employers has been magnificent. In some instances, they have paid thousands of pounds by way of Directly under the insurance premiums on the lives of men who have gone to the Front. In almost every State the response from them has been very fine. There may be a few unsatisfactory cases, but I feel that, speaking generally, very few would refuse to honour"" their obligations, and we should not be unfair to employers as a class. While the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Rodgers) was out of the chamEvery State has its Lands Deber, I pointed out that my objection to his scheme was that it was based oh voluntary effort, whereas I consider that every person should be compelled to pay accordWhile the ing to his means. I have known men worth tens of thousands of pounds to absolutely refuse to contribute to Red Cross funds, whilst others have always been willing to clo so.

No matter what the Government may do, we shall find that in dozens of our small comUnder the munities assistance in various forms will be given to any man returning from the Front.

As I pointed out at the outset of my speech, we made certain promises during Therefore the scheme the last election campaign, and we have in this Bill a promissory note ready for our signatures. There is very little in it except a proposal to appoint a Commission, coupled with the fact that we know the method by which the Minister is going to administer the scheme. I approve of that method, but should have liked to see in the Bill something solid, so that we might be able to say that we had helped to create a scheme which we felt sure would be of advantage to those who have made such great sacrifices for us.

One of the features to which I object is the divided responsibility which will be created under it. First of all, we are to have a Repatriation Commission, and the Minister for the time being, whoever he may be, is to be chairman of that Commission. Then we are to have State Repatriation Boards and Local Committees. In the actual working of the scheme, the majority of the applicants for assistance will probably come, first of all, under the notice of the Local Committees. Those Committees will have to work under prescribed regulations; and it is questionable, having regard to the wording of the Bill, whether the State Repatriation Board will not also have to work under prescribed conditions issued by the Minister. The result will be that when returned soldiers present themselves, the Local Committees will have, of necessity, to submit their cases to one of the superior bodies before they can be finally decided. I fear very' much that many returned soldiers will thus become greatly discouraged before their applications are attended to, and their needs supplied. That is the position to-day. ""We have a Repatriation Board in existence; and I received to-day a letter from a returned soldier who is one of four brothers who went to the Front, one of whom so distinguished himself as to receive the honourable distinction of the Victoria Cross. This returned soldier has set his mind upon the acquisition of a certain piece of land. He went to ithe proper authorities to have his desire satisfied, but he writes to meIt is just a month since I lodged my applito any one. How can we hold an unpaid cation for the Clayton farm, and so far the Land Board have maintained an unbroken silence. I am getting impatient. Have called in once, but can get no satisfaction. Crown land ? land that he desires to purchase. We have a divided authority at present, and we cannot say Who is responsible for the condition of things that is aggravating this particular soldier. His case is only typical of hundreds of others. During the dinner adjournment, I met a returned soldier whom I knew very well, and when I inquired whether he had succeeded in doing anything with the Repatriation Board, he said, "" Don't talk Repatriation Boards to^me. I went to them until I was tired, and found that I had to do something without any assistance from them. In the future they can go hang, so far as I am concerned."" That is a deplorable condition of things. We should inaugurate under this Bill a system that will enable us to locate the responsibility for any failure. If a responsible officer treats with disrespect any soldier who has fought for us, that oflicer should at once be brought to hook. Instead of providing for a number of Commissioners, the Government would have been better advised in proposing a system somewhat similar to that adopted for the management and control of our State Railways. There they have a Commissioner who is responsible to the Government for the due fulfilment of all the duties and obligations of his position. Under the Commission for which this Bill provides, I do not think we shall be able io make any one responsible to us. Let us adopt the State railways system and have one Commissioner. Let him be, if necessary, a highly-paid man, and I certainly think that we cannot pay boo well the man who will have to handle the huge sums of money that will be controlled by the Commission. In connection with our postal system, we have a central executive, under whom are our Deputy Postmasters-General, who are responsible for the due fulfilment of all the obligations of the Postal Department in their individual States. We can thus attach responsibility for any serious lapse in bhe services of the Department in any of the. States. But, under the system of voluntary service for which this Bill provides, I do not think we shall be able to attach responsibility Commission responsible for anything?

One of the difficulties in connection with farming-it applies even to those who are well established-is that it is almost impossible to procure effective labour. I feel satisfied that there is a reasonable hope for the success of the scheme if the men are settled in communities. I cannot conceive of anything more discouraging to the men, or more unsatisfactory to the Commonwealth, than that those who go on the land should waste their energies, and expend the small sum of money which will be advanced to them, becoming at the end ruined men. We must, by every means at our command, seek to prevent that from happening. There are many other things which I should like to say,, but the Minister has already received so much instruction from honourable members, that perhaps he will be unable to give due consideration to further representations. has been a discursive debate this afterrioon on the subject of repatriation. Judging from the speeches that I have heard, no one seems to know where he is going, or what he is going to do. Some honourable members are skating on .very thin ice in the promises that they are making. The last speaker ( Mr Palmer) and the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) spoke of the machinery of the Bill. The honourable member for Parkes( Mr Bruce Smith) says that the scheme of repatriation cannot be defined, and that the cost cannot be estimated. There is no scheme formulated in the measure. The honourable member for Cook( Mr J. H .

Soldiers, when they have lost their physical fitness, and are suffering from shell shock, ought not to be sent out to the Never-never. People talk ahout doing everything possible for the brave fellows who have fought and bled for us, and yet there is a suggestion to send them to the edge of the unknown land. During the discussion to-day, I interjected that some of the land bought in South Australia was inundated during the last flood, and an honourable member replied that some of the best land in the country was periodically inundated. That, I admit; but that is not so in regard to the land which is called the Pinery, and which has been purchased by the South Australian Government on behalf of soldiers from the Pront. ' The evidence given in tbe inquiry to which I have referred would be interesting reading for honourable members; but Heaven knows what the South Australian Government purchased the land for if it was not for their own personal aggrandisement. As a matter of fact, the State Government purchased no fewer than three sites for a Mental Defectives' Home, and one of these is bigger than the city of Adelaide itself. Those who carried out_that transaction are all lily-white conscience, win-the-war patriots; and after all their talk about the soldiers, who are preserving their lily-white freedom, this is what we find. seeing that the inquiry is not finished. that the Government bought three sites for a Mental Defectives' Home. Mr Owen Smith, when giving evidence at the inquiry, was asked what he said when he saw this land, and he replied, "" It was, ."" I forget his phrase, but I know he stigmatized the fact that he was asked to purchase three sites. However, let me get back to the question before us of repatriation. The Government valuator, MrH . M . Addison, was called in for his valuation, and the following was published in the Daily Herald of 17th September as the opinion of that gentleman : The land is unsuitable for dairying, pig raising, or poultry raising. About one-third of it is subject to inundation of tidal waters, and about one-twelfth of it to inundation by flood waters. The remainder of the land is undulating, hungry sand, ready to drift badly when disturbed. I am reliably informed that no man has yet been able to profitably use the land. If the honourable member for Grey( Mr Poynton) is right as to the price being £21 per acre, it was paid for land that no man has hitherto been able to hang on to. That is the method of repatriation as disclosed by this transaction. If those who speak so highly of our soldiers are honest, it is up to them to see that land for the purpose of repatriation -is compulsorily purchased adjacent, not only to the cities, but to the railway lines that have been built to open up the country. No one can say that there is not ample land to be obtained on which amateurs could make a fairly decent start, and which would repatriate the whole of our soldiers. I know that when travelling from Launceston to Hobart' I saw .large tracts of land held by certain persons but not used, and the same may be observed in every State in the Commonwealth. It is our duty to see that this land is secured and our returned soldiers placed upon it. No soldier should be in want so long as he lives on this earth. And this reminds me that the other night we on this side were challenged about our liberality in the way of repatriation. AllI can say is that we must not be challenged too much, or we will show how far we are prepared to go.

When the war broke out, and we were suffering so much from drought and unemployment that it was^necessary to feed people at the Trades Hall, Adelaide, a meeting was held in order to obtain suggestions as to what could be done to absorb the unemployed. I made had all to do with the land. AndI remind honourable members that from Port Victor up to Clare there is a lovely belt of fertile hills. Travelling on one ocour soldiers, but I am afraid that nothing casion in a fruit district I met a grower, who had visited Tasmania, and, in conversation, he assured me that the area I have mentioned is the best apple country in the world. At the time of the drought we had a Labour Government in South Australia, or what was known as a Labour Government until they were found out, and when suggestions were asked for, I put forward one which was considered rather revolutionary. We must he revolutionary if we seek to bring about successful reforms, A great quantity of the hill country back from Adelaide is virgin ground, and my suggestion was that the Government should forcibly resume all that was not being put to use, and employ men in clearing it and fencing it, and in building. cottages upon it. My idea was that those who chose to take up the blocks could do so, for I knew that the drought could not last for very many years, and that if we could have that land developed in this way, it would he rendered productive within two or three years, while in the meantime we would he absorbing the unemployed, and staving off bad times. But my suggestion was considered to be too much of a wild-cat proposal for the Government to entertain, and that land still remains untouched. Had the scheme that I outlined heen carried out, the present prosperity of the environs of Adelaide would be wonderful. It will he to our undying shame if we ask any soldier to go upon land upon' which another man cannot exist. should make good land available for him, particularly in .the neighbourhood of cities or close to railways, and if it is necessary, we should have no qualms in asking a strong, healthy man to move off the place that he now occupies, and go further hack, in order to make it available for one who is inore deserving of it. But I am hoping against hope, because there is nothing tangible in the Bill before us; there is no assurance in it that the returned soldier will get that to which > he is said to. be so justly entitled. We have had promises, but I do not place too much reliance on promises that are jgiven when there is a wave of patriotism The suggestions pulsating through the country, and making people's brains work at twice their normal capacity. The Bill should state what ought to be done for in a tangible shape will come out of this measure until the soldiers themselves have an opportunity of voting upon the composition of the next Pederal Parliament. I am most anxious to know what is to be done for those who do not wish to go on the land-shearers , miners, men employed in tramway services, in factories, and in offilces. The majority of our returned _ soldiers will represent that' class which is Med every week by the landlord. What is the suggestion of the Government in regard to these men to whom the landlord is the biggest bugbear? The right honorahle member for Parramatta ( Mr Joseph Cook) has not forgotten his former days, when he was a land reformer and a* revolutionist, and when he had the fire of battle that is not to be seen in his eye to-day. He knows the troubles of. the man on a daily or weekly wage, out of whose wages the capitalist can cut huge junks each week, and on whom the landlord calls every Monday, and cannot be denied. What are we going to 'do in regard to those men, in order to release . them from that thraldom -under which' they have lived for so many years-the thraldom of rent laws, and -the necessity to scratch along on a minimum wage? I 'hope that the Government will be generous in their treatment of them. Honourable members opposite have spoken of their desire to do a fair thing to the soldiers. The honourable member for Cook We( Mr J. H . Catts) has given notice of his intention to move some amendments, and I challenge honourable members to vote against them. If they do, I shall direct the attention of the returned soldiers to their speeches as justification for their attitude. At any rate, I think that I can claim the support of the honourable member for Grey( Mr P.oynton) when we 'come to those amendments. His speech indicated it. 'Cottages must he built, 'but not in slum areas. We should copy the Gadbury 'and Rountree ideas. We must remember that the soldiers are human beings, who will like a little .pleasure in life, and will wish to rear their children as robust men and women. It is said that posterity will hear the burden of the cost. It has always had to carry it. I like the way in which some honourable members talk ahout the cost being merely £60,000,000. "" What is a million or two?"" they say. Iti is something that must be paid back. I like the glib way in which they talk about posterity getting the advantage of all this expenditure. We were told that the whole of the public debt of Australia was to be paid by posterity; but I challenge any honourable member on the other side of the House to tell me how much posterity has paid done for us? much for us, but we are the posterity of those who commenced borrowing in Australia. The first loans fell due years ago, but what have we done to repay them ? Read the Budget speech of the heaven-born Treasurer of South Australia. I do not mean to be disrespectful when I speak of him.in this way, because he is one of the best financial men that South Australia has had; but every Treasurer, when he has been in office for a few years, seems to imagine that he is a heaven-born financier. felt his wings sprouting before some one chopped them off. The Treasurer of South Australia has told us of the 4J per cent, loans that are falling due, and' must he come a Bill of this kind, although it makes redeemed next year at 6 per cent. ing asset in the shape of railways for the turning, and that its appearance should greater portion of the loan money spent not have been deferred until a lot ofin South Australia. asset exists, but I do not believe in this gard to the war have been inaccurate, system of handing on a debt to posterity,. and we have had to learn as we went Nor does any honourable member believe along. I have no desire, to enter into they in it when he applies it to his own case. It is the desire of every one to leave something to his family when he dies. I have never known of a man who tried to get into as much debt as he could in order to leave it for his family to liquidate after his death. Yet in our public life that is what we are doing. We are calling the tune and not paying the piper. It is time we returned to honest methods of government!. The pocket patriots of Australia have increased their bank deposits by £49,000,000 It is no wonder they say. "" Nothing is too good for those brave fellows who have gone to the Front to fight for us."" And every time mother takes the kiddies to the pictures in the hope of seeing Dad in some of the battle scenes, the Government take a ^d. for every ticket she buys, but they will nob take the £49,000,000. When the soldierscome back, and find that whilst they have been heroes in fighting for their country the other fellow has been exploiting their dependanbs, bhere will be a change in themethod of finance, and we shall discontinue undertaking things the payment for which is left to the kiddies. It is immoral to suggest that in order to repatriate the soldiers we should borrow, arid has posterity put an interest burden on their children. In conclusion, I hope the Government will think, not only of the soldier going upon the land, but of the man who gaveup a good job, and is returning incapableof earning, more than half of what be earned, before he went to the war. It isfair to say that he shall never want owing to the incapacitation which has resulted' from doing his duty, and that anything he gave up in order to go to the Front shall be returned to him in full measureIf we do not do that, we shall not be acting honestly as a Parliament, and as-members we shall have'no right to occupy our positions unless we honour to the full The honourable member for Grey every promise made in regard to what thesoldier would get when he returns. a belated appearance.

294,Mr Leckie (Indi) [9.47],"I welgeneral principles of this measure, beyond expressing my acceptance of the sentiment expressed by every member who has spoken, that the men who went away are entitled to everything we can give them. They should receive, not only as good a position as that which they left, but, owing to their services and the fact that if they had remained they would probably have improved their positions, -we should endeavour to place them in better circumstances than they were in when they enlisted. The outstanding feature of the scheme appears to be the that lies between the Minister and the soldier administratively. This Parliament has accepted the responsibility of repatriating the soldier and replacing him in civil life, and its representative the Minister wil l be at the head of the organization for administering the scheme, but there is a very long cry from the M in ister to the soldier. When the soldier returns and desires help, whom shall he approach? Shall he go to the Minister or to one of the Committees? If he goes to the Minister, has the latter' to inquire through all tbe different bodies until he reaches the'Local Committees, or is the soldier to go direct to the Local Committees, who must refer back to the Minister through the various channels before a definite reply can be given? back tq the Minister at all. never see the Minister. ing accepted the whole responsibility and agreed to provide the money, we should have complete control of the administration. I have nothing to say against the proposed Ministerf o r Repatriation. I believe that Senator Millen is a very suitable man. But when the war is over, the Repatriation Department will be the big Department of the Federal Government, and probably it would be better if the Ministeri n charge were a member of this Chamber. Members of this House will come into more direct contact with the soldier than wil l members of another place, and, therefore, should be in closer touch with the Minister. think that the Commonwealth Parliament should be more directly connected w i th the Local Committees, and that a member of'this House should be chairman of each State Repatriation Board. fact, the Minister might simplify his scheme and obviate the appointment of one body by making the chairmen of the State Boards the central Commission. During the debate representation of the soldiers on these different bodies has .been advocated. Senator Millen, in his speech, gave a direct promise that on all these bodies the soldiers would be represented, and the Honorary Ministeri n charge of the B ill in this House explicitly stated that two soldiers would be appointed to each State Board. Therefore, we have a definite promise that the soldiers will have great distance representation, and I commend the Government for that decision. Honourable members opposite who were adversely criticising the Government for not giving the soldiers representation must have overlooked those promises. Mr J. H . CATTS -Surely as an old parliamentarian the honourable member knows that such promises do not last long. tarian it has been my experience that a direct promise in the speech of a Minister is kept, and as that promise is supported by the opinion of every honourable member in this House, as well as by the people outside, there seems to be no likelihood of its being broken. A scheme of repatriation must have several phases, but most honourable members have dealt principally with land settlement. If we were asked what is the may best avocation to which the returned soldiers could be put, every man would say T h is Parliament havthat we should add to the wealth of the country, and be acting in the interests of the men, if we settled them on the land. But anybody who has studied the psychology of the soldier knows that his work and experience unfit h im temperamentally for lif e on the land. Even those men who were on the land when they enlisted, haying enjoyed some of the privileges of civilization, having mixed w it h large bodies of men in camps, and tasted some of the pleasures of the larger world, as well as experiencing the excitement of the campaign, will be unfitted for a return to rural pursuits. I have had a lengthy experience in land matters, and I realize I also with regret that one feature which militates against men remaining on the land is the monotony incidental to waiting for results.

298,Mr Leckie,"As an old parliamengets a return. go against the grain of a soldier who has been receiving a daily wage. viction is that land settlement w ill play a very small part in repatriation. If ""we can"" encourage settlement on the land well and good, but we must not expect very big results in that direction. The Minister has estimated that at least £1,500 will be needed to settle a man on the land, and it seems to me that for the same expenditure four or five men could be settled industrially. ment will find it necessary to absorb 70 per cent, or 80 per cent, of the returned soldiers in secondary industries, and that they can turn their attention more profitably to that avenue of employment than in spending vast sums of money in trying to settle on the land men who are temperamentally unfitted for that occupation. I have been struck with the speeches of some honourable members, particularly those of Victorian members, who have decried the failure of closer settlement in their own State. for Melbourne Ports( Mr Mathews) said that there was a big area of Crown lands on which returned soldiers could be placed. Everybody knows that all the best land in Victoria is already alienated. There is left nothing but out-back blocks. I shall be no party to placing a returned soldier on such areas, where he will not have a fair chance of enjoying the decencies and comforts of civilization. Some honourable members seem to be impressed with the possibility of the Murray Waters scheme. I believe that a certain number of men may be placed on closer settlement blocks along that waterway, but the area of land that will be made available is not unlimited. During the debate on the Murray Waters scheme in the Victorian Parliament, the fact was elicited tliat the scheme, in addition to making safe the existing closer settlements which had been jeopardized by the droughts, would only provide for intense culture under irrigation an additional 200,000 acres in Victoria. ber considered the extent to which the scheme will benefit South Australia? proximately 1,000,000 acres of additional land. but honourable members will see that there is a limit to the possibilities of that And that waiting will scheme. Irrigation, like'everything else, must grow, and the irrigationist must My concreate a market for his goods. Already in Victoria the market for some products, which are the result' of irrigation, is overstocked, and people who planted some classes of f r u it trees a few years ago in the hope of getting big returns find that, even if the usual export were taking place, there would still be a big glut in the local market. Therefore, irrigation must proceed slowly, and we must create a market I believe the Governfor our products as we progress. In the fields of industrialism, however, there is big scope for useful repatriation work. The absorption of men into their original occupations is not sufficient. We should endeavour to give the men better jobs than they had when they lef t Australia, and if the same amount of money is spent in the industrial field as is proposed to be spent on land settlement, as good, if not better, results will accrue. Fori n stance, a large number of men went to the war from the Newcastle and Lithgow coalfields. Many of them are returning. The honourable member They are men trained to follow the occupation of coal miners, and we should not be content to simply replace them in the mines. I suggest to the Government the desirability of purchasing coal-bearing land, and subsidizing returned soldiers to develop new mines. I do not propose that the Government shall buy mines that are already established, but that they should acquire a coal-bearing area, provide the necessary equipment, and allow the soldiers to work it . If they make any profit above their wages, they should be entitled to keep it . When the Minister for Works and Railways was moving the second reading of the RailwaysB ill , I was impressed with his remarks regarding a big lake of salt deposits. There should be a good outlet for this commodity. The salt) has cost the Government nothing, and if the Government spend money in developing the deposits,, and handing them over to returned soldiers to work, a useful and profitable field of employment may be provided. As I have pointed out on a previous occasion in this House, I believe that, in It will make available apstead of spending very large sums in purchasing estates and in other directions, it would be, in the long run, a good thing I am aware of that, if the Government created monopolies in certain trades which should be entirely for the benefit of the returned soldiers,",76,Groom

Directly a soldier returns to Australia, he will make for his own home, or for his own district, where there will be people ready to welcome him with open arms. I do not hesitate to say that a soldier who returns to any part of our State will receive a welcome. If there is not a rest home in the district to which he goes, he will find there some one who will look after him and provide a home for him. Returning to the question of land pur* chases, I suggest that those having suitable land for sale should be invited to notify the Department as to the price they want for it. Many of our soldiers know the value of land, and will take good care to expose any unsuitable purchase made on behalf of the Commission. I was glad to hear the honourable member for Adelaide say that the soldiers would be repreployed, and the profits from which should sented on the Commission. They are already represented in this House. But for their votes, some of the best men in this Parliament would have lost their seats. One of the ablest statesmen in Australia, the Minister for Home and Territories ( Mr Glynn) was saved to this House hy the soldiers' votes. The honourable member for Moreton( Mr Sinclair), the honourable member for Herbert( MrI was sorry to hear the statement made Bamford), and several others, retained their seats by the votes of the soldiers at the Eront; and I am glad to know that they are doing the best for our boys.

Wherever our returned soldiers settle, there will be people to help them. Every man practically will say, "" Here is a returned soldier, and I am going to give him my help."" I disagree with those who think that we can settle returned soldiers on the land at comparatively little cost. It will take'from £1,000 to £2,000 to buy a block on which a man be comfortably settled, and when he has been settled, he will need to be supplied with suitable stock and implements purchased by men who understand his requirements. Then, again, those who do not wish to go on the land should be provided for, and I am sure they will be. Those who do not desire', to secure a block should be provided with funds for the purchase of a business, or portion of the money raised under this scheme should be devoted to the establishment of new factories, in which they can be embe distributed amongst them. Every district should have its particular class of manufacture, just as is the case in the United States of America. Those who do not wish to return to the calling they were following at the time of their enlistment should also be afforded opportunities for learning other trades. during this debate that employers are not doing their duty. I do not know of an instance where an employer has not done his very best for a returned soldier. Large firms and banking institutions are making up the difference between the wages formerly received by their employees who have volunteered and the pay they draw in the ranks. The money is being accumulated, and will be ready for them on their return. T e employers, 1 mortal men can do, and they would be unworthy of the name of men if they were nofc. Thousands The Government need to be very careful in their appointment of Local Committees, since grave duties will be imposed upon them. Any responsible person who consents to the purchase of unsuitable land under this scheme should be adjudged guilty of an indictable offence and severely punished. .1 recognise, of course, that there are many difficulties associated with the valuation of land. In South Australia, for instance, every block of land has to be separately valued. We have had to drain thousands of acres in my State, but I do not see why the fine fellows who return from the Pront should .be placed on land which has to be treated in that way. We should give them the best of our land, and I believe we shall do so. WhetherI am a member of a Local Committee or not"" I shall do my best for the returned soldiers; my services will always be at their disposal. I shall take care to inspect every block of land that it is proposed to purchase in my electorate, and where I believe a mistake is being made, I shall not hesitate to expose it in the House. There are many avenues of employment which should be open to our men; our railway and telephone services should provide employment for . quite a number. Some of the best men in the South Australian Railway Department volunteered, and when they return their former positions will be open to them. Any man who shuts the door in the face of a soldier will have a bad time, and rightly so, for he would be unworthy of respect. But for our men ab the Pront we should not be here in peace and comfort to-night. . Every mind is now turned towards securing the preservation of the Empire. nobly and well, and should it cost even £2,000 a mam to replace our soldiers in comfort, we should be glad to spend the money. If it had not been for our soldiers, we shmild have nothing' at all to give them. Sir Rupert Clarke said re; cently that if it had not: been for them we should have had to take to the hush, and we should have been as badly treated in the bush as our pooT Belgian friends. The Northern Territory has been spoken of. We must not run down the Northern Territory; it is a great country. When Australia wakes up, as she will when the boys come home with their knowledge enlarged, the railway will be made across the continenit, and the Territory will become one of 'the finest countries in the world. We shall have there one of the finest military stations on the face of the earth. Our soldiers will find it a good country in which to breed horses. I do not suppose that I shall live fco see that development, but it will come, nevertheless. Having this great country, we must hold it with our own people. If we cannot, we shall lose it, and shall deserve to do so, for not doing our duty. For years past we have not done our duty in this regard, but I believe that we shall do it now by helping our soldiers. When this Government promised to bring back the boys who had a been away at fche war for three years, I thought that every eligible man who was still here would say, "" Let me go in the place of one of them."" One of these days I hope to see a great rising of eligible men. They do not yet understand the position. I do not want a rising like that which occurred in Melbourne the other nighlt. The damage done then might serve to illustrate, in some degree, what could be done by an enemy man-of-war. No country is so exposed as is Australia. All our principal cities could he razed to the ground within a few minutes hy the bombardment of hostile battleships, if it were not for the protection of the British Navy.

This is the greatest producing country in the world. No other produces sueh wool, wheat, and oifcher products.

I have been pleased to listen to the debate, and compliment the Leader of the Opposition upon the temperate address wibh which he opened the criticism of the Bill. I am pleased, too, that his splendid example has, been fallowed hy memhers on both sides, and that the discussion has been free from party bias.

I propose to read some figures from the last annual report of a Victorian company which has taken an interest in the welfare of returned soldiers. Last night the honourable member for Melbourne Ports referred to the failure of Victorian schemes. The .fact that we have in existence in this State a company which is taking an active interest in settling the soldier on the land has 'been overlooked. Considering its limited capital, this company has made excellent progress. It has been in operation for four or five years only, and during that time it has purchased three estates, the total area of which is 20,700 acres, and tlie purfully considered the matter. As a result chase price, including cost of irrigation and drainage works, £135,200. The number of purchasers from the company has Mr Lister. Australian Soldiers' [REPRESENTATIVES.] Repatriation BiU. been 153. Althoughi t is said that failure is He said that Australian written largely on Victorian schemes of this nature, the number of those who have forfeited is only four, and the numher of sales by original to other purchasers eight. The number of settlers who, for various reasons, it is thought will not succeed, is twelve. Deducting the doubtful cases and forfeitures, sixteen in all, from the total number of purchasers, that is 153, it will be seen that land settlement schemes are not altogether a failure in Victoria. The gentlemen who control this company are prepared to obtain further assistance, to place more men on the land. This proposal should be very carefully considered by the Government. Personally I do not view with too much favour the dual control, under which the Commonwealth Government find £500 per man, or, approximately, £20,000,000, and hand the whole of the land responsibility over to the States. I should prefer to see the Commonwealth purchase the land for the settlement of our men, whom they desire to benefit under this scheme. There are many other matters to which I would like to refer, but I cannot enter like to touch on, namely, the establishment and encouragement of our secondary industries. In Australia we produce considerable quantities of wool, which, in the main, has to be sent to England, and returned to us in its manufactured form. In this connection, I think employment could be found for a considerable number of men. I have in my hand a proposal for the establishment of a textile institute in connection with the Technical College in Geelong. I cannot enter fully into the details, but I shall be pleased to hand the document to any honourable member who may desire to see it. At present, we have to import skilled workmen from the Old Country to take the management and control of our woollen factories. I believe that many of our returned soldiers could he trained if a proper scheme were formulated; and a number of managers of mills and others interested have met in conference and careof their investigations, I am in a position to state that for the sum of £9,500, plus £600 a year for salaries, provision could be made for the technical training of 50 returned soldiers. would provide for the whole of the machinery and other requirements; and it is allocated as follows:-Fo r woollens, £4,790; for worsteds, £2,180; sundries, £1,030; and motors, shafting, pulleys, &c, £1,500. These figures have been compiled by practical men, who. are deeply interested in the movement, and who are prepared, if the Government will take the initiative, to erect and supervise fchis kind ? the erection of the necessary factories, so that work may be commenced forthwith. There is one point that seems to have been overlooked by every speaker.' Much has been said about the repatriation of the returned soldiers, but I wish to put in proved capacity have willingly given their a plea for that noble band of women, the nursing sisters, who are equally deserving of consideration. So far as I can gather, no provision has been made for the future of these women when they return to our shores. such a way that we can devise means to assist not only the returned nurses, but also the returned sailors. to hear that, because I know of no more deserving class. The fathers, mothers, sweethearts, and wives of thousands of our soldiers to-day have every reason to be grateful for the work these women have done at the Front, and I should be lacking in a sense of appreciation were I to allow this opportunity to pass without expressing my personal obligation to them. home, and has had the attention of quite a number of these noble women, I recognise the value of the work they have done and are doing; and it is very gratifying to me that their future is to be provided for. Mention has been made of the composition of the Commission, and the Boards, and I submit that amongst the soldiers who have returned, and who will return, there are many competent to occupy positions on these bodies. By the very fact of their association with the men, these returned soldiers must have more sympathy for them; and I fail to see why they should not be given equal representation 'on the Commission and the Boards. Senator Millen, when introducing the measure in another place, remarked that our soldiers are not like the soldiers of The sum mentioned the olden times, but are also citizens. The soldiers will have to share the responsibility in the administration of the funds, and will, in proportion to their means, have to contribute; and, in my opinion, not only should they have equal representation, but they should be paid for their services. How many returned soldiers are tbere who could give the time required for the administration of a measure of work is all right for a little while, but we cannot expect it to continue for ever. We know of instances where business men of services in the carrying out of measures for the amelioration of the condition of the soldiers; but they cannot, and should not, be expected to continue those services for an indefinite time. Every man is worthy of his hire; and by providing for payment, we increase the chances of obtaining the best men, particularly so far as the soldiers' representatives are concerned. Generally, the soldier has not too much of this world's goods, and cannot afford to occupy positions without remuneration. . The honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Yates) referred to himself and others as preparedI forget his exact words-to assist financially any proposal that might come from the Government for the repatriation of the soldiers. I regard that as a challenge; and I propose to test the honourable member's loyalty and paAs one who has been invalided triotism, because, after all. patriotism does not consist in getting, but in giving.

MrM c WILLIAMS (Franklin) [10.45]. -The importance of this Bill thoroughly justifies any honourable member in rising, even at this late hour, to express his opinion upon it . It is by far the most important measure that has ever been in troduced into this Parliament. None of us yet comprehends its magnitude. Therefore, I regret thafc it comes before us in such an emaciated form. It is really little more than a skeleton. When we compare it with the existing A ct we see that almost all its provisions are those which are already contained in the measure that was passed last year. In view of the magnitude of the subject with which the B ill is dealing, the provision that is being made for the appointment of honorary officers to carry on the work of repatriation can result in nothing but absolute failure. The work of the Commonwealth Bank is not nearly so gigantic from a monetary aspect, as are the financial functions to be performed by the Commissioners and the various Boards and Committees provided for in this B ill . If we take the figures given by Senator Milleni n the admirable speech which lie. delivered in another place, we see that the measure prepares the way for the expenditure of at least £100,000,000. aggerate. my figures. Senator Millen has estimated that it will cost about £60,000,000 to place soldiers on the land, and as it is considered that we will have to make provision for settling about 40,000 out of a total of 240,000 on the land, ifc is an exceedingly mild estimate to say that another £40,000,000 will be required to make provision for the balance of the 200,000. To place a sum of that magnitude in fche hands of honorary Boards and Committees can result in nothing bu t failure. I thoroughly agree with the honourable member for Corio( Mr Lister) that if the work is to be done well it w ill call for the whole of the efforts of the very best men in Australia. I do not think that a greater mistake could be made than to place a Minister of the Crowni n charge of the work. ment such a difficult matter, seeing that it is in existence all over Australia at the present time? MrM c WILLIAMS If what one read in the newspapers this morning ?s to be accepted as a specimen of the method followed in settling soldiers on the land, it is time we revised our system. Ifc was painful to read that a shire councillor had proposed that the rates of returned soldiers should be remitted because they were not in a position to pay them, and that, speaking with a knowledge of the country, he had declared that it was impossible for these men to make a living on their holdings. MrM c WILLIAMS I do not know exactly, but it is somewhere in Victoria. One thing that is absolutely essential for the proper administration of a repatriation scheme is continuity of policy and methods. Had the scheme-which has been outlined been in existence eighteen months ago, we would' have had three different Ministers in charge of it within six months. Nothing is more calculated to bring chaos and failure upon a scheme of this kind than to have in sole charge of it a man who is subject to the vicissitudes of every general election. For the first three or four years whoever is controlling this great work will have to devote to it the whole of his time and the best that is in him if it is to be carried to a successful issue. member agree with the principle of having a Minister in charge of the work ? MrM c WILLIAMS No . The work of the War Council did not proceed so satisfactorily either to the Government or to the Council itself when a Minister was in charge as it has proceeded under the presidency of the gentleman who is in charge of recruiting. I do not say this with any desire to reflect upon the Minister. He performed his duties on that Council as well as any one else could have done, and he was as regardful of the opinions of the members of the Council as 'any one else could be, but an unfortunate position is created when Cabinet rejects",82,Groom

I am thoroughly in accord with the honourable member for Corio that at least two returned soldiers should be placed on every Committee. have gone to fight for the Empire are some of our best commercial men. They have been drawn from our banks and commercial institutions. It is a sine qua non that we should have on the various Boards men in close touch and in thorough sympathy with those for whom we are making provision. Committee the B ill will be amended in order to provide for this, as well as for every other, we with the scheme. Some honourable members say, "" Let us trust the Minister."" I trust the Minister, but how do we know who will be in charge of this work in six months' time, or in two years' time? I hope that the members of the various Committees will be appointed for a given term. It is not advisable to appoint men for an unspecified time, because if they are not paying atSenator Millen is Leader of the tention to their work the Minister is placed in a very invidious position by having to remove them, a task that he will be very loath to undertake.

If they fail to do good work they need not be re-appointed-if they have not previously been removed. The people -do not The pay of no soldier should cease until his pension is available. We One soldier dehave all had cases brought under our notice in which there has been an interregnum between the cessation of the soldier's pay and the payment of his pension. I should like to see a provision incorporated in this measure which will state that on the day on which a man's Por that pay ceases his pension shall commence. I do not intend to delay the House at, this late hour, b ut I urge on Ministers and the House generally the very serious need for having a permanent Commis-, sioner in charge of this work instead of a 1 Minister, and for appointing the very best men in each ^State to the StateA l l the work to be Boards. The pick of them could be centralized in Melbourne to form the Central The only alteration Commission. But they should not be honorary appointments. Some honourable members contend that equally good men can be got to do this work in an honorary capacity. That may be so whilst the first glamour is on the undertaking; but the magnitude of this scheme is so enormous that we cannot exAmong those who pect business men to give sufficient attention to it in the evenings, which will be the only time that they can make available for it . An enormous amount of work will be involved in dealing with the future of 240,000 men. About land settlement, I hope that in perhaps, more nonsense has been talked than about any other phase of the scheme. Those who have studied the history of principle that land settlement know that to place on the have enunciated in connection bush lands of Australia men who are not accustomed to farm work, and expect them to make a living, is to condemn them to failure and disaster. We would do better to deport them, and give them an opportunity of making a livin g in some other country. quality of the land they are given. MrM c WILLIAMS depends on that. A small block of good land is infinitely better than a large area of inferior land. In passing, I suggest to the Minister that it might be advisable to settle the soldiers in communities. That, however, is a detail into which we need not go now; ' but there are several large and important principles which ought not to be l e f t to regulation. I am afraid, if this work is left to honorary workers, to whom it will be merely a subsidiary employment for their time and industry, we shall have nothing but chaos and failure; and the repatriation of our soldiers is the last thing in connection with which Australia can afford to have failure. will receive very careful attention, and that what is now merely a skeleton may be moulded into a living form. # sidering this B ill , we must not forget that well, oiled. If we do that, I shall have we have the honour, of the people of Australia in our hands. It is their measure as much as ours, and in dealing with it at this time we are simply living up to one of our pledges. I am not one of those who think that this is the time to discuss in detail a Repatriation B ill . Those honourable members who have' stigmatized the measure as a mere skeleton, and regretted that it has not flesh upon its bones, have taken a wrong view. The time for us to legislate in regard to repatriation will be after the scheme has been working for some time, and we know what we are talking about. sent time, we are discussing things which are largely problematical. We are estimating the number of men who will go on the land without having any basis upon which to rest our calculations. The people of Australia have told us that the soldiers must be cared for, and we have before us the machinery by which that can be done. We have a provision for a Central Commission, State Boards, and Local Committees; and if we get the right men on those bodies, everything will be well. If we do not get the right men,, there will be chaos, I do not agree with the honourable member for Franklin( Mr. McWilliams) that there should nob be a Minister at the head of this scheme. The honourable member argued as though this were a party project, and the outgoing of one party would mean a change of policy. I do not take that view. A great deal would mean a change of Minister. policy, because this is tlie policy of the Australian people. Nor do the people wish us to place any limi t to the amount at the disposal of the Minister for placing soldiers on the land and re-establishing ' them in industries. They will be generous to a fault, and the Minister need never be perturbed as to the amount of money he will have at his disposal. He is to be given complete charge of repatriation, and upon him, the Commission, the State Boards, and the Local Committees, w ill depend the success of the scheme. A year, or two years, hence, when we have seen this scheme working, and tested it , I hope in Committee the B ill will be time enough for us to go into details, and, if necessary, legislate. For the present, let us provide the machinery proposed in this B ill , and let all of us no doubt as to what the outcome w ill be. Much of the discussion on this B i ll has hinged round the question' of land settlement, and many suggestions have been made, some based upon theory and others upon practical experience. In my opinion, the least difficult phase of repatriation will be the land settlement, because it has this advantage, bhat even if the soldier fails the land will remain as an asset. Therefore we may regard land settlement as likely to be the least expensive portion of the whole scheme. However, most of A t the preour energies will require to be devoted to men who will not be capable of being placed on the land-me n whose health has been undermined, and who will require to be helped, not only to make a living, but to regain their strength. The honourable member for Barrier( Mr Considine) took exception to fhe proposed employment of partially disabled men. I predict that such men will appreciate some kind of employment which will keep their minds occupied and divert their attention from their ailments.

In regard to land settlement, I totally disagree from the proposal of the honourable member for Echuca( Mr Palmer) and the honourable member for Pranklin be settled in communities. If one thing more than another has been responsible for the failure of attempts to settle unfit men on the land, it has been the placing of them in groups. not unfit. Amongst them are farmers and farmers' sons. able to take their place anywhere on the land. We shall d'o well to settle as many men as we can, but to place them in groups would be a mistake. Nothing appeals to the man on the land like the example set him by some successful farmer alongside him. which any fool can make a success. There are men who appear to do very little work on their farms, and yet make them pay, whilst others do a lot of work and never make a profit. Successful land settlement is largely a matter of careful and intelligent management. The scheme, as outlined by Senator Millen, makes provision for giving returned soldiers representation on the Board, and I tliink we shall be acting wisely if we leave the appointment of those members to the Government. I agree that men should be appointed for only a fixed term, at the expiration of which they can be removed if they have proved unfitted for their responsibility. If we leave the selection of their representatives on the Board to the soldiers themselves, we shall be affording opportunity for a good deal of bickering and discontent. Of the Bill itself there is little to be said ,unless we take .exception to its skeleton nature. But we are entering upon something new in our experience, and possibly we are justified in making the measure more of a frame-work than is usually the case. Its purpose is to legalize some form of organization for repatriation purposes, and a duty devolves upon each of us to carry out the pledges made to the people that the care of the. returned soldiers will be our first, consideration. The Bill must necessarily leave much unsaid, but a great deal of work can be done under the authority it gives. We must take power to act in a large way in order to meet the requirements of the soldiers as they return. No doubt there will be a number of failures on the land and in other avocations, but we are taking authority in this Bill to institute a great scheme, and we must make it as liberal as we can, and see that its administration is not hampered. I take it that the Government will welcome any suggestion in Committee that will make the organization more complete and thorough. As we are making a new departure, many mistakes will be made even in administration, and we must be in a position to remedy them speedily. As a rule Government Departments move too slowly, but I ho^e the Repatriation Department will stand out in bold relief from the others, and do promptly what is required of it. There are wiseacres who think that they could go into a backyard and write up a Farming is not an occupation of scheme that would suit every case to be met; but, as men of the world, we know that there are many difficult problems with which we cannot immediately deal. I am conscious of my own inability to suggest a way of meeting every case that will arise under this scheme. We must leave great power in the hands of those who will be charged with the administration. The Boards to be created will be large, and, it may be, unwieldy; but even if that be so, we must give wide powers to those who have to administer this ' law. 1 Under ordinary circumstances, one would hesitate to do so. We shall be working, however, under abnormal conditions, and it is necessary, in order that every case may be met, to give ample powers to the administrators of the measure. We are impelled to do this-to make new departures-havin g in mind the noble sacrifice that has been made by the men who have gone to fight for our libertv and for the land which we all love. We hope that they will be able to make good when they return. We shall have a heavy financial obligation to meet under this scheme, but will meet it cheerfully. In placing the returned soldiers on the land, -we shall be incurring not the least of the financial burdens in connection with it, but we shall be putting them in a position to assist us to bear i£,' as well as the other financial obligations placed upon us by the war.

The few complaints we have heard up to the present as to the treatment of returned soldiers relate to hardships that have been due to the period of waiting. I hope to see the registration of these men carried out as far as possible while they are still overseas. Of the 2,000 men who returned yesterday, there is not one who knows what he is going to do now that he is back. I think the Repatriation Department should have its agencies at work in 'England, or wherever the men are, and find out from them before they return the occupations for which they are fit.

I sincerely hope that tlie Defence Department will have nothing to do with the repatriation of these men. In saying this, I do not 'intend to reflect upon the administration of the Defence Deparment as such, but I say, without hesitation, that I have no faith in its treatment of men for which it has no further use. It seems to regard them as mere cogs in the wheel, and, when they are broken, as being fit only to be scrapped. exercise a good deal of humane feeling in the treatment of our returned men, and we must ever have a sense of our responsibility and of our promises to those who have risked their lives to Australian Soldiers' [REPRESENTATIVES.] Repatriation Bill. save the Empire. Even if some have contributed to their own wrecking, that is no reason why we should fail to treat them humanely, and try to restore them to the That state in which they were before the war. I hope the whole control of this scheme will be removed from the Defence Department, and. from men of military training. One is appalled sometimes by the treatment that is meted out to the rank and file by the heads of the Defence Department. Coming to the State Boards to he created, I appreciate very much the idea that seems to be running through the minds of the Government as disclosed in this Bill. I think the Boards should consist of experienced and successful business men, who will be unbiased in their actions and uninfluenced by remarks made even in this Parliament. Their work,, after all, will not be heavy. There will be much routine work to be done by the man has officers who will have to carry out the instructions issued from time to time by the head of the Repatriation Department. The principal work of the Commission will relate to cases for which there is no precedent, and on which they should be best able to give an unbiased decision. There is much that one might say concerning this measure, hut I think it well to reserve a goodly portion of my remarks until we go into Committee, where we shall make every effort to improve it . There are one or two suggestions, however, that I desire to offer at this stage.

It will not he an easy task to return to Australia 200,000 or 300,000 soldiers.
