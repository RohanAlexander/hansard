Other Matters Owing to the publicity given to the subject with which the Committee are concerned, a tremendous number of public and private persons have written to state that they arc desirous of assisting the Committee with their advice or services or by recommending thoseof some other person, and every firm and society is anxious to place its services at our disposal. It is feared that many useful offers at this time will be passed over, and that many correspondents will feel aggrieved at receiving a mere acknowledgment, perhaps a belated one; but it is hoped that this difficulty will soon be overcome by augmenting the staff. It is suggested that the press may give pubthe railway service on mail contractors, licity to the fact that applicants for employment will be requested to send full particulars and references when it is found that their services are likely to be required. Personal interviews are not welcome at the present time, which is fully occupied in investigation into the ways and means of co-ordinating the available resources of Australia for assisting in the present war.

What did the plant consist of? 2. What was the price paid for each item of the said plant? the 'honourable member's questions are: 1. Condenser, live stock, vehicles, ploughs, barrows, &c. 2. The information desired by the honourable member is of a lengthy character, and I therefore lay it on the table of tlic House in the form of a return. ister representing the Minister of Defence, wpon noticeWhether the Government is yet in a position to declare its policy in relation to submarine construction to replace our lost vessels? vernment is to replace the submarines as early as possible, and the Imperial Government were informed of this last October. General, upon notice1. Will he inform the House how many witnesses gave evidence before the authorized offito the effect that these Norwegians are cers recently appointed under the War Precautions Act to inquire into the sugar supplies of the Commonwealth, and who such witnesses (if any) were? 2. Will he lay upon the table of this House copies of the evidence taken and documents (if any) used as evidence in such inquiry? honourable member's questions are: 1. As it became evident at the outset of the inquiry that nearly all the stocks were held by the Colonial Sugar Eefining Company, the investigation was narrowed in scope. Questions were asked of Mr Knox, the general manager of the company, and Mr Symonds, tbe manager in Melbourne and the manager of the Millaqitin Company. Evidence was also taken from practically all the wholesale dealers in Sydney and Melbourne, and from most of the jam manufacturers. 2. I do not think it advisable. MAIL SERVICE INNEW SOUTH General, upon noticeWhether he will inform the House why it is necessary for the Postal Department to pay the Railway Commissioners of New South Wales £123,000 in 1915 for a curtailed railway mail serviee (many lines only running three days a week), whereas in 1913 the same Department paid only £121,811 for a full every-dayin-the-week service? honourable member's question is: The increase in payment of £123,000, 19141915, as compared with £121,811, is principally due to the opening of new lines. Under the existing agreement between the Postmaster General and the Railway Commissioners of the several States, no reduction is made in tbe payment by the former when the frequency of the railway service is reduced. On the other hand, no additional payment is made where the railway frequency is increased. The reduction or increase in frequency docs not, of course, materially affect the weight of the mails carried. The subject is receiving further consideration of this Department in connection with the now agreement now under attention. of External Affairs, upon noticeWhether he is yet in a position to make a definite statement concerning the entrance under contract of Norwegians into Western Australia? ral's opinion, which has now been received, confirms my previous intimation contract immigrants as far as their shore work is concerned. I have called upon the company to furnish an explanation as to why the provisions of the ContractI m migrants Act were not observed. A f u l l report, which tlie Customs authorities at Fremantle have despatched by mail, haa not yet been received; but a telegraphic summary states that the company have explained that, as the State Government were anxious to increase the production of high-class manure, the company undertook, in connection with the granting of a licence to capture and treat whales, to erect a shore factory for treatment of the offal which could not be dealt with on board ship through lack of space; that they were not aware that the Act was",9,Supply

The amount of overtime shown, which averages 0.34 hours per man per week, is not considered excessive in time of war. (The number of hours shown in tlie report is 919$, not 1,019, as stated in the question.) 2. It is not practicable to eliminate overtime in the Ordnance Branch, owing to the undesirableness of relegating the responsibilities of certain classes of the work to temporary employees.

Whether it is a fact that in obtaining supadoption of the course proposed by the plies of fodder for the Defence Department tenders were not called? 2.

Owing to the vacillating and unsettled condition of the fodder market of late, dealers have been disinclined to enter into contracts for any extended period, except at prices much higher than those at which the Department can operate within the Commonwealth and elsewhere.

Constitution Alteration Amendment Bills are so interwoven that it would be, to a large extent, impossible for me to determine whether or not any overlapping has taken place, provided tliat honourable members kept to the constitutional questions involved. A t the same time. I do not wish it to be understood that the Attorney-General is to be regarded as a precedent to be followed on all similar occasions.

I had then only to explain our position under tlie Constitution the nature of the amendments; day I have also to explain and deal with many representations pose and scope of the amendments, to deal with some recent utterances of honourable members of this House which have given rise to the impression the people outside that this Parliament is already clothed with the powers which we are seeking by these means to obtain. must remind honourable members, at the outset, what the powers of this Parliament really are. This is a Parliament of enumerated powers. of a Statute. we must look for all our powers. If they are not there, we do not possess them. Our position is fundamentally from that of the States, which were originally sovereign powers, and could pass any laws they pleased. laws were as limitless as the powers of the community itself. terms of legislation, anything that they thought community. reign powers still, save to the extent to which they have been limited by the Constitution of the Federation. understand what are our powers, we have to look at a document. at the Constitution may do. The States have to look at the Constitution may not do. Constitution but we cannot do all there set out. For the experience of fifteen years has shown that many powers, apparently conferred upon tlie Commonwealth, really possessed by this Parliament. short, many of that imposing array of powers set out in section 51, and other parts Mr Hughes. shadows of powers. The States are in no and 941,947 such position. They are sovereign, save to As there were 171,658 in the extent to which they are limited by times the Constitution, and the real limitations imposed on them are few. They need it is more look at no document, but may pass such legislation as the circumstances demand. CirTheH i g h Court has been created for the purpose of interpreting the Constitution, of the Constitution and preventing the States and Commonwealth from exceeding the powers alloIn presenting the procated to them. The High Court is, of course, not a legislative body. Its functions are purely judicial. Its duty is not to make laws, but to declare what the and laws are. In its function of interpreter but toof the Constitution, it has to say what our powers are, and not to say how we both of the purshould use them. It is very necesand sary, at this juncture, to remind honourable members of this poiut, and I shall revert to it later. I have said amongst that the H i g h Court is the interpreter of the Constitution. When, therefore, we are asked what our powers are, we I have not only to look at the Constitution as it stands, but to look at it in the light of the rules of interpretation which the High Court has laid down, and in We are the creature the light of the decisions which the Court It is to that Statute that has made in accordance with those rules. If , then, we are asked what the powers of the Commonwealth Parliament are, different we have to say that they are those enumerated in the Constitution as interpreted by the H i g h Court. Beyond that Their powers to pass we cannot go, for the H i g h Court is the final arbiter of our powers. What the They could express, in High Court says our powers are-thos e are our powers. What the High Court proper in the interests of the says the Constitution means-that it does The States have those sovemean. It is very necessary that I should, at every stage throughout this discussion, impress upon the minds of honourable In order to members exactly the position in which we find ourselves. We are a most proWe have to look gressive community. No country is able to see what we to point to progress at a more rapid rate or in directions more varied than this only to see what they Commonwealth during the last fifteen We must look at the years. Trade and the manner of its deto see what we can do, velopment, manufactures, and general progress of the Commonwealth in one way and another, have been astounding. All over the world there has been treare not mendous development. Every day In ancient institutions are tumbling into the dust, new ones more suited to a progressive age are taking their place. Yet of the Constitution, are but we are told that this country should govern itself according to a system of laws which was an anachronism at the time we adopted it , and which is now totally unsuited to our purpose, and which has been rendered less fit for our present purpose by the narrow interpretation placed upon the Commonwealth powers by tbe H i g h Court and the Privy Council. This brings me directly to the consideration of the proposed constitutional amendments themselves. amendments in their form and substance are based upon sound principles and upon the teachings of experience. They aim, not at dealing with the symptoms of the malady from which the Constitution suffers, but at tlie eradi' cation of the disease. What is the disease from which the Constitution suffers? It arises from the illogical and unscientific allocation of the powers between the Commonwealth and the States. We have followed too slavishly the model laid down by the framers of the American Constitution. In their day, no doubt, they did what was wise and possible, but their day is not our day. The instrument which was sufficient for their purpose is quite inadequate for ours. They were legislating for a small community of men engaged in almost primitive occupations, isolated in groups far removed from one another, and carrying on their several businesses without order or that systematization arising out of, and necessary to deal with, the tremendous complexity of modern methods of production. circumstances in the American Confederation which compelled the adoption of a compromise. without hesitation that the American Constitution never was fit even for tlie purpose for whicli it was intended, and is certainly unsuited for a community living under twentieth century conditions. difficulty has always been the allocation of powers between States and Commonwealth upon lines which do not permit of a clear line of demarcation being drawn between them. I have said that it is the ' function of the High Court to draw that line of demarcation, and say, "" This power belongs to the Commonwealth, and that power belongs to the States."" H i gh Court to. do that fairly if it is beyond the power of mortal man to say where a power begins and where it ends? There is neither logic, sense, nor reason in the division, for example, of the trade and commerce power. Commerce is a subject which, in its very nature, cannot be divided. Commerce is a national matter. It is intercourse. It begins, where intercourse begins and ends where intercourse ends. That is to say, commerce is, in its operation, coterminous with our territorial limits; and to attempt These to circumscribe its operations, and to declare that in such-and-such a district commerce must be subject to one law, and in another district to another law, is but to invite confusion and trouble. We have followed slavishly in the footsteps of the framers of the American Constitution in this respect. The American reports are f u l l of cases irreconcilable, hopelessly confusing, and absurd, as a result of efforts to distinguish between what is State commerce and what is Inter-State commerce. If honourable members will look at what commerce is, they will see how utterly. impossible it is to distinguish between what is State commerce and what is Commonwealth commerce-to say what is Inter-State commerce and what is Intra-State commerce. You send a parcel from Albury to Wagga. That is Intra-State commerce, subject to State law. You send the same parcel from Albur-y to Wodonga, just across the Murray River, and that is Inter-State commerce, and so subject to Commonwealth law. You send a letter from Sydney to Melbourne, or you send a letter from There were special Sydney to Wagga, and both are under the same law. Surelyi t would be as rational and logical to say that But I say there should be a postal law governing the delivery of postal articles within a State, as well as a law governing postal deliveries between States, as it is to say that there should be separate commercial laws governing commerce The chief cause of the inside a State and between States? You cannot draw a line between commerce within a State and commerce passing from one State to another. No such distinction is possible. This illogical and unscientific division of power' of trade and commerce in the Constitution not only prevents us from dealing with commerce inside the -prohibited sphere, but hampers us in dealing with commerce inside the But how is the sphere that is covered by the Constitution. We may not deal with commerce inside a State, but we may deal with trade and commerce between the States. The result is that we cannot effectively deal w it h trade and commerce at a l l . I have said tliat, in my opinion trade and commerce t is an object of national concern. It cannot now, if it ever could, be dealt w it h adequately by the States. there was a day when trade and commerce trickled in tiny rivulets from hamlet to hamlet, when the needs of communities were supplied from within, when inside little districts, sparsely inhabited, everybody found his needs supplied by local producers. But that day has gone, and now we see a cataract of commerce massing from one end of the earth to the other, a tremendous and ever-widening stream, flowing hither and thither from one corner of the earth to the other, and yet it is contended that the control of this national and ever-broadening stream of our commercial industrial life can be regulated by the laws of a hundred States through which it flows. Clearly the ideal commerce law is one recognised and observed by all nations, and to that ideal we are fast advancing. until we reach it , our ideal most certainly must be national control over commerce. A distinguished writer, Prentice, i h his Commerce Laws of the Constitution, saysIt is obvious, then, that the line between the State and Federal power with reference to commerce is an arbitrary one. There is no economic or commercial distinction which even roughly corresponds with"" State boundaries. Commerce is a whole, and a power to regulate commerce, if complete and unlimited by an arbitrary line of division, must extend to all commerce, wherever conducted. Sueh a power Congress does not possess. The Constitution, in fact, established an arbitrary ljmit to Federal jurisdiction. The consequence is bhat we find ourselves at the present day unable to take the first step in dealing with the great commercial interests of tliis country. We cannot even make a general company law. There are some who do not grasp the importance of commerce, who regard it as a thing apart -a thing that concerns the man in the office, the clerk in the store, or, possibly, the manufacturer commerce is so correlated with -for dustry-tliat our daily lives, so that, when we come to deal with any sphere of human we find ourselves hopelessly fettered unless we have control of commerce. affects everv person in the and affects ""him closely. Mr Hughes. vitally affected by the freight he has t e pay upon the transport of the commodities ' he requires, and upon the produce which he sends away. The producer is vitally concerned in the facilities for transport No doubt f r o n the place, where he produces hia goods to the market in which he finally disposes of them. The shopkeeper, themerchant, the artisan, the housewife, every section of the community, live dependent upon commerce in one way or another. It is perfectly obvious that the regulation of commerce is a matter winch must be in the hands of the National Parliament, and in order that it may be in . the hands of that Parliament tlie power must be conferred upon it .in general terms. The whole subject-matter must pass to this Parliament. That is the point which I desire to emphasize. The chief reason for the trouble from which we have suffered since the inception of the Commonwealth is that, in the allocation of powers as between the Commonwealth and tlie States, the whole subject-matter has. But not been allocated either to the Commonwealth or the States respectively. It would be infinitely better if the Commonwealth possessed only one-half of thej powers it is supposed to possess, if it had control of the whole subject-matter of those powers. If it had such control, there could be no litigation, no uncertainty, no clashing of powers. The functions of the H i g h Court would then be merely to determine whether any particular Act was within one of these powers. If it was, clearly it would be constitutional. If not, then obviously it would be ultra vires of the powers of this Parliament. But when the H i g h Court is called upon to decide, not only whether the Commonwealth has power to deal w it h a particular matter, but whether it has power to deal with it in the way in which the Parliament has dealt with it , confusion becomes worse confounded. It is not too much to say that the chief reason why the H i g h Court has pruned down our apparent powers by a in his factory. But series of decisions in -constitutional cases; industry arises from the fact that we have insufficommerce is the handmaid of incient control over trade and commerce. it touches every corner of This brings me to a point, the importance of which can scarcely be exaggerated, activities, one which not only diagnoses the trouble from which we are sufferCommerce ing, but points out the nature of community, the remedy which, must .be applied to it .

Ib is essential this be done without delay, for the scope of our iiuthoidty which, should grow, witli the passage of timebecomes, actually moire restricted through, thedecisions of the High Court. I will explain' the reason for bhis: TheH i gh Court, in interpreting, the Constitution, has laid down n rule which has had the effect of. narrowing, most unfortunately, the powers of this Parliament. referred to asthedoctrine of the limitation of powers. attention of honourable members to that doctrine, and invite them to follow closely the effects of its application) to the various powers enumerated in the Constitution. I have said that if we wish to know what our powers are we shall have-, nob only to look at the Constitution-, but to look at it in, the light of its interpretation by the H i gh Court. B'arr/er, thedoctrine of thelimitation of powers wasfirst enunciated'. It Itas the effect of applying the words' of limitation in one sectionof the Constitution, not only to the section in which they occur, but to othersections insuch a way that wherethere isambiguity in one section, the plain words of the Constitution in anothersection are regarded as insufficient, and there is thus superimposed on the'Constitution apresumption in favour of the States. The effects of the-'application of thedoctrine have been most important and far-reaching. In the case of Rf.iv r . B'arr/er-the ExciseMachinery ease-the Court said, in effectI t is clear tliat tliis Act is a regulation of the conditions of labour which we hold to be reserved' to the States. The only enumerated power of. the Commonwealth which, can possibly come within it istaxation-,, and i.t is not olear that it is within taxation, therefore the reserved"" power of tlic State prevails. That is to say, wherever tliere is. a doubt, it is always determined in favoun of the States and never in favour of the Commonwealtli-; whenever there is ambiguity, it is never resolved in favour of the Commonwealth, but alwaysin. favour of the States. It follows,, therefore, that the doctrine has so narrowed our powers that : when we ask what those powers are we eannot ascertain! by looking at theCon^ stitntion,,. for the mere fact t h a t powers are enumerated in the Constitution is only prima facie evidence tliat thesubstance The remedy lies in of any power so enumerated, is. really vested in the Commonwealth. But let me amplify the effects, of the docbrine. In interpreting the enumerated powers, the H i g h Court has: laid it downThe Constitution as ai whole, and especially section 107, was held to reserve to the States control of the internal or domestic affairsof the States, except as faras they came within one of the enumerated powers of the Commonwealth. Section 107 readsThe rulemay be Every power of the Parliament of a Colony which has become or becomes a State shall) unless it is by this Constitution exclusively I direct the vested in the Parliament of the Commonwealth or withdrawn from the Parliament of a State, continue as at the establishment of the Commonwealth, or as at the admission orestablishment of the State; as the case may be. Tliat is the principle on which the reserve powers of the States stand, or, at any rate, by which they are guaranteed. In the Attorney-General v. The BreweryI n Hex v. Employees Co., bhe words "" TradeM a r k "" were held not to include the workers'' trademark provided for by the Actof 1905,. because-, as set out by the Chief JusticeXn myopinion, it should, be regarded .as a . fundamental rule in the construction of the Constitution that where the intention to reserve any subject-mattes to the States, to the exclusion of the. ©ommonwealth, clearly ap^ pears, no exception from that reservation can be admitted' which is not expressed in clear and' unequivocal words. Otherwise the Constitution will be made to contradict itself, which upon a proper construction must be impossible. S'o it was held that we have no general power to make a lawon trade marks-. I invite honourable members to look at paragraph x-viii. of section 51 of the Constitution, which says, in plain words,, thatThe Parliament shall . . . havepower to make lawsfbr the peace; order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect toCopyrights, patents or inventions and designs,, and trade marks. Here power to make laws on trade marks ia'defined in clear terms-; yet our power to make laws with regard to trade marks islimited by the reserve powers of the States. And so, with almost every other power of the Commonwealth. The.trouble arises through a division of the subject matter.,, and the consequence is confusion and uncertainty. Again, in the. case ot Huddart Parker similar the interpretation of the scope of paragraph xx. of section 5 1 . the attention of lionorable members to the provision which says that the. Commonwealth Parliament shall have power to make laws with respect toForeign corporations, and trading or financial corporations formed within the limits of power, to the Commonwealth. We must the Commonwealth. Those words are clear, unambiguous, apsaysparently leaving no doubt that we have f u l l power over both foreign corporations toms, and corporations formed within the limits the States, whether by means of internal carof the Commonwealth. Y et it was held riage or ocean navigation, shall be absolutely that we have no such power, because our free. power would impinge upon and impair To those who understand the English tbe reserve powers of the Statesi n that language, those words mean what they regard. The Chief Justice saidI t is a corollary to tliis rule that, if there all over the Commonwealth, and that he an exception from the reservation, the exnothing should prevent it so doing. It is tent of the exception must be equally clearly certain that, had the people of this and unequivocally expressed, and that, so far country thought that they did not mean as the exception does not extend, the reservation remains in full force. I cannot accept that, this Parliament would never have the doctrine that if an invasion of the sphere been sitting here to-day under this Conof the State is admitted for a limited purpose, stitution, for the Constitution would the reservation altogether disappears. The never have been accepted by the people. invasion is only permitted so far as it is necessary to enable the power in question to TheH i g h Court acknowledges be exercised, and the extent of the permitted the words mean what they say, but invasion is determined and limited by the same it asks, "" W h a t do they say?"" Accordnecessity. In the WorkersI pointed a priori doubt whether this was a trade acquire and control the subject-matter of mark, and held that the reserve power as commerce. The position is as though it to internal commerce prevailed. we had had full power over trade and reservoir to a tap must be kept clear and commerce the prohibition apply. It is in this way that the limitation Court had held that there was nothing in paragraph 1 of section 51 has been used to prevent the commandeering of the in interpreting The effect of this doctrine of limitation is fident in his charter, the ratepayer turns that while the words "" among the States"" on his tap, holds his pannikin under it,remain in paragraph 1, read in conjuncbut nothing comes out of the tap.

They know principles were applied to what interest the case aroused, with what impatience the judgment of the CourtI direct was awaited, w it h what feelings the judgment when delivered was received. I ask them to remember that no amendment of the Constitution will be of any service to the community unless it gives power, and not merely the shadow of not fool the people again with mere words. Section 92 of the Constitution On the imposition of uniform duties of Custrade, commerce, and intercourse among say, namely, that trade should flow freely that ing to the Court, the Constitution deTrade Mark C£LS6'j SIS clares that commerce shall be free; but it out, the Court found an does not affect the power of the States to But if had been enacted that the pipe from the would not free from all obstructions, but that the the scope of the powers. water in the reservoir.

""Show us,"" they would say, in "" where it is guaranteed that water must A run through the pipes. Show us where appreciated. we. But the electors feel they have been members will recollect the deceived: tliat they have a shadow where they thought they were solemnly assured of the substance. Plain words have become the sport of dialecticians, and the Constitution is the happy hunting ground for the never-to-be sufficiently venerated members of my honourable profession. Constitution was given to the people of this country, and accepted by them, as plain men and women who desired to enlarge their powers of self-government. When we declared that trade should be absolutely free, what we had in our minds was that, instead of our opportunities being circumscribed by the narrow limits of a State, they were to extend, without hindrance, throughout tlie length and breadth of this great island continent. I take it that here was a pledge, solemn and unconditional, that in times of scarcity, should they occur, we would all be in the same boat; not that within the boundaries of one State there should be plenty, of which the less fortu nate outside would not be allowed to partake. If there were general scarcity throughout Australia, we should have to do what we could to meet the common needs; but we have a right to complain when, under a charter of Pederal liberty, we are told that the right remains with some to take advantage of relative plenty while others are compelled to suffer because of relative scarcity. that nor touch it at all. fer not to amplify my remarks at this stage; but I state, definitely and emphatically, that the proposed Trade and Commerce amendment, if approved by the people, will have this effect: The Commonwealth right of eminent domain in property will extend over the whole sphere of the subject-matter of State commerce. Our right of eminent domain w ill be paramount to that of the States, so that if the States, after the proposed amendment has been adopted, were to exercise their power of acquisition, the Commonwealth could acquire from them, willy-nilly, in the same way as from private citizens, what they had acquired from others. So much is quite clear. But unless and until the limitation in our trade and commerce power is deleted, section '92, guaranteeing freedom of trade between the States, is a rotten reed. Until we have the f u l l trade and commerce power, there w ill be endless litigation, aud the edifice of our authority must rest on an uncertain and tottering foundation. The foundation of our authority must be broadened u n t i l it rests on the whole trade and commerce The power; otherwise, the constitutional edifice must always be in danger of collapsing like a pack of cards. I say advisedly, that had I to choose between this power and all the others, I would select this power, because without it we cannot progress as a nation. The other powers are supplementary to it , and without it would not help us very much. The limitation of time imposed upon speeches prevents me from dealing at great length with these matters, but I wish very briefly to touch on the other proposed amendments. Mr Deputy Speaker, to the statement of the Attorney-General, that he proposes to deal with Bills that are not now before us. whicli I think is unparliamentary. consider that the Attorney-General has broken any' of the rules of the House. There is a connection between this B ill and tlie other measures to which he has referred which prevents them from being dealt with separately, and I shall follow The B ill does not cure Mr Speakeri n allowing great latitude of debate in regard to them. my own sake, to avoid dealing now with the other Bills, but it is impossible to present to the House and to the country a connected statement of the proposals unless they are dealt with together. Intimately and inseparably connected respect of the acquirement of with the power to control trade and commerce is the power to control the operations of corporations, trusts, combines, monopolies, and industrial matters generally. Isi t possible to divorce commerce from industry, which are the two sides of the same thing? One man manufactures, and another transports the article manufactured. A hundred years ago it was the individual who carried on trade and commerce; to-day it is the company. Ninety per cent., if not more, of the commercial, industrial, and manufacturing operations of the world are carried on by corporations, over which this National Parliament has no control, notwithstanding the plain words of paragraph xx. of section 51.

He was in formed that the little farmer was to be crushed. little farmer now sleeps in peace. But the great land-owner has dreadful dreams, and wakes to a still more dreadful reality. I shall deal with these points more in detail later. I now wish to direct the attention of the House and the country to a point of fundamental importance in connection with the power of nationalization. The States have power of eminent domain if the term can be applied to the compulsory acquisition of personal property. They have the power of eminent domain over property of all sorts and kinds, without limitation, reservation, or condition. The States have power to take all property without compensation. of Victoria could now expropriate all private property within her territorial limits, and not be called upon to pay the fractional part of a farthing by way of compensation. The State Government could take the wheat from the farmer and give nothing in r e t u r n ; the meat could take ancl all their contents, other kind of property and securities, financial and otherwise, and give nothing in return. This power of eminent domain is vested in all the States. But the Commonwealth is in a very different position. The proposed law w ill give the Commonwealth power to acquire property on just terms; that is to say, the Commonwealth must pay just compensation as assessed by the High Court. The honourable member for Flinders inserted these words as an amendment, in 1911, and my honourable friends opposite may take credit to themselves for so doing. I do not wish to disturb their complacency in this regard, but I tell them that if tlie amendment had not been inserted it would have made no difference, for the Commonwealth has no power to acquire property on any other than just terms. According to sub-section x x x i . of section 51 of the Constitution, these are the only terms on which the Commonwealth can acquire property, as the words of tlie sub-section were showThey did the same thing The acquisition of property on just terms from .any State or person for any purpose in Then the poor farmer was respect of which the Parliament has power to make laws. It will be seen .that if the words "" just terms'' had not been inserted in this As a matter of fact, the proposal now before the House, it would not have made any difference; we should not, as I said at tlie time, havo had any power to acquire property except on just terms. I wish honourable members to contrast the position of the States with the position of the Commonwealth in this regard. I desire to strangle at the outset the misrepresentations that were made during the last referenda: that we proposed to take property and not pay for it . That the Commonwealth cannot do, though the States may; we must pav 20s. in the £ 1 for any property we acquire, while the States need not igay a halfpenny. That distinction is fundamental. Whether the case be that of a poor widow, a poor struggling farmer, or the The State richest man in the land, the fact remains incontestable, that tlie States have now the power to confiscate any property without payment, while the Commonwealth has none. I do not propose to enter into the nature of the amendments at greater length at this it could take stage. Amendment of the Constitution from cold storage; it is absolutely necessary; these propositions houses, shops, factories, are couched in terms which w ill give us and every the power we desire. In my opinion, no less power than that at whioh we aim w ill enable the Commonwealth to legislate effectively for the protection of the in terests of the people. The matter is urgept, and certainly of national importance. AlthoughI do not deny that there has been thrown over this national! matter an aspect of party, I do deny that, it is a party question in essence. Whoever may have to exercise these powers, it . will be for the people themselves to determine the limitations of their exercise. I shall not attempt at this stage to deal with the volume of objections which were raised on a previous occasion to these proposals. It was then said that they amounted to Unification-that they were opposed to the spirit of the Federal Constitution-n o doubt we shall hear those cries again, but it will be found that they have lost their hypnotic influence.

I am content at this stage to leave sible for a lawyer, or anybody else, to define the matter with honourable members; but, the limits of the Government's powers, I would Mr Hughes. and later on in the debate, I shall support my rights, but only witli those honourable gentlemen.

But with regard to the honourable gentleman's contention that it is impospoint out to honourable members that the overriding principle recognised in all countries is that all constitutional limitations give way to what is the supreme law of the land, the safety of the realm. Nothing stands in the way of that supreme law; if that safety is really involved, all constitutional ties are like prices-by which he means power to reflax in a fire. If this country were inimmediate danger of occupation by the enemy, is there any power that the National Government would not exercise to prevent sueh an occurrence? I venture to say there is not. But we have not arrived at that dangerous stage yet. I do not propose to press my argument any further than it will go, but that principle, salus populi suprema lex est, implies also that the supreme law must rest with the one Government that represents the whole of the people. How far that power would go is a different question, the resolving, of which must depend on the circumstances of the case. I am not prepared to say that, under the existing conditions in Australia, any power would reside in the Federal Government to go about buying foodstuffs generally and distributing them. If tlie object is simply to say, ""Things arc hopelessly at variance as to the circumdearer now than usual, whether through combinations or conspiracies or arrangements of the kind, therefore let us buy the stuff and sell it to the people more cheaply,"" I hardly think that would or could reasonably, in the present conditions of Australia, be regarded as a legitimate exercise of the constitutional power. On Saturday last the Age, no doubt stimulated by the suggestive but rather uncertain observations of the honourable member for Flinders, published an article written ostensibly by a Labour man; but I am afraid that the labour at which the writer has been habitually working is not that which he would have us believe it to be. The article contains this passageWhatI mean to say is that, by virtue of the war, the Federal Government has acquired power to do by executive Act (while the war lasts) anything that might be clone legally in peace by virtue of the. express provisions of an the streets. amended Constitution. Its powers indeed are unlimited ancl absolute. It could, if it chose, ment more calculated to confuse and suspend all the State Parliaments to-morrow, abolish the High Court, and put the whole Commonwealth under martial 'discipline. I i i that extract tlie culminating point has been reached, and at one bound we pass from vague uncertain statements as to our power into the most definite declaration that we can abolish the H i g h Court and suspend State Parliaments. No wonder the minds of people have been a littl e confused as to what our powers really are. The opinions which in many respects differ fundamentally, but they agree on the one point, that the powers of the Commonwealth during a time of war are sufficient to enable us to do almost anything. But that is the only point of agreement, for, whereas the honourable member for Bourke says we have power to regulate duce prices-the righ t honourable member for Parramatta says that the regulation of prices is impossible, and will lead to a condition worse than the present; and the honourable and learned member for Flinders expresses the view that the time is not ripe for our taking any such action. Though the three honourable members mentioned agree that we have the powers, they are unable to agree as to the use we should make of them, and that difference of opinion is in itself fatal to their contention. It is surely a most significant circumstance that even those who assert that we have these great powers are stances which would justify the exercise of them. But let me deal directly with the contention that the Commonwealth has power, in the words of the lionorable member for Bourke and the honourable member for Flinders, "" to do almost anything."" The honourable member for Flinders does not, like the honourable member for Bourke and the Leader of tlie Opposition, base his statement on the defence power. He looks to something which he calls salvs populi suprema lex est. It may be that this L a t in tag, like tlie doctor's prescription which no man is able to read, has had a hypnotising effect on the people, so that we no longer hear of the tremendous and elastic powers of the defence legislation, but only of salus populi suprema lex est. No doubt, shortly, even little children w ill be prattling that phrase in I can conceive of no stateunsettle the minds of the people than such a statement of our powers, for while in a sense it is true enough, as applied to present circumstances it is profoundly untrue. The question before us is-in whom is this sti-prema lex vested, in the Commonwealth or in the States? The honourable and learned gentleman tells us sahis populi suprem.a lex est! The point is not as to whether there is a supreme law, but in extracts I have quoted embody whom it is vested. Isi t vested in the Parliament which has prescribed powers, or in the Parliaments which have reserved powers? Isi t vested in the Parliament whicb, during the last fifteen yeaars, has had its every power down,, or in the Parliaments, which, according to the Constitution, reign powers which may not be impaired by the Commonwealth ? Our friends, the ardent advocates of the States and their authority, verts Commonwealth. wings displaysa brilliant plumage, spreads its broad most air without could do nothing can now do. everything. It is very strange. learned member for Flinders says-, "" salus -populi suprema -lex est; the stances have not arisen which justify power, but when they do, the Federal Parliament will have unlimited But what does that declaration of unlimited power amount to ?. The honourable gentleman, Leader, to whom he referred as "" my learned Leader,"" made a statement was inconsistent, not only with the Federal system of government, "" rule of law."" suprema lex to which gentleman refers? at the best it is but the inchoate substance out of which law is made. is law ?

So much for the doctrine of saluspopuli suprema lex est, which can have no relevance to partner to the Federal pact whose powers are enumerated. ferent with the Parliaments of the States, because they have reserve powers. then, we would know what our powers Mr Hughes. are, we must look, to the Constitution. whittled Wliat are these powers ? Most of them have been pruned down; but one, the havesovedefence power, has not been cut down by the H i gh Court. I said the other day that he would be a bold man who would set a l i m it to that power. That have suddenly becomeconwas and is my opinion; but by that to the great powers of the statement. I do not mean that there This Parliament, whose is no l i m it to the power; I .mean have been clipped, suddenly only that the power is very wide. The honourable member for Bourke and pinions, and flies in the topthe right honourable member for a rival. We who Parramatta seem to think that we can do anything by virtue of the The honourable and defence power. I think they are wrong. They have overlooked the fact that we circumare not the only Legislature, and that would every State Legislature may deal with the the exercise of that supreme circumstances that confront it . And their powers are infinitely wider than powers."" ours. I admit that we may do anything necessary to defend the country; but the thing done must have an intimate and in his anxiety to help his direct relation to defence. The relation must beclear and obvious. It must not which be merely a colourable pretext for legislation outside our propersphere; and if but also with the the matter be within the sphere of the For what is this State Legislatures, it can only be exerthe honourable cised if the States have not acted, or if It is not law at all; the matter be such as to prevent effective State action. L e t me give an' illustraWhat tion. The Parliament of New South Wales, by its Wlieat Acquisition Act , constitutional acquired all the wheat. W ill the honourable member for Flinders or any other honourable member say that we could have expressed. But this suprema acquired that wheat by virtue of our inchoate defence power? Would he say that in view of the clearly-expressed judgment like of the High Court? The fact is we have of Great Britain can ' take hold no such power; the honourable member knows that perfectly well. No doubt if there is a shortage of any commodity cannot do so, because likely to impair the ability of the Commonwealth to defend itself, then our reserpowers under defence would be sufficient This to acquire that commodity. We may Parliament is a Parliament acquire commodities in such circumlimited by the stances. But as to the regulation of beyond tlie limits of which prices, there is no such power. Mr GI .

139,The Case Would Be Dif,"Mr HUGHES I have said that, i uperfectly certain that the honourable and learned member for Flinders will not contend we have. If honourable members will read his speech carefully, they will find that he does not say we have that power. Much confusion has arisen because a lawyer has endeavoured to set before laymen what tlie Legislature may do in certain circumstances in language shorn of legal technicality. His meaning is imperfectly assimilated, and an entirely wrong deduction -is made from his observations. I come now to the Age article, which says we have power to suspend the State Parliaments and to abolish the High Court. W ill any honorablo member say for a moment that we have such a power ? And yet the writer of the Age article is absolutely logical. If we have this power; if there is in any circumstance the power vested in us to say, "" We can do anything we like necessary to defend the country, then anything that we do as being necessary to defend the country is necessary to defend -the country, and we may suspend the State Parliaments and abolish the H i g h Court."" No one will say for one moment that we have that power, b ut it is the inevitable deduction to be drawn from a general statement that our power, whether it be derived from tlie suprema lex or from our defence power> is unlimited. I am perfectly certain that the honourable and learned member for Flinders never intended such a deduction to -be drawn. But the people have drawn that deduction, as they inevitably must, and there is grave danger when we leave the firm ground of legal and constitutional warrant for any action done by this Parliament, by the Judiciary, or by individual citizens, for then we move about in the quicksand of shifting opinion. vested in this Government, who is to determine the occasion for its exercise, or the extent to which its exercise shall go ? , imply that there is a power whicli can be given and withdrawn, "" Thus far, and -no f u r t h e r . "" But who is to decide when the power is to be exercised, and how far it is to go? If there be a power, it can only be exercised when, in the opinion of the ten men who form the Government of this country, it is necessary to be exercised; and it may be exercised, not merely when war threatens, but when .any emergency threatens. The honourable and learned member did not say, and he cannot say., that war is the only emergency which may justify -a recourse to the suprema lex on the part of the Executive Government. What, then, this power of suprema lex amounts to, if it amounts to .anything at all, is that any Government may exercise arbitrary powers when it pleases, and to tlie extent it pleases. And it means nothing else. Buti f there be such a power, then it is not only outside, our Constitution, and outside the H i g h Court, but outside this Parliament. No doubt such power is vested in every Government that has armed forces at its disposal. Stripped of everything by.which it is hidden, there is nothing more in what tlie honourable gentleman said than this-: -.that to those who have force the occasion may arise when they will exercise it . History is marked by instances where Governments have used their military power, and not infrequently to serve their own purposes. In this Government, that has at its back the A r m y, no doubt there is power to shut up this House; to go into every State House and shut it u p ; to say to every Serjeant-at Arms, "" T a k e away that bauble "" ; to abolish the H i g h Court; and to establish martial law throughout tlie country. Of course, we have that power; but -that power rests on force, and not on law at all. It ia government by force, government by military despotism, and not government by law. Who will say that the emergency in which we now' find ourselves is such as to justify a resort to force ? No doubt a Government must, if the occasion warrants it , be prepared to do anything -and everything. W ill anybody say that such an occasion has now .arisen, and if .the occasion has not arisen-and no one w ill say it has For, if unlimited power is arisen-wh y all this talk about our power to do anything we like under our defence power ? Who w ill permit us to use such powers? A t the worse The honourable member seems to or at the best, the honourable and learned member's contention can only amount to tliis: that the H i gh Court would allow us to do certain things. A r e we to believe that tine H i gh Court contemplates abdicating its position-of retiring from its office? Do we see any sign of the States recognising their incapacity to deal with tlie situation? We see the very opposite. We see the H i gh -Court exceedingly active, exercising it s functions with vigour, delimiting our powers jealously. The other day we saw evidences of the Court's activity, its power, and its determination to use it , in the decision in the Wheat Acquisition case given in the middle of the war. Nowhere do we see any indication that the Court is ready to abandon its power. Nor do we see any signs that the States are willing to surrender their powers to us, or find themselves incapable of dealing with matters that arise in their various spheres. ber's time has expired. Leave to continue Court actively carrying on all the functions assigned to it under the Constitution. It is evident, then, that our powers are those enumerated in the Constitution, and no others. If we are to understand by the application of this doctrine of suprema lex that we are to use our arbitrary powers, subject to the H i g h Court that will not interpose its power to arrest our legislative action, what does that mean but this: that we shall legislate subject to the power of the High Court? The contention of the honourable member for Flinders, viewed from this poirit, amounts to no more than this: What the Court says we may do, outside the Constitution, that we may do, and no more. But this would be to make the H i g h Court the dictator of our policy. That would be a -position as intolerable as government by force. Y e t it is the one alternative to a military despotism, to which tliis Government-and I hope this Parliament and this country-wil l never submit. To elevate the High Court to the position of a supreme legislative chamber, what a proposal that is! That which the H i g h Court says we may do we may do. By such a course we should abrogate the supreme functions of this Chamber as an expression of the national will of the people. But we could not do this, and we ought not even to consider it as possible. There is, therefore, nothing in all this talk of swprema lex. power is wide, but is emphatically not limitless. On the contrary, there are very real limits set to it . And I cannot but be amazed at the change of opinion that has animated my honourable friends, who were for years the banner-bearers of law and order, that they should now tell us to disregard the Constitution and the safeguards of the law, that we may do anything we may conceive necessary to be done. They told the people over and over again that this Constitution was sacred, and that we must not under any circumstances lay our iconoclastic hand impiously upon it . Now we are not only to tear it down; but to destroy the very temple in which it stands. Why this change? It is because the proposal to amend the Constitution does not find favour in certain quarters, and frantic efforts are being made to confuse the minds of the people and guide granted. us into dangerous pitfalls. We do not propose to exercise tlie great powers We see the H i gh that we are asking for without the consent of the people. We only propose to exercise them after the people have given their mature approval thereto. We are not going to sacrifice the policy which we have for years, in season and out of season, advocated, in order to b© subjected to the direction of the H i g h Court as to how far we shall go or how far we shall not go. We are not going to endeavour to carry out this policy at the point of the bayonet; but we propose to do what we have to do with the approval of the people in a constitutional aud legal fashion. Just one other point. Our friends have argued that it is i m proper for us to ask the people to approve of these amendments at this time. Why is it improper? I s it contended t h a i to ask the people to vote on six abstract questions six months hence w ill impair our national efficiency? General not to discuss that question. If I were to allow him to do so, we should have an endless discussion upon the war. I cannot allow that subject to be discussed, since it has nothing whabever to do with the constitutional question involved. now has an idea what legislation under the wing of the High Court would be. SinceI am unable to elaborate this part of my argument, I must draw my re-' Our defence marks to a conclusion. I have endeavoured to show what our powers under the Constitution really ar.e.

We in a thousand ways. wealth has not the powers it ought to have. No man who has given this question a moment's consideration w ill dare to say that it has. The honourable and learned member for Flinders, over and. over again, has declared himself a firm believer in the necessity for the amendment of the Constitution. He has declared that the trade and commerce power must be given to this Parliament without condition or reservation. He has declared over and over again that the power to make super-eminent industrial laws must be given to this Parliament. He has declared that trusts and combines cannot be dealt with by the States, but only through Federal legislation. He has stated only recently that he has not changed his opinions since he first gave utterance to them in 1911. Speaking only the other day, he re-affirmed the position that the amendment of the Constitution was urgent. The right honourable member for Parramatta, when his Government went to the country, declared in his policy speech that his party were in favour of constitutional amendment. I do not attempt for one moment to criticise the amendments he proposed, because the right honourable member did no more than indicate that his party favoured amendment. He did not reduce his proposals to for m ; but he stands committed, amendment of the Constitution. honourable and learned member for Angas has stated, in a memorandum prepared by him while in office, and read frequently in this House, that the amendment of the Constitution is necessary in order to enable us to deal with trusts and combines. member for Darling Downs, in the memorandum prepared by Mr Garran and endorsed by him as Attorney-General, and despatched by Mr Deakin to the SouthA f r i c a n Government, declared I am that the trade and commerce power ought to be given without words of limitation. As for the industrial power, we know from the experience of normal, result, not from some years how hopeless is the position of the Conciliation and Arbitratio n Court. AE this time, when practically the whole world is plunged in war, it is surely not too much to say that we should use every means to maintain industrial peace; that we should strive with all our find ourselves to-day hampered soul and strength to avoid industrial warThe Commonfare; that we, as civilized men, should appeal to reason rather than to force. The position in which the Industrial Court finds itself to-day is most unhappy. It is hampered by technicalities. Orders of prohibition cut across clearly expressed awards of the Court, obtained after lengthy hearing and great expenditure of money. The Court cannot make a common rule. In this Industrial Court where the technicalities of law were to be tabooed, the Court flounders in a morass of technicalities. Every day dialecticians spend hours, days, and weeks in the H i g h Court splitting hairs about the meaning of words. We have come to a time now in our national history when, having cast off the robes of youth, we have put on the toga of manhood, and we ought to be armed with adequate constitutional powers.

173,Mr Joseph Cook,"That is the rateone recollects that the defence expenditure of the Old Country is towering u p to £3,000,000 oer day, one realizes what a small contribution we are making. The proposed vote for defence purposes in this B ill represents £18,000,000 per annum, or about one-seventieth of the annual war expenditure of Great Britain to-day, although our population is. about one-ninth of that of the Old Country. Australia,, roughly speaking, has 5,000,000 of people, and Great Britain 45,000,000. Over there they are spending at the rate of £3,000,000 a day, while we are spending a little over £40,000 a day. That is as I see the question. We are spending, roughly, about l-70th of. the amount that is being expended in the Old Country; and I , for one, say, here and now, that I have never been satisfied with that proportion. Ever since the war broke out, I have never been satisfied that Australia is doing enough in this great world struggle. I do not underrate the difficulties of this war as they relate to Australia. I do nob underrate the difficulties that have to be encountered in the initiation of a war machine. them. I have been up against them myself, and I know what they mean; but, taken by and large, I should like to see Australia doing very much more than she is doing at present to bring this war to a successful termination. Nothing has gratified me more than this appeal, which has come from the Imperial Government for men without munitions. I think the sooner that appeal is sounded like a tocsin through tlie length and breadth of Australia, the sooner shall we see a great fillip given to the recruiting movement here, and the sooner will our troops be ""wending their way over tbe seas to fight for the liberty and freedom of our fair land. -T should like to say a word with regard to the way in which the Estimates are presented to us. They are not in the -shape that we expected to see them, and 1 they are not in the shape in. which, I think, tliey were promised to us. The expenditure on account of current account, and the expenditureon account of war, is all lumped together, though I have no' doubt that in the Departments of theTreasury and' Defence, an account is kept of a l l expenditure on account of war. Sir JOHN FORREST I regret that the Estimates were not presented in this way. I know there is some difficulty in doing it , but the difficulty is no greater than is experienced in every State of the Commonwealth in regard to loan accounts and loan moneys. £300,000,000 of loan money has been expended in Australia on public works, and the accounts have always been submitted separately. We had the loan Estimates submitted to us in the same way as current Estimates on departmental accounts, and I had hoped that the same course would have been followed in regard to this disastrous war. I admit that there is some difficulty. Ajs all our expenditure on account of war is derived from loan, I had hoped that course would have been followed when dealing with tliis great war expenditure. Asi t is, we are in thedark, except in so far as we w ill be able to get returns, byand-by, of the expenditure; and I think the right honourable gentleman promised to give us these returns. I know kept. when we are asked for money in regard to expenditure from loan on account of war, it is mixed u p with expenditure on current account. separately. is that we expected, and I understood, thab these Estimates would be submitted in th© same way as were the Estimates for the £300,000,000 of loan money in the Sbabes. [6.0] -My righ t honourable friend does well to point out that we have no separation of the accounts as they are presented to Parliament. There is no doubt that we were promised a separate Budget for the Expeditionary Forces and a separate Budgetf o r the Defenos expenditure. These thingsmay be kept separately in the accounts at the Treasury, but that does not help us here. For instance, who knows how much of this £100,000 for amimunition, this £17,000 for general contingencies, and how much of this £56,200 for the camps is part of the Expeditionary Forces: expenditure, which ought to appear as such in the statement?

181,Mr Joseph Cook (Parramatta),"know whether that covers the Expeditionary Forces expenditure in its entirety or not. Sir what items it covers. think that the right honourable the Prime Minister ought to submit a separata Expeditionary Forces Budget, covering all the details of the Forces, and keeping it separate and distinct from the ordinary administrative expenditure of the Department. So far as I am concerned, my attitude is this: There never was a greater need for economy on the administrative side of the Department, and never a greater need for lavish expenditure on the Expeditionary and war side of the Department.' We can still have economy and efficiency, and by exercising economy with efficiency in the ordinary administrative expenditure we will make available more money for the purposes of war over the seas. The first thing to do, I submit, is to itemize this vote for the Expeditionary Forces. mitted in a different schedule, if necessary, or as an explanatory paper. I do not care how it is done. right honourable gentleman promise to bring clown a paper? the Budget at the first opportunity. We have been keeping the accounts separately, but the details could not be put into this SupplyB ill . right honourable gentleman could give us a paper showing what this £5,000,000 is for. ister and Treasurer) [ 6 . 4 ] I am quite in agreement with the statements made by the Leader of the Opposition and the right honourable member for Swan. The Defence Department have been instructed to keep separate, distinct, and detailed accounts of the war expenditure, apart altogether from the ordinary Defence expenditure, which would be equivalent, to current expenditure in the absence of war. Department at this time-it would not have been fair, even if I had thought it wise-to make out a different schedule in the meantime for the actual expenditure up to date. This can be done at the end of the financial year, when the books are being closed, and as early in the new year as possible it will be my duty, as it will be my object and aim, if I cannot make a JOHN FORREST -We do not know f u l l financial statement, to make an in terim statement showing the conditions of I do the Loan Vote and dealing with Defence expenditure. I shall place that before .the House, because I am entirely in accord with the views of honourable members opposite in this' matter, and feel in regard to it just as strongly as they do. There is a danger of Defence matters becoming so interlocked and interlaced as to be difficult of separation, but the accounts are being kept f a it h f u l l y at the present time. I am also in agreement with tlie point raised by the right lionorable gentleman regarding the amount of expenditure. If it becomes our duty-as it may-to expend a great deal more money in bhe defence of Australia and to help defend the Empire generally, it will be my particular business, as Treasurer to come down to Parliament The statement could be suband tell honourable members so, and also to make provision for the supply of money, which is a most important factor. If u l l y appreciate what tlie right honorI quite agree with you. able member for Parramatta has said about the war expenditure of Great Britain, and of the great resources of the Mother Country. I am sure that I am I will bring it down in not trespassing on the patience of honourable members when I say that we all congratulate the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the proposal that he has made, and the prospect of getting such an enormous sum of money, running into over £500,000,000 or £600,000,000, with a prospect of going up to £900,000,000 or £1,000,000,000. As honourable members are aware, we were granted a loan of £18,000,000 by the British Government for war purposes, and we have under promise an additional £6,500,000 to cover our expenses up to the end of the financial year. Asf a r as can be seen at present, no serious financial difficulty w ill arise during the present calendar year; but that is subject to contingencies, and to the determination of the people-to pledge their credit to a greater extent But I am not asking the Defence than at present. Unfortunately, in Australia, though we are comparatively strong financially, we have not been in a position to draw on our own credit to assist the Mother Countryi n the war.

I join heart and soul w i th the right honourable gentleman opposite in saying that it is incumbent, in the first place, upon all those who are physically fit to be trained to go to the front, to do so, and upon all those who have means, and who can supply those means to the Government to enable them to equip and transport our soldiers to the front, and so assist the Mother Country, to help in that way. We have a common duty, as a Dominion of the Mother Country, to defend the Empire, and we have an additional duty at this time of crisis, in helping to the best of our ability, by our own collective and individual efforts, financially. agree with the suggestion of the honourable member for Parramatta-which , apparently, expresses the desire and intention of the Government also-that we should contribute in men as f a r as possible, and in material also, in.as great a proportion as our present circumstances justify, towards the common defence of the Empire. road to that before the. war broke out, [155] because, when Admiral Henderson'B scheme would have come to fruition 'in I do not quite fol1930 or 1933, our contributions per head on the peace basis towards the cost of naval defence would almost have equalled the rate per head justified by the white been much beyond the Canadian rate of contribution; so that, as a matter of fact, a we had expressed then, by that arrangement, ' the desire of Australia gradually to reach the point at which we would discharge the whole of the honourable obligations which rested upon us, and which No young were expressed by the establishment of the Navy, whose usefulness is manifested in its material as well as its moral aspect, by the immunity we enjoyed through the efficiency in home waters of the British Navy. We have embarrassed ourselves in our attempts to reach the limits of our desire by our easy-going methods of the past. I remember more than once oalling attention to the possibility of a war putting a strain upon resources, that we were somewhat cavalierly disposing of in our Budgets, H o w f a r that may when the bounty of Providence had given us exceptionally good years. The United Kingdom is undoubtedly in a splendid position to meet its obligations, for many years and many reasons, of which not the least is this: that the foreign investments of the United Kingdom average from £2,500,00 0 to £3,000,000 per day. That stream from the United Kingdom to the various parts of the world, which before the war represented in interest to private persons on public and semi-public investments, apart from industries, a sum of no less than £200,000,000 per annum, has been intercepted by the war, and is now directed towards supplying the wants of the I m perial Government-the last expression speech-in war contributions. That is an enormous sum, and shows the marvellous material resources of thei United Kingdom. We hope eventually to be able to reach the goal of our common desire; but it is through the somewhat lax methods of our financing of the last twelve or fifteen years that we, w it h enormously great resources, not yet developed to their f u l l , have been unable, under the strain of the present occasion, to finance our obligations directly ourI think we were on the selves.
