39,Mr Isaacs (Indi,"Attorney-General)has so much power. Even the House of Lords and the Privy Council may find their decisions upon any point whatever reversed by an Act of the Legislature. That is not always so with us. It is so in Canada in many respects, but so far as Australia is concerned, the Supreme Court has the almost unique power of controlling, by its decisions, the efforts of the Legisother States. lature itself. That, to my mind, is a verybusiness alone that has to be transacted by important consideration. power. should be regarded as dangerous.

This question was threshed out in the Federal Conventions, and provision was made in the Constitution for the powers to be exerwork is enormous. cised by the High Court. It would be of no use to apportion jurisdiction to the Commonwealth and the States respectively unless the Constitution provided for such control and would insure that the respective Legislatures would operate only within their own ambits. As I ha.ve said, the High Court was organized nearly three years ago, and honourable members will find in the report of Mr Castle, Principal Registrar, the ioth July-the report was brought up to the last moment prior to the tabling of the correspondencea considerable amount of information that will enable them to judge of the enormous increase of business before the Court. established on the 5th October, 1903, and from that date until the end of that year sat for twelve days, and heard two appeals and eight motions and applications. 1904 they heard thirtv-nine appeals and forty motions and applications. moment, I am passing, by the original jurisorder to dispose of the business as it comes diction of the Court. heard sixty-four appeals, and seventy-two motions and applications. During the present year they have already decided no fewer than forty-two appeals, and a very large number of motions. The number of appeals which they have dealt with during the first half of the present year is nearly as large as the total number dealt with last year, and the cases now awaiting attention will be more than sufficient to keep the Court employed for the greater part of the remaining portion of this year. In addition to that, even since the correspondence was printed, a number of other appeals have reached the position of just being entered for hearing in the High Court. To my own knowledge, certain cases are coming forward from the State tribunals in South Australia and Victoria, and I presume that the same thing is happening with regard to The amount of appellate the H i gh Court is, to my mind, sufficient to justify a measure such as this. It must be within the observation of honourable members, as it is certainly within the observation of those who come into professional contact with their Honours, and of those ing as to the manner in which those honourable gentleman transact their business, that the strain and stress upon them in their almost continuous application to appellate Those who, like myself, have had personal opportunities of judging, know f u l l well that the magnitude and importance of the cases brought before therm and the industry and the application they bring to bear, must involve an enormous strain, on their Honours. It is well known to those who practise before them that, however strenuously arguments may have taken place during the day, their the Honours come prepared next morning in a which is dated manner that shows that they have been working overnight in dealing with many' difficult problems. strain upon the Justices in connection with the appellate jurisdiction be lessened The Court was if their number were increased to five ? tices, were increased, an interchange might take place which would perhaps enable In judgments to be considered, and there would not be that intense strain which now For the has to be undergone by their Honours-, in In 1905 the Court along. think that with a larger Bench there would be more conflict of opinion, and, therefore, more strain. answer the honourable meniber in the words of the learned Chief Justice, who, in his letter gives many reasons from the public stand-point, why the Court reauires to be strengthened. In paragraphs 6 and 7, he says6. The appellate business of the Court is of a very onerous and responsible character. In the",16,Judiciary Bill Second Reading

45,Mr Isaacs,"No. I think I 'can bestlarge majority of cases, it is expedient, if not necessary, to reserve judgment. continuous pressure of work leaves us very little time for research, and for the preparation of written or even oral judgments. think it desirable that a Court of final appeal should work at such constantly high pressure, from which, however, there is no prospect of escape so long as the number, of Justices is limited to three. 7. Apart, therefore, from the question of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, we are of opinion that-if suitors desiring to have recourse to the original jurisdiction of the Court are to have a fair opportunity of doing so, and if the imminent risk of dislocation of the appellate work of the Court is to be provided for-it is absolutely necessary that some addition should be made to the number of the Bench. We think, further, that it is very improbable that Mr Justice O'Connor will be free at any time during the present year to discharge his functions as President of the Arbitration Court. In a previous portion of his letter His Honour the 'Chief Justice says that a sitting of the Full Court was appointed to be held at Adelaide on 21st inst. dated 8th May. His Honour pointed out that that business had been withdrawn, and that but for this accident the Court would certainly not have been able to dispose of the business still remaining to be heard in Sydney before leaving for Melbourne for the sittings of the F u ll Court appointed for the 28th May. He added, "" In the actual state of affairs, it is possible that we may do so."" Court to have business left over-that is constantly happening. H i g h Court to overtake arrears of business. In other Courts, the Judges may interchange, and the business may be brought up to date in that way, but the Justices of the High Court are continuously on the move from one State to another dealing with cases as they come along, and if once their business falls into arrear it is difficult for them to pick it up again. His Honour the Chief Justice pointed out that it was doubtful whether the Court would be able to dispose of the business still remaining to be heard in Sydney before leaving for Melbourne for the sittings of the F u ll Court on the 28th May. As a matter of fact, the Court had to allow some business to stand over in Sydney and come on to Melbourne, and so strenuous were their efforts to finish the business in Melbourne in order to enable them to get back to Sydney that in one case, of which I have a vivid recollection, arguments on a very important point had to be suppressed, and The present the cases merely handed in to their Honours. of the number of days upon which the Court sits during the year? formation could be completed. The appeal business of the Court is constantly growing. There is no doubt that the Court has so far established itself in the confidence of both the professional and the general public that its business, is increasing. I should like to point out, as a tangible reason that will appeal to honourable members from a common-sense point of view why the appellate business is likely i o increase. The High Court has power to hear appeals from the judgment of a single Judge in the States Court's. Therefore, there is no necessity, unless the parties desire it , for appealing first to the Full Court of a State, and subsequently The letter is to the H i g h Court of Australia. Now, I must say that these continuous appeals -constitute a very expensive process, and in many cases would result in the ruin of a litigant. I can best illustrate the position by citing one case which came within my own personal experience. There was a litigant who was not very wealthy, and whose widowed mother and sisters were to a large extent dependent upon him. He lived in a neighbouring State, and he was willing-in order that their rights to certain property should be asserted-to incur the expense of an action. The case, came before a single Judge of the Supreme Court of the State in question, and he was defeated. Had there been no appeal direct to the High Court-in other words, had this litigant, in case of defeat, been forced to appeal first to the Full Court of that State, he would have been able to go no further. On the contrary, assuming that he had won his case, he would have been carried further, either to the Privy Council or to the High Court, and he would not have been able to stand the expense of that litigation. Consequently, if that had been the position, he would never have appealed at all. But, having the right to appeal from the decision of a single Judge of the Supreme Court of the State direct to the High Court, he was able to bear the costs involved. He did so, and he succeeded in his action. I mention this case as a practical illustration of the reason why litigants are likely-whereve r they can",17,Judiciary Bill Second Reading
46,Mr Joseph Cook,I s it unusual for a,18,Judiciary Bill Second Reading
47,Mr Isaacs,It is very hard for the,18,Judiciary Bill Second Reading
48,We Do Not Mr Mcwilliams,I s there any record,18,Judiciary Bill Second Reading
49,Mr Isaacs,"Yes, so far as the indo -to so appeal direct to the High Court. By so doing their case is determined once and for all. There is no right of appeal subsequently to the Privy Council. The decision of the High Count is binding, or, as the Chief Justice says, ""It is a final Court of Appeal."" But whilst it is most advantageous to litigants that the number of appeals should be cut down, and that finality should be reached as early as possible, it is extremely important that the learned Justices of the High Court should not be rushed in the work which they have to perform, and that their decisions should be given after careful deliberation and full consideration. In this connection I would point out that that tribunal, occupying as it does, a position of much dignity and responsibility, has to decide questions which involve not merely the interests of individuals and of large corporations, but the welfare of the States themselves, as well as of the Commonwealth. We can easily imagine very important questions indeed coming before the High Court-questions in which the rights and powers of the States Parliaments, as well as the constiturespects. In this connection I do not wish tional powers of this Parliament, will be in dispute. importance that the Court shall not be hurried in its deliberations, but shall be afforded the fullest opportunity for considering its important decisions. As matters stand, it is absolutely impossible for it to do the work which the public demand of it. If we go a step further, we find that the Constitution Act vests the High Court beyond any power of recall, with certain original jurisdiction. original jurisdiction with which it has been invested has reference to the interpretation of the Constitution. There are several -cases at present awaiting decision by the Court, and I am told that some eleven writs in its original jurisdiction have been issued this year, of which I think two are ready for trial. present outstanding if not all, I think, we may expect sooner or later to be brought before tlie Court, that is to say, if the desire of those who have instituted the, actions, to obtain a decision from the High Court without any -serious delay, can be satisfied. I would also point out the advantage of litigants lieing able to appeal direct to the High -Court, from the stand-point of the expense involved, and the saving of time effected. Mr Isaacs. They might bring an action in the Supreme Court of a State upon a matter in which the State Court has concurrent jurisdiction, and as a result of that action they might be carried by way of appeal to the Full Court of that State, and subsequently to the High Court. In any case there would be at least two hearings, whereas if the litigation were commenced in the High Court the parties might agree to state a case for the Full Court, or the Justice who hears it might refer the matter to the Full Court, where it would be finally determined. The public appreciate this fact, and desire to avail themselves of the High Court, and it is only right that having created that tribunal it should be equipped with the numerical strength necessary to enable it to discharge the public functions for which it was called into being. I now come to another matterI do not know what to term it, because it partly involves questions of original iurisdiction-bu t it is really one of auxiliary jurisdiction. This Parliament has seen fit to invest the High Court with original jurisdiction in many to refer to the many Acts which we have It is, therefore, of the highest passed, such as the Customs Act, the Excise Act, the Post and TelegraphAct, the Property for .Public Purposes Acquisition Act, the Electoral Act, the Defence Act. the Patents Act, the Conciliation ancl Arbitration Act, and the Trade Marks Act. But I specially wish to refer to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, and I would invite the attention of honourable members to the urgent letter of His Honour Mr The only other Justice O'Connor upon this subject, dated 25th April, 1906. He saysCircumstances have arisen which make it my duty to bring under the notice of the Government the present condition of business in the Commonwealth Court of Arbitration. A dispute alleged to have arisen between the Merchant Service Guild of Australasia, Employes, and the At the Commonwealth Steam-ship Owners' Association, moment there are eleven Employers, was some months ago in proper form brought before that Court. On the 5th cases, most of which, inst. both parties came before me to fix a time and place for hearing. The hearing will necessitate an inquiry into the status, wages, daily duties, and hours of employment of the officers of the mercantile marine of Australasia in the service of the steam-ship owners of Australasia. It is clear from the statements filed by the parties, and from the facts put before me on the application, that the case involves issues of vital interest to both parties, and of vast importance to the public, and, further, that having regard to the relation of the parties, and to the nature of the dispute, it is essential that the matters in difference should be settled as soon as possible, and when once entered upon should be heard -continuously until determined. A month's continuous sittings of the Court, at least, in my opinion, would be necessary for the hearing. I have some personal knowledge of that case, having been consulted in regard to it, and I think that the honourable and learned member for West Sydney is possessed' of similar knowledge. I think that he will bear me out that a month is a very small period within which to expect that matter to be settled. To my mind it will occupy at least two months, and probably more. very quickly if it were settled within two months. will be able to deal with all the matters mentioned by His Honour. not be dealt with as matters stand at present. His Honour says. Looking through the list of the appeal sittings of the High Court for the remainder of the year, it is impossible to find even two or three days, much less a month, of the working time of the Court which is not f u l l y occupied. In practically all the appeals three Judges are required to constitute a Court. I have no hesitation in saying 'that the appeal business is much more congested I think that no stronger words than thosenow than it was when that letter was "" a denial of justice""-woul d be used.

His Honour continuesOn the hearing, therefore, of the application, not strike, and that we have warned emI find myself obliged either to take a course ployers they must not lock-out, if so far we which would suspend all the appeal business of have only nominally created a tribunal to the High Court for a month, or to postpone the settle disputes between them, it is a denial hearing of this most important dispute indefinitely.

Nobody would give to a Judge of the His Honour must have felt an enormous Supreme Court of any one State power to pressure upon him to induce him to declare what the law should be in all the communicate to the Government sponStates.

When his; Court, the whole of the three Judges would letter came to hand, the Prime Minhave to be engaged upon it. that we have been passing has been for the purpose of providing work for the High Court? took place upon the Australian Industries Preservation Bill, the opinion universallyexpressed was that complaints lodged under that measure should be investigated by a Justice of the High Court rather than by a Board. His Honour proceedsAs the alternative, in my view, less harmful 1 in the administration of justice, I adjourned the application until August, in the hope that some chance might before then leave an interval in the High Court appeal business, but I see at present no prospect whatever of such an interval. If this condition of the High Court businessarose from temporary, causes not likely to recur, the position would not be so serious. But the condition has not arisen from temporary causes. It is the result of the steady growth in the appeal business of the High Court, and all the indications are of a further increase rather than a diminution in its volume. I can say distinctly, both from my position as Attorney-General and as a member of the practising Bar, that His Honour's statement, is quite within the mark.

Then came the letter of His Honour the Chief Justice, in which he speaks on behalf of himself and all his colleagues.

In New South Wales, the summer vacation is eight weeks, and the winter vacation three weeks; in Victoria the summer vacation extends over six weeks, and, although there is no provision in the law for a winter vacation, the practice is to have a fortnight's holiday in July. In Queensland the summer vacation is eight weeks, and the winter vacation four weeks; whilst in South Australia the vacation is two months in duration, extending from 25th December to 25th February. I believe, although I am not sure on the point, that notwithstanding the absence of a rule providing for a winter vacation in South Australia, there is a practice under which the Judges can obtain some holidays in the winter. ways a holiday; a Judge has often much hard work to do. Australia the vacation is two months-ex tending from 24th December to 25th February, whilst in Tasmania the long vacation extends from the 17th December to 28th February.

The High Court, in order to limit the number of appeals, for special reasons, has laid down precisely the same rule as the Privy Council has done relative to the grounds on which special leave to appeal will be given. I should, perhaps, read the views of the learned Justices to show that they are not assuming to themselves the power to hear further appeals by granting special leave, other than under the rule laid down by the Privy Council. In the appeal case of Dalgarno v. Hannah (1 C.L.R., 8), the first case dealt with by the Court, the Chief Justice saidWith regard to the second ground, we think that the rule to be applied by the High Court in dealing with applications for special leave to appeal in cases below the appealable amount should be substantially that laid down by the Judicial Committee of -ths Privy Council, in. the case of Prince v. Gagnon. The quotation from the judgment of' the Privy Council, which the High Court applied to itself, is as follows: Their Lordships are not prepared to advise Her Majesty to exercise her prerogative by admitting an appeal to Her Majesty in Council from the Supreme Court of the Dominion, save where the case is of gravity, involving matters of public interest, or some important question of law, or affecting property of considerable amount, or where the case is otherwise of some public importance, or of a very substantial character.",21,Judiciary Bill Second Reading

The case was under the appealable amount, and the Court said that where there were mere questions of fact involved-wher e there was no important question of law involved-if the judgment appealed from was unattended with sufficient doubt to justify the granting of leave to appeal, they would refuse that leave. They also refused leave in the case of Norton v.

In three or four other cases, which I need not enumerate, they have applied the same principle.

It is hardly necessary for me to speak at length since a very explicit statement witb reference to this contract has already been made to the House by the Prime Minister,, and the agreement itself has been laid upon the table, so that honourable members no doubt are by this time fully seized of its effect. I should like to point out, however, that less than a year ago, namely, on 4th October last, it was my pleasure to move the ratification of another contract irt respect of the Same mail service. At that time there was a general review of the conditions of past contracts for the carriage of mails between the State Governments, the British Government, and various steam-ship companies, and it is, therefore, not necessary for me to go back again into what is ancient history by giving the amounts paid in each case, and showing how, step by step, conditions have been improved, by obtaining accelerated speed, If we desire that the Court larger vessels, and a better service. I wish, however, to call the attention of honourable members to the contracts which immediately preceded and led up to the making of this one. The first contract of which I shall speak is that for a weekly service, made in 1897, between the Australian States, the British Government, and the Peninsular and Oriental and Orient Steam-ship Companies. The subsidy paid under that contract was ^170,000, of which the Australian States adpaid ,£72,000 and the British Government £98,000. Under it, the maximum time for BILL. the journey of the Peninsular and Oriental steamers was 686 hours, and of the Orient steamers 696 hours, the mails being landed and embarked in Europe at Naples by the Orient Company and at Brindisi by the it is expedient' that an appropriation of Peninsular and Oriental Company.

It is difficult to ascertain the exact amount of the increase, because the contract is for the carriage of mails to the East as well as to Australia, but the period of three years, for which it has force, mav be extended to ten years, and it is provided that, if there is an extension, the British Government Bhall be entitled to a reduction of subsidy.",22,Judiciary Bill Second Reading

79,Mr Austin Chapman (Eden,"Mon-The period of three years after which the contract may or may not be extended terminates simultaneously with the period of the contract between the Commonwealth -Government and the Orient Steam-ship Company, when; in all probability, the British Government will probably try to enforce a -new set of conditions similar to those which we shall enforce under the contract which .the House is now being asked to ratify. It is hardly necessary to remind honourable members of the difficulties and troubles which were experienced by past Governments before the existing contract with the Orient Company was entered into, because, no doubt, before the debate closes, my predecessor in office will give the House a very .graphic description of his troubles and tribulations in that connection. We know what excitement there was through the -country before the matter was settled. Deputations representing various branches of commerce were constantly waiting upon Ministers, and the public were clamouring for some definite arrangement. to the matter now only because I do not wish honourable members to forget the many difficulties which crop up in the making of contracts of this kind. There must be at least two parties to every bargain, and the demands and requirements of, each party take a great deal of consideration. In this case, I think fhat all that has been asked for is fair play, reasoncism was silenced by pointing out that able treatment, and a good service for a proper payment, and I think that I shall be able to show that these requirements will be met. The subsidy now given to the Orient Company is £120,000 a year, an increase upon that paid under the contract with the Feninsular and Oriental and Orient Companies and the British Government, to which I have already referred. What brought about the existence of two separate contracts, one between the British Government and the Peninsular and Oriental Company, and the other between the Commonwealth and the Orient Company, was our legislation, endorsed by the people of this countjy, requiring that white labour only shall be employed on steamers subsidized for the carriage of Australian mails. This Government, immediately after the ratification of the contract with the Orient Company, gave that company notice of the intention to terminate it, one of the articles in the agreement being that two years' notice of the intention to terminate should be given by either party. We gave that notice early, because we thought that a better contract could be made, and wished to take time by the forelock. _ We did not desire to be again placed in a corner, finding ourselves at the last moment practically in the hands of. companies whicli, being the only ones in the trade, could dictate their own terms. in the same position again, if the ships required under this contract are not built. can show that all reasonable and business like precautions have been taken to provide against a contingency of that kind. We have ascertained that those with whom we are dealing are responsible men, whose reputation in the ship-building world is second to none. sarv companv cannot be floated? honourable member to allow me to finish my statement. When I have laid the facts I refer before the House, I shall be glad to hear his criticism. It is almost pleasing to me that some one has at length been roused to tlie expression of unfriendly criticism. When the conditions which we laid down were first made public, it was said that the Government, to placate a certain party in this House, had made provision for the purchase at anv time of the ships used in the service. That critia similar provision exists in the British contract, and io most other contracts. It was also said that we were asking for too much, and that our conditions would not be accepted by any tenderer. Mr Paxton, a representative of the Svdney Chamber of Commerce, said some time ago that no company would tender for a service under the conditions laid down. But, in a letter published in this morning's newsnapp-s. savs that the conditions obtained by the Commonwealth are too good; that we have all the best of the bargain; and that it is a cne-sided contract; although, in the next sentence, he declares that those with whom we have contracted intend sell the concession-a n absurd statement, in view of his first position. Every one of the conditions which we oritnnallv laid down has been accepted, and several others have been added, the additions being such as exist in the present contract with the Orient Steam Navigation Company, and have been sanctioned by this Parliament.

Those who complain that a ring or combination now exists for the prevention of competition should welcome the new arrangement. These who have faith in Australia will agree with me that ""there is plenty of room fer the new Australian line as well as for the Orient Steam Navigation and the Peninsular and Oriental Companies. According to the statements of the chairmen of the Peninsular and Omental and Orient Steam Navigation Companies, and a number of big nnancial institutions, a great expansion of business is expected in Australia, which means that there will be more produce, more passengers, and more mails for ocean-goine; steamers to carry. Evidentlv those who have entered into this contract think that something of that kind, is about to happen, because they have bound themselves to provide boats of heavier tonnage than those now carrying our mails, to give an accelerated speed, and to meet all the requirements of the travelling public. of business be rightlv anticipated with an Anti-Trust Act in operation, whose effect will be the stoppage of importations and the restraint of trade? orable member has fullv discussed the provisions of the Anti-Trust Pill; we are dealing now with the conditions of the proposed new mail contract. In the first place, in order that there might be the keenest competition in the tendering, we advertised our conditions in Great Britain, and copies of them were distributed all over the world. It was made known that a postal service only was asked for, the mails to be carried between Adelaide and a port in Southern Europe, with an extension of the journev of the steamers to Mr Paxton says that the an approved port in Great Britain. Parcel mails are carried by sea for the whole disY e s b u t tance between Great Britain and Australia, and therefore we require that the steamers carrying our mails shall go on to an approved port in Great Britain, in order not the Postthat, by sending our parcels by sea, we may save the heaw cost of transport I have across the Continent of Europe. to learn that it is a crime That is purelv a postal matter. We asked ship-builders in England, and for an acceleration of speed, and imposed in the shipping business in a number of other conditions, which we thought would be in the interests of the Commonwealth, and at the same time enable those who tendered to provide a good service. In anticipation of objections that our conditions were too harsh, a provision was inserted that tenderers might offer to provide a service under any conditions they liked as to route, speed, or terminal ports, subject always to the stipulation that they must man their steam-ships with white labour, and to the understanding that a preference would be given to the contractors offering to carry on the service with vessels of the highest speed. I think that honourable members and the public generally will approve of the latter condition, because extra speed means extra trade. It will bring us closer to the markets of the world, and into more intimate relations with other parts of the Empire, I have referred to the very few criticisms that were' directed to the conditions immediately after they were issued. 1 It seems to me that that was fhe time at which any objectidns should have been 1 urged. I notice that the Government have been taken to task for not having imposed any conditions with regard to the carriage of cargo. I was absent from Australia for several months, during which period this an expansion matter was handled by mv colleague, the Vice-President of the Executive Council, in conjunction with fhe Prime Minister.

89,Mr Austin Chapman,"The honditions of contract. The negotiations which were carried on reflect the greatest credit upon the Vice-President of the Executive Council, and I am .glad to say that the mail contract is' described by one of the Brisbane newspapers this morning as one of the most important executive acts since Federation was established. turned from England, I found that nearly everything in connection with the mail contract had been arranged, and the credit in connection with the transaction' is due to my honourable colleague who had charge of my Department during my absence, and I have much pleasure in paying this tribute to the ability and judgment which he has displayed.. I desire to call attention to the fact ""that when the contract with the Orient Steam Navigation Company was under discussion, the late Premier of Queensland, Mr Morgan, stated that if the contract had been made for a service terminating at Adelaide, and all the States had been placed on an equal footing, Queensland would have raised no objection. In connection with the present contract, tenders were invited in plenty of time, and as I have said, very little criticism was directed against the conditions proposed. ceived only, five tenders, and in accordance with the conditions, which provide that only the three lowest tenders shall be disclosed, particulars relating to those only have been placed before honourable members. tender was informal, and there was one other besides those regarding whicb information has been given. Honourable members will readily understand that business men who enter upon these great undertakings do not care to come into conflict with one another, and that, furthermore, no public good can be served by publishing the particulars of the tenders, except to the extent provided for in the conditions. Whilst one can understand the eagerness of honourable members to obtain particulars whilst negotiations are proceeding, matters must be dealt with upon a business footing. It is the duty of the Government to make the best possible bargain with the contractors, as it is the aim of the contractors to do the best they can for themselves. Business men who conduct important negotiations such as those which have just been concluded, would laugh at the idea of placing the other side in possession of valuable information. I join my honourable colleagues, the Vice-President of the Executive Council and' the Prime Minister, in saying that, in "" the [ST] course of negotiations, we were met by the representative of the contractors in the most liberal spirit. He was anxious to secure a good contract, but always remembered that there were two parties to the bargain, and that what was required was -an efficient service at a reasonable cost. I When I retake it that we all recognise that the introduction of a third shipping combination, into the Australian trade will tend to the advantage of the community, by bringing about more competition, and, probably, a reduction in rates.' I believe, moreover, that the contractors will not only have a strong commercial backing, but also strong support from the public. It seems to me thab it is a good thing for us to have a line of steamers, manned by white men, with the Australian flag flying at the masthead. The new line of steamers will be, I believe, partially owned in Australia, and I think that we should give the contractors ""every assistance reasonable in carrying out their undertaking., steamers be registered ? We report in the Commonwealth. That should be sufficient for the honourable member, because I do not think that it is desirable to introduce any provincial feeling into the matter. It will be seen that, beyond the One advertised conditions, the agreement contains three paragraphs, 14, 15, and 16. These are practicallv identical with clauses 32, 34, and 35 of the agreement with the Orient Company, and, consequently, have already received the approval of this Parliament. Clause 1.4 provides that the Government will use their good offices with 1 the States Governments to secure to the mail contractors facilities equal to those granted to other ship-owners. No one can take exception to that. Clause 15 refers to fresh legislation. Clause 16 contains the usual provision as to what may take place in the event of a declaration of war. The contract provides that we shall have complete control over the carriage of all mails, and that all the postage received in regard to letters shall belong to us. No mails can be put on board at any port without the approval of the Postmaster General. The contract is for a term of ten years. The alternative period mentioned in the conditions of tender was seven years. It has been complained in the past that, owing to the short period for which the contracts were entered into, i i would not pay any new combination to construct ships",25,Bounties

A subsidy of £ 1 2 5 , 0 0 0 is provided for a 636 hours' service, and the'contractors are entitled to extra remuneration to cover the cost of an acceleration of speed to the extent of twenty-four hours upon the trip one way; but the total sum payable to them is not to exceed £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 per' annum over and above the contract price. the contract that would enable the Government to demand an accelerated service. tract will give us power to demand an acceleration of speed. seem to me to be clear upon that point. the short time at the disposal of the contractors, the contract provides that they shall not be required during the first six months to conduct the service with the ships that are to be built according to the conditions of contract. provide vessels that will carry the mails within the specified time. will be found that the contract is very clear upon that point. up under the advice of two of the ablest lawyers in Australia, namely, Mr Croker and the Commonwealth Crown Solicitor. It is provided that the steamers shall each have a registered tonnage of at least 11,000 tons. I think it is most desirable from the stand-point of the Commonwealth that we should have trading to Australia ships of a better class ihan those now coming here. The new vessels will be able to accomplish the voyage in quicker time than the present mail steamers; they will provide three times the refrigerated space that is' now available, and they will afford additional inducements to travellers. The contractors recognise that they will be coming into competition with powerful companies who are now engaged in. the Australian trade, and that they must be thoroughly up-to-date if they are to enjoy a fair share of that trade. They feel that if they can offer the public something better in the way of accommodation* than they have hitherto been receiving they will be .considerably assisted in carrying out their undertaking. I would Provision is made point out in this connection that the average tonnage of the eight Orient steamers engaged in the present service is under 7,000. The average tonnage of the ten vessels comprising the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company's fleet is less than 8,700 tons. In addition to the ships being of 11,000 tons register the contract provides that the plans for their construction shall be submitted to the Government. That is a most desirable state of things from our stand-point, and it will also be of assistance to the contractors, because, when once we have entered into this undertaking, which provides for the payment of a sum considerably in excess of . £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 , the Government, and succeeding Governments, will naturally feel that the interests of the new contractors are, to a very great extent, their interests. If the contractors prosper it will be an indication of the prosperity of Australia, and there is no doubt that every reasonable assistance will be accorded to them, not only by the Government of the day, but by the Parliament and people of the Commonwealth. In this matter, as in others of much smaller magnitude, the success of one naturally hinges upon the other. I have very little doubt They must, however, that everything will run smoothly, and that the service will prove of very great benefit I think that it to the people of the Commonwealth. As regards the question of a further acceleraI t has been drawn tion of speed, I have already pointed out that, at the end of five years, if any other line of mail steamers trading to Australia is completing the voyage in less than 612 hours, arrangements can be made for the vessels carrving the Commonwealth mails to provide an equally expeditious service. I have also pointed out that the port of registry must be „ within Australia. That seems very little to say, but what does it mean ? will not say which is to be the port of registry. control that matter; but I hope it will be Twofold Bay, the Federal Capital port. After a l l , it does not matter very much in which capital the vessels are registered.

What does the accelerated speed under the new agreement mean ? It means that we shall obtain a regular service of 636 hours, or twenty-six hours less than the service at present provided by the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company. When we secure a 612 hours service, it will be fifty hours less than the mail service prothe acceptance of the proposed 'contract will' vided by that company. tain a 612 hours service under the proposed contract. posed to agree with those who assure me that we can. What does that mean in comparison with the present 'Contract, which some people would evidently like to see extended? It means a difference of sixty hours. Is there no advantage to be derived from a service which is sixty hours less than that provided at present? But, as a matter of fact, we shall secure a service which is eighty-four hours less. This accelerated speed will mean that correspondence received by an, incoming mail can be replied to from Sydney, in the case of the 636 hours service, by the same vessel; while, if we secure a 612 hours service, it thorities will recognise that our request iswill permit of answers being forwarded all the way from Brisbane. ' In my opinion, that is a very decided advantage, andi one that is worth paying for. Some honourable members appear to think that theprovisions of the contract are not sufficiently stringent. NeedI point out that the penalties provided are very drastic indeed? Under the existing contract, if a. mail steamer is twenty-four hours late, thepenalty imposed is £100. If a vessel istwenty-three hours late, no fine can beinflicted. But, under the new contract, the penalty provided is £ 5 for every hour that a vessel may be late in delivering itsservice will mean that residents of all thecapitals will be able to answer letters by return post, and to catch the outgoing mail. That will be of very great advantage. rated service ? under the 636 hours service, the residentsof Sydney will be able to reply to their correspondence by the outgoing mail. Probably, business people even in Brisbane will' be able to forward replies by the outgoing steamer, because the first term of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam NavigationCompany's -contract will expire about the same time as the current contract with theOrient Steam Navigation Company, and, naturally, the 'British Government will ask the former company to provide a serviceequal to the new service of the Commonwealth. With a little pressure, doubtlessthe Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company will be able to do that. If expedite the transit of British mails, it will' prove a decided gain to the entire community. There is no need for me to say very much more in regard to this contract. I should like to add that the Government expect to secure an accelerated train servicein connection, with, it.

A liberal spirit was exhibited on both sides. Mr Croker endeavoured to meet us in a reasonable way, and did all that he possibly could to bring about the early acceptance of the contract.

I am glad to see that the honourable member, together with his right honourable leader, has adopted the view of the Government that it is necessary ' to establish great industries in Australia, and that, whilst we ought not to aim at the impossible, anything that is reasonable and proper for the encouragement of great industries should have our support. honourable member's leader stated in Queensland that he would help to establish such industries, and nothing would give me greater pleasure than to see oun big mail steamers constructed at Mort's Dock. would point out that there is plenty of room for three great lines of steamers in the service between Australia and Great Britain. I ' have nothing to say against either of the other two. We hope that they will remain in the service. Competition is the life of trade, and competition between the three lines would be highly beneficial to Australia. This contract, although not very pleasing to some who cannot 'view these matters except from a party stand-point, is viewed with satisfaction by the Government. They took a risk in giving notice of their intention to cancel the present agreement, and when they did so all sorts of gloomy forebodings were indulged in. The acceptance of the contract by a firm of undoubted strength is highlv gratifying. It is to be hoped that every contract that is let will meet with no sharper criticism than has been levelled at that now under consideration. What have the opponents of the contract said? They have simply declared that it is a very fine one, and that they cannot understand how the contractors are I have already going to carry it out. I would point out, however, that the Orient Company have succeeded in carrying out a similar contract with a smaller subsidy, although in that case they had not to provide such fast or such large steamers as will be required under the one which this House is now asked to ratify. We know very, well fhat the larger the steamers the greater the trade and the consequent returns. That being so, it is difficult to understand the criticism which has ibeen levelled at the contract unless some of it has come from an interested source, and is designed to throw an obstacle in the way of the acceptance of this agreement. I s the honourable member ship-builders. I shall the sort of people with whom we desire to make contracts. We need to enter into agreements with men who can not only supply us with the stipulated service, but are capable of providing an increased service when it is required. Once these great ship-building firms start to build steamers for the Australian trade, it is to be hoped that the number of vessels which they put on the service will steadily increase. TheI t is pleasing to hear that the question before us is one in which every class is interested. It is a matter that affects every one, and should appeal to all of us, not from a party, but from ^ national, stand-point. I take it that there I will be no opposition to the ratification of fhe contract, although, naturally, some criticism will be offered j but before we talk of refusing to ratify it we should ask our-, selves what the alternative is. What should we have in front of us if we refused to ratify the agreement? Let us recall our position when we were practically at the mercy of the ship-owners. Having regard to all the circumstances, I commend this motion to honourable members, believing that the contract is an excellent one, that it will result in great good to the people, and' that it is one of which we may well be proud. Although the contractors are ship-builders carrying on business in Great Britain they are of our own kith and kin, and I hope that this large expenditure on an Australian service will be but the beginning of many Australian lines.

As I have said, six out of the eight members of the Shipping Service Commission reported in favour of a State owned service. has been hurled against that report, and particularly against paragraphs 4 and 5, which deal with the estimated income and expenditure of a national line. One of the metropolitan papers has declared that the figures therein given have been so riddled that it would be the height of folly to make any attempt to carry out the proposition. In ' the Commission's report £ 9 0 , 0 00 per annum is allowed for interest, £ 7 6 0 , 0 0 0 per annum as the cost of the round trips. .£:i 50,000 for insurance, £ 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 for de preciation and sinking fund, £57*000 for managerial expenses, calculated at i \ per -cent, on the £ 7 6 0 , 0 0 0 before referred to. making the total expenses £1,207,000. It is estimated that the income from passenger traffic would be £ 7 0 1 , 9 0 0 , while subsidies for mails, &C-, would come to ,£150,000, and the freight on State imports would return £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 , and ordinary freights ^£368,000, making a total of £1,319,900, and giving a surplus over expenses of .£112,90(5. In a criticism of our recommendations published in the Age newspaper, it is stated that ""we fondly gave a mass of figures which we considered unchallengeable, and to incontestably prove oUr case;"" but we expressly state in the report that we had no definite and reliable figures upon which to base an estimate, though it might be taken for granted that private companies would not send vessels to Australia unless by doing so they hoped to make profits. We were of opinion that the shipping companies which have done business with Australia in the past, and are still trading here, have not acted as philanthropists. They d'o not send their vessels here to render a splendid service to this country. Their object is to make a profit. Two companies-the Peninsular and Oriental and Orient Steam Navigation Companies-hav e been carrying mails between Australia and Great Britain for more than twenty years. Of these companies, it is stated authoritatively that the last-named has not found its business profitable. Mr KennethI shall be Anderson told us that, in some years the company made a profit, while in others it did not, there being a loss on its operations in the aggregate. Of course, that statement must be accepted as correct, though why the operations of the companv have not paid is a question which I cannot answer. Its steamers may not have been sufficiently large, its capital may have been too small, or there may have been A great deal of criticism other reasons. The Peninsular and Oriental Company, on the other hand, has been highly prosperous, and, for a great number of years, has done exceedingly well. There are some who say tliat it makes its profits, not on its Australian trade, which is unprofitable, but on its trade wjth India and China, though I venture to think that it must be assumed that the Australian trade is not unprofitable, because a company would rather make larger profits on a smaller tonnage than smaller profits on a larger tonnage. It mav, however, be accepted as an axiom as true as the assertion that the whole is greater than its part, thar the mail companies doing business with Australia either have made, or are making, or hope to make, profits. If the business of the mail companies had been wholly unprofitable, there would long ago have been a big cry for the Government to undertake this service. If there were no profit in the operations of mail companies, every Chamber of Commerce in Australia would have affirmed that the services which they perform should be undertaken, not by private enterprise, but by the Government, and the ladies of the National Association would have been ready to admit that, even if the performance of these services were left to the Government, there would be no interference with the sanctity of the marriage tie, and no undermining of the great cardinal principles of Christianity. The fact that the Government has not been asfked' to carry on these services is evidence that they pay. The Age newspaper is. a strong advocate of the establishment of an Australian Navy, of which I , too, am in favour; but that is because there is no profit in keeping up a naval force. themselves costly structures. filled with delicate mechanism requiring expert care and attention, and are practically obsolete almost before they are launched. But, according to the Age, the establishment of an Australian Navy would be patriotism. That is because there is no profit to be obtained from such .a.n undertaking. But directly it is proposed that the Government shall undertake a service which would yield a profit, that is lunacy. entirely apart the figures which we have given, we claim that facts show that private enterprise does pay, though the assertion that the Government can do the work as well as it is now done is quite another matter, with which I shall endeavour to deal later on. For the moment, it is sufficient to contend that the mail companies find their business profitable, and, in tal Steam Navigation Company and had cost all probability, will continue to do so. Nearly all the metropolitan newspapers of Australia have paid the Commission the compliment of criticising, the figures which we have submitted., and, of course, we cannot object to fair criticism. It would occupy too much time to deal one by one with the statements which have appeared in these newspapers, and, therefore, I shall content myself with pointing out that, while they all agree that our estimate of income is an inflated one, and our estimate of ..expenditure altogether too low, they differ en tirely among themselves in matters of detail. I shall, however, refer more particularly to an article which appeared in the leading columns of the Age, since that is a protectionist newspaper, which is supporting the Government, and, therefore, argues strongly against the proposed establishment of a national fleet, and for the acceptance of the Government proposal. In this newspaper a statement appeared, oh the authority of Mr O. Gordon Wesche, the acting superintendent in Australia of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, to the effect that the estimate of £3,000,000 which we had set down as the probable cost of the eight steam-ships necessary for the service which we propose, is not large enough, because five steamers of the Mongolia and Macedonia type cost £2,500,000. I had first .intended to ask him if he had been correctly reported, because mista.kes sometimes occur, and I thought that he probably meant £1.500,000. I did not do so, but no contradiction of the statement has appeared, and it is accepted' and ouoted in the leading article of Mr Thomas. Men of war are in the Age to which I have referred. dn They are the 8th December, 1904, however, in a newspaper called Fairtlay. whir-h is, I believe, one of the leading shipping journals of England, the annual balance-sheet of the. Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Companv appears, and Sir Thomas Sutherland, the chairman of the company, Vvhoroustbe taken to know something about its operations, is reported to have said that the Macedonia, the Marmora, the Mongolia, Putting and the Moldavia-al l four of which are of the type referred to by Mr O. Gordon Wesche-togethe r with the Pera, the Palma, and the Palmyra, three steamers which are not mail boats, but average 7,500 tons each, cost £1,681,954 9s. 9d. If the three 7,000 tons vessels which I have named had been given to the Peninsular and Oriennothing at all, the Mooltan, which is the fifth vessel of the class referred to by Mr 0. Gordon Wesche, would have had to cost £818,045 ios. 3d. to make up his estimate of £2,500.000 as the cost of the. five. On the other hand, if the three vessels of the Pera class had cost £150,000 each, the Mooltan would have had to cost £1,268,045 to make up his estimate, and the other four of the same class £308,000 each. The writer in the Age newspaper, dealing with our figures, puts the cost of the boats that would be required at £400,000, thoujfh, as he accepted the statement of Mr O. Gordon Wesche, he should have put it down at £500,000 each. I do not know why'he made a reduction of £100,000 for each vessel, unless it was because he wished to let the Commission down as lightlv as possible. If that was his intention, I think that he failed to perform a public duty. He also says that at least ten vessels would be required. We recommend a fleet of eight vessels; but he says that, in addition, there should be a reserve vessel at each end, to be used in the emergency of the foundering, wrecking, or temporary withdrawal, through any cause, of any of the eight. Estimating the cost of the vessels employed at £400,000 each, it would mean the keeping of £800,000 of capital idle to carry out that suggestion. I should like to know if any private company would be foolish enbugh, stupid enough, or mad enough, to transact its business in that way. If eight-vessels could perform the service, would a private company keep two other vessels lying idle merely to meet emergencies ? contract provide for such an arrangement? propose to provide nine boats at the outset. not.

We asked whether it would be of any advantage to have eight steamers built by one firm of ship-builders, but Mr Coghlan strongly urged that we should not place an order for more than two steamers with one builder. He informed us that, in the event of our ordering two steamers from the one contractor, we might rely upon a reduction of from 1 to 2 per cent, in the cost. That would represent a saving upon each steamer °f £7;°°o, winch would be ample to provide all the pantry furnishings and cutlery required. That would leave £20,000 for the substitution of turbine engines for quoted by Mr Coghlan show that we have not greatly underestimated the cost of the steamers required. Mr between the various ports of the CommonCoghlan may make mistakes, but I think that every honourable member will admit that he takes the greatest possible pains to obtain ""accurate information. states that steamers such as he describes would be capable of conveying 350 first class, 170 second-class, and 500 third-class passengers. The Commission do not indicate in their report that this would be the best class of steamer to employ. Evidence was given by Mr T. A. Saunders, of Perth, which appeared to commend itself .to some members of the Commission. He suggested that accommodation should be provided for a large number of passengers of the one class, upon much the same lines that the White Star steamers carry passengers. He stated that the White Star line had created a traffic for itself. If we Mr Thomas. When I went to were able to fill steamers such as Mr Coghlan indicates with passengers for only five months in the year, and carried no passengers whatever during the remaining, seven months we should, I think, do very 'well. Of course, we might not be able to make full use of our passenger accommodation for even five months, but we might rely upon securing the whole of the passengertraffic now carried by the Orient Steam Navigation Company, which would have to retire from the passenger tradewhen the mail subsidy was withdrawn. We might reasonably expect also to securesome of the passengers who now travel by the Peninsular and Oriental Company'ssteamers. Then, again, we may reasonably assume that all Government offieach. He mentioned that, in cials, from the highest to the lowest,, when travelling on business, would proceed by the national steam navigation line.. At present, when a Government official requires to pay a visit to England, sufficient money is given to him to defray the cost of his passage, and he is free totravel by any steamer that he chooses. Otherwise, we should simply be feeding one private company' as against another. But if we had an Australian line of steamers in the fullest sense of the word, I ' venture to say that all State officials travelling 'between' here and England-ir respective of whether they were going; home upon private or Government business-woul d travel by those vessels. Public sentiment would induce them to do reciprocal' ones. * The figures that. I now come to our coastal trade. As honourable members are aware, there is a considerable amount of passenger trafficwealth. All this traffic would be throwrv in to make up the five months' full passenger trade. The Commission have set He down £150,000 by way of subsidy. At the present time the Postal Department is= paying a subsidy of £120,000, and infuture it proposes to pay £125,000. TheQueensland Government makes . up thedifference between that amount and the present mail steamer subsidy of £150,000.. If the Queensland Government is prepared to subsidize a private company, surelv it should be willing togrant equal assistance to a national* line of steamers !

140,Mr Thomas,"The mail steamersEven when the Tariff discussion was in progress, we frequently saw free-traders and protectionists alike quoting from the same volume of Coghlan in support of their rival contentions. But the question is, "" Can a line of mail steamers be made to pay?"" should run a line of their own; but if it cannot, we have no right to become mendicants by asking a private company to undertake the work of carrying our mails for less than cost price. It has been said that the Government cannot run any concern as economically as can a private company. In this connection, I may mention that the Commission, examined the Chief Railways Commissioner of every State except that of New South Wales, where Mr Harper represented the Railways Commissioners. None of these gentlemen can be called Socialists, and every one of them is opposed to the idea of establishing a national line of steamers. But when we asked them whether the work at present being done by fhe railways could be performed more economically and expeditiously by private enterprise they said that it, oould not. expect to receive any other answer from them ? orable member's dictum, the evidence given in the opposite direction must also have been biased. Mr Tait, the Chief Railways Commissioner in Victoria, has, during most of his life, been associated with privately owned lines. He has been vigorously attacked at various times by members of the Labour Party, and that fact would not predispose him to labour ideals. Yet he saysMy experience, liaving been engaged on what might be called a privately-owned railway for over twenty years, and for the last three years on a State-owned railway, is that the public receive f u l l y as good, if not better accommodation and service, liaving regard to the circumstances, from a State-owned railwav as they would receive from a privately-owned railway in similar circumstances. I should like to add that my experience here leads me to think that there is no need of competition in the Australian States, at least to keep the railway management and the railway staff of State-owned railways up to the mark, for we have the critic with us always, and in every part of the country. It has been said that there is no elasticity in the method of determining the freights to be charged upon ocean-going steamers, and that that constituted a great trouble. I confess that when I assumed the position of chairman of the Select Committee upon ShippingI thought that, probably, there might be too much red-tapeism and notsufficient flexibility in the method of determining freights, and that these factorsmight militate against the idea of a StateI f it can, the Government owned line of steamers. I am very pleased to say that without exception, so far as I can remember, the members of the Chambers of Commerce whom we examined, altiiougn opposed to a State-owned service,took the view that non-elasticity of freights between England and Australia, as the result of the Shipping Conference, was a good thing. Mr Keep, who is a prominent merchant carrying on business in Melbourne, was examined by us, and, although strongly opposed to a State-owned service, said, when dealing with the Shipping Conference, and the elasticity of freights,, thatIt is an advantage to the importer to havefreights stable, so that he may know exactly what his goods will cost him before he orders them, and also that he may know that he is paying the same rates of freights as are charged to his competitors. That was practically the evidence of a l i D i d the honourable member the members of Chambers of Commerce ex'amined by us. It must be recognised,, therefore, that inflexibility of freights,, whilst not being disadvantageous to the Government, would be highly advantageous: to the commercial community. Some people object to the rigidity of our railwav freights, but if the Railways Commissioners, were able to vary them according to their own sweet will, there would be a hue and' cry throughout the country. the curse of the American rebate system. ture of the present contract affords mesatisfaction, and that is that, so far as the Post and Telegraph Department is concerned, it provides only for a postal service. I have urged on more than one occasionthat the service paid for by that Department should be a postal one pure and' simple. But I have also urged in this House that it is not sufficient for the Government to arrange merelv for such a service^-that whilst the Post and Telegraph Department should not be debited with the cost of anything more than the carriage of mails, the National Go'vdrnmerilt should make arrangements for something more than a postal service.

One feadoing this at the present time. vernments of Germany, France, Norway, the Argentine, Japan, and even the United States, are now entering into contracts with shipping companies to provide for something more than the carriage of mails. Not long ago, a Select Committee of the House of Cosimons presented a report dealing with the matter, in which it saidThat the subsidies given by foreign Governments lo selected lines or owners tend to restrict legitimate desire of the protectionists of free competition, and to facilitate the establishAustralia that we should be able to supply ment of federation and shipping rings, and, therefore, that no subsidy sliould be granted without Government control over maximum rales of freight, and over this combination of subsidized wilh unsubsidized owners to restrict competition. The time has come when the National Government of Australia should deal with this question. It was once said by a great statesman in the House of Lords, that the key of India was in London, and I venture to say that if Australia is to make, in the next decade, the progress that it nas done in the past, it will be necessary for us, not merely to be able to supply our own requirements, but to be in a position to hold our own in the markets of London. are concerned, it is not sufficient that we should be able to satisfy the requirements of the few people scattered over this great Continent; we must be in a position to supply at least some of the needs of the struggling masses in the congested parts of the old country. In order that that may be done, freights must be regulated, 'not by a. board of directors in England, but by a member of the Government. We have in power, I believe, a Protectionist Ministry. It has been proclaimed as such from the house-tops, and I understand that one of the objects of protection is to do away with all imports. The desire of the protectionists is that everything that can reasonably be made in Australia shall be made here. I take it that there can be no objection to their contention that if it be possible everything necessary to satisfv local wants should be produced in Australia. whether or not_that is economically possible or whether f t is a sound proposition, but policy of the Government and of the great protectionist party. when the present Minister of Trade and Customs was Premier of New South Wales, he attended a banquet given by a steamship company conducting a service between The GoSydney and Vancouver, to celebrate, if I remember rightly, the placing of a new steamer on the line. The honourable gentleman, speaking on that occasion, wished the company all success, saying, "" I hope that you will have this boat going f u l l of produce to Canada, but returning empty."" I trust that I have not misquoted the honourable gentleman, but I understand that the words I have attributed to him express the all our needs. cost! that phase of the question; 1 am simply pointing out that the desire that we shall produce everything that we need is a laudable one, although I cannot say whether or not it is economically possible of fulfilment. The point is that if that is the object of the protectionist party it must result in freights to England being increased, since there would be no back-load ing. If these steamers hadl to return empty from England the freights to the old world would be double ,what they would otherwise be. If So far as perishable products the Government were able to bring about such a happy state of affairs as the production in Australia of all that is required to satisfy our wants, they should be in a posi tion to say to the producers: "" It is immaterial whether as the result of our legislation there is no back loading. We shall take care that you are not penalized by having to pay more than, you would otherwise do."" Unless they were able to take this stand the advantages of their policy would be minimized. There is one question to which I should like an answer, and that is as to whether or not the company with whom the contract has. been made is to be a member of the Shipping Conference in England. If it is not to be a member of that conference, then heaven help it it will needl all the assistance that a kind Providence can give it to save it from. ruin. On the other hand, if it is to be a member I cannot say of the conference the position will be rather serious, so far as the people of Australia are concerned. It is) necessary -that we I assume that ft is the should have some information on this question. I am not opposed per se to the Some years ago.

146,Mr Thomas,"I am not dealing withparticular objection to an employer enjoying the right to join a union whatever may be the name by which it is called; but some of the features of the Shipping Conference in England are certainly inapplicable to a trade union. In the first place it would be interesting to learn whether they keep open their books. House as to preference to unionists, and the closing of the books of unions. I have been a trade unionist for years, and am a strong believer in unions, but I hold that as soon as unionists declare that they will work only -beside trade unionists, they must throw open their books, so that a worker who wishes to join their union will be able to do so. I have expressed! this opinion before, and will do so again. The same remark will apply to the Shipping Conference. Mr Kenneth Anderson, when before fhe Commission, was asked by the honourable member for Kennedy whether any company, by subscribing to the articles of association, could join the conference, and his reply was that it depended upon the financial backing of the company. acting superintendent in Queensland of the 1 Australian United Steam Navigation Company, was asked by the honourable member whether any company other than the Australian United Steam Navigation Company. Howard, Smith, and Company, and the Adelaide Steam-ship Company, trading on ihe coast, could join the conference on subscribing to the articles of association. The reply was, "" Oh, no; we can do all the work ourselves."" terrogated on the same subject, said that it was not a fair thing that, after all the pioneering work in connection with the establishment of a shipping service had been completed, other companies or firms should be able to step in. and reap the benefit. As a trade unionist, I am prepared to grant the employer the sameright that I ask for the employee; but if trade unionists declared that their'books were to be clpsed, what a howl of indignation there would be. The honourable T. C. Beirne, a member of the Legislative Council of Queensland, informed us that, although he had loyally abided by the Shipping Conference-that, although through his broker he had caused all his goods to be sent out in vessels owned by members of the Conference-he was threatened with the loss of his deferred 1 rebates', because his London broker had sent goods to a person in South Africa by a vessel which was outside the compact. What would the editors of the Australian daily Mr Thomas. newspapers say if trade unionists took upon themselves the responsibility of saying that, although an employer here had done everything they desired, he ought to be penalized because of the action of an employer in South Africa? I think they would be writing their articles Much has been said in this in the deepest gall. Another arrangement of the Conference is that a profit shall be paid, not only on the ships that are working, but also on the ships which are idle, that is, on the whole of the capital of the companies interested. If , in Australia, the trade unions were to ask that, not only shall the men who are working be paid, but that also the men who are not working shall be paid, what would the ladies of the National League say? A company subsidized by the amount by which the proposed company is to be subsidized should not join the shipping ring, though, if it does not, those who send cargo by its vessels may be boycotted by the other companies. If , however, we established a national line, the shipping companies would not dare to Then, again, Mr Barnes, boycott consignors, because behind a Government are the full resources of civilization. member able to say that his party will vote with him on this matter? for discussion at the present moment. tion. what wages are to be paid to those employed by the proposed new company. It has been stated in the newspapers that they are to be paid the Australian rates for deep sea vessels, because, I understand, our sailors do not ask for the same rates of wages 'for long voyages as they expect when employed on coastal trips. We ought to pay those concerned in the carriage of our mails and cargo white men's wages. We require that there shall be white stokers on the mail boats, and we should also require that they shall be, paid white men's wages.

I last addressed myself to this question, I quoted extracts from the reports of the right honourable the Treasurer to indicate the nature of the country through which the proposed railway would pass, and also to 'show the intimate relationship which the survey proposal bore to the eventual construction of the line. Now that the courtesy of honourable members has permitted me to continue my remarks, I find that I am not in a position to guarantee the correctness of my right honourable friend's none too satisfactory accounts ot the territory north of the Australian Bight. I absolutely agree, however, with the view that if we pass this Bill we shall pledge ourselves to the construction of the line in the event of the estimates of the cost of construction and the annual loss upon the working of it not being proved incorrect. The survey of a railway is surely the initial stage of its construction. may prove to be the death of the line. estimates of the cost of construction and the annual loss upon the working of the line are proved to be too low, we shall, by passing this Bill, have taken one of the preliminary steps towards the construction of the railway. shall have nothing to guide us. i 8 JULY, 1906.] Railway Survey Bill. 1457 have already been presented to Parliament. Knowing how closely associated the proposal for the survey is with that for the construction of the line, it is our duty to examine carefully the whole railway scheme.

I propose to deal with the reasons which have been urged in favour of the construction of the line, and to regard this Bill as one of the preliminary steps in connection with that undertaking. Let me take the five main points which have been advanced in favour of the work. They are:-(1 ) That there was an implied pre-federation I think that the right promise that the line would be constructed; (2) that it is constitutionally impossible for Western Australia alone to construct it ; (3) that for national purposes of defence it is necessary; (4) that it is expedient for developmental purposes; and (5) that it will benefit the east of Australia as well as the west. more than the west. which have been urged in favour of the building of the line. I intend to prove that each of these points is a bad one, and that, therefore, all must be bad.

225,Mr Kelly,"Exactly. I am going tovey that the right honourable member's friends at the border-as he describes them-shal l give us a guarantee that they will consent to the construction of the line. That is the point. As a member of the Convention, the right honourable gentleman said inferentially that the only obstacle to his proceeding with the construction of this line as Premier of Western Australia was the disinclination of his "" friends at the border "" to meet him. I ask him to remember that fact. He went on to satisfy the delegates from the other States that, so far as railway construction-genera l railway construction, that is; not this particular railwav-by the Commonwealth was concerned, they would be safeguarded. He saidThere will be quite sufficient security for the rest of Australia in the fact that, before a railState. I do not propose at the present way can be constructed, the Parliament of the Commonwealth will have to agree to it ; and it seems to me that if the Parliament of the Commonwealth has to agree to the construction of a line, New South Wales need not be afraidthe right honourable gentleman meant, of course, to include Victoria and Queenslandbecause she will have a very large share of the representation in the lower House to guard her interests. I would remind honourable members that according to the Treasurer we are here to guard the interests of the Eastern States. I wish to make a few more quotations before turning from the views of the Treasurer to other matters. The right honourable gpntleman not only wished Western Australia to look to herself for her own development, but actually resisted the handing over of the railways of the States to the Commonwealth. He expressed one of his reasons for this attitude in the following terms:I know that in our Colony the railways aie one that this matter was not brought before of our great revenue-producing instruments. But the Convention. Indeed the contrary apthat was not the reason why I voted against the proposal. I do not think any one voted against pears to be the fact, since the right honorit because he was afraid of the responsibility of taking over the railways. As self-supporting tingsand reproductive works, they would be amongst the best assets the Commonwealth could have. Taking the whole of the railways of Australia, they are not only self-supporting, but also reproductive, and, therefore, my honourable friend was altogether wrong when he said that we were afraid for the Commonwealth to take over responsibility for the railways. I would vote tomorrow for taking over all the railways of the Colonies, and not be afraid of the responsibility; of the proceedings of the Convention, and but the Teason why I voted against the provision was different altogether. I invite the attention of honourable members to this statementWe use the railways for opening up our territoryHe was referring to the territory of the Statesand giving a means of transit to our colonists, and we desire to extend them in any way we wish, at the time ancl in the direction where they are required, untrammelled by any other authority. Here we have a statement by the Treasurer, clearlv showir.p that he did not expect that the Commonwealth would ever be asked to enter upon railway construction, even for the benefit of Western Australia. He went to the eastern States, however, and asked for certain concessions in the way of a peculiar protection for the western juncture to quote the right honourable gentleman at any length on this phase of the question. thing about it at the Convention.

I am, however, extremely gratified that the representatives of Western Australia are present, and I hope that, before it is too late, they will see reason to change their attitude in this matter. I shall say no more on the question whether an implied promise that the proposed railway should be constructed was obtained by the people of Western Australia from the people of the eastern States prior to Federation. I think that the history of the case proves that there is nothing in this contention. If there is nothing in it by itself, it can have no force in conjunction with other claims. I therefore hope that we shall hear nothing more about any implied promise to Western Australia. The next point that has been strongly urged by the representatives of It was put forward when Western Australia is the constitutional inability of that State to construct a line on its own account. It is pointed out, and As a voter who took an very properly, that if the people of South Australia are opposed to the railway, they can refuse to connect their system with that of Western Australia, and thus defeat the project. In order to answer that plea it is only necessary to refer to sub-section x x x i v . of section 51 of the Constitution, which empowers this Parliament "" to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth "" with respect lo "" r a i l way construction and extension in any State,"" but only "" with the consent of fhat State."" It is obvious from this that this Commonwealth is in the same unfortunate position as is the ''State of Western Australia. We could not take any of the steps preliminary to the construction of the line without the consent of the State, and it is, therefore, self-evident that Western Australia has no claim upon us, owing to her being placed under a special disability in the matter referred to. The next point urged by its supporters is that the railway is necessary for the purposes of national defence. We are told that the eastern States must be free to help Western Australia if M a n y of us have at command of the seas is lost. I desire honourable members to treat this question in the same way that I have asked them to deal with the other points brought forward in favour of the construction of the railway.

278,Mr Kelly,"I was flattered, if anyrest absolutely upon its own merits. would first ask honourable members whether the expenditure of £4,500,000 upon the construction of a railway through a waterless and inhospitable waste would be justified in 'the interests of Australian defence? We have been told that the first essential to our defence is sea command. If command of the sea is absolutely assured, Western Australia, in common with all other States, is safe. If we spent £4,500,000 upon increasing Imperial naval strength, we should probably place our command of the seas beyond all question, and thus insure the safety of the Commonwealth. how the pouring of £4,500,000 into the desert would help the people of Australia, or the people of the Empire, to retain a command of the seasa command which absolutely underlies the whole problem of Australian defence. In dealing with defence, we should discuss the questions relating to it in the order of their importance. I have dealt with the subject of sea command, and the next in order of importance is population. I would ask the Treasurer how an addition of £4,500,000 to the already overwhelming debt of Australia would offer additional inducements to persons abroad to come here and settle on the land? Obviously, it would do nothing of the kind, and I think I have shown plainly that the construction of the railway cannot be permitted to enter into our consideration of defence matters. Western Australia is safeguarded from invasion from oversea, not by the mere handful of people who live in the' south-eastern corner of this Continent, but solely by the naval power of the great Empire of which Australia is only a small section. If command of the seas were once lost, the eastern States could not possibly succeed in repelling on invasion in the west. Honourable members may ask whether we would not do something to help Western Australia. That reminds me of the remark of Major General Sir Edward Hutton in answer to a question addressed to him by the Treasurer as to whether the proposed railway would be useful to Australia from the defence point of view. He said that he did not think it would be of much use to construct a railway if we had not the troops to send across to Western Australia. troops were not sufficiently equipped, but find within their constituencies large areas we are getting over that difficulty now. is to be relied on, even if his version be correct. It must be plain to the Treasurer that if we are to spend money upon defence, the first object of our solicitude should not be a desert railway, but the equipment of our men. of men capable of bearing arms. repel an invading force in Western. Australia if we lost command of the seas.' If the railwaj' was built, and an enemy had command of the seas, it would cost us an enormous sum of money to I want to know, however, transfer a force, with the necessary equipment, from the eastern States to Western Australia. It would probably cost us £ 5 per ton for freight, and a large sum per head for the conveyance of our soldiers, whereas the enemy could forward his munitions to the seat of war at a cost of, perhaps, only 15s. per ton. What would be most likely the outcome of a struggle between our 4,000,000 people and, say 60,000,000 people overseas, under such t conditions as I have indicated? The answer is obvious. Owing to the vastness of our territory, and the fact that we are a mere handful of people, we have no defence against external aggression unless we retain command of the seas. The' railway can be of no .possible assistance to us as an element in our arrangements for defence. NowI propose to deal with another argument that has been brought forward in favour of the proposed railway. I refer to the alleged national expediency of its construction for development purposes. If we desire to spend our monev to the best advantage, we should first develop the country that is likely to prove most valuable. We are now asked , how1 ever, to first select a desert which absolutely appalled the Treasurer when he cast eyes upon it. If we searched Australia through we should not be able to find any more dismal and unpromising tract than that through which the railway would pass. unpromising than the Riverina country appeared fifty years ago. is making a most extravagant statement.

He went on to quote precedents which I do not deem it necessary to recapitulate-the y are all set out in Hansard-showin g the judgments bearing upon this question which have been given in the United States. He then proceeded to advance a number of other arguments in favour of the construction of the Esperance line, and he actually appealed'to the Commonwealth to override the State authority in this connection. I ask the Treasurer whether he thinks the people of Western Australia would consent to the Commonwealth undertaking the construction of the Esperance railway ? I hope that he will be able to enlighten us upon that subject, because it is one which is very vital to this discussion. right honourable gentleman who.is so prone to interrupt when his voice is not altogether necessary is unable to reply to my ' question. The honourable member for Coolgardie actually went on to argue that the mere difference between a. tramway and a railway would enable the Federal authority to construct the Esperance line without violating that section of the Constitution which prevents the Commonwealth from building a railwav through any State without first having obtained the consent of that State. He urged that the authority of the Western Australian Government should be over-' ridden in order to give the inhabitants of the gold-fields simple justice. knows better than does the Treasurer that if we were to abandon the proposal to construct the Transcontinental Railway, so as to enable the inhabitants of the gold-fields to obtain cheap supplies by the building of the Esperance railway, the Parliament of Western Australia would be against us. That State would then talk of seceding from the Union because the views of its coastal districts were likely to be overridden for the benefit of the people of the gold-fields. He goes on to Two objections are urged against the construction of the line. The first is, that Esperance is not a safe harbour; and, second, that the railway would not be a commercial success. If either of these objections were sound, the proposal might be at once dismissed. In view of the statement which he made in connection with the Esperance line, I hope the 'construction of the Transcontinental Railway would result in an annual deficiency of £70,000-h e will assist us to successfully oppose this Bill. He continuedEsperance harbour is completely landlocked, and is approached by a surveyed, well-defined channel, from 20 to 60 fathoms deep. During his visit in May, 1898, Sir John Forrest, the then Premier, is reported to have said, ""He was well pleased with their harbour. He thought it an excellent one, and very little was left to be desired in its accommodation. They had a very good start to become one of the chief ports of the Colony."" At a later stage I hope to afford the Treasurer an opportunity of proving the value of the protestations which he made upon that occasion. The honourable member for Coolgardie continuedLet us leave mails, trade, and traffic out of the question, and consider the matter as it affects humanity.

The. honourable member for Coolgardie went on to say that I t has been shown conclusively, I hope, that the refusal of this railway so outrages the spirit, if not the letter of the Constitution, as to demand soon or late decisive action by the Commonwealth, and that a gross injustice is being thereby inflicted on thousands who have laboured and suffered for the cause of Australian nationality.

Since making his speech the honourable member has been and ceased to be a member of an Australian Ministry, and in consequence of that one accession to office he seemsj to have sacrificed the individual interests of his own constituents to the good of his party in Western Australia. Another parliamentarian! from the gold-fields who was. returned at the recent Western Australian elections as an ardent supporter of the Esperance Bay railway project, since becoming a member of a State Ministry, has had to think of the votes of the whole of the people of that State, and to go back upon the Esperance project. It is gratifying to know, however, that the people of the gold-fields are as anxious for the construction, of the Esperance Bay line as ever they were. I have here some cuttings from the Kalgoorlie Miner, dating from 23rd May to 19th June, which were sent to me a few weeks ago. I propose to quote from them, to show that on the goldfields the feeling is still strong on this question, although the political exigencies of great parties may have induced the representatives of the gold-fields in this Chamber to go back on the Esperance Bay pro-* posals. The Kalgoorlie Miner, which I r understand is one of the largest journals on the gold-fields, writes as follows:The worse sample of all of evasion of the spirit of federation has been given in the matter of the persistent refusal to sanction the Esperance railway. One of the chief reasons for this refusal in the pre-Federal days was consistent enough from a protectionist point of view, that the building of the line would foster competition by the eastern States. After federation this reason, so utterly inconsistent with the spirit of union, was allowed lo fall away into innocuous desuetude. That seems to be the position taken up by 'the gold-fields in this matter. The people there desire their produce to be carried cheaply from the east, so that the farmers of Western Australia shall not We are assured by the supporters of this proposal that the Transcontinental Railway will give an opportunity to the farmers in the east, but the exercise of the smallest amount of common sense will show the follv of such a suggestion. has been extended. clearly shown that in pre-Federation days the State refused to sanction this line because of possible competition from the eastern States. If competition from the eastern States is what these honourable gentlemen require-if they desire cheap food for the people of the.gold-fieldsI shall give them an opportunity at a later stage to join me in a proposal that it shall be a condition precedent to the passing of this Bill that Western Australia shall give an undertaking to build the Esperance Bay railway. So far as this argument goes, it is clear that the farmers of the eastern States, for whom these honourable members have expressed so much concern, would be much better served by the Esperance Bay railway, which the Transcontinental Railwav is certain to k ill . The Kalgoorlie Miner continuesThe opponents of the line have, since federation, been content to refuse their support without troubling themselves to give a reason. Mr Keenan is the first to revive the old reason, ignoring the fact that Western Australia is now in federation with the rest of the Commonwealth. He explains most elaborately that the Government is taking steps to encourage land settlement, and that it would be inconsistent with the policy it proposes to do any act which would encourage competition from the eastern Slates -the States with which Western Australia is nominally in free-trade.",52,Forrest Wha T Justification I Think I Pointed Out The Other Day But I May

There is a complaint that the special. Tariff about which the Treasurer was so anxious, has not effected its purpose! Much has been said lately about the transcontinental railway, so vastly coveted by metropolitan land-owners; but it is quite possible that South Australia would never authorize the construction of that line so long as she is directly menaced by the refusal to connect the gold-fields with Esperance. There is no reason why South Australians should not be selfish as well as our metropolitan people.

The State of South Australia is anxious that in taking over the Northern Territory, the Commonwealth shall reimburse her the money expended upon it, and construct a railway from Oodnadatta to join with the line from Port Darwin, and the honourable member for Coolgardie moved an amendment to. the effect that the Commonwealth must not do more than repay the actual expenditure of South Australia on the development of the Territory.

320,Mr Cameron (Wilmot) [8.47],"Iconstruction of a railway always adopt the most hopeful view regarding its prospects. They invariably under-estimate the cost, and exaggerate the probable returns. I am afraid that the cost of constructing, the proposed railway has been under-estimated ; but, even assuming' that the line can be built for £4,500,000, I should like to know where the money is to come from. At the very outset of our career as a Federation, the Labour Party laid down the prinI suggest that the honourable member for ciple, to which they have closely adhered ever since, and which has been endorsed by the present Government, that no money should be borrowed for the construction of public works. We know very well that, under the Braddon clause, we have to return to the States three-fourths of the Cuswhich the Treasurer has painted the toms revenue, and that we have only between £2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 and £3,000,000 per annum with which to play "" ducks and drakes "" at the present time. The chances are that the operation of the Braddon clause will be extended, because most of the States recognise that, otherwise, justice will not be done to them. Therefore, I ask where the money is to come from? I do not regard it as at all likely that the Labour Party will forego their principles, so far as borrowing money is concerned, and I would ask them whether they expect the money to be raised by means of a land tax? by means of a land tax is to be devoted to the construction of the proposed railway, what provision will be made for the payment of old-age pensions? of monev for 'both purposes. ber evidently ha's no land. members must see that, owing to the financial difficulty with which we are face to face, we cannot construct the proposed railway. Therefore, it is of no use for us to expend money upon the survey. We know that the people of South Australia do not desire that the railway should be constructed, and, furthermore, that many of the inhabitants of Western Australia are indifferent on. the subject. The honourable member for Wentworth read newspaper extracts, which indicated that the residents on the gold-fields in Western Australia desired to secure the construction of a railway from Kalgoorlie to Esperance. seems to me that the honourable meniber for Coolgardie would be adopting a patriotic course if he supported the construction ,of that line, rather than the project which underlies the present B ill . It is perfectly true that a former member for Kalgoorlie was rejected by his constituents because of his advocacy of the Esperance line, and that his place was taken by a much less brilliant luminary, but, at least, he perished in a good cause. Coolgardie should follow in his footsteps, and immortalize his name by recognising that the interests of the residents of the gold-fields would, best be served by the construction of a line to Esperance Bav. I cannot understand the eloquence with beauties of the desert, which he found so unattractive when he traversed it thirty years ago. I should like to know how he can reconcile his former statements with his present attitude. We know that he is anable man, and that he is also possessed of sound common sense. He, therefore, ought to know that, representing as he cloes, not only Western Australia, but the whole Commonwealth, he has no right to ccnie forward, and ask the whole of the States to engage in an enterprise which in all probability would result in a ghastly failure. If I were a representative of Western Australia. I should feel humiliated to come here, and plead that, although my State was one of the richest in proportion to population, the people were so poor, so mean, and so harrow-minded, that they would not put down their own money and construct the line, but preferred to come crawling to the Commonwealth. If they asked for assistance upon the grounds of their poverty, I -should be one of the first to recognise their claim. But Honourable T sannot forget the attitude which was taken up by the Western Australian representatives in the Senate only a few weeks ago, when they declared against Federal expenditure being charged per capita, and asserted that the little State of Tasmania must do the best that she could. When such narrow-minded' and parochial sentiments are expressed by the representatives of a country which ought to be above such meanness it ill becomes them to ask assistance from the representatives of the other States.

339,Mr Wils On (Corangamite) [9.12],"member for Wentworth, we may fairly say that the question of the desirability of authorizing the survey of the proposed transcontinental railway has been thoroughlyof the line through that State, can it be discussed. I fail to see how we can reasonably proceed any further with the Bill, unless the amendment which he has submitted is agreed to. But before discussing that question, I should like to direct your attention, sir, to the fact that a quorum is not present. pointing out that the House was placing itself in a ridiculous position by authorizing working of the line would be borne on a expenditure upon a survey of the proposed line before the principal condition under which that line can be constructed, has been complied with. As the honourable member for Wentworth has pointed out, the preliminary survey may possibly cost £100,000 beforeo it has been completed. That money, which has to be contributed by the whole of the States, would be absolutely wasted if South Australia .refused her consent to the construction of the line through her territory. That is the crucial point in connection with this Bill. If the South Australian Government refused its consent to the line traversing its. territory, of the land in South Australia through enmity would undoubtedly be created between that State and Western Australia. On the other hand, South Australia might be asked by this House to put its hand to something which might prove very costly. That State will have to bear a large share of the annual loss upon this railway, because there can be no doubt that its construction will involve a large annual loss. Prom the report of the engineers, I gather that that loss for the first ten years of its construction is computed at £86,696. I desire to know whether the honourable member is in order in discussing the cost of the-proposed line? the moment, but if the honourable member went bevond the scope of the amendment before the Chair he certainly was not jn order. the honourable member for Grey, I would point out that I was dealing, not with the question of expenditure, but with the estimated annual loss on the maintenance of the Transcontinental Railway, and showing that a proportion of fhat loss would have to be borne by South Australia. The annual loss for ten years would be, it is estimated, no less than £86,696. If the South Australian Government would thus incur a loss of at least £100,000, in addition to the loss of the territory required for the construction reasonably asked to give its consent? The length of line running through South Australian territory would be 650 miles, and that running through Western Australian only 450 miles. It is obvious that the bulk of the loss of territory would fall, not [Quorum formed.] I was upon Western Australia, but upon South Australia, whilst the actual loss on the population basis by all the States. South Australia has had a bitter experience of desert lines. Honourable members are aware that she has at the present time a line running through the desert to Oodnadatta, and it seems to me that if South Australia is to be guided by her experience in that regard, she is unlikely during the present century to consent to make such a sacrifice as the construction of this line would involve. When the people of Australia generally become apprised of the true position, they will be hostile to the project. We have to consider the character which this line would! pass. It is difficult to obtain any information on the subject, except from the report of the engineers-inchief who made the preliminary survey, but the Treasurer has given to ""posterity some particulars ojf the country on the Western Australian side. do with the question. fice to be made by South Australia depends entirely on the nature of the country which she will be asked to hand over to the Commonwealth. If the land required for the purposes, of this line were worth £ 4 0 an acre the sacrifice would be enormous, whereas if it were worth only Jd. per acre it would be a mere nothing. I have no doubt that the people of Western Australia think that an expenditure of a million of monev is worthy of consideration, although it mav be nothing to the Treasurer, who has so often asked, "" What is a million ?"" whether or not we should proceed anv further with the motion in the absence of the consent referred to in the amendment.

376,Mr Wilson,"The honourable andtion if , after we had spent £20,000, or even £30,000, or £40,000, on this survey-becaus e public expenditure generally largely exceeds the first estimate-the South Australian Government refused to consent to the construction of the line? The evidence which we have goes to show that the South Australian Government are anxious to bring about an extension of the railway beyond Oodnadatta, which makes it likely that they will place an embargo upon the construction of the line under consideration, and although it has been suggested that the Commonwealth can under any circumstances construct this railway, the best opinion is that, under the Constitution, it has no such power, and the gravest complications may therefore result if any attempt is made to construct it against the wishes of South Australia. As the proposed railwav would traverse a greater distance in South Australia than it would traverse in Western Australia, the former State is the more interested in this proposal, and it would be absurd for us to sanction expenditure for the survey of the route while it remains hostile to the scheme. No honourable member, and no sane man outside, would expend money on the survey under these conditions. We are asked to take too much for granted, ancl, before spending a shilling, should obtain the consent cf Soutli Australia to the construction of the line, in the event of the survey proving satisfactory. orable member would not vote for the survey. formation which has been placed before us. The Treasurer, whose business capacity is well known, would not in private life act on the lines which he is asking the House to follow. States, whose citizens are already very heavily taxed, and ask them to provide money for the survey of a railway which will probably never be constructed, because South Australia will not grant -her permission. I do not know of any such proposal ever having been brought before an Australian Parliament. So far as we can judge, from the information available to us, South Australia is hostile to fhe construction of the railway, and we shall have to take our chance of her refusal to allow the work to proceed. amendment will be agreed to, and that .Western Australia and South Australia .will join in having the line surveyed. When they have done this, it will be time enough for them to come to us and ask us to construct the railway. I am sure that if the Treasurer thought that South Australia would block the construction of the railway, he would not ask us to vote money for carrying out the survey, but he takes too optimistic a view of the case. Until we are assured that South Australia will agree to the construction of the railway, we should not pass the measure. understand the attitude of the Government with regard to this Bill.

It is not in order for the honourable member to discuss the main question. position. As we are to be called upon to find the money for the proposed survey, I think that it is necessary that we should have some evidence that the Government of South Australia are willing to allow the work to proceed. Under the circumstances, I shall oppose the second reading of the Bill. From the observations that I was able to make when I was recently in Western Australia, and from tire reports published in the newspapers, I believe that half public interest. It is in furtherthe people in Western Australia do not want the survey made. which the,Mayor of Kalgoorlie thing to do with the amendment. to do with the amendment. The survey might be started from the Kalgoorlie end of the proposed line, and, unless the South Australian Government permitted the work to be completed, the expenditure incurred would be so much money wasted. Unless the Treasurer can give us some definite asthis connection. The amendment will read surance with regard to the attitude of South Australia, I shall oppose the Bill. Will South Australia consent to the survey being proceeded with in her territory ? can spend £20,000 on a survey, but they have to decide what shall be the route. For that reason alone I think that the Government should have no hesitation in accepting the amendment of the honourable member for Wentworth. [9.50] I wish to explain the vote which I shall give upon this question. I am diametrically opposed to the railway, but at the same time. I intend to vote against the amendment, because it seems to me that those who vote for it will be pledging themselves to support the construction of the railway, in the event of South Australia giving permission to make the survey through the territory of that State. The Government of South Australia would be standing in its own light if it refused permission for the survey to be made. The construction of the railway would benefit that State, because the other States of Australia would bear the expense. I do not think that the amendment is of any value, because I believe that South Australia will not refuse its consent to the survey. not desire to detain the House for more than a few minutes; but I wish to move a further amendment. I hold the view fhat it is desirable in connection with the construction of any railways in Australia-and especially in connection with any that may be constructed by the Commonwealth-that the lands upon the route proposed to be surveyed should be conserved in the ance of that view that I propose to move a further amendment. I believe that honourable members generally are in accord with the principle which I have stated. The terms of the amendment are similar to thos,e which were adopted by this House in connexioiu with, that portion of the line which would pass through Western Australian territory. The Western Australian Government readily fell in with the suggestion. But we obtained no promise from the South Australian Government that it wouldl take similar action,. My amendment is, therefore, designed to bring South Australia into line with Western Australia in as follows:That all the words after the word "" u n t i l "" in the amendment be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words :"" The Parliament of South Australia has agreed that all the available Crown lands for a distance of 25 miles on each side of the line should be placed under the control of the Commonwealth, so that the proceeds from the disposal of such lands shall go towards making up any deficiency that may occur in connection with the expenditure upon the proposed line.""

'But it would only be fair to ask South Australia and Western Australia, which would chiefly benefit by the construction of the line, to bear a very large proportion of the cost of the proposed survey. It seems to me that those States should also guarantee the Commonwealth against any loss which might occur in connection with the working of the line. I understand that the Western Australian Government has undertaken to bear a certain proportion of that loss for a period of tem years.; but no such offer has been made by South Australia, and, before proceeding further with the Bill, it would be advisable for the Government to endeavour to secure a similar guarantee from that State. The construction of the proposed line will involve an outlay of at least £4.500,000, apart from the cost of the survey. It therefore behoves us to seriously consider whether we are at the present time justified in committing ourselves to such a huge expenditure.

When the Commonwealth has determined that a railway running east and west across the Continent is desirable, I am? sure that South Australia will put no unreasonable obstacles in the way, provided there is a disposition to meet the wishes of that State in regard to route and gauge. matter I have to differ from the honourable and learned member for Angas. I approve of the survey being proceeded with. No one can take exception to the position which South Australia takes up. ment have given their approval of the survey for the railway being carried out. As to the railwav itself, they will consider that at a later stage, when the results of the survey are known, and when the route and gauge of the line can be determined. Of course, as to these matters consideration will have to be given to the wishes of the State; but of this I am certain, that the demands of South Australia will not be unreasonable. be of such a character that the Commonwealth Parliament,, if it decides to construct the railway, to Western Australia, will be able readily to accept them. Personally I agree with the honourable member foi Angas that a railway from Port Augusta to Port Darwin is of much greater importance to Australia as a whole than a railway from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie. [10.12] -When this exploitation Bill was before the House last session,, I voted against they please. So far as this railway is conit. Since that time no new arguments have been brought forward to induce me to alter the opinion I had then formed. The Minister of Home Affairs, in introducing this Bill, put forward the same old argument, used so often before, that some irresponsible person, at the time the Federal Conventions were being held, bribed the right honourable member for Swan to induce the State of Western Australia to enter the Union. I do not feel disposed to give a vote which will plunge the Commonwealth into an expenditure of £5,000,000 because one person in South Australia made a promise to the right honourable member for Swan to induce him to bring Western Australia into the Federation. I cannot see how this railway is to pay for axle grease. The expenditure involved in the construction of the line, the borrowing of the money, and working expenses connected with it, will amount to quite £5,000,000, and I should like to know where honourable members expect to get the interest upon such a sum from the working of such a railway. There is no railway in Australia that, in similar conditions, could be made to pay working expenses. We know that railways cannot compete against water carriage in the transport of goods, and this line must depend I regret that in this solely on the passenger traffic. Is there any. member of this House sanguine enough to believe that the passenger traffic over this line will be sufficient to pav interest on £5,000,000 ? Some honourable members The Governhave said that they will not pledge themselves to vote for the construction of the railway, but when they are prepared to vote £20,000 for the survey of the line it is evident that they are prepared to vote for its construction. honourable members be prepared to throw away £20,000 if they are not prepared They will, I am confident, to vote for the construction of the railway within the expense which has been estimated ? The rubbish is to be found in the proposal to vote £20,000 for the survey of a railway of this sort: It is all very well for honourable members, who represent districts through which the line would pass if constructed, to support this proposal. little out of sugar. the other States have an equal right with the people of Queensland to grow sugar if cerned, there is not the slightest prospect that it will pay, and the Commonwealth should not be run into an expenditure of this kind. I am surprised that members of the Labour Party should go back Upon the principle they have adopted in opposing the borrowing of money for public works in the Commonwealth. Opposition to such a course is one of the planks of the Labour platform, and if this line is not to be constructed of borrowed money, it can only be by the adoption of the scheme for making monev. which has been put forward by the honourable member for Brisbane.

All that can be found in this territorv are ants and flies, and vet we are bein.<r asked to put a railwav through such country af an expense of in the Federation. posal is nothing but a buccaneering, filibustering iob of the worse kind.

I can give the right honourable member for Swan credit for what he did at the Federal Convention. The right honourable gentleman took very fine care that in joining the Federation Western Australia should be entitled to impose a special Tariff. I am very sorrv that the Premier of Queensland at the time did not impose the same condition. The right honourable member for Swan saved his State by that special Tariff, whilst we in I Queensland have had to suffer. Honourable members talk about sugar, but in Queensland we have the only big industry of the kind-in Australia We have built I have been on the up that industry ourselves, and there is £.500,000 of the money of the State invested in it .

Posterity would have to bear the loss upon the railway when constructed; therefore South Australia has a perfect right to demand that it 3hall be built through the best portion of her territory. I do not feel inclined to vote any money for the construction of such a rotten raihvay. of the Commonwealth? think that we want any defence. We have already provided quite enough defence. Indeed, we have spent too much public money in that direction. to any defence system. afraid of any nation coming to invade Australia, and I do not believe in maintaining officers merely to wear toggery. I do not consider that the construction of this raihvay has any relation to our defence system. Certainly, I do not look upon it as a factor in the effective defence of the Commonwealth. It has been interjected that leading members of the House support this B ill . Why has it commanded their support ? Most of those who are known as leading members in the House have been in the Ministry. With them it has been merely a question of concession in return for support. That is the long and short story of this business. Those who have not been in the Ministry have been free to vote as they like. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie has been hobnobbing with honourable members, and trying to hoodwink them into voting for the survey of this raihvay. I give him credit for his action, and perhaps if I were in his place I would act similarly. I do not blame him for trying to induce any honourable members to vote for the survey of this railway, however unreasonable the proposal may be from a Commonwealth stand-point. It is all very well for leading members to vote for the Bill, because they have got support, or hope to get it. I trust that the Bill will be relegated to its proper place, and that is the waste-pacer basket. cannot forget that if the railwav were constructed the people in Queensland would have to bear a share of the loss on its working. I trust that if the House does not reject the Bill-and I do not expect that it will nuite agree with, the denunciations which -the Senate, which seems to be stronger, and perhaps less shackled than we are. will take that step. It is because our memI do not blame South bers are practically shackled that they in tend to vote as they do. No argument has. been adduced to justify a vote of £20,000for a survey. Every one knows quite well that the construction of the raihvay would cost £ 5 , 000,000 at least, because that is the lowest estimate which has 50 far been furnished. In my opinion, .£20,000 is a very large sum to pay for the survey of a line 1,100 miles long. I have had a. little to do with surveying, but I have : never known a case where it cost about £ 2 0 a mile to make a survey over country which is practically flat, and where the surveyor could take long sights. forgets what a terrible desert it is. ThatI am opposed is why it is to cost so much per mile. orable and learned member, as a surveyor, knows that £ 2 0 a mile is an exorbitantprice to pay for making a survey for that distance. profit out of it at £ 2 a mile. should like to be in partnership with the honourable and learned member when, he was making the survey. I have had someexperience in connection with long railway connexions, and I know what a survey costs per mile. I submit that £ 2 0 a mile is an exorbitant price to put down for making a survey over practically flat country. If the railway hacl to be constructed over mountains, such as are met with in New South Wales or Queensland, I could understand that rate being charged, because the surveyor would have to take short sights in order to get his levels. In this case, however, he could take five or ten chain, or even longer, sights. Practically there is no obstruction in the wav. because the country is fairly, open, and free from scrub.

No less than thirty-five years ago he went over that part of Western Australia, and no one who has read his descriptions of his travels will wish to visit the place. Let us see exactly what the Treasurer has done. For four years, when he sat in a Ministry, he never brought forward a measure for this purpose. He has now been in office for twelve months, and the Bill has only just ""been brought forward in a casual kind of way. last session. because there is a general election coming on. is being held up as a sort of bait to some persons in Western Australia-to show them what their representatives are doing for them. learned member voted for the Bill last time.

At the present time it would be highly undesirable on the part of the House to pass a vote for a survey, when it really has no intention of authorizing the construction of the raihvay. In proof of my statement about the character of the country, I might instance the sum. which the Minister in charge of the Bill has put down as likely to be the cost of levelling. I suppose that everv one knows that through, a great part of South Australia and central New South Wales, the regular charge for levelling is £ 2 a mile, and out of that rate men ""pay for the equipment of their camp, and make r a profit ranging from £500 to £1,500, or £2,000 per annum. member speaking of levelling in connection with raihvay survevs? level the whole country, from Coonamble to Oodnadatta, and to make a handsome land journey on a bicycle. profit at £ 2 per mile. the honourable and learned member could they were in better condition at the end of -do so. margin to work upon. The right honourable I should not go beyond a gradient of 1 in 50. So far as the bulk of that country is concerned, the gradient would, perhaps, be only 1 in 1,000, and one could take sights of 10, 20, or 30 chains each. The average would be 10-chain' sights. I have been able to level 10 miles a day in country similar to that through which this line would pass, and 10 miles a day, at £ 2 per mile, would mean a handsome profit. The Treasurer, however, has asked that a sum of £ 2 0 per mile shall be allowed for this work, and probably that amount will not be sufficient, since the moment one leaves the coast one has to carry water on camels. That proves the nature of the country through which this line would pass. 1 Long ago I took up country to the north of Eucla. make a search for minerals along the route, and to report? lives; just as many lives were lost in prospecting for gold in Western Australia before it was found there. along the proposed route; I refer to Tarcoola. the north of the proposed route.

Without pledging myself to the course that honourable and I shall adopt in future, I may say at once that there are far more arguments in favour of our assuming control of a line of steamers than there are in support of this project. There is no question that the one might return f u l l interest on the money expended, while the other would obviously not do so.

MOTIONS FOR LEAVE OF ABSENCE. That the House do now adjourn. I wish to draw attention to the need for an alteration of the standing order relating to the granting of leave of absence. Standing order 45 saysLeave of absence may be given by the House to anv member, on motion, after notice, stating the cause and period of absence; and such Mahon, H . motion shall have priority over other motions, Maloney, W. R. N . and shall ^lot be debated. McCay, J. W. That standing order should, in my opinion, McDonald, C. be amended to allow of debate, which is Phillips, P. the practice of another place. To-day Quick, Sir J. the honourable member for Dalley moved Ronald, J. B. that leave of absence be granted to the Watkins, D . right honourable member for East Sydney, Watson, J. C. on the ground of urgent public business, Webster, W. and it might appear that, in allowing the Tellers : motion to be passed on the voices, we approved of the absence of the right honourable gentleman. I would point outthat, , when' members of the Tariff Commission Storrer, D. desired to absent themselves from their Thomson, D . A. places' in Parliament, in order to attend to really urgent public business,, the right Conroy, A. H . B. honourable member for East Sydney disKelly, W. H . approved of their going away to Western Australia, Tasmania, and South Australia whilst the House was sitting. So strongly Fysh, Sir P. O. did the honourable and learned member for Tudor, F. G. Illawarra feel upon the subject that he Edwards, R -considered that it was his duty to be in Salmon, C. C. his ""place in the House, rather than fo absent himself, even for the purpose of taking part in the proceedings of the Tariff Commission elsewhere than in Melbourne. I do not think that the right honourable member for East Sydney is attending to urgent public business. When it was sought I have to intimate to to grant a month's leave of absence to the leader of the Labour Party in the Senate, who was a member of the Tariff Commission, not only did honourable senators belonging to the party led by the right honourable member for East Sydney object to leave being granted, but they forced the matter to a division. The honourable senators who voted against the motion were Senators Baker, Dobson, Gray, McFarlane, Symon, Walker, and Clemons. Honourable members will find the division recorded at page 3342 of Hansard. The right honourable member for East Sydney is now in Queensland urging the electors to vote, and yet he is himself absenting himself from the House, and neglecting to vote upon matters of the highest importance. I think that he might have shown a better example. What is his record in regard to attendance in this House? On the 4th July Senator Higgs pointed out that during the first session of the first Parliament the leader of the Opposition attended only 93 out of 215 sittings; that is to say, he was absent upon i2'2 days. During the second session he attended only 27 out of 68 sittings. In the first session of the",70,Pairs

During the second session of this Parliament he attended 29 out of 90 sittings, and was therefore absent upon 61 days. We have seen very little of the right honourable gentleman during this session. He was not here to express his opinion upon what has been described by members of his own party as one of the most far-reaching measures that has ever come before this or any other Australian Legislature. I think that it was his duty to be present, not only to speak, but to vote. It would appear, from the action of some honourable members of the Opposition, that the right honourable gentleman was very glad to be absent. Some of his supporters put up a great show of opposition to the Australian Industries Preservation Bill, but not a single member had the courage to call for a division upon the motion for the third reading. In 1904, when the honourable member for Barrier directed attention to the absence of certain Ministers, the right honourable member for East Sydney stated that it was their duty to be here, and that they were paid to be here. Now he is absent from his place in Parliament, and is endeavouring to undermine the positions of honourable members who are here doing their duty.' If it is an urgent matter for the right honourable gentleman to conduct a campaign upon the lines he is now following, it is equally urgent for honourable members representing Queensland to be in that State looking after their own interests. The right honourable gentleman is reported to have stated that he had given up the present Parliament, and was now appealing to the electors. stead of seeking for leave of absence, he should have sent in his resignation. I trust that the Standing Orders will be amended, so as to enable honourable members, before granting leave of absence, to satisfv themselves that the member who is seeking to be relieved for the time being from attending to his duties in the House is engaged uponi urgent public or private business. I am sure no one would raise his voice against leave of absence being granted to an honourable member who had really urgent business to attend to. surprised that honourable members should object to the absence of any individual member. It seems to me that that is a matter for his constituents rather than for us. Many men may be transacting the business of the country, even -though they mav not be present in Parliament. I have always thought that it was a mistake on the part of the Pederal Convention to require that the attendance of honourable members should be recorded like that of schoolbovs. The mere act of walking in and out of the Chamber does not constitute attention to parliamentary duties. bers walk in and out of the Chamber, and nothing more is seen of them. that. I have done the same thing myself, and I shall do it again. The fact ""that that .course of conduct is pursued is largely due to our sitting days being too numerous . to permit of our giving proper attention to our work, and making ourselves thoroughly acquainted with the measures which we are called upon to consider. An honourable member's attention to his public duties should be judged by his public acts, and not by the mere record of his attendances in this Chamber. Certain honourable members who have the best records in the matter of attendance have clone so little actual legislative work that when they make a proposal we merely smile. I remember that last week I characterized one honourable member as the most stupid man in this Chamber. Another honourable member interjected, and upon looking at him I had to acknowledge that perhaps I was mistaken. Mv regard for the truth compelled me to withdraw my remark. Thev are both remarkable for their attendance. We are going much too far in placing any value upon the mere attendance of an honourable memI f that be so, inberOf courre, Ministers ought to be in their places, but I do not think that in our hearts we regard regular attendance in this House as any guide as to the mental effort which one is making in the discharge of his legislative duties. Of course, if the honourable member for Hindmarsh ' admits that he has called attention to this matter merely for political purposes, there is nothing more to be said.

I regard a motion of this kind as being purely of a formal character. No good purpose would be attained by altering the standing order in the manner suggested. Indeed, if I had my way, so far from having a standing order regarding attendances, I would not allow them to be recorded, especially after what I have seen take place in this Chamber when important matters have been considered in the absence of a quorum. members were like the right honourable meniber for East Sydney, there would never be c a quorum. liament would be doing no harm, and we should arrive at a happy negative state of affairs that we do not seem able to attain now-. The honourable member for Capricornia is one of those who sit so frequently in the Chamber that we cannot very well complain of his protest. But when there are so many of us who offend, and who feel it to be necessary at times to leave tion should take upon himself the task of the chamber for purposes of relaxation, we ought not to complain. Indeed, some of the best work I have ever done has been when I have been out of the Chamber looking up matters in connection with work that had to be done here. I could not have dived so much into history if I had not taken advantage of opportunities to leave the Chamber for the purpose of looking up authorities.. It would be a most dangerous thing if a motion for leave of absence were not at any time allowed to be taken as formal. a member leaves the country and shows that he is taking no interest in the proceedings of Parliament. case the circumstances would be entirely different. I trust that the greatest warmth of political feeling will never allow us to descend to such a level as to refuse formal leave when it is asked for. do not think that the matter under discussion is that which has been suggested by the honourable member for Werriwa. It is not a question whether the attendance record is correct or not, or of whether honourable members should on occasion be granted leave of absence. It is purely a question of whether a member holding the prominent position that the leader of the Opposition holdsa responsible position on a level with that held by Ministers of the Crown -shoul d be absent for such long periods as he is. We cannot say that the right honourable member for East Sydney stands in the same position as a private member. Further, I venture to say that the honourable member for Werriwa, -with his knowledge of political history and parliamentary precedent, cannot point to any case in Australian history where a leader of the Opposition has left Parliament sitting to conduct an electioneering campaign in a distant part of the country. same thing, and gave as his reason that Parliament did not truly represent the electors never left Parliament sitting to engage in an electioneering, tour. I watched the career of Sir Henry Parkes from the moment when I first entered the State of New South Wales, and I know of no such case as the honourable member has referred to. It is deplorable, that the leader of the Opposigoing into the electorates of honourable members while they are attending to their duties in this Parliament, and should endeavour to cut the ground from beneath them, whilst at the same time he asks for leave to enable him to do so to a greater extent than he has already done. work in stirring up the electors to vote at the next election. if the Minister of Trade and Customs were to ask for leave of absence from this House while he was going through the electorate of Werriwa, the honourable member would be one of the first to raise an objection. If it is right and proper for the right honourable member for East Sydney to leave Parliament while it is sitting, it would be equally right for every member of this House to retire-to his own electorate for the ourpose of campaigning.
