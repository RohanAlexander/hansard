11,Mr Hughes,"It is not usual to elicitEXPEimrTTJEE. Minister for Works and Railways had the calculations made by Mr Commissioner Blacket in his report on the administration of the Home Affairs Department checked', and has he obtained reports on the findings of the Commissioner? If so, will he lay the result of the investigations on the table? I wish to know, too, whether the honourable. gentleman does not consider that there should be some statutory alteration regarding the duties of the Auditor-General, or some regulation passed? of time in considering the report of the Royal Commissioner, and have had it investigated by specialists, chiefly experts regarding the values of buildings, and in regard to accountancy methods which werecriticised by the Commissioner. shall be ready to present the reports of these experts to Cabinet as soon as there is an opportunity, and, with the permission of Cabinet, I propose to subsequently lay the whole of the papers on the table of the House. At this stage I prefer not to express an opinion regarding the statutory authority of the Auditor-General. the frequency of the mail services between many country towns is to be reduced ? If so, what is the reason for the reduction ? reduction in country mail services except where the tenders have exceeded; not merely the amounts previously paid, but those that the Department can legitimately afford. I have done all that I can to prevent the reduction of country mail services, and if war conditions would permit I should be pleased to extend country facilities. vanized and other fencing wire has increased about 500 per cent., and that of barbed wire and wire netting about 300 per cent., cannot something he done to fix the prices of these commodities, so that they may remain within the reach of our farmers and settlers? materials referred to has increased largely, because the importation of them has diminished. Yesterday I promised a deputation that black wire, fencing wire, and galvanized iron would be placed high on the list of importations for permitted shipment from America. If freight can be obtained, that will have the effect of reducing the price of those materials in Australia. The Government will consider the advisability of fixing prices for fencing wire and similar material. I am not now in a position to say how far the increase of prices has been due to the increased cost of materials. It is true, as has been pointed out, that I have spent a good deal the price of wheat, of meat, and of butter has gone up. This is equally true of the prices of nearly all commodities. The cost of labour has also increased. All these increases, I think, are naturally reflected in the price of wire netting. The question of whether the price of wire netting I has gone up more than it ought to have done is one into which we ought to inquire. We must frankly recognise the fact that under our present circumstances, those methods by which prices-are regulated in normal 'times are now quite inadequate, and thafa there must be some sort of tribunal to hold the scales evenly between producer and consumer. Works and Railways state . whether his Department has considered the advisableness of erecting cement works in Australia, more particularly in view of the fact that something like a thousand silos will have to be constructed, presumably of reinforced concrete, of which cement is an important constituent? There is also the fact that cement is required for various public works, and that there is some doubt as to whether the shareholders or managers of some cement works are not of enemy origin. matter Has been considered-certainl y not in my time-excep t in connection with the acquisition of a property just outside' the Federal Capital territory, which was supposed to be carrying cement stone, and which is now, I believe, the subject of legal proceedings between tbe Commonwealth and the original owners. manufactured there, what would it cost to bring it to Melbourne ? >",4,Petitio N Assessment Bill

The question of marking of boots and shoes manufactured within Australia is under the control of State Governments. Debate resumed from 19th July (vide That this Bill be now read a second time. not intend to occupy much time in the discussion of this Bill. somewhat in a quandary as to whether or not we are doing the right thing in this, regard, but I recognise that it is absolutely necessary that some steps should be taken to assist in the preservation of our grain. Travellers oh our railway lines are familiar with the fearful losses due 'to the fact that to some extent some one has blundered. I have often thought that we in Australia are exceedingly careless and indifferent to the provision that should be made for protecting our wheat and other grain stocks from the ravages caused by mice and those . worked by climatic influences. Apparently the Wheat Board, or whoever exercises control over the agents, made the mistake of falling into the groove which has so long been followed in Australia, with the result that deplorable losses have occurred, and must continue, from what I consider to be the primary negligence of those who were charged with this duty. There are to be seen stacked close to various railway stations in South Australia hundreds of thousands of tons of wheat without a particle of roofing. These stacks were originally roofed, but, unfortunately, the stacks themselves were used as the foundation for the roofing, and as soon as the mice got to work on them they collapsed, with the result that the iron which was resting upon them fell in, and the rain penetrated them. ment. separate support for the roofs, the stacks, following an old custom, were used for that purpose. Whilst such a practice plague to combat, and when, with an ample shipping service, wheat had not to be stacked for any considerable length of time, it has led in the existing circumstances to tremendous waste. A few days ago I put ,to the Prime Minister a question to which he was unable to give me a satisfactory answer. Under, the Wheat Board certain business men who had been engaged in the grain trade for years were appointed as wheat agents, and, I understand, were intrusted with the responsibility of properly housing and protecting the grain stacks from the elements. When travelling through a wheat-growing district recently I had a conversation with a man who was working under one of these agents, and who I am still gave me information, which, if true, is most astonishing. He said that while the agents were held responsible for up to 3 per cent, of losses due to any failure on their part to carry out their duty, the occurrence of any loss exceeding 3 per cent, relieved them from all responsibility. He assured me that isi such circumstances they were relieved, not only from responsibility for the original 3 per cent, of loss, but for all loss in excess of that. If that be true, it is a scandal, and does not suggest much foresight on the part of those who made the agreement. Such a provision in the agreement would really be an inducement to these men to get over the maximum of 3 per cent., and so to absolve themselves from all responsibility. I put a question to the Prime Minister on the subject, but, as I have said, did not receive a satisfactory answer. This phase of the question ought .certainly to be looked into. Various estimates have been made as to the actual losses we shall suffer. I have heard some gentlemen declare that the loss will not exceed 3 per cent., while others who are engaged in the handling of wheat say that the mice plague alone will result in a loss amounting to something like 10 per cent The ravages of the mice plague, however, represent but one phase of our difficulty. A far more serious danger is that of the weevil.

Not one word has been said during the debate to show that bulk handling has been proved satisfactory. The proposed silos are a prelude to, or a part of, a great bulkhandling scheme; and for that reason I suggest that the passage of this measure ought not to be hurried. As to the necessity for the other provisions in the Bill, however, there can be no doubt, for there is certainly room for much to be done. should be going on. with only a fourth or fifth of the trouble. the destination of this wheat, high member for Grey complaining of ?

The proposed scheme commits us to bulk handling, which is a different proposition from that to erect proper stores and accommodation for the protection of the wheat we have and to come. the honourable member and the Government is that the Government desire to put the wheat into silos, while he desires to bag it. commits us to bulk handling, I do not desire to commit myself, because bulk handling is one proposition, and the proper protection of the wheat, whether in bags or loose, another. There will be ample opportunity in the course of this debate for the Government to show that they are justified in going on with a scheme of bulk handling, whioh has been turned down, or, at any rate, delayed in New South Wales. going on with a scheme. There are very funny stories told about New South Wales in this connection. himself that, he intends to introduce the system. at any rate, the farmers, who are principally interested, are very divided in opinion-; and we ought, as I say, to have some information 'before us as to the merits or demerits of the proposed system. So far as the Bill commits . us to bulk handling, I am against it. [11.42] -The Government are to be congratulated on placing a measure of this character before the House. The state of the wheat stacks in South Australia is such as to demand immediate attention. When we remember that this wheat is the property of the British ""Government, we It is a scandal that such waste must realize that a great responsibility is thrown upon us, quite apart from the question of bulk handling; and in view ofpatriotic reasons ought to stimulate us to take every necessary step to protect it . In this work, we cannot afford to lose an hour; and for that reason the Government! are to be commended for introducing the measure thus early. It appears to me that there is a desire on the part of those in favour of bulk handling to, as it were, seize the opportunity presented by our misfortune, and push this project forward, when, if there were no war, it would receive more consideration on its merits. We are asked to consent to an expenditure, of, say, £3,000,000, an estimate a little high, perhaps, but one that allows for the contingencies that arise in great projects ' of this kind. That being the case it is vitally important that the Commissioners to be appointed under the Bill should be experts, and those experts should be engineers. There are a number of men who wander about all day long, and are experts on everything under the sun, but those who have had the misfortune to be mixed up with any of these gentlemen are anxious to give them a wide berth. As we do not live to the age of Methuselah, we have not the time or the inclination to be bored with them. But unless Parliament is very careful, so-called experts will be appointed as Commissioners, because of the desire of the State authorities to do somebody a good turn.

It is necessary that the buildings to be erected for the protection of the wheat shall be of such a character that they w ill efficiently serve their purpose. I do not profess to be an expert in regard to wheat handling, but this is a matter in connection with which an average amount of common sense is useful, and a very homoeopathic dose of expert knowledge is sufficient. It has been stated that Mr. Fuller intends to introduce into the New South Wales Parliament a B ill to authorize the construction of these silos as a step towards the institution of bulk handling. W it h all due respect to the enthusiastic advocates of bulk handling, I ask them to look at what they are doing. It is all very well to take measures to protect and store the wheat in Australia, but there is also the problem of shipping the Wheat abroad. An y ship-owner, unless he has a particular axe to grind, w ill declare that vessels must be specially constructed for the carrying of wheat in bulk, and the number of ships suitable for that purpose at the present time is very limited. take nearly all the wheat from the United States of America and Canadai n bulk. which they will not leave. they are sent. that our fellow citizens have the same money for the purpose of adequately proamount of common sense as we have, and tecting the wheat on hand, and also the I ask the honourable member for Wimnext crop. mera would he, as an overseas ship-owner, send ships to Australia when he' could the States are mulcting' the Commonget plenty of freight in the United States wealth when clause 9 states clearly that of America and Canada? they are sent. them ?

My argument is that the present is not the time for any of the Australian States to institute bulk handling, because of the fact that wheat in bulk is most efficiently carried in vessels specially designed for the purpose, and tonnage of that character is limited. If Victoria and New South Wales are very anxious to improve the. occasion by introducing bulk handling under cover of war necessity, let them raise and spend the money on their own account, but the Commonwealth should be careful that it is not mulcted in any expenditure with that ultimate object. In South Australia bulk handling is undoubtedly an open question, and it seems to me that that State has the best of the scheme.

I do not think that the present scarcity of shipping is altogether the result of the operations of the Huns. Beyond doubt there is a certain amount of shipping tied up in neutral countries. The owners, not being rich men, know that it will pay them better to tie up their ships until after the war, when they will be able to pick up cargoes anywhere about the world at high freights. If I were a neutral ship-owner I should certainly tie up my fleet rather than take the risk of submarining, because I should know that after the war I could operate the vessels at a substantial profit. Vessels of that class will be released when peace is declared. Many of the vessels that were coming to Australia before the war no' longer sail under the British flag, because they are not first class, but they can carry Australian wheat, and they will be available for that purpose after the war. Are we more likely to get our wheat to the overseas market by means of those vessels, or by bulk handling? The bulk system cannot be practically considered to-day, and I contend that it is waste of time for farmers and experts to talk about the system unless they solve the. problem of getting the wheat in bulk to the ports of Europe. That question has never been adequately considered. The provision of rolling-stock is another problem. In the United States of America and Canada special rolling-stock is built for the bulk handling of wheat, and I ask, how are we to handle our grain in bulk with the present rolling stock? The provision of special trucks will mean further heavy expenditure. trucks for the purpose. could use a wheelbarrow if he liked, or employ a Chinaman to carry the grain in baskets slung on a pole across his shoulder. We must look at the matter from a practical, business stand-point. In conclusion I urge one or two points of importance. As soon as possible we should agree to the Government proposition, but it should be a proposition sanctioned by this House to limit the expenditure of the Commonwealth to £3,000,000 for the efficient storage of wheat, and that wheat should be stored by February next. Bulk handling should be cut out of the question so far as this Parliament is concerned. It would be a piece of insolent impertinence on our part to dictate what the Parliaments of the States should do. The States can go to any expenditure they choose, but we should not allow the question of bulk handling to be mixed up with the question of the protection of. wheat at the present time, which is the purpose of this Bill. The whole scheme, strikes me as being ill considered. We are about as wise after hearing the, explanation of the Prime Minister as we were before he spoke. We are told that there will be about 6,000,000 tons of wheat in Australia by next February, yet the proposal of the Government is to make provision for protecting only one-third of the normal harvest, which represents about one-fifth of the actual amount of wheat that will need to be protected in Australia. It would appear to me that the Government have not given proper consideration to the matter of providing for the adequate protection of the wheat harvest. The Prime Minister has pointed out that the British Government have purchased the wheat from us. If that is so, it is our duty to take adequate steps to protect not only one-third of the normal harvest, but also all the wheat in the Commonwealth. The scheme now put forward will not do so. Furthermore the Government should furnish us with some details of the scheme. They talk about erecting silos. What will be the nature of these silos? Will they be built of reinforced concrete? What will be the system of conveying the wheat to them? Will it be the first step towards bulk handling? Is the wheat to be brought to the silos in bulk, and stored in the silos in bulk, or are we to continue the first proeess of the present system by conveying the wheat to the silos in bags and then opening them and placing it on conveyors or hoists to be tipped into the silos? What provision is to be made for turning the wheat in the silos after it has lain in them for some time ? What is to be the method of taking it from the silos; will it be taken away in bulk and shipped, or will it be re-bagged for that purpose?

I wish to know what system of handling wheat we are to get for the expenditure of nearly £3,000,000 of Commonwealth money. The storage and protection of wheat is not a matter that concerns the States only. It is a matter that affects the whole of the Commonwealth, and is of concern to the Empire as a whole. The Prime Minister has pointed out that it affects the rights of the Imperial Government who have purchased our wheat. Therefore it is the duty of the Commonwealth to accept full responsibility in regard to the protection of the wheat, and not merely advance £2,850,000 to the States. has initiated the matter. responsibility on to the States. can hardly be separated from the control of the Railways.

MAHONY -A t this stage I do not wish to tell the honourable member what views I hold in regard to the control of the Railways, but the point he has raised does not get away from the responsibility that the Commonwealth Government should assume. We are dealing with something of vital importance, not' only to Australia, but also to the Empire, and surely a Government that has been returned by the people to do everything possible to further the war aims of the Empire should have the courage to assume its responsibilities. I have heard the honourable member for Flinders enunciating the doctrine of suprema lex. Seeing that this is a matter of such great importance to the Empire, surely the Government will use the power, which the honourable member has told us they possess, the power of promoting the safety of the realm, and assume responsibility in connection with this matter. [15] Honourable members may imagine that because the Chief Commissioner will be a representative of the Commonwealth, and will have the right of veto on all matters, the Commonwealth is protected; but that is the weakest point in the whole thing, because the right of veto can only arise when something wrong has been done. This may lead us into a very nasty position. We should protect the Commonwealth beforehand against blunders of State management, and not have power to f step in only after something has been done. Thus we may prevent some of those things that are causing an uneasy feeling in the minds of many people in New South Wales. I am not inclined to make any charges, but in commercial circles in Sydney to-day there is a most uneasy feeling that there is something that the people of the Commonwealth may regret, if the State Governments, especially the Government of New South Wales, are given control in the matter. In the inCommonwealth terest of all parties, the Commonwealth and the Empire as a whole, the Commonwealth Government should say, ""Here is a great national project; something that stands for the protection of our soldiers, .and is going to help us to get on with the war, and something that is going to feed our armies. Let us assume responsibility, There cannot be and control the whole business ourselves."" . Sir WILLIAMIRVINE (Flinders) [12.12] I am a little reluctant to rush in where even angels fear to tread, but I must say, in justification of venturing to take part in this debate, that I represented a purely wheat-growing district for eleven or twelve years, and I gave some little time to the study of the bulk-handling question in Canada. It would be of considerable advantage to the House in dealing with a Bill of such a highly technical nature if we had some one in charge of the House who really knew something about the matter.

Sir WILLIAMIRVINE interjection of the Postmaster-General as an intimation that he is thoroughly equipped with all the knowledge necessary to inform the House upon this matter. The Bill has been placed before us by the Prime Minister as a measure for the preservation of wheat, and as one which did not involve the adoption of the bulkhandling system in Australia, but I am afraid we cannot accept it in that light. I cannot help coming to the conclusion that the Government have swallowed with too great avidity the Commission's report that has been placed before us. If we look into the facts and figures placed before us by that Teport, the whole thing appears to bear the marks of undue haste in dealing with such an important matter. I desire to draw attention to one or two important points that should he considered before the Government proceed to conclude this business. cept the Bill as a mere proposition for the preservation of wheat. To do so, we would need to leave out of account altogether all aspects of the permanent bulk-handling proposition. During the whole time that I was a representative of wheat-growers, and so far as such interests have been concerned since, I have been strongly in favour of the bulk-handling of wheat. But I believe that there are difficulties in the way of its adoption, in Australia which are not met with in Canada. The fact that our wheat is not mostly carried along the same railways is a great, though I do not think an insuperable, difficulty. The Prime Minister, however, has asked us to put aside in the consideration of this proposition the bulk handling question; to view the proposition merely as one for the preservation of a large quantity of wheat which, unfortunately, we are at present unable to ship away. I agree with every word that the right honourable gentleman uttered regarding our moral, if not legal, responsibility for the preservation of this wheat. Now, if we are to deal with the proposition as one for preservation only, we must ask what is the best and most effective, as well as the most economical method of preservation. So viewed, the proposition seems to me uneconomical and unpractical. Although of late years we have become accustomed to the spending of millions of pounds as if they were shilI take the lings, this proposal to spend £3,000,000 is one which should not be agreed to without the careful consideration of the House. There are now in Australia 165,000,000 bushels of wheat of which we cannot get rid, and at the end of the present harvest we shall have approximately another 100,000,000 bushels on hand, making in all 265,000,000 bushels. When we shall get any or all of this wheat away, and how much of it we shall get away, is a matter of the greatest uncertainty, and of the gravest anxiety to others besides ourselves. The capacity of the concrete silos, for the erection of which by the States the Commonwealth is to advance money, will he 49,000,000 bushels, or a little less than one-fifth of the total quantity of wheat that we shall have to preserve, the remaining four-fifths being left without special provision, other than that now existing. I do not say that that fact condemns the proposal; it may be that we cannot do We cannot acmore; but it must be remembered that we are considering a measure for the preservation of only one-fifth of the total quantity of wheat that will have to be preserved. The Commission has estimated the cost of erecting the silos at Is. 2d. per bushel of their capacity, or, in other words, at about £2,850,000. The value of the wheat that is to be stored in the silos is estimated by the Commissioners at the price which the Government is now paying the farmers, namely, 4s. per bushel, that is, at £10,000,000, though it may be a little more. The Bill, then, is a proposal to spend £2,850,000 in preserving for a time £10,000,000 worth of wheat. But the method to be adopted will not protect the stored wheat from devastation by mice. All the experts agree that wheat can be protected from mice without the erection of silos; this method of silo storage is to be adopted to save the stored wheat from possible destruction by .weevil -r-that is, we are being asked to spend £2,850,000, or an insurance premium of more than 28 per cent., to save £10,000,000 l worth of wheat from one particular danger only. many years.",13,Wheat Storage Bill Second Reading

We have the estimate that the cost of turning over , the wheat would be i d . a bushel, to be subsequently reduced to %d. per bushel, but we are not told how many turnings over would be required.

The expenditure may be a wise one, regarding the proposal as one for the initiation of the bulk handling system; but if it is to be regarded as a mere temporary measure for the preservation of a portion of our wheat-whic h is how the Prime Minister asked us to regard it-it should not receive the sanction of the House. As the initiation of the bulk handling system, I do not condemn it. If the States are willing to take the responsibility of constructing the silos with money advanced to them by the Commonwealth, I do not oppose the' introduction of the b l k handing, system, because it u may be a wise and extremely beneficial measure. applies to one-fifth of the wheat. time. ' Sir WILLIAMIRVINE asked to sanction the proposed expenditure as a mere temporary provision to get over an immediate shipping difficulty that will sooner or later be removed, leaving us as we were, the measure is unacceptable. Yet it may or may not provide a wise method of starting the bulk handling system, which, to my mind, will ultimately have to be adopted in Australia.. But viewing the proposal as the initiation of the bulk handling system, there are a few questions which one is naturally inclined to ask. [15]-2 handling system involves the erection of silos into which wheat is delivered by the farmers before being put into the railway trucks-distric t silos-and the erection of other silos at the ports at which In addition the wheat is to be put on board ship, and the provision of proper appliances for loading it into the ships. The House has not yet received information on several important points. ThoughI would welcome the adoption of the bulk handling system, before authorizing it we should have information on several matters of moment. It was stated by the Prime Minister-and his statement seems to be borne out by the report of the Commissioners-that bulk is to be broken at the points where the wheat is put on the rail. The Commissioners refer to the necessity for immediately altering trucks and waggons to enable them to carry the wheat. Therefore I assume that if the Commissioners had in mind a --definite scheme-as to which I feel some doubt-that scheme involves the breaking of bulk, that is, the taking of the wheat out of the bags at the points where its railway transit is to begin. That seems to be borne out by this significant passage in their reportYour Commissioners find that no State has at present sufficient waggons available which would be suitable for the carriage of wheat in bulk without minor alterations, or any special provisioni for cleaning the waggons after their use for ordinary business. They are satisfied, however, that a quick and cheap method of overcoming these points can be found, and are of the opinion that immediate steps should be taken in that direction by the individual States. I have nothing to say for or against those who drew up the report. I do not know their capacity, nor how far they investigated the matters referred to them; but it is clear that they acted hurriedly. If we are ments of New South Wales and Victoria had already had the matter under consideration for months. Sir WILLIAMIRVIN E I am merely concerned now in pointing out that the scheme which the Government ask us to adopt is one under which wheat will be taken out of the bags at the initial, not at the terminal, point of railway transit. It must be then removed in bulk from the trucks to the silos erected at the ports. This involves at least two-thirds of a bulk handling scheme.

Probably they are prepared to do this, but the subject is one on which the House should have information. I come now ""to what, in my opinion, is a somewhat greater difficulty. AlthoughI am entirely in favour of the bulk handling system, believing that its ultimate adoption in Australia is inevitable, the question of whether this is the most suitable time for its introduction, having regard to the war and to our circumstances, depends upon certain facts concerning which we have no information. of shipping. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE point that I have in mind. We shall have in a few months 265,000,000 bushels of wheat which we must send Home. The people of the Old Country must have it if they can possibly secure it , and we must preserve it for them. man says that we must preserve it for them, and yet he holds that as a temporary measure our proposal is not justifiable. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE repeat to the Prime Minister, without being guilty of improper reiteration, what I have said in his absence. I have already conveyed to his colleague, the Postmaster General, my views on this phase of the subject. General's notes of the honourable member's speech. will show the right honourable gentleman that I have pointed out that as a purely preservation scheme this will provide for only one-fifth of the wheat, and at a cost of about 30 per cent, insurance premium on the value of that wheat. I am prepared to consider this proposal, and I think the House will consider it , on its real basis, and t h a t is as the in i iafcion of the bulk handling system, enabling the States that are prepared to do so to introduce that system in which I , for one, believe. But let me state the practical difficulty that I fear. It may be no difficulty at all, or it may be a very serious one. It was to I wish to some extent referred to by the honourable member for Hindmarsh a few minutes ago, and it is as to whether we may not be hampering, rather than helping, the Imperial authorities at this moment oy adopting a scheme for which they may not be able to make, or may not have made, the necessary shipping arrangements. I take it that at some time not later than the beginning of next year the Imperial authorities must, if possible, obtain shipping to carry from Australia to Great Britain as -much as possible of our supply of 265,000,000 bushels of wheat. I do not know-and this is one of the points on which we should like to have some information from the Prime Minister, if he can supply it to us-to what extent the, Imperial authorities may be able to divert to Australia the fleets of slum which hitherto have been engaged in the T h a t is the direct transit of grain in bulk fro m Canada, the Argentine, and other places in America, to England. Those fleets are equipped for the bulk handling of grain. I should think it very probable that when the Imperial authorities desire suddenly to remove, under convoy or otherwise, the bulk of this wheat, they may have to do so by concentrating in Australian waters all the shipping that they can secure from the seas around. I cannot ber will allow me to say so, that is a theoretical, but not a practical difficulty. Such a massing of ships is impossible. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE V e r y well.

Before the war broke out, there was a 50,000,000 tonnage available for the mercantile marine, whereas to-day it is not more than 12,000,000. The United America and Japan are building largely. The former country has on the stocks today more mercantile marine tonnage than has been built in the whole world in any previous year. In addition, they have just issued their standardized plans for the building of 1,000 schooners up to 2,500 tons, with auxiliary screws, and according to the last American mail? by November next it is expected that one of these vessels will leave every day for Great Britain.. Canada also is engaging in shipbuilding. In America, every village from Seattle to Vancouver is building shipping according to the standardized plans. Only four and a half months is allowed from the laying of the keel until the ship is launched; six weeks is allowed for the rigging and completion, and under the contract a ship has to be ready to receive cargo in six months from the commencement of the work on the vessel. According to present progress, in Australia, five years will probably elapse before we produce a single ship. Although we have been three years at war, and the question of shipping has been pressing on us, not one foot of timber has been cut in Australia for the purpose of ship-building; and it is just about time we left off talking and started work. 1 know personally that excellent offers were made months ago to. start ship-building for our Inter-State trade. A first-class ship builder, who served his time on the Clyde, came from Tasmania to Melbourne prepared to immediately lay down the keels for sailing ships of 1,000 and 2,000 tons, with auxiliary screws, for the .Inter-State trade. This man is able to finance 50 per cent, of the cost, and he offered to go on with the work if the Government would guarantee the other 50 per cent, in progress payments, he giving a mortgage over the vessels, There are people ready to charter these boats when completed for five years, at a return of interest on the cost of construction and maintenance, and a decided profit. the Government? ago. for the work? all right, and this man is ready to start the work. The great question we have to carefully consider is whether there States of is any prospect of the wheat we have t in stock being shipped at any time to England, considering that it* is stored 12,000 miles away from our markets. We know that if the war ceased to-morrow, or very shortly, not a bushel of that wheat would be shipped to England, seeing that it can be shipped at much less cost from other producing countries. I do not believe that 1,000 tons of the wheat we have will ever get to Great Britain, because there will be an enormous release from Russia and from some of the southern countries of Europe. Then, there is going to be a record crop in Canada, where wheat has been raised solely for. war purposes, and'the United States of America has an exceedingly large crop, which is only seven or eight days' sail in cargo boats from England. We, as I say, are 12,000 miles away, and the freight from Australia is three or four times as much as that from other countries. It is a serious fact that we are storing millions of bushels of wheat which is now being destroyed. Two years ago I saw a stack of wheat in Perth that was riddled by weevil, and the whole of the wheat in Australia to-day is depreciating. May I say that the management of the storage of wheat is, in my opinion, the most de-",17,Wheat Storage Bill Second Reading

116,Mr Mcwilliams,"The timber isplorable fact in Australia, so far as incompetence and want of foresight are concerned! Millions of bushels of wheat are being destroyed steadily every day, and yet wheat is at a record price here-a£ T such a price that it cannot be bought for fodder purposes. It is a matter for very serious consideration wfiether the Wheat Board should not visability of releasing a considerable portion of this wheat at a reduced price, rather than allow it to rot. I defy any man to study the position of the shipping capabilities of the world to-day, and express any hope that any great portion of this wheat will ever reach Great Britain. Ifi t is intended to keep this wheat in store, and to store next year's crop, then most emphatically something should be done to protect it . Up to the present nothing has been done. The extent of the depreciation cannot be estimated, but those of practical experience tell us that it has been enormous. When we consider that, the seas once open, the wheat from Australia will have to compete with a first-class article from three to five times nearer to the market, our prospects in this regard are exceedingly limited. Before the Government embark on any very large expenditure, they should at least assure themselves that there is more than a reasonable probability of the wheat reaching its destination. There are ships in Australia which could have been released for the oversea trade if the wooden shipbuilding for the Inter-State trade had been engaged in, and I urge the Government to lose no more time in starting the industry. This is one of the best, cleanest, and healthiest of trades, working, as the men do, in the open air, under cover, and it has always produced here one of the highest types of worker. It is an industry that should have never been allowed to lapse, and the sooner it is reinstated the better for the people of Australia and the better, especially, for our Inter-State trade. Do' honourable members know that practically every port in Tasmania to-day is blocked because produce cannot be got away to Australia, and that hundreds of men are out of employment because some of the largest'timber mills have been shut down? The Inter-State trade in Tasmania displays a congestion that is deplorable.

[Quorum formed.] should inform the Committee whether the silos are to be constructed of reinforced -concrete. If that is the intention a tremendous quantity of cement, will be required. Judging from the report, the most economical style of silo will be one with a capacity of 50,000 bushels, and as the scheme is to handle 50,000,000 bushels, about 1,000 silos will be required. In view of the magnitude of the contract, the Government might well consider whether it would not be better for them to purchase outright the whole of the cement required, or purchase cement works. Honourable members may argue that the Commonwealth will not spend this money, and that ultimately it will have to be found by the wheat farmers, but we shall be failing in our duty if we do not use every precaution to see that' the money is expended to the best possible advantage. The farmers will conclude that the whole scheme has been carefully considered by the Federal Parliament, and will feel assured that they are not paying too much for it. The State Governments will regard the scheme as having been practically recommended by this Legislature.

The quant it y and value of the product concerned, in relation to the population and the available means of disposing of it , are, I think, without precedent. It is generally admitted that there will .be at least 5,000,000 tons of wheat in the Commonwealth in February next, and I ask honourable members, "" What are we going to do with this huge and valuable yet perishable asset t What are we to do with We have no control over the next season's crop ?"" Honourable members may speak of bulk handling, and say that the South Australian Government does not agree with the methods of storage proposed in this B ill . There rests upon this Government the solemn and grave responsibility of preserving this great asset for which we have not, and in all human probability cannot have, any outlet in the immediate future. There is hot any means at the disposal of B r it a in and her Allies by which the present season's crop, plus next season's crop, can be disposed of before the t h i rd I have had a conversation season's crop is upon us. Suppose we raked the seas, and brought here all the shipping necessary for our requirements. Taking into consideration the submarine menace, and its effect upon the amount of available shipping tonnage-honorabl e members may gather what that means partly from the published statistics of the losses each weelt-if we brought all available ships here and loaded them with wheat only-which , of course, would be absolutely impossible because, although wheat is needed, other things are needed it would be impossible to take the wheat but of this country in the time. The position is, the wheat is here, and here it must remain for a very considerable time. We' have not sufficient tonnage to ship it . Eveni f we had the shipping we could not ship the wheat before the 1919 harvest was upon us. There are no facilities here for handling such an immense amount of cargo in the time. The Leader of th© Opposition knows very well that it would be impossible to do it , because he and I went into the matter at considerable length at the outset of this proposition. The greatest amount of wheat ever handled in Australia in any season prior to this war has been 1,250. 000 tons, and that was at a time when all the fleets of the world were at our disposal, when We all we had to do was to pay the normal freight to secure all the shipping we asked for. The farmer must look at the matter from this aspect. He is relieved of the responsibility of keeping in good order and condition wheat the Government have sold to Great Britain, but we are not relieved of the responsibility. We cannot, and ought not to attempt to evade that responsibility.

Twenty-five years hence the silos will be as good as when first erected. Their sites w ill be selected with, due regard to the requirements of bulk handling. We propose to go as f a r in providing storage as we deem prudent, and to adopt a method suited to that system of handling which every country whose ambition it is to become a great exporter of wheat must eventually accept. We live in great times. There are some amongst us who take a pessimistic view of the future of this great country. They need not do so. Excepti n one respect, we are the most favourably situated of all the nations. We produce the things of which the world is becoming daily more court asked a question in the House of Commons about the future meat supply of Great Britain. When I was in France, the Government of that country agreed to grant us most-favoured-nation treatment in regard to the importation of meat. France is a country which used not to import cattle, but is now compelled to do so. Germany is alleged to be eating up her tremendous herds, and when the war is over there will probably be a great dearth of cattle. Moreover, at the present time, at least 12,000,000 men are living on the best food that they have ever eaten, and they will not be content to go back to the meagre diet that sufficed them formerly, but w ill demand wheat and meat in ampler measure. The United States of America is nearly at the end of porting country. Its population is outgrowing its production of wheat. Canada has an enormous quantity of wheat to export, and its wheat lands are wide and fertile, but the world's demand is so large that there is room for us, too. all, as a merino-wool producing country, Australia need not fear the future if she properly organizes her resources, and provides against the temporary dislocation that must follow on the heels of the war. 1 Western Australia was not represented nor the Governments of the States are at the Conference, but this morning I had committed to any particular contractor or a telegram from its Premier stating that tenderer. It was decided'tentatively last his Government was in cordial co-operation with the object the Commonwealth has in view in this matter. Since the Conference there has been a change of Government in South Australia, and the new Government does not approve of this proposal. I cannot help that. Governments pass on their liabilities to their successors, and the last South Australian Government passed on to the present Government its liabilities in regard to this undertaking. If the present South Australian Government repudiates the arrangement, that is its own affair. I called a conference which was attended by the then Premier of South Australia, the Premier of Victoria, the Acting Premier of New South Wales, and other Ministers. Should there be a change of Government in Victoria next week, are we to be told that Victoria will not come into this arrangement! Business cannot be transacted in that way. If this Parliament tells us that the scheme must be proceeded with, we shall go on with it . We cannot serve two masters. The State authorities were consulted, and what has been done has been undertaken at their request Whatever individual State Governments may do now, the Commonwealth Government must take its instructions from this Parliament. One word about cement The proposed silos are each to be 71 feet high and 36 feet in diameter, with a capacity of 50,000 bushels, and it w ill take a great deal of cement to build them.

141,Mr Tudor,S o large an amount of,23,Wheat Storage Bill Second Reading
142,Mr Hughes,"I assure the honorFriday that the design of the silos should be determined by the Commissioners to be appointed under the Bill, and they will fix the cost of the structures at per bushel of their capacity. Therefore, the question who is to be the contractor for their construction is of less importance than it would otherwise be. As a matter of fact, the question of contract has not been considered. It is a purely State matter,'but one in which, as we are finding them the money, we have, and must .have, a considerable voice. Coming now to the point raised by the honourable member for Wakefield, I would say that he is in error, if he thinks I wish to force any State to adopt a particular system. I have no such desire. It would be impossible, however, for the Pool to carry on its operations if one State adopted one system while the other States adopted another. If South Australia elects to remain outside the scheme if it does not erect silos-the wheat raised in that State will be charged storage just as if it had erected them. If that were not insisted upon wheat-growers in South Australia would obtain more for their produce than would those in the other States. Take the position in any one State. In one part of Victoria, let us say, wheat can be kept without trouble. Is the farmer in that part of Victoria to receive more for his wheat than the farmer in another part of the same State where storage must be provided to protect it from the ravages of mice or from the weevil? Certainly not. The principle underlying the Bill is that all farmers are treated alike; the expenses and benefits of the Pool are spread equally over them. That, I think, is fair. I venture to believe that when the Government* of South Australia know the whole of the facts much of their objection to this proposal will disappear. As to the rest, we shall be ready to listen to any suggestions they may make. But it will be impossible to manage the affairs of the Wheat Pool unless all wheat-producing States are placed on the same footing. That applies, and must apply, to all wheat, and has applied to wheat right through. On the whole, I think it may fairly be said that farmers have all been treated fairly; certainly all have been treated alike. There may be room for improvement in the treatment which they have received, but at any rate there is not Mr Bugnes. that dissatisfaction which arises where some are treated differently from others. not think the Prime Minister can exaggerate the importance of this subject. We are up against a very difficult problem. The only objection I have relates not to the measure, but to the fact that the country has not been given a fair test as between the adoption of the bulk handling scheme and the retention of the present system. I regret that the Government did not come out into the open and say, "" We are going to test the feeling of the country upon the bulk handling system."" Had they done so, I believe .they may have converted the whole country to the acceptance of this scheme. I should have liked the country to go into the whole question of primal costs and storage under the bulk handling system, and the cost of converting rolling stock, as well as of farm conversion and the necessary shipping conversion. Those are considerations which must be faced. But I cannot see the merits of this proposal if it be segregated, and dealt with solely as a wheat-preservation proposition. Oh the Prime Minister's own showing, we shall have shortly to deal with 265,000,000 bushels of wheat, whereas this scheme provides for the preservation of only 49,000,000 bushels. Australia has had no previous experience of the keeping properties of wheat; no one in this country can tell us how long wheat grown in the temperate districts, subject to coastal influences, will keep, or how long wheat grown in the warmer climates will resist weevil. As to the other conditions, I am satisfied thab wheat grown in the inland districts can be preserved. As a grower of wheat, I have no doubt as to that. Wheat is, so to speak, better able to look after itself than anything else produced by the farmer The wheat berry has wonderful powers of endurance. My own doubt is as to its power to resist the weevil. I heard with some disappointment the statement made by the Prime Minister, while the honourable member for Flinders was speaking, that not wheat but flour was to be stored in these silos. WhatI said wag that, when introducing the Bill, I pointed out that if we could put our wheat into flour, we could save 25 per cent, of freight space. In that way we would keep our mills employed and produce large quantities of offal,",23,Wheat Storage Bill Second Reading

144,Mr Hughes,"I did not say that.which would mean abundance of cheap food for our stock. That being so, I said we were going to endeavour to ship as 'much flour as possible. That cannot be done unless we have stores in which to place that flour. We have no such stores at present, but this scheme will provide us with such accommodation. mills are filled almost to their very doors, and that our local consumption, including seed wheat, will account for only one-third of our wheat production. The Commonwealth has guaranteed to the farmer for the next two years 4s. per bushel f.o.b. for his wheat. will lose money. The farmer is told that cost of constructing storage accommodation under this scheme will amount to Is. 2d. per bushel.

I am not satisfied, however, that this proposal can be segregated, and that it is not an inseparable part of the bulk handling system. and commits Australia to, that system. If we were not eventually to adopt that system, then we should have incurred an expenditure in this respect which would not be justifiable even in such an emergency as that with which we are faced. We have not had placed before us expert information as to how long wheat could be preserved in the northern areas on concrete floors with skeleton roofs. That is the most acceptable form of storage up to date. I am not comparing it with the bulk handling system. a long while under, those conditions. only thing we have to fear. you have put your wheat into such sheds you have simply to trust to God; you cannot tell what is going on, or what new pests may be there. On the other hand,when wheat is placed in the cylindersin the silos-it is turned over at certain periods, aerated and examined so that you know where you are. emphasize the necessity for a wider measure than we have at present before us. In normal times,a little more storage than that provided for in this B ill would be sufficient for the whole of our wheat, because under ordinary conditions we have ships coming into port to take our wheat away as fast as it reaches the If we adopted bulk sea-board. In such circumstances an extensive system of storage is unnecessary. What we have to consider is whether we should take the risk of damage to four-fifths of our wheat in respect .of which we are committed to the extent of 4s. per c bushel, or whether we should go further and incur an additional cosb of Is. 2d. per bushel as the primal expenditure necessary to provide storage for a larger quantity.

I thoroughly agree with the Prime Minister that it is our duty to do everything in our power to keep our stores of wheat in perfect order. It is quite certain that if this is not done the right honourable gentleman w ill not be able to make another deal of the kind with the British Government. In my opinion, the transaction has helped Britain, and has helped the farmers of Australia; indeed, I do not know what we should have done if tbe money had not been brought into the country at the time it was. circumstances, the Prime Minister is deserving of the thanks and help of every man in trying to protect the wheat, which means not only the food of our own people, but of our boys over the water. Next year, if we have a dry season, we may run short, and we know that in the olden days the rulers always took good care of the food of the community For many years to come Bussia will not be able to grow the wheat that she has in the past,; indeed, if that country goes on as at present, she will soon have neither wheat nor people. The Prime Minister has a good grasp of tlie question. wheat is much more difficult to keep in some parts of Australia than in others; and in that he is perfectly correct. ought at once to get to work on the erection of sheds, whether they be called "" s i l o s "" or by any other name, because they will always be useful. Cement can be made cheaply in every State of the Commonwealth, and can be used for both sides and roofs, obviating entirely the use of iron. I was greatly struck at observing the process of bulk handling in Canada. the Canadian system here at once, owing to the nature of our coast-line; but in Canada, at Minneapolis, I saw great trains laden with wheat pass through a huge mill, where 16,000 bags of flour were turned out every day, untouched by the hand of man in its manufacture. If we cannot handle the wheat in bulk, we ouffht to make sure that our stores are kept in proper order; and if the Prime Minister sees that this is done, and proceeds, generally, on broad liberal lines, he will have the support of the whole people. Let us get our wheat away, and paid for, if possible, for unless we bring money into the country we shall inevitably become very poor. I shall be pleased to support the Government in this work in every way in my power. gratulate the Prime Minister on the manner in which he has dealt w i th the measure, which should be acceptable to every honourable member. W it h the honourable member for South Sydney, I regard it as advisable that the work under this B ill 'should be brought more under the control of the Federal Parliament. The Stale should be called upon to send in plans and specifications, with a f u l l report for consideration by this Parliament, and we should have the power to veto or Under the confirm the expenditure proposed. I cannofc understand the objections raised to this measure by our South Australian friends. All the States will be on the one footing. The Prime Minister has told us that, in view of the war, it is probable that we shall have to hold wheat for something like three or four years. What condition would bags of wheat be in at the end of that period ? If silos are erected in South Australia the farmers there will have to unbag their wheat just as we shall have to do in New South Wales. The silos are to be constructed in such a way that they may be used as ordinary stores, or in conjunction with bulk handH e pointed out that ling, and the arrangement, I think, shows great foresight on the part of the Prime Minister. If the buildings could be used We only .for silos there might be some objection, but I think that as they can be used for the dual purpose it is only a question of time when the honourable member for Wakefield and others will be found heartily supporting bulk handling. I am surprised at the attitude of the South Australian members, because, as a matter of fact, ib was South Australian settlers who taught us in New SouthI do not think we could adopt Wales how to farm. In the matter of the handling of wheat, however, the South Australians seem to be lagging behind, and putting obstacles in the way of the progress of up-to-date farming. I am not a prophet, but I am the son of a clergyman, and I predict! that in a year or two we shall find the honourable member for Wakefield one of the strongest advocates of bulk handling.

As members of the Commission will have to travel all over the wheat growing areas of Australia, it ought to be possible for them to supply valuable information in respect to any temporary storage that may be necessary. I understand the honourable member for Wakefield hasan amendment conforming to my suggestion, namely, that the Commission should be requested to make recommendations for temporary storage in respect of the balance of wheat that cannot be stored in permanent silos. We know whab happened last year under the pool owing to the ravages of the mice, and we want to secure some better protection for our wheat in the future. [3.48]:I move That the following new paragraph be added to the clause :(d) arrange with the Governments of the respective States for the erection of such other temporary structures as may be found necessary. The^ Prime Minister was good enough to suggest the means by which the very itrong objection I raised, owing to the peculiar position of South Australia, has been' practically removed. The amendment will secure the protection of the entire grain stocks in Australia. wondering how far this amendment will commit 'Parliament to a further expenditure. I am not sure if we have passed through Committee the message appropriating this particular amount, but that -jan be dealt with later.

Minister said that he would .consider the request favourably. of additionalfloorsin Victoria would cost £250,000, there should be a similar amount of expenditure in the three other States, so that this work may involve us in the expenditure of an additional £1,000,000. The silos, which are to cost £2,850,000, will not account for more than one-fifth of the grain. How much more expenditure will we be committed to if we are to provide floors for only the remaining four-fifths? silos; private firms also have silos, so that it will not be four-fifths. asked for more than they required and more than they expected to get. I am anxious to know from the Prime Minister to what extent the amendment of the honourable member for Wakefield will commit us; whether, if we agree to erect silos, we are also committed to the cost of providing floors for the balance of the wheat. ister and Attorney-General) [3.53] I am prepared, to agree to the amendment g rovided that its effect is to give the Commission a greater scope for the exercise of its discretion. I do not contemplate the erection of temporary structures which will cover all the wheat. HadI done so I would have come down with a measure which would have been sufficient for that purpose. It is obvious that a temporary structure that will cover 1,000,000 tons can be erected at a lower cost than a permanent silo to contain 100,000 tons. I do not say that I shall not come down to the House subsequently,' if necessary, and ask this Parliament to do something more in regard to protecting wheat. If I found such additional storage necessary, I should be wrong not to do so; but when I accept this amendment I do not contemplate adding to the liability or the scope of the Commission so far as expenditure is concerned. I merely propose to allow it to cut off some of the silos in the drier districts, and erect in their place structures which will give reasonably ample protection, thus spreading the protection over a larger quantity of wheat. ThoughI am desirous of meeting the views of honourable members, I do not wish it to be understood that we are abandoning the principle of silo construction. For seven-eighths of the wheat If the provision silos will be provided.

We ought to be careful, in dealing with a Bill which appropriates money, to see that it is preceded by a message from the Crown recommending the appropriation for a particular purpose; and the larger the amount involved the more careful we should be. In this case we are embarking on a huge undertaking with the smallest amount of information ever submitted to honourable members.

I believe from the few figures I have put together that the cost is quite likely to be doublewhat is estimated. been made to the fact that in some cases it may be necessary to purchase sites for the silos. I doubt whether the New South Wales Railways Commissioners or the Sydney Harbor Trust hold land which could be used for the erection of silos; arid, if land for the purpose has to be purchased in Sydney, we know that it will be very costly. Land anywhere near wharfs or railways is very valuable. cost a great deal to purchase land, if that be necessary, for the erection of silos at some of the country stations which would be suitable central depots for the storage of wheat. Honourable members may be agreed that the erection of silos is highly desirable, but the responsibility of giving the House some information as to the probable cost of carrying out the proposals rests upon the Government, especially at this time, when we know that economy in public expenditure must be studied. I admit that economy may be practised to such an extent as to be dangerous to the public interest, but we should have more definite information than has yet been given of the probable cost of this proposal. Some years ago, when Sir Henry Parkes introduced a measure to provide a water supply for Sydney, I happened to be in favour of a rival proposal-the Kenny Hill scheme. I waited with a deputation upon Sir Henry Parkes, arid submitted to him actual figures, which showed that the Kenny Hill scheme could be carried out for £1,000,000. We reminded him at the same time that the scheme he proposed would cost anything between £5,000,000 and £7,000,000. He replied, "" Gentlemen, you may be quite correct in your figures. I do not doubt one word that you say."" And, turning to me, he said, "" I shall be quite satisfied, West, if you leave this matter alone."" I asked him why I should do so, and he said, "" IfI tell the public of New South Wales what the Government scheme is going to cost, Parliament will never vote the money, and there will be no water supply."" I do not know whether the present Government, in submitting these proMr West. posals, are following the example of Sir Henry Parkes. The day has gone by for that sort of thing. There was a difference of opinion between country and city members in connection with, the Sydney Some reference has water supply, but this is a matter in which the whole of the people of Australia are concerned. The Government should be made, to understand that honourable members will refuse to consent to schemes of this kind unless they are supplied with ful l information, especially as to cost. If he were on this side of the House, no one would be keener than the Prime Minister in urging that the It will people's representatives should not be kept in the dark with respect to public expenditure. An amendment has just been accepted to make provision for concrete floors for some of the temporary structures. Some of these will cover a space of 200 feet by 70 feet or 80 feet. In many of the country districts it would be useless to put down less than 6 inches of concrete, and with ah inch of cement on top this would cost, in many cases, 15s. per yard. I believe that the Prime Minister is-not aware of how much additional expenditure is involved in the acceptance of the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Wakefield. spent. will not. I am protesting that honourable members do not know what they are voting for. They do not know what is likely to be the actual cost of giving effect to the Government proposal. It will cost a great deal of money to lay down concrete in some of the country districts. Sharp sand, grit, and metal will be required, and in some places the cost of these materials will exceed that of the cement. I venture to assert that even the Prime Minister does not know the extent of the burden which he is putting on the Treasury. I express no opinion as to the goodness or badness of the scheme. I believe that the silos will be as useful after the war as in the immediate future, and only the future will show whether the system of bulk handling is the right one for Australia to adopt.
