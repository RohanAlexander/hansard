By a commercial arrangement an undertaking was given that within six months Australia would endeavor to come to a trade agreement with Belgium. In the matter of arranging: trade agreements with different countries, many difficulties confront the Government. Strong efforts were made to come to a favorable trade agreement with Belgium, but it was found impossible to reach finality within the period allotted. new arrangement for the extension by two months of the period allowed^ and during that time the negotiations will Droceed. It is hoped that, an agreement will be arrived at. Meanwhile, there is no ban upon the entry of Australian barley into Belgium, but the embargo upon beef still exists. ACT.

As the principal manufacturing company has undertaken to purchase all the higher grades and 'he ordinary usings of the darker grades, it follows that a proportion of the usable leaf carried over from previous years will be absorbed, because the ordinary usings of Australian leaf are in the vicinity of 4,000,000 lb. As the honourable member is well aware, some of the tobacco that is carried over from year to year is not usable. Therefore, it can hardly be expected that the whole of the carry-over can be bought. Belgium has now made a fact that the bulk of the tobacco now held in Australia is nearly two years old, and that the growers have not had any intimation from the manufacturers as to whether that old tobacco will be bought, will the Minister for Trade and Customs suggest to the manufacturers that they should meet, in conference, representatives of the Australian Tobacco-growers Association with a view to a definite proportion of that two-year-old tobacco being bought forthwith? the honourable member, from a recent re.port, that there is quite a lot of tobacco even in the district which he represents which is not usable.

Mr Thomas replied that he would make personal investigations wherever possible. I ask the Assistant Treasurer whether that statement is accurate, and if he is prepared to make a statement showing the allocation of the money that was voted by this Parliament to provide compensation for these settlers? reference, but in any event the responsibility for the allocation of the money is on the Government of Victoria. The whole responsibility of the Commonwealth Government was, practically speaking, to advance to the State Government of Victoria the sum of £100,000, and the matter was then arbitrated as to where the responsibility lay for the finding of the money. The arbitrator found against the .State of Victoria so that that State is responsible for finding and allocating the money, and the only responsibility of the Commonwealth is to advance the money temporarily to the State of Victoria. was considering the allocation of certain moneys for the assistance of British migrants settled in Victoria, the Assistant Treasurer and other members of the Government stated in reply to criticism on the part of members of our party that the money which was then being voted would be used for the purpose, not of satisfying creditors, but of directly assisting these unfortunate settlers. I desire to know what authority the Assistant Treasurer had for making that statement and whether he is now prepared to admit that the contention of the members of our party, that the money would be used to satisfy creditors, was correct? taking part in the particular debate in any way; in fact I am quite certain that I did not do so. The terms on which this Parliament was asked to find temporarily the sum of £100,000 were clearly set forth in the bill. The subsequent arrangement as to how the money should be expended was to be the responsibility of Victoria. Now as the result of arbitration, the final responsibility is wholly on Victoria, and it is a matter, therefore, which does not concern this Parliament.

When I came into office I endeavoured to straighten it out on the basis of equity to the users of dictaphones and to the general public. Subsequently, I arrived at a basis which was fair to the department and to the user of the dictaphone. Although it involved an increase in the trunk line rates for the use of dictaphones, it has generally been accepted. In some instances additional dictaphones have been installed, and in other instances tele-printers have been substituted. I frankly admit that in .some cases the dictaphones have been taken out altogether. The position is perfectly fair. The payment in advance is in accordance with the policy prevailing in respect of the payment of telephone rates by private users, and I see no reason why it should be altered in the interests of one section of the community. for the Interior given any consideration to the matters which I raised last night in respect of compensation payments to men who were injured when the Commonwealth was in control of the Cockatoo Island Dockyard?

Trade and Customs) [11.1] -by leave^I move That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to provide machinery to enable the Government to comply with certain provisions contained in article 9 of the trade agreement concluded with New Zealand last year. The agreement itself was approved and ratified by Parliament in November last. Article9 provides that where the rate of duty on particular New Zealand goods entering Australia is higher than the rate of duty on the like Australian goods entering New Zealand the New Zealand Government may request the Commonwealth Government to admit like New Zealand goods into Australia at the rate of duty payable on the like Australian goods entering New Zealand. If the Commonwealth Government fails to comply with the request within three months, the New Zealand Government is free to impose on the particular Australian goods a duty not greater than that imposed in Australia on the same goods from New Zealand. The provision is a reciprocal one. While Parliament has been in recess, three applications have been received from the New Zealand Government requesting the Commonwealth to concede to New Zealand the equivalent of the New Zealand rate on knitted or lock-stitched piece goods of silk or artificial silk, unmounted wireless receiving sets, and dry batteries and dry cells. New Zealand accords free entry to Australia for all these goods, and there is a substantial and growing export trade from Australia in each item. of this bill affect, say, 'butter ? vernment may make a request, but there is no obligation upon the Commonwealth Government to agree to it.

For the three-year period, 1930-33, our total exports to New Zealand were valued at £8,352,203, and our imports from New Zealand were valued at £3,072,562. It is the same story whether we consider primary or secondary production. The Australian rates of duty as applied to New Zealand goods of the three classes I have mentioned are high, and practically preclude the New Zealand goods from the Australian market. There is little doubt that if New Zealand applied the Australian rates it would result in the I , therefore, ask honourable members to loss of the New'Zealand market for these goods. With Parliament in recess, and in the absence of the necessary enabling machinery, it has not been practicable to meet the earliest of the New Zealand requests within the time provided in the agreement. Our inability to meet the first New Zealand request within the time limit has been explained to the Dominion Government with which arrangements have been made to meet the position. The general provision proposed under this amendment is necessary to enable any future requests, from New Zealand to be met within the prescribed three months, and to obviate similar difficulties in the future. In its absence, and where it is desired to meet similar New Zealand requests, action can only be taken by the introduction into the House of Representatives of individual tariff resolutions. Circumstances will arise in which it will not be possible to introduce a resolution within the time the article allows. The consequences might easily be very serious f.oy Australia's trade with New Zealand. It is perhaps desirable to explain that the provisions of the article are not applicable throughout the entire range of the Australian tariff. contains two schedules,applying respectively to New Zealand goods and Australian goods, in which are enumerated various classes of goods and the rates of duty applying thereto. Goods other than those enumerated in the schedules are subject to the British preferential tariff of Australia or New Zealand, as the case may be. The article applies only to the goods which are not enumerated in the schedules to the agreement and which are subject in general terms to the rates of duty for the time being in force under the respective British preferential tariffs. The proposed amendment does not alter the original agreement. Its purpose, as I have said, is to provide the means to carry certain of the provisions of the original agreement into effect. The proposed amendment merely sets up the machinery whereby Australia can accord to New Zealand the same rates of duty as New Zealand accords to Australia whenever the New Zealand Government so requests. The provision of the necessary machinery is a matter of urgency. give this hill a speedy passage. New Zealand is a very large buyer of Australian secondary products, whereas -exports of manufactured goods from New Zealand to Australia are practically negligible. Failure to meet the New Zealand request would mean a severe loss to Australia. The members of the Opposition supported the trade agreement between New Zealand and Australia when it was submitted to Parliament last year, because they believed that it would foster amicable trade relations between the two dominions. We also thought that there was a great possibility of our developing an export trade with New Zealand, particularly in manufactured goods.

We desire our manufacturers to conduct their business on such an efficient basis that they will be able not only to supply the home market, but also to build up an export trade and so give employment to an additional 500,000 people in the factories of Australia.

I am not content to await press statements issued by the Minister regarding his negotiations with New Zealand immediately before the elections. Canberra was the direct result of the visit of the Minister to New Zealand. to assume that because he knows everything that occurred at the conference all honourable members should be equally well informed. Conferences of that kind held under the Government's supervision are not always fully representative of the interests concerned. Large numbers of growers may be opposed to the decisions arrived at, but they will be denied an opportunity to express their opinions unless the matter is fully discussed in Parliament where their representatives may speak for them. I appreciate the desire of the Minister to expedite the passage of this bill, but he ought, I think, to have given honourable members some further information on the matter. It is admittedly desirable to encourage trade with our sister dominion, but it behoves every one of us to look after the interests of his own section of that trade. I am concerned with the apple trade, *and with the proposal to admit New Zealand apples to Australia on more favorable terms. What is the present duty on New Zealand apples? central. the New Zealand Government guarantees an f.o.b. price to the growers for all apples exported from that dominion. Therefore, a duty of 3s. a central will not prevent the New Zealand growers from shipping their apples to Australia and competing unfairly with our own Australian producers. That is a serious prospect for our growers, and I should like to hoar the Minister's opinion of it. I know that the Minister has endeavoured to secure the co-operation of the New Zealand Government regarding quotas and varieties of apples exported the agreement to reduce duties on New to Europe, but New Zealand does not Zealand products, but if we do not do seem inclined to come to an understanding. The same thing may happen in regard to the Australian market. It may be that certain varieties of apples which, under the agreement, we are not allowed to export, will be sent by New Zealand to the Australian market. We should be given some more detailed information on these points. The hill refers to certain schedules, but copies of those schedules have not been supplied to honourable members. During the last recess the Minister for Commerce visited New Zealand, but no report on his visit has yet been presented, nor has any statement been made regarding the result of the recent conference in Canberra of Australian and New Zealand representatives. It may be that, under this bill, New Zealand butter will be admitted to Australia in competition with Australian butter. It may also happen that New Zealand meat, butter and bacon will be admitted to the detriment of our primary producers, who surely should be entitled to their own home market. When the butter pool was first formed in Queensland, and a price fixed for butter consumed locally, supplies of butter were imported from New Zealand in an endeavour to smash the pool; and that would certainly have happened had not the Federal Government increased the duty on New Zealand butter. The Minister said that the bill would assist our secondary industries.

While we all agree that it is desirable to foster with New Zealand trade that will be beneficial to both countries, it must be remembered that it is difficult to make such an arrangement without its being detrimental to some section of tins primary producers in one country or the other. I am afraid that, when entering into negotiations with other countries in connection with trade agreements, the Minister is not always so fully informed as he might be as to the possible effects of the proposed agreement. I do not desire to reflect upon the capacity of the Minister; he has to rely a great deal on others for information to guide him in. these negotiations. I know that certain discussions are inow proceeding, and that committees have been inquiring into the matters covered by the agreements, and have submitted recommendations. But I suggest to the Minister that the members of these committees are not sufficiently well informed to advise him. Directors of Agriculture and departmental health officers meet together and advise the Minister as to the effect of certain embargoes. after all, they know very little about the economics of the different industries affected by the imposition of these embargoes. acquainted with the personnel of these for Commerce) [11.35] -The honourable committees to know that they are well member for Darwin( Mr Bell) has versed in the technical side of the industry, but know little of the economic effect of their recommendations.

As an illustration, at the present time we are negotiating with Canada for a supplementary trade agreement. The Canadian Parliament is going into recess, probably during this month, and is not likely to meet again until after the commencement of the new year. In the meantime, no matter whether the terms of the agreement arrived at between the respective governments should be put into immediate operation, ratification has to be delayed until both parliaments meet. It can readily be seen that this must present a difficulty to the detriment of both parties to the agreement. As a good deal has been said in respect to my recent visit to New Zealand, I think it necessary to give briefly the hismend the abolition of all embargoes, and tory of the embargoes which are at present operative between the Commonwealth and New Zealand. Some time ago, on the recommendation of the technical officers of the Commonwealth, an embargo was placed on the importation from New Zealand of apples and pears and nursery stocks because of the fear of the introduction into Australia of fire-blight. A similar embargo was placed against the importation of potatoes from New Zealand because of the prevalence of corky scab and powdery scab. New Zealand naturally resented the imposition of this embargo, claiming that we were not bona fide in our assertion that the embargoes were imposed for quarantine purposes, and it was only after the unfortunate experience of tbe visitation of thrips to Australia three or four _years ago, when there would have been a good market for New Zealand apples which the dominion was desirous of exploiting, that it resolved to have a complete understanding with Australia on the matter. Eighteen months ago, New Zealand imposed a counter embargo on the importation from Australia of citrus fruits. This, as indicated by the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr the States of the Commonwealth declare Beasley), was a very serious blow to the citrus fruit-growers of Australia. not a proclamation issued prohibiting the importation of onions into New Zealand? was brought into force because the onions and other vegetables were likely to be infected with Mediterranean fruit fly. One of the objects of my visit to New Zealand was to confer with the dominion authorities on this matter. I found the position that confronted me very difficult. Unfortunately, I had to overcome the feeling in New Zealand that Australia was not "" playing the game."" As a result of my negotiations, however, a conference was arranged between the technical officers of the New Zealand Administration and our own officers, in order that the issues between the two countries could be fully discussed. That conference was held in Canberra last Monday week, and its findings have been made public, indicating that the technical officers of both administrations are now prepared to recomto suggest that the necessary protection against the introduction of diseases into either country can be secured by setting up a process of certification of exnorts from both countries. existing between Victoria and Tasmania prohibiting the importation into Victoria of Tasmanian potatoes because of the prevalence of corky scab. Yet the Victorian market may be open to New Zealand potatoes. against the importation of Tasmanian potatoes into Victoria is imposed for the same reason that Australia shut out the New Zealand potatoes. The Victorian representatives were present at the conference in Canberra, but under instructions they did not enter into the discussion because there is at the present time litigation proceeding between Tasmania and Victoria as to the validity of the embargo on the importation of Tasmanian potatoes. The Victorian representatives sat in conference and heard the representatives of New Zealand and that it was no longer necessary to prohibit the importation of New Zealand potatoes because of the danger of the introduction of scab. We are hopeful that one of the results of the conference will be that better relations will be established between Tasmania and Victoria.

The primage duties proposals of the 4th October, 1933, provided for a new departure and reduced the primage duty on goods eligible for admission under the British preferential tariff and subject to protective duties under the cus1 toms tariff from 10 per cent, to 5 per cent. The two main reasons for this action were:-(1 ) To give effect, as far as the finances would permit, to the Tariff Board's recommendation on the protective incidence of primage duties; and (2) to carry out, as far as was possible under the then financial conditions, Australia's obligations under article 14 of the United Kingdom and Australia Trade Agreement in respect to primage on British goods. Considerable relief, amounting to approximately £585,000, has been given by way of the reductions of primage duties which were made in connection with the budget for 1933-34. revenue derived from primage duties represents a substantial item in the Commonwealth's receipts; in 1932-33 it amounted to over £4,500,000. Practically the whole of the imported goods directly affecting the primary industries have been either exempted from primage duty or made subject to the low rate of 4 per cent. The Government has at all times realized the necessity for removing as far a3 is reasonably possible, any burden that presses unduly upon the primary industries. emergency taxation before anything else. Mr ""WHITE -This is emergency taxation, and it concerns some very destitute persons about whom I have heard the honourable member speak in this chamber. It will be appreciated that the Government, since it assumed office, has gone as far as it can in providing relief from these duties, and that any future alterations will he dependent upon the state of the treasury. This motion has been brought on unexpectedly. Certainly, the Minister has given some explanation on it ; but even so, I consider that honourable members ought to be given an opportunity to go further into it. Has the Minister any objection to the debate being adjourned? oportunity to consider the matter before bigger measures are brought down. to say that I am opposed to remissions of taxation being made before there baa heen a full restoration of emergency cuts in the case of invalid and old-age pensioners, public servants, and other very deserving sections of the community, who have suffered considerably, and who were promised that as soon as the finances of the Commonwealth permitted, there would be a complete restoration. This Government adopts the attitude that there should first be a restoration to taxpayers, and that invalid and old-age pensioners and public servants should be the last considered. It cannot be asserted that there has not been an improvement of the revenues of the Commonwealth. The revenues of the Commonwealth showed The a decidedly upward tendency in the first year that this Government was in office. That was not due to either its administration or its legislation. The Scullin Government, by sound administration, and by prohibitive and restrictive measures which prevented the importation of goods that could not be paid for, the result of which was to turn an adverse trade balance of £30,000,000 into a favourable one of £30,000,000, enabled the present occupants of the treasury bench to return a surplus immediately. Pensioners and public servants had been assured by the representatives of all parties that the cuts which had been imposed on them would be restored to them as soon as the finances permitted, yet the first year's surplus was not devoted to that purpose. On the contrary, an additional £700,000 was taken from pensioners, while taxation was remitted in the case of the wealthy section of the community to an amount of £2,000,000. Pensioners were further reduced to the extent of £750,000, although bondholders and banks were not asked to make any additional sacrifice. In the succeeding financial year, the Government had a further surplus of approximately £5,000,000. It again remitted taxation, chiefly in the",22,Customs Tarif F Primage Duties 1934

99,Mr Forde,"The Minister gave usnever a part of the protectionist system, and the Leader of the Opposition would be the first to admit that. These charges were imposed by this Government with great regret because they represented a burden upon our industrial activities and therefore uponour employment activities. Insofar as they have been lifted they have relieved and stimulated industry and increased employment, and the more these charges are lifted the more will employment be increased. Therefore the members of the Opposition, in resisting the removal of these primage charges upon industry, are hindering the restoration of employment in this country. cannot allow the lecture which has been given to us by the honourable member for Henty( Sir Henry Gullett) to pass without correcting his statements and his interpretation of the attitude of the Labour party. The honourable member said that this Government is holding the balance fairly by reducing taxation imposed under the emergency legislation proportionately with the restoration of reductions in social services and Public Service salaries. That statement is absolutely incorrect. The reductions that were made in social services under the first emergency legislation stand to-day in their full severity. In addition further provisions have beeu inserted in the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act which have added to the severity of the original emergency reduction. The only restoration that has been made in pensions by this Government was in respect of reductions imposed by itself, which doubled the first emergency reductions provided under the original Premiers plan. This Government has reduced very substantially the taxation under the original emergency legislation without making the slightest restoration to the invalid and old-age pensioners; in fact, it has added to the impositions upon them. Therefore the very basis of the case put up by the honourable member for Henty has been knocked from under his feet. The honourable member said that the restorations made to public servants and pensioners were in proportion to the reduction of taxation. was the object of the Government. ber said that it was being done progressively and that the balance was being held fairly. I say that that is absolutely incorrect, and the honourable member, if"" he knows anything about the facts, must admit that. The original reductions that were made under the Premiers plan with respect to social services stand to-day in the majority of cases. There have been remissions all round in taxation, even remissions in taxation that was not affected by the emergency legislation. I refer particularly to the land tax. I do not deny that my Government imposed emergency taxation with regret, but we imposed other taxation in the form of reductions with greater regret. Those impositions should be the first to be removed. Government imposed them. and the honourable member supported them. We imposed them because we had no alternative. Now that money is available relief should be given to the poorer section of the community. relief as the result of the removal of these primage charges. Mi-. SCULLIN -Only indirectly. I am not objecting in principle to the removal of these charges, because I do not stand for the principle of the continuation of primage which was purely an emergency charge in a period of financial crisis. But impositions on the pensioners should be the first to he removed. Our attitude to-day is perfectly consistent with our attitude on the budget. I admit that these matters came up for consideration months ago, but it must not be forgotten that in the meantime we have had a long recess. We made our protest on these matters when the budget was introduced, and we are entitled to make a further protest now that the effort is being made to give legal effect to the vote of Parliament We have been consistent throughout. There is another aspect of the subject which should bo considered. It has been said that the reduction of the primage duties is consequent upon the ratification of the Ottawa agreement.

The present Comptroller-General of Custom* .agreed that an anomaly existed, and the matter was placed on the stocks to be -dealt with. It was never contemplated that any British manufacturer who used Australian raw material should be prevented from qualifying for British preference. I raise no objection to the proposal 4o substitute regulations for proclamations, upon which a discussion took place -some time ago, although I apprehend -certain difficulties. I recognize that there is involved the principle of the right of Parliament to have a voice in the matter at the earliest possible moment The third proposal involves considerably more than the second. It is that -tariff schedules must pass into law within --3ix months of their having been tabled, or lapse. Under normal conditions, it might be proper to provide that the Parliament shall ha-ve an opportunity to either accept or reject a tariff -schedule within six months. I point out, however, that we are living in abnormal -times at present. All over the world, there are movements which are aimed at -the development of the industries of -different countries with a view to dealing with the unemployment problem. They --are not directed against Australia or any other country as an act of retaliation ""because of high tariffs, but they are having repercussions in every country, and Australia must be ever ready to meet whatever situation may arise. Tberefore, the greatest elasticity must be allowed to whatever administration is in power. Mr ""WHITE I propose to bring down A special bill to deal with the international -situation. -suddenly arise to protect Australia against the dumping of goods produced in other countries, proof of which is not available. It is known that to-day one -nation is adopting extraordinary methods to place its goods in other parts of the world. I have read an address that was delivered by Major Douglas, in which ho claimed that Japan had put the Douglas credit theory into operation, but upside down. His explanation was that Japan was utilizing the national credit to subsidize the manufacture of goods with a view to capturing the markets of other countries. That explains many things that it has been difficult to understand. Manufacturers have shown me articles, the cost of the raw material used in which, they have assured me, has been as much as the articles could be sold for if labour had not to be paid for. Therefore, there must be an explanation apart from the question of cheap labour. I received a letter to-day from rubber workers in my constituency who recently were thrown out of work because a number of the stores are being filled with imported balloons against which it is impossible for the local article to compete. The balloons are not branded ""Made in Japan,"" but they are landed in Australia so cheaply that they can be sold at a very low figure. Serious developments might arise almost on the eve of the rising of Parliament, when it might uot be possible to have a tariff schedule passed. Parliament always has control over its own affairs. If it does not wish a schedule to lie on the table for a longer period than six months, it can decide to deal with it. I know that honourable members have in mind schedules that have been unratified for a number of years. brought down by the Bruce-Page Government lay on the table for about twelve months during its administration, and for the whole of the period that my Government was in office. During the war period schedules lay on the table for as long as three years. I venture to affirm that had this suggested provision been in operation during the war it would have been found necessary to repeal if. If it is now agreed to, Parliament will be forced to repeal it whenever special circumstances arise. After all, the protection of Australian industry is of the greatest importance to the development and the life of this country. What is wrong with leaving it to the Parliament itself to determine when schedules shall be dealt with? This would not confer upon the Parliament any wider power than it now possesses.

Parliament should approve of any taxation that is imposed. One House only has not the right to say that a section of the community shall be taxed. If the Government of the day had a majority in both Houses of Parliament it would be easy for it, should the necessity arise, to bring in special legislation to overcome any fault that may be found in this measure.

Progress reported. Debate resumed from the 26th May, 1933, (vide page 1965), on motion by Tliat tlie bill he now read a second time. [ 2..""iJ j -The object of this bill is to bring Australia into line with other maritime countries which have signed the International Conventions relating to seagoing vessels. The first international conference on this subject endeavoured to secure uniformity among the big maritime countries in regard to methods of surveying, load line provisions, and examination of vessels generally. It was desired that all vessels should be thoroughly examined on a uniform basis in every country in order to ensure, to the greatest possible extent, the safety of persons travelling by sea, whether as passengers or as crew, and also the safety of property 'transported by sea. The Minister explained, in introducing the bill, that its purpose was to implement Australia's part as one of the signatories to the . Conventions. I am afraid, however, measure in its present form shall Fundamentally the basis of the Conventions is that everybody in the world engaged in seagoing operations shall be subject to uniform conditions. The Conventions are founded on the practice of the maritime section of the British Board of Trade and Lloyd's Register in Great Britain. If Australia is honestly to take its part as a signatory to the Conventions, it is under obligation to make sure that the practices of this country in regard to the matters involved are identical with those of other countries which have signed the Conventions. It is provided in the British legislation that the inspections and examinations shall be made by expert officers. The employment of engineer surveyors, ship surveyors, wireless surveyors and so on is specified in the legislation of other countries: which have implemented these Conventions; but there is no mandatory provision in this bill that the persons employed by our Navigation Department to do this work shall be thoroughly qualified in every respect. I fear, therefore, that persons may be employed who are not technically fitted to do the work. I wish not to attack the Minister or the bill, but merely to ensure that the c right thing shall be done. I can see a danger in the wideness of the terms of certain clauses of the bill. We should take all care to ensure that only thoroughly qualified persons are engaged in this important work. If we employ unqualified ' persons, other maritime countries, which are parties to the Conventions, will soon know of it and will not be willing to allow their ships to be examined by our officers. I suggest, therefore, that the language of the bill should be strengthened to provide that only qualified examiners shall be employed. Some of these Conventions have been in operation for nearly 50 years. There has, during this time, been a gradual change in the type of ships and the nature of their equipment. Other nations copied British procedure because they believed it to be the best,, and we ought to be the last to depart from it. The provisions in this bill differ altogether from those in the British act.. that if we pass the For instance, it is stated in the bill simply we that the ships shall be surveyed, but it is not achieve our objective. not stipulated that the persons who carry out the survey work shall bequalified to do so. I trust that the Minister will examine the matter from this angle, and : see that the men in his department possess the necessary qualifications. I am not casting any reflection on the men now engaged in the work; some of them may be qualified, while others may not have had an opportunity to pass the necessary examinations. It should be stipulated,, however, that men doing survey work should possess the qualifications laid down by Lloyds. I ask the Minister to see that the Australian act is on all fours with the British Merchant Shipping Act, which provides specifically that declarations-",32,Customs Bill 1932 Second Reading
172,Mr Stewabt,,33,Navigation Maritime Conventions Bill 1933 Second Reading
173,Mr Holloway (Melbourne Ports),"-of survey shall he made by persons qualified to do the work. This applies to surveys of all parts of the vessel, including the engines and wireless installation. I also have had the case put before me by the Australian engineers. ask is that the Merchant Shipping Act of Great Britain shall be followed by this Parliament when amending the present Navigation Act in so far as it applies to the surveying of ships. Our act states that surveys shall be made by "" persons "", but does not state what qualifications those persons shall possess. The British Merchant Shipping Act in sections 2, 5, 9, 17, 46 and 53 indicates the technical -qualifications of the surveyors who are to be employed. The work of survey should not be left to unqualified persens who may have no knowledge of the intricate equipment which it is their duty to examine. Not only haa Great Britain provided for the survey of ships by qualified persons in regard to ship's engines, & c ; it has also brought its legislation Up to date by an amendment of 1932 which specifically deals with wireless installations. We are not opposing the bill as a whole, but we ask the Minister to make the alterations which have been requested. No one will be placed at a disadvantage thereby, and it will make for greater safety for those who have to go to sea. A ship's captain might be a very good authority on navigation, &c, but, as regards the safety of the ship at sea, the chief engineer occupies almost as important a position as the captain himself. We have been taught in the past to copy British legislation, and here is an excellent opportunity to put the lesson into effect. By failing to include the provision which has been asked for -we are placing ourselves .apart, from all other maritime nations of the world. 'The engineers are not seeking anything unreasonable when they ask for preference In regard to appointments for survey work. -The bill now before the House provides for certain amendments recommended by international conventions, but it also affords an opportunity to the Minister *to accede to requests made to him by a deputation from the Marine Transport Council of Sydney, which waited upon him in Sydney on the 9th October, 1933. Replying to the deputation, the Minister statedThere has been no opportunity in recent years of considering general anuuidinente to these acts. Many requests for amendments All they have, however, been received, particularly in regard to the Navigation Act. If and when it is possible to introduce! amending bills f u l l consideration will be given 'to tlie paints raised by the deputation. As the Navigation Act has yet to be amended to enable the Safety of Life at Sea Convention and the Loadline Convention to be ratified, I can see little prospect of a general amending bill being introduced in the near future. this Bill to re-open the whole Navigation Act; we merely propose to carry out our obligations under the Conventions. the Minister does not propose to accede to the requests of the Marine Transport Council. It is. often very difficult to secure amendments regarding legislation which does not come prominently before a large section of the public. This bill is one that opportunity s offers for a general review of the Navigation Act, and should have been cordially welcomed. No douibt the International Conventions are important, but there is a responsibility on the Government to give effect also, in so far as is possible, to reasonable requests made by local organizations. I introduced the deputation which waited upon the Minister in October last, and, as it may be a long time before the Navigation Act is again before Parliament, I take this opportunity to put on record the requests made by the council on that occasion. They asked that section 1 should be amended by omitting the words, "" belonging to a ship registered in Australia "", and "" at any place in Australia "". Although the Navigation Act has jurisdiction only over vessels whose first port of clearance and port of destination are within the Commonwealth, it would be competent for a vessel trading on the coast, and registered oversea, to evade the provisions of section 132. That possibility is removed by the omission of the words I have quoted. If the last-mentioned words are allowed to remain, a vessel registered in Australia and observing Australian conditions, would be",33,Navigation Maritime Conventions Bill 1933 Second Reading

The maritime unions urge that he be treated similarly at his home port. In cases where such expenses were heavy, the major portion of the wages paid would be absorbed in this direction. A further proposal is that the word "" aud "" be substituted for the word "" or "" iu the second last line. Under present circumstances, a certificate from either the Medical Inspector of Seamen, or his medical attendant, suffices. In many casus, this has had an adverse effect upon rhe seamen, as only a certificate from either of tbe persons I have mentioned is required, aud the employer is enabled to deny further liability. As a result of experience, it is claimed that the seaman is without adequate protection, and that, the certificate of recovery from the two medical men is essential. Provision is made for difference of opinion by the proposal that the present proviso to the sub-section be struck out, and the following substituted:Provided that, in eases where a difference of opinion arises as to the condition of the sen man, the matter sliall be determined by reference to an independent specialist; acceptSecretary of the Maritime Council that able to both parties. It is further proposed that the proviso to sub-section 1 a be struck out, because it limits the payment of wages to a period governed solely by the duration of the articles of agreement. If the articles expire within one month from the date on which the seaman is left ashore, the payment does not exceed one month's wages. In all other cases, it is not to exceed three months, after which-in cases of accident, only-the brought under the Seamen's Compensation Act, which provides for a payment of 30s. a week. Ho regard is paid to the seriousness of the complaint or injury from which the seaman is suffering. If Mr Beasley. a seaman who is employed on a ship, the articles of which expire within one month from the date on which ho is left ashore at his home port, is seriously injured and incapacitated for a lengthy period, he receives only 30s. a week after the expiration of the month, whereas if he were landed away from his home port, he would receive wages, sustenance, and medical expenses up to the time of his recovery. This discrimination is not equitable, and it is respectfully urged that the anomaly should he remedied immediately. Tho next proposal is that the words "" and sustenance "" be inserted after the word ""agreement"" in sub-section lb. It is contended that, although it is usual for a. seaman, to be provided with sustenance while being treated under this sub-section, the provision should be clearly stated. The last suggestion is that paragraphs b and c of sub-section 5 be deleted. The opinion held is that the inclusion of a stated period before a claim can be made is bad in principle, and encourages the seaman to ensure that he is incapacitated for the period mentioned. The reference to the period of fourteen days has been deleted from the seamen's award. The inclusion of occupational diseases is also recommended. I have specifically referred to these suggestions and opinions in order that they may be recorded. It would appear that there is no possibility of having them considered in conjunction with the measure that is now before the House, despite the fact that the Minister for Commerce( Mr Stewart) stated in his letter to the an opportunity to deal with the act had not presented itself for many years. It is likely that a similar set of circumstances will prevail for the next few years, unless there is a change of government, at the forthcoming election. That is something to which these men will have to look forward because this is a matter in which the public generally are only indifferently interested. The Government has decided to shelve reform, and seaman is apparently leave alterations in abeyance for a considerable period-that is, of course, if they. remain in office. The maritime unions have prepared their case in a most capable manner. They supplied the Minister for Commerce with their suggestions practically twelve months ago. If the honourable gentleman has not had the time to devote to these question*, an officer of his department ought to have given attention to them. The Government has not acted rightly in having refrained from dealing with the local aspects of navigation now that the measure is before the House, but if the Minister is not prethe representations, is not at all unreasonpared to make the amendments now, perhaps he may indicate his desire to take HCtion in the very near future. Such a prothose obtaining in Great Britain, and nouncement would give some satisfaction to these men. As we are not able to take action ourselves, the best that we can do is to endeavour to encourage action on the part of those who have for the time being the necessary power and authority. As we have failed to obtain immediate action, we should like an assurance that there will"" not be very much delay in meeting the requests of the men whose whole lives are practically absorbed in the industry. ter for Commerce) [3.22] I am gratified at the general approval Of the purpose that It would he surprising if any other attitude were adopted, because, as the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway) has stated, the purpose of the bill is simply to bring Australia into line with the rest of the world by ratifying the obligation which it undertook in the maritime conventions of 1929 and 1930. The object of the conferences and of the conventions which followed them was simply the protection of life at sea. Fault has been found with only one phase of the proposals that are now before tbe House-the definition of ""surveyor."" There is no variation with respect to the requirements of the survey, but. there has been criticism of the fact that the measure does not make as specific a provision as is made by some other measures overseas. There is a reason for that, and it is not a sinister one. It is not the intention of the Commonwealth that there shall be the slightest laxity in the survey of our ships. So far from that being the case, Australia has shown the way to the rest of the world in. the matter of maritime legislation. We have not a greater number of amendments to make to our act to conform to our obligations under the conventions because to a large extent the provisions sought have been anticipated for a number of years. I am sorry that I am unable to accede to the request that has been made. It was formulated in very good temper and, .from the point of view of those who have made able. But the conditions prevailing in Australia are entirely different from thia makes necessary a greater degree of elasticity in our legislation than is needed in the corresponding legislation of Great Britain. Some of the survey work in Great Britain is undertaken by ship surveyors, who in Australia would be known as naval architects. Unfortunately, Australia has not yet reached in shipbuilding the position that would ensure tbe availability of this type of man for the survey of our shipping. It is because of the necessity for elasticity in our legislation that we prefer to allow the position to remain as it is provided for in the bill, and to be a little more specific in the regulations that will be issued under underlies this measure. the act. An indication that the Board of Trade has no objection to the practice that we adopt in this regard is furnished by the fact that only recently it appointed two officers of my department to act as its representatives in Australia in the survey of certain passenger ships that voyage to international ports. One of the two officers is a nautical surveyor; yet it is against the class of work which such men undertake that most of the agitation that has been given expression to-day has been launched. ' The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) has complained that certain further amendments of the act have not been proposed in this measure. I am afraid that I cannot give him. a great deal of encouragement to believe that there is likely to be an immediate re-opening of the subject. Indeed, if some of the observations and the forecasts of the honourable gentleman may be taken seriously, a promise by me that the act would be further amended at an early date, would not prove very reassuring to his constituents.

Lady Northcote was a lady of great distinction, and both during her sojourn in Australia and in the years that have followed she endeared herself to a wide circle of Australian acquaintances and friends. Her house in London was ever open to visiting Australians, and her interest in our country remained fresh and vivid to the end. 1 know that the House will be with me when I say that her passing leaves a gap in the lives and memories of a great many people, and that we learn of it with great regret. leave I desire to associate the Opposition with the remarks of the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons). Lady Northcote played an important part with her husband when he was Governor General of Australia in the early years of federation, gracious lady who, during the years of and a few years ago I , with my wife, had the privilege of renewing acquaintance with her in London when she kindly invited us to her home for a rest during the activities of the Imperial Conference. Unfortunately, our stay was too short to enable us to avail ourselves of the invitation. By her acts of courtesy she displayed her continued interest in the welfare of Australia. She told me on that occasion that she had never forgotten her stay in this country. She was a charming personality, and I am sure that the Australian people generally will deeply regret her death. the Country party I wish to associate Minister( Mr Lyons). I had the privilege of knowing Lady Northcote, and I can state that she, like Lady Novar, after her return td Great Britain, was a great advocate for Australia, and a good friend to all Australians abroad. Lady Novar has, at all times, extended a warm welcome to visitors from Australia, and I know that on the walls of her house there is displayed a fine collection of Australian paintings. In her garden there is a beautiful growth of Australian trees and shrubs. Her library contains a large collection of current Australian newspapers. It has often been said that our Governors-General when they return to England are fine ambassadors for this country, and I can say truly that both Lady Novar and Lady Northcote have proved themselves to be fine ambassadresses. When Lady Northcote was in Australia she endeared herself to all Australians whom she met. In England she continued to show a lively interest in this country, and extended kindly hospitality to all Australians in London who were able to come into contact with her. The Country party combines with the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) in expressing deep regret at the news of her death. -by leave I desire to associate myself with the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons), the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin), and other honourable members in expressing regret at the passing of the her distinguished husband's occupancy of",36,Navigation Maritime Conventions Bill 1933 Second Reading

I used to respect the gentleman to whom I refer, but I can respect him no longer. Every consumer of petrol and oil in this country will Wonder why an Attorney-General should be allowed to take money in the form of fees from the oil combines in the circumstances in which he is doing. To luy mind it is a terrible thing. While I was in the room, the commission decided that it would continue its proceedings in camera. I suppose that this was done in order to. consider whether certain questions could be asked. I have known questions to be dodged or evaded by legal gentlemen in other connexions. I say that if a man who appears before a court of this country or a properly constituted legal tribunal refuses to answer questions which are asked in the interests of the country, he should be sent to gaol for a night to consider his position. If he remany oil companies is punctuated by fuses to answer the questions in the mornmurders and suicides. It is impossible ing, he should be sent to gaol for a week. If then he still refuses to answer the questions, he should be sent to gaol for a year. Such procedure., in my opinion, would solve all difficulties very quickly. When the commission sat in camera all the members of the general public, including myself, and also the representatives of the press, who are capable of giving publicity to the proceedings of this in my hand a list of men prominently bodv, were obliged to retire; but the nine legal luminaries remained in the room to consult with the commission. That, I consider, was infamous. I asked a well-known Melbourne magistrate how he would get on if he were obliged to dispause justice with nine barristers on one side and none on the other. He said, "" Doctor, it would be impossible."" SoI think it is impossible for the people of Australia to get justice from this commission under those conditions. One of the prominent figures at the inquiry in Melbourne was Mr Erood, a man who, I believe, has been responsible for saving 'this country thousands of pounds in income taxation in connection with these combines. I have known him for many years. The late Mr Palmer, who, for some time, was the representative in this House for Echuca, directed attention to this matter very many years Dr. Maloney. ago, and I gave him a promise that if he brought it up in the HouseI would help him to fight the combine. Another gentleman who took tbe matter up was Mr Walter Marks, for some time the honourable member for Wentworth. On one occasion in this chamber he produced sworn declarations disclosing the methods of the oil combine to prevent the exploitation of the oil resources of Australia. He stated that when bores were down to a certain depth they were destroyed by dynamite or other means by paid emissaries of the foreign combines, with the result that those carrying out this work were discouraged from continuing. I do not say that all oil companies are linked together in this business. When Erance was in dire need, a proposal was made by interests backed by Standard Oil to buy the French Government tobacco monopoly for £200,000,000 in gold. The history of to say how many firms or private individuals have been ruined by these accursed business organizations. Mr Rockefeller is now distributing largesse throughout the world.

Once more echo answers"" Wliere ?"" The information which Mr Marks gave to the House some years ago made it clear that Parliament, and not the Government alone, should deal with these combines. Honourable members should read a little of the history of Standard Oil. Many years ago, when Parliament was sitting in Melbourne, a gentleman connected with the company made a statement in South Africa to the effect that if the Australian Parliament would not let him have his way, he would buy up all the members. opinion of their probity was not a very high one. Some months later, in Melbourne, I was introduced by the: late Mr he was doing a much better work than Randall Alcock, a well known merchant of Melbourne, to a clever and, as I thought, a courtly gentleman. I noticed that he evinced a desire to tajik about oil, so I told him at once that I had read so much about it that I hated the very word. Still he persisted and said, "" You must admit that tbe combine pays good wages and the people get a better article"". I told him plainly that I did not want to talk about it. Thereupon he asked, ""Well, what do you want?"" I replied, "" I ' l l eat with you and drink with you, and exchange pleasant conversation with you, but I will not talk about oil."" Theu, as he still pressed me on the subject, I said to him, "" Were you in South Africa some time ago ?"" When he informed me that be was, I asked, ""Are you connected with Standard Oil?"" He said, ""Yes"". I then said to him, "" Are you the gentleman who stated that if he could not get his way iu Australia, he would buy up all the members of the Commonwealth Parliament? "" His reply was, "" I have been accused of that,"" whereupon, I said, "" Well, as far as I am concerned, I wish, the Standard Oil Company was in Hell and you with it . "" Cleverly, his answer came, ""Well, doctor, you must admit that if it were there, it would make a very fine blaze!"" At this juncture, Mr able gentleman very attentively and I Alcock, who had left us, returned, and said to me, ""Willie, why are you qnarrelling wdth my friend ? "" and he was man enough to say"" The fault was entirely mine; the doctor has just told me that he would eat, drink aind talk with me, but he would not talk about o i l "" . has been sufficiently long in politics to That man, I believe, eventually did. "" get"" two members of that Parliament; but I should add that, at the following election, they were defeated. One has since died. I hope that God will forgive him if, as was reported, he had been bought by the oil combine. I have spoken to Mr Frood, who appeared before the commission in Melbourne recently. From my knowledge of the man, there is nothing against him. I was unable to follow all the figures which he presented to the commission. I understand that Evidently his he is an ex-soldier, and I suggest that when he was fighting for the people of Australia before the royal commission was being done by the Victorian Attorney-General, who, as a legal luminary, takes money from both sides. I come now to Sir Charles Merrett, another gentleman who has been prominently before the public in connection with the inquiry by the petrol commission. I only wish that Mr Ham and Mr Menzies were as highly respected by their friends as Sir Charles Merrett is by his. I do not know him personally, but 1 have never heard a single word uttered against him, and the fact that he appeared before the commission fighting against the unjust charges levied on the people of Australia by the oil combine entitles him to the respect of every member of this Parliament. Mr Pollock engaged the attention of the commission for several days. Besides giving voluminous evidence, he presented a petition containing 500 signatures of persons protesting against the operations of the combine, including university graduates, and asking that Mr Pollock should be allowed to cross examine witnesses. I understand that he has sound technical knowledge of the oil business. Nevertheless, he was not allowed to cross-examine witnesses who appeared before the commission. -Order! I have listened to the honorhave reached the conclusion that he was proceeding to criticize, not only witnesses who appeared before the petrol commission, but also the royal commission itself, which has not yet completed its investigations. The honourable gentleman know that it is unbecoming for an honourable member of this House to criticize any body so constituted, until its report has been presented to the House. deavouring to show how helpless the people of Australia are in the hands of the combine. I did not say a word about the commission itself. honourable gentleman was saying. 'His remarks concerning counsel and also some of the witnesses who appeared before",40,Attorney General S Department

190,Mr Speaker,"I heard what, thethe royal commission were couched in very strong terms. I , therefore, ask him to be more careful in his criticism of that body. Speaker, I shall try to mend my ways; but I believe that the people of Australia are in agreement with me on this subject. I am sure that every purchaser of petrol is convinced that he is being treated unjustly by these high charges. The position could easily be remedied. If Parliament enacted a law to provide that the selling price of petrol in Australia should be the price charged in the country of origin, plus freight, duty, and reasonable distribution and administrative charges, there would be no complaint. Every one knows that unfair charges are being levied on the people by these combines. It has, I believe, been estimated that petrol users in Australia have been bled to the amount of £100,000,000 by excessive charges to provide unjust profits for the combines. A few weeks ago, I discussed this question in the press, and mentioned particularly the price of kerosene, stating that a profit of is. a gallon on the 36,000,000 gallons imported would provide an excess profit of £1,800.000 per annum. Kerosene can be landed in Melbourne at 5d. a gallon. If it were sold at lOd. a gallon, the profit would be about 100 per cent., whichshould be sufficient, and yet the selling price of kerosene in Melbourne is Is. lO^d. a gallon, and 2s. 3d. at Bendigo. A profit of Is. a gallon on 36,000,000 gallons would give an excess profit of £1,800,000 per annum. I regret that the Attorney-General"" of Victoria should, under privilege, have made such an attack on a Commonwealth public officer. ber's time has expired. sire to bring under the notice of honor[4.17] -Quite recently, the honourable importance to South Australia, and which way) and I were in the Northern Terrishould be of interest, also to other parts tory, and, while we were at Darwin, a of the country. I refer to the proposal fire occurred in the railway bond stores, of the Minister for the Interior( Mr resulting in the. loss of large quantities Perkins), to transfer 100 men from Canof foodstuffs, and in damage to governberra for employment at Port Augusta ment property estimated at £8,290. Th<= on ballasting and sleepering the Eastshed was used for the storage of West railway. This may be an exfoodstuffs and such like commodities cellent idea so far as the Canberra unconsigned by rail to persons living in the employed are concerned, but I remind the Minister that there is a tremendous amount of unemployment in South Australia also. In the town of Port Augusta alone there are 160 men in receipt of government unemployment relief, and, no doubt, there are others out of work who have not yet put themselves upon the relief scheme. Throughout the whole of South Australia, the percentage of unemployment is probably as great as, if not greater tha.u, that for the Commonwealth as a whole. In the circumstances, it is a ridiculous proposal to transfer men from Canberra to a State that is already burdened with the problem of finding employment for its own citizens. It should be pointed out, moreover, that South Australia does not derive much benefit from the expenditure of Commonwealth loan money on works such as this. It was known in South Australia that this work would have to be done in the near future, and it was hoped that, during the carrying out of the three-years plan, employment would be found for South Australian citizens. Many of those out of work were looking iorward to tbU opportunity to obtain employment. J do not make a habit of grumbling about State disabilities, but one of the last things I had to do before the adjournment of Parliament in December, was to complain of the action of the Commonwealth Bank authorities in bringing stone from New South Wales to Adelaide for building purposes, when excellent stone was available in South Australia. That may have been a small matter, but the principle involved in this proposed transfer of unemployed men is of the greatesi importance.

When goods of that kind arrive at Darwin, they are taken possession of, while still in the ships' slings, by the railway authorities, and stored until forwarded by rail. The consignee is not given the option of appointing his own receiving agent. The goods in question were the first which had arrived at Darwin since the wet season, and honourable members must know that during that season it is impossible to transport goods to the outback places. The result was that many of the consignees were relying on this shipment for practically a year's supply of stores, and now those stores have been destroyed.* I asked the Minister who was responsible for the loss of the goods, which had been taken arbitrarily under the control of the Commissioner for Railways, and I was informed that under by-law No. 21, made in pursuance of powers conferred by the Commonwealth Railways Act, the Commissioner was not liable for the loss. The settlers in the north have been having a very bad time due to dwindling markets, &c, yet they will not receive one farthing's indemnity for the loss they have sustained. I suggest that when the by-law was framed, it was meant to refer to goods in transit on the railway, and not to those iri store at the waterfront. It is estimated that the value of the goods lost was approximately £20,000, and it is not right that the Railway Department should refuse all compensation. Many consignees whose supplies were destroyed were not in a position to order more, and, consequently, their position is hopeless. Surely the Government cannot expect the Northern Territory to be effectively settled if it does not recognize its responment in the same manner as any other sibility to those who are already settled there. Accompanied by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports inspected the bond store, which is a building about one half the isize of this chamber, where we found foodstuffs and other goods stored with matches, kerosene, benzine and other inflammable goods. Such an arangement would not be permitted in any other part of Australia. Although thousands of pounds worth of goods were stored in the building the department was too niggardly to employ a night watchman to assist in protecting them. vernment insure the goods1 only up to the time at which they leave the ship's slings. The department would have to protect the goods while under the control of the Railway Department, but. apparently it assumes no responsibility while they are in the bonded store. On behalf of those who have suffered so seriously, I earnestly appeal to the Minister for the Interior( Mr Perkins) to assist those unfortunate consignees who cannot finance themselves, and to do the fair thing by recompensing them for the losses they have incurred while the goods were under its control. wish to make a strong plea on behalf of the aged and infirm. I am glad that the Postmaster-General( Mr Parkhill) is temporarily in charge of the House, because I know that he will sympathize with me in the case which I wish to bring under his notice. The aged and infirm, to which I refer, are the vehicles in use by the Postal Department at Hobart, and which are employed in connection with the maintenance of telephone lines and other matters incidental thereto. These vehicles seem to be in the last stage of their existence and have to submit to severe tests in running up and down the hills in the vicinity of Hobart. The use of such old vehicles must result in a loss of efficiency in connection with the work of the department, and their retention from the angle of efficiency would not be sanctioned by those engaged in private enterprise. The Postal Department should maintain its equipbusiness concern. During the depression some of the equipment, and notably those I vehicles in use at Hobart, have been allowed to get into a state of disrepair; but the time has now arrived when the department should take stock of the situation and make the necessary renewals. I can see no justification, by comparison with other activities, particularly those controlled by private concerns, for keeping in use such equipment. The maintenance costs must be heavy and must result in inefficiency as well as engender dissatisfaction in the minds of those who have to operate them.

198,Mr Hutchin (Denison) [4.23],"Iforward in the hope that the Postmaster General will immediately make provision for the necessary repairs or renewals to be made. When the honourable member for Boothby( Mr Price) spoke this afternoon he was under the impression that 100 men were being sent from Canberra to work on the East-West railway, and that no South Australians were to be engaged. Unfortunately, the honourable member was not present last night when the Minister for the Interior( Mr Perkins) said that, in addition to the 100 men to be sent from Canberra, possibly 200 men were to be selected in South Australia. I understand that the amount originally allocated for the work was £60,000, but I believe that it has now been increased to over £200,000, thus making it possible to provide work for 300 men over a period of three years. When the position is fully explained I am sure that my South Australian colleagues will agree with me that it is only right that the work should be proceeded with. It has also been said that unnecesfor the work in question is being found sary cost will be involved in transporting men from Canberra to Port Augusta, and possibly in returning them here, but I understand that it is proposed to ask the men to repay the cost of their travelling expenses over a period of twelve months. When these facts are taken into consideration I think honourable members will agree with .me that it is better that 200 men resident in South Australia should be provided with work rather than that the whole scheme should be dropped. ringah-Postmaster-General) 1 know something of the agitation going on, particularly in New South Wales, in connection with the bankruptcy arrangements mentioned by the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr E. J. Harrison). I can assure the honourable member that the representations he has made will be taken into consideration by the Attorney General( Mr Latham). The honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney) is under a misapprehension as to the manner in which the royal commission on petrol is being conducted. The honourable member said that the Commonwealth has not a legal representative on the commission, but I may inform him that the chairman of the commission ia Mr Lamb, K . C , an eminent legal authority. In addition, the commission an experienced barrister who is now sell prior to his appointment to the Victorian judiciary. In these circumstances, the commission is quite capable of carrying on important work on which it is engaged. I say nothing with regard to the statements that have been made by the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney) respecting the different persons whose names he mentioned. I do not consider that he should have adopted the course that he followed, and, in the circumstances, do not propose to reply to his attack. The matter referred to by the honourable member for Boothby( Mr Price) and the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Stacey) was fully discussed last night, and the Minister for the Interior( Mr Perkins) clearly explained the intention of the Government. The money by the Commonwealth, and it is desired to give employment to citizens of the Commonwealth.

The Minister for the Interior has informed me that, in view of the protests that have been made and the views that have been expressed by honourable members, the matter has been re-considered, and the money which [4.28] was to have been set aside for the employment of these men will now be expended in Canberra, where they will be retained. The Minister for the Interior considers that he made last night a f u ll statement upon the matter that was raised by the honorahle member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson). He did not make a statement; he answered a question. have been asked to inform the honourable member that the additional facts mentioned by him this afternoon will be taken into consideration by the Minister for the Interior.",44,Attorney General S Department

There is, doubtless, some foundation for the attitude adopted by the honourable member. During the years of the depression, the post-office has been reluctant to renew any vehicles or equipment which could be serviceably employed, the object boing to avoid undue expenditure. with the houorable member that, in yiew of the uplift that is taking place in all sections of postal administration, the time has now arrived when a certain amount of expenditure is really warranted in order that a much greater outlay upon renewals may be avoided at a later stage.
