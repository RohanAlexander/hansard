The high level of interest rates, particularly trial disputation, the recent veritable rash of those in the United States, inevitably impacts on strikes and bans which have added to costs, have interest rates here.

Treasurer, Frank Crean, that 'one man's excessive As I say, there is a slow-down in activity. That wage increase costs another man his job', that is not in dispute. Its causes are manifold and comtime has arrived. There is indeed a heavy responsiplex. What is not true, as the Opposition in probility on the part of not only employees but also posing this matter tries to imply, is that the total employers and wage tribunals to contain excessive responsibility for it rests with this Government. cost increases. In comparison, it is worth pointing That assertion is absurd and cannot be logically out that in the United States of America there sustained for one moment. I do not suggest that have been recent settlements in which employees the Government has not made mistakes, as the have accepted actual wage cuts in return for job Treasurer ( Mr Howard) conceded the other day. security. It has never been more imperative, with I do not suggest that there are not things which both inflation and activity falling overseas, to concould not have been done better. In my view some tain any further upsurge in costs in Australia. things would have been done better if they had These are some of the internal factors in the curbeen done differently.

The Government the very good performance of the Australian fights inflation not as an alternative to-instead economy, way out in front of most of the other of-fighting unemployment, as the Labor Party leading industrial nations in recent years, as I said so often makes out and as the honourable member at the outset, and still out in front, albeit currently for McMillan( Mr Cunningham) was saying in an experiencing a slow down. That is the point I earlier debate today, but in order to increase emwant to underline. ployment and growth and reduce unemployment The second point I want to underline is that in on a sustainable basis. That is the only route to contrast the Australian Labor Party has not today sustainable growth, to higher employment and to in here or anywhere else offered any credible or lower unemployment. It is inflation and higher believable alternative strategy, a point to which I costs which undermine competitiveness, which will return. If there is a slow down it would have erode profitability and thus the capacity and the happened much earlier and would have been incentive to invest, because with inflation and much worse under the economic policies that the higher costs here-the costs of construction and Labor Party proposes. Further, in coping with the of employing Australians-the sums, when one current difficulties and in looking ahead, if the projects forward a new investment and a new Opposition had been dispensing things, if it had project, do not come out right. So it is inflation been in government, we would have been working which holds back investment, the very investment from a much less sound, less solid and effective which means additional jobs for Australians. As base than presently exists. against that we have an Opposition whose first answer to overcome unemployment is to increase Let me elaborate on that. The key driving force government spending. The honourable member behind the growth of the economy and the growth for Adelaide said: 'The big factor is the shortage of in employment, to which I have referred, has been orders'. He would try to get over that problem by the upsurge in investment spending, by which we big government spending. mean spending on building new factories, new infrastructure that goes with them.

The Committee accordingly bases its sulking attitude of the Minister for Aboriginal recommendations regarding Aboriginals and Torres Strait Affairs was indeed instructive. This Minister, who Islanders in Queensland on the assumption that co-operation began in this portfolio with such promise, between the Commonwealth and Queensland is not likely to revealed what I imagined to be his true colours. provide a full and sufficient discharge of Commonwealth obligations to Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders in His opposition, and I take it it is also the oppoQueensland and that some unilateral action by the Commonsition of the Government, was based on the aswealth will therefore be likely to be necessary. In cases where sertions that this Bill is, to quote him, 'premature, the effective management and control of their own affairs by ill-considered, poorly drafted and based on the Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders requires the continued occupation of specific lands by those people, the Committee misapprehension that Commonwealth interconsiders that some acquisition of property must form part of vention is both necessary and desirable or that it is the legislative scheme. necessary now'. Let me deal with these criticisms. The Committee pointed out the fact that in exerFirstly he says the legislation is premature.

It is true that no specific proposals Queensland. In fact, as the Minister for Aborigihave seen the light of day yet.

The Minister asks us to leave nes in Queensland. However, in doing so he it to him to negotiate a settlement with ignored the overwhelming thrust of the ComQueensland. AllI can say to the House is that, in mittee's recommendations and the conclusions of the absence of any report on the progress or chances of success of the Minister's approach, one Government.
