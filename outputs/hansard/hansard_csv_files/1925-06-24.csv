In view of the numerous complaints by allowance postmasters and postmistresses to the effect that their salaries are inadequate, will he state what are the minimum and maximum salaries paid to such omcers? 2. Does he consider tfliat a living wage is paid ? honourable member's questions are as follow :1. The minimum payment for the conduct of an allowance .post-office is £25 per annum, but such minimum payment is made only in rare cases where the application of the fixed scale of payment to the business transacted would result in a lower remuneration. There is no fixed maximum payment. 2. It is invariably recognized that an allowance postmaster has other means of livelihood than that derived from the remuneration paid for tihe transaction of postal business, consequently the question as to whether the annual payment made by the Department constitutes a living wage does not arise. It would be r|uite impracticable for the Department to provide post-office facilities at very many of the places where allowance offices have been established if an amount equivalent to a living wage had to be paid for the conduct of the office.

During the last two years, when, and by .whom, have the various court registers been inspected? I am now able to supply tbe honourable member with the following replies:1. The magistrates of the Territory of New Guinea, i.e., the district officers and the deputy district officers, at present come under the supervision of the Government Secretary -The Administrator has suggested tliat the Central Court shall exercise a general supervision over all inferior courts in the Territory, and shall have the right to inspect and call for tlie production of the records of any such courts. This suggestion has been approved, and the necessary ordinance to give effect to it is being .prepared. 2. There have been no inspections of the district courts at Babaul and Kokopo during the last, two years A monthly return of all cases dealt with at the district courts is submitted to the Government Secretary. 3. See 2. 4. The court registers at Kieta were inspected by District Inspector Walstab in August, 1924, and tliose of Madang by the same officer in November, 1924.

In committee sumed from 19th June, vide page 298): attitude of some wheat-growers in Vichad moved, by way.of amendmentThat Divisions 1 to 8-The' Parliament, in the Commonwealtli. £11,486, be reduced by £1. The purpose of the amendment is to direct the Government to take immediate steps to establish a compulsory wheat pool. There is in the platform of the party to which the honourable member for Wannon belongs a plank for the socialization of all means of' production, distribution, and exchange. I have not heard honourable members opposite mention that plank for a considerable time, but possibly it is being kept in the background on account of the imminence of the general election. In the absence of any intimation that that plank has been removed from the platform, I am forced to consider whether this proposal for a compulsory wheat pool throughout the Commonwealth is not the thin end -of the socialistic wedge, the insertion of which is 'beiug camouflaged. But even if that be not so, the mover of fhe amendment sincerely desires a compulsory wheat pool in the interests of the wheat producers-the honourable member always impresses me as a particularly sincere man-I , as an opponent of socialism, must be careful not to assist the Labour party to put its pernicious policy into operation. The arguments employed by the mover of the amendment were not convincing. He quoted few figures in support of his contention that a compulsory pool would be in thc interests of the wheat producersbut even if he had buttressed his arguments with statistics,, covering the last decade, they would not necessarily have proved the necessity for a compulsory pool, because figures in regard to wheat fluctuations prove' very little. MrM . CAMERON -Yes. M i \ E. RILEY -They all are in favour, MrM . CAMERON I shall show that they are not. The honourable member for Wannon says that the Tvheatgrowers throughout Australia desire a {Consideration recompulsory pool, and he mentioned the voice the views of all the wheat-growers A t the present time a plebiscite of the wheat-growers of",16,Maize Industry

43,Mr E. Riley,"Are there any wheatSouth Australia is being taken to ascertain whether they are in favour of a voluntary pool backed by the State Government, and replies are obtained from them only w it h the greatest difficulty"". They are asked whether they are prepared to place in the pool a certain percentage of their wheatI think 50 per cent -and the replies are coming in very slowly. Only when they are pressed to say whether or ^ot they want any pool do they reply. It w ill be seen, therefore, that there is no burning desire on the part of the South Australian wheat growers for the establishment of a compulsory pool. wheat-growers of Western Australia also are opposed to compulsion. honourable member for Wannon proposed a voluntary pool, instead of a compulsory one, I would have given h i m all the assistance in my power, because I believe that it is in the interests of both the growers and consumers to organize for."" the elimination of unnecessary middlemen, who, unfortunately, reap perhaps a greater harvest thanthe actual producers. The honourable member said that large quantities of wheat were being wasted because silos had not been provided. right lines. It is distressing, when travelling through the wheat-growing areas, to observe the waste that is taking place. If the honourable member would advocate that the Commonwealth. Government should assist the wheat-growers directly, or through the State Governments, to provide silos, he would have, my hearty support. speak for a large number of wheat growers when I say that they would object to being compelled to put their produce into a pool ctver which they would have no control. pool would not be in the interests' of the growers or of the country, for it would remove speculation, which is an incentive to enterprise, and is oneof the maininducements to mento undergo the hardships great wheat belts of this country. We -shall not increase theproductivit y of Australia by removing speculation, and compelling men to work against their principles. In the interests of the wheat-growers the honourable member might also have urged that assistance should be given to the states to provido a larger number of. agricultural .chemists -a . class of men. for whom Australia is crying out. to-day. . They are needed to advise the' farmer about the qualities and the shortcomings of his soil. Through, the enterprise of Dr. Richardson, of South Australia, D r . Cameron, of Victoria, and others who are working on similar lines in the service of the states, much valuable work has been done, but thiswork is capable of great extension. If the wheat-grower, by the application of scientific knowledge, can increase the efficiency and productivity of his farm, more benefit will accrue I understand that the to Australia than if he is compelled to put his produce into a pool. The ComH a d the monwealth Government, whenever it is asked to do so, should assist in providing machinery for any voluntary effort on behalf of any class of producer. We have dried fruits and dairy produce export control boards, and if the wheat-growers are desirous of pooling their wheat, and approach the Government with anything like unanimity, the Government should do what it can to provide the necessary machinery. I am opposed to compulsion except at the unanimous request of the producers concerned. If they made a In that argument he was on unanimous, request I should not deny them, compulsion, although, personally, I am opposed to it . For these reasons I shall vote against the amendment. the amendment of the honourable member able member for Barker( MrM . CameI believe that I ron) appears to have found ini t a definition of ""socialization."" It proposes a reduction of the vote by £ 1 as-a directionto the Government to take immediate steps to establish a compulA compulsory sory pool, and to enter into negotiations with the respective states in order to give effect to it . If the honourable member is correct in statingthat a compulsory pool is a form of socialization, I hope the press of this country will throw asidenecessary to subdue Ihe its definitions, and accept this one, with, which' I am satisfied. The socializationof the means of production, distribution, and exchange is not, and never has been-, a plank in the Labour party's platform, but it is the objective of the party. What is an objective? It is the goal that we aim at, the end that we hope to reach. Surely the party is not to be condemned for having a l of ty objective. A high",17,Supply Bill No 1

45,For Wannon ( Mr Mcneill,". The honorideal hurts no one. Some one has said, "" A i m at the stars, even if you hit only the chimney tops."" I am not running away from the objective of socialization, but I like to get to the true meaning of it. The words ""sociable"" and ""socialization "" are closely allied, and socialization means the general effort to obtain "" the greatest good for the greatest number."" If the compulsory pooling of wheat is tending in that direction, I am in favour of it . The honourable member complained that a previous speaker did not produce figures. I have figures which prove that over a period of years, from 1900 until the first pool was established, the wheat growers lost money by not having a pool. In January and February of most of those years, when the bulk of the growers were rushing their wheat upon the market, prices were lower than in . the following months. My figures will prove that had there been compulsory pools, the returns to the growers would have been greater than' they were under the system of control by private merchants. . The honourable member mentioned that in South Australia difficulty had been experienced in obtaining replies from the wheat-growers in regard to the continuance of the voluntary pool. That is because the growers are being asked to sign a three-years' (contract}, which will bind them to put at least 50 per cent, of their wheat into the voluntary pool. A large number of growers in South Australia, possibly on account of their financial position, are not prepared to tie themselves up for so long. MrM . CAMEBON -They will be tied up indefinitely if a compulsory pool is formed. no doubt, has in mind our experience with compulsory pools during the war, a time of great stress and extreme difficulty. Because some of the war-time compulsory pools have not yet been wound up, he infers that difficulties and delays would occur in the business of compulsory pools in peace time. He ought to remember the extraordinary circumstances which brought the war-time compulsory pools into existence. He ought also to remember that we have now had eight or nine years' experience of compulsory and voluntary pools, and that the pooling system is well understood in these days. Surely he will agree that we must have learnt something from our experience? I admit frankly that I prefer a voluntary to a compulsory pool; but I find that there is a big possibility that the voluntary pool in South Australia will not be continued. I have made it quite clear to the wheat-growers in my district that, if I thought that the voluntary pool would be terminated, I should use my vote in this House, and my influence everywhere else, to bring a compulsory pool into operation. I told them that if they were not able to take care of themselves I should certainly do what I could to take care of them. It seems to me that it is becoming a question of leaving the wheat-growers to the mercy of the wheat merchants or compelling them to join a compulsory pool. For the reason that I prefer the compulsory pool, I am supporting the amendment. The figures which I propose now to present to honourable members will show that the early seller of wheat nearly always has to be satisfied with a lower price for his product than the grower who can hold it and sell it when he pleases. I had an impression for a long while that that was so, and I have confirmed it by a search of the newspapers from 1900 to 1915 to ascertain the exact position. better deal this year. year's results. BeforeI conclude my address I shall survey the whole period from 1900 until to-day. I have taken my figures from a conservative newspaper, the South Australian Register. The quotations give the price of wheat in trucks at Port Adelaide on the first day of each month named. When the first day of the month has fallen on a Sunday, I have taken the second day. I have omitted half-pence, and where two quotations were given I took the higher one. I shall let the figures speak for themselves. I shall not give quotations for every month in. the year, but shall confine myself to those for January, March, and June. I have taken January and March for the reason that it is in those months that the great majority of the wheat growers sell their crops. I have taken June for the reason that it is fairly safe to say that wheat sold between January",18,Supply Bill No 1

Although the price was 3s. 9d. in May, and it rose again to 3s. 9d. in August, the June price, which 1 have quoted, was only 3s. l d . In that year the early seller gained most, and it is rather fortunate for those who may be opposed to my argument that I have make comparison. Had a compulsory pool been in existence in 1915, the early seller would have been in pocket to the extent of ls. 6d. a bushel, I have taken the average so that it is not surprising that the agitation for a pool became strong at that time. Of course, there were other considerations, such as a shortage in freight, but in that year, on account of It is impossible to calcuprices alone, a good case was made out for the inauguration of a compulsory pool.

57,Mr Gabb,"It certainly would not atequal to that of 14s. on the basis of pre-war prices. We may say that the price of commodities has increased by about one-third. It seems to me, therefore, that if the farming community in South Australia received an average .price of 3s. 9^d. during the period to which I have referred, an equivalent price for this year and for some period ahead would be in tlie neighbourhood of 5s. a bushel on. trucks at Port Adelaide. Experience teaches us that after a war the tendency is for prices to return slowly to the vicinity of the pre-war levels. Looking over the returns of the voluntary pool that has existed in South Australia for the last three years, I find that the average price received by the farmers in my state has been 4s. 9d. a bushel on trucks at Port Adelaide, which is slightly lower than the 5s. which I have estimated, as the likely average price for a period of years upon which farmers must base their plans. I now intend to quote the compulsory and voluntary poo] returns against those obtained from private merchants, for, if the advantage were with the private rcorchants, honourable members opposite, who are opposed to a compulsory pool, would be very ready to refer to them. Victorian Wheat-growers Corporation gives the following as the compulsory pool returns in. South Australia: Year. Price. d. 8. 1915-16 1916-17 3 3 net * 1917-18 1918-19 1919-20 9 1 1920-21 7 4 » ff Jf ff The average net return to the farmers in South Australia during the period that the compulsory pool was operating was5s. 3£d. In arriving, at that figure I made an allowance of 6d. for freight in the year in which freightand charges had to be considered, the experience of the voluntary pool having been that freight and chargesworked out at roughly 7-£d. a bushel. the basis of the price on. trucks at Port Adelaide the compulsory pool figure is 5s. lOd. a bushel, compared with 3s. 9d. a bushel paid by private merchants in the Mr Gabb. previous period. The following prices were paid during the period that the voluntary pool was operating:1921-2, 5s. 0}d. on trucks, Port Adelaide. 1922-3, 4s. 83d. on trucks, Port Adelaide. 1923-4, 4s. 5Jd. on trucks, Port Adelaide. Average, 4s. 9d. That was subsequent to the war, and I admit that to a certain extent the disarrangement due to the war still existed. It win be seen that the comparison between the period under the voluntary pool ancl that under private merchants was as 4s. 9d. is to 3s. 9d. The proper test, however, is a comparison of the returns from the merchants during the same, period. The figures that I shall now quote have been prepared by the management of the voluntary pool. I saw two of the officers of the pool, and said to them, "" If I quote these figures on the platform or anywhere elsej is there any danger that anybody will be able to bore holes' through them ? Have you carefully checked' them ? "" They said, "" We have given them the most careful consideration, ancl you can confidently quote them."" They are as follow:192L-2, 4s. 9id. on trucks, Port. Adelaide. The 1922-3, 4s. 6Jd. on trucks, Port Adelaide. 1923-4, 4s. 3d. on trucks, Port Adelaide. Those figures are the averages of the prices paid by the merchants, as disclosed by quotations published in the press. During those three years the merchants handled, roughly two-thirds of the total quantity of wheat harvested. The loss sustained by the non-poolers in South4 H less freight and charges Australia works out at £265,000, after 4 9 less railway freight making, allowance for the deduction of 5 4 ff ff l d . a bushel for interest in the case of those who pooled their wheat. The prices this year have been as follow:January .. .. .. 6s. 5d. March .. .. .. 6s. 8d. June .. .. .. Gs. 2d. The top price was realized, in February, and it was 6s. lOd. a bushel. I believe that 'the price to-day is approximately 5s. 6d. or 5s. 7d. So far as this year has gone the prices show that the early seller gained to the extent of 3d. a bushel, comparing January with June. OnI desire now toadvance a few reasons for-supporting the establishment of a compulsory pool, quiteapart from that furnished by the figures that I have quoted. Any one who goescarefully through those figures can arrive at but one conclusion, and that is that had there been a pool it would have benefited the wheat.growers. One of my reasons for supporting a pool is that it saves the farmer from the results of alarmist reports that from time to time are published in the press with the object of either inducing him to hold his wheat and carry the loss if a fall in price is imminent, or making him sell if there is a probability of a rise in price. Some honourable members may say, ""Do you believe that the press would print matter that would not be in the interests of the farming community? "" I say that the press will print anything that it is paid to print. In my experience, there has been only one occasion when it has refused matter for which payment was offered. When the anticonscriptionists desired to publish answers to certain statements the press refused to take either their articles or their money. I am perfectly satisfied that many reports are published with the object of "" putting the wind up the farmers/' and inducing them to release their wheat when prices are at their lowest. I have here a quotation from the Adelaide Register, of the 31st May, 191Q> which illustrates the insidious manner in which the press reports suggest that jprices are likely to drop, and that the farmer would be well advised if he sold his crop at the earliest moment. On the 1st May, 1910, the price of wheat was 3s. 9d. a bushel. On the 31st May of that year it had dropped to 3s. Id. a bushel. WhatI shall now quote is a report published by Darling and Company, one of the big wheat-buying companies in Australia. It reads:Owing to the collapse in the wheat markets of America and Europe, great uncertainty prevails, and the decline in prices has been most serious. Values of Australian cargoes of wheat at port of call do not now exceed 31s. 6d. per 480 lb. ci.f., and parcels for prompt shipment by steamer to London and Liverpool are nominally viorth 31s. per 480 lb. c.i.f. This means a very serious reduction on rates current, .and it looks as though there is no immediate prospect of improvement, and a question about which there is some uncertainty is how much lower prices are going. That report conveys the impression that the farmers would be acting wisely if they sold immediately. What happened ? By the 1st July the price had risen to 3s. 5d. a bushel, and by the 1st August it was restored to the old price of 3s. 9d. a bushel. The report was published in the hope that it would influence the actions of those who had stored wheat. Had any farmer taken notice of the suggestion that there was great uncertainty as to how much lower prices would fall he might have disposed of what he held. ther ? I can judge, the existence of a pool prevents the farmer from being "" bull dozed "" by reports that are published with the object of misleading him regarding the state of the market. I have another reason for supporting a pool. Under the existing system of selling to merchants, who reaps the benefit of the great gain in weight that takes place between the time that the wheat is placed in the siding and the time that it is sold? Some will probably say that the gain in weight is infinitesimal, but I point out that during the three years that the voluntary pool has operated in South Australia, handling only one-third of the wheat, it has saved to the wheat-growers the not insignificant sum of £17,800. Honourable members will seo that the private merchants who in the same period handled two-thirds of the South Australian wheat must have benefited to the extent of £35,600 from the same cause. That is a strong reason for the establishment of a compulsory pool Bamford) -The honourable member's time has expired, but as no other honourable member wishes to intervene, he may continue for a second period. out that when wheat is sold to the private merchants there is a tendency towards centralization, with the result that the outports are neglected. Before there was any wheat pool in South Australia, the price quoted for wheat at the outports was generally -Jd. or l d . per bushel less than at Port Adelaide, but since the pools operated in that state the price quoted in the press has been the same at Port Adelaide and the chief outports, showing that the pooling system tends towards decentralization.

"" compulsory."" their system is much the same as that outlined by the honourable member for growers should obtain the f u ll return for their production. The establishment in Australia of a compulsory pool would enable its managers to co-operate with those controlling the wheat of the two countries I have mentioned, not for the purpose of bringing about a monopoly, but in an endeavour to reduce the margin between the top and bottom prices for wheat. I read with interest the recommendation of Sir John Higgins regarding wool, and was particularly struck with his definition of ""stabilization."" He said that his idea of stabilization was not to fix prices, but to prevent undue fluctuations in price. The establishment of a compulsory pool would also tend to eliminate the speculators and those who in the past have robbed the farmers. favour of a compulsory pool is that under a system of pooling it is possible for the return of commission on freight to be made to the grower. In this oon r nexion I desire to refer again to the voluntary pool in South Australia. During the three years in which it has operated the sum of £44,383 has been returned to the growers. small sum when we consider that the pool dealt with one-third only of the state's wheat. I understand that the refund was made possible by a system which eliminated the delay which, sometimes exists in connection with the loading of the wheat boats. tralian Farmers' Union has had to bear its share of criticism, but in its conduct of the business of the voluntary pool it has done good service to the farmers of South Australia. A further reason for my support of a compulsory pool is that without a pooling system South Australia will again revert to the "" honourable understandings "" of the past. History repeats itself; human nature is unaltered; and without a system of pooling the greedy merchants who in 1908 and 1912 robbed the farmers, will rob them again. The Ministry is a combination of members of the honourable the Nationalist and Country parties. Allegedly, there are five Country party members, but actually there are but I did not use the word three, in the persons of the Treasurer The idea underlying (Dr. Earle Page), .the Postmaster-General( Mr Gibson), and the Minister for Works and Railways( MrH ill ) . The Honorary Minister( Mr Atkinson) was previously a Nationalist, whilst Senator Wilson does not belong to the Country party; he is really a Nationalist. The Prime Minister took these men into the Ministry to make it appear that the Country party was well represented, but he knew that at heart two ""of them were Nationalists. This coalition Ministry this year refused the finance necessary to establish in South Australia even a voluntary pool, except under impossible conditions. The Prime Minister said that we have no power to establish a compulsory pool. I say that he has neither the inclination nor the desire to do so. The Government was prepared to leave the farmers of South Australia at the mercy of the merchants, but the advent of a Labour Government made posAnother argument in sible a voluntary pool in that state. The Country party professes to stand, above all things, for co-operative marketing, and for the primary producer reaping a fair return from his labour; but its leader, Dr. Earle Page, has sold the Country party and "" turned down "" the South Australian farmers in regard to wheat pooling. Are honourable members That is no aware that on the very day that it was announced that a voluntary pool was to be established in South Australia the price of wheat increased by 3d. per bushel?

I comply with the terms of the amendment, and negotiate with the states in order to ascertain whether the farmers do or do not require a compulsory pool. No such action has been taken. It is re' inarkable that the Prime Minister in this House, eighteen months or two years ago, said that a wheat pool would be the last pool to be guaranteed by his Government. orable memher tell us something concerning the disgraceful waste which occurred under a compulsory pool?

The farmers have paid for the waste incurred, and for the experience gained, but this Government will not now help them to go on. principle were also placed in charge. n of the pooling system were strong advocates of private enterprise, and did all in their power to prevent the pooling system being a success. Under a compulsory pooling system, the growers would obtain advantages in chartering freights and in the general handling of wheat. The honourable member for Wannon also suggested that the assistance of the Commonwealth Bank should be obtained. MrM pool more advantageous than a voluntary pool? the honourable member of what has occurred in South Australia under a voluntary pool. Apparently it . is my duty, and not that of the honourable member, to protect the interests of the farmers in that state. I notice in to-day's newspapers that Sir John Higgins has suggested what is really a compulsory wool poql, although he has termed it a voluntary pool. He suggests that licences should be issued to control the export of wool. I am not opposing such a system; and, if the question of the establishment of such a pool were before the House, I think I should support it. Notwithstanding that the right honourable the suggest that the Government Prime Minister said that under the Constitution the Government has no power to create a compulsory pool, it has established a Dried Fruits Exports Control Board and a Dairy Produce Exports Control Board with power to control exports. The Government has not, I know, given these boards power to compulsorily acquire the products of these industries for export, but it has given them power to issue licences to control exports. If the Government has not the power, as the Prime Minister states, to compulsorily acquire these products, he has shown that his Government is prepared to issue licences in order to control exports. Whyshould not similar action be taken in regard to wheat? No action whatever has been taken.' The Government is prepared to leave the wheat-growers entirely at the mercy of the merchants. I can reply to the Prime Minister's question as to the power of the Government by asking him another question: Has the Governthe ment the desire to establish a pool? The right honourable gentleman's own words in Hansard supply the answer. The Government is controlling the price of markSj some of the men placed in control sugar, and in order to do so negotiated with the states. Has the Government gone to the State Governments in regard to wheat? It has not. In dealing with the sugar problem, the Government gave consideration to the opinions of certain honourable members opposite; but, although there are representatives of wheat-growers on both sides of the House, the Government does not think that they deserve as much conCAMERON -I s a compulsory sideration as other primary producers. I am not saying one word against the sugar agreement, because I am a strong supporter of our White Australia policy. There is a way in which to assist the wheat-growers if the Government only had the inclination. I am not surprised to find that negotiations with the State Governments have not been opened up; because this is a big business government, consisting of business men! It ' is the government which disposed of the Geelong Woollen Mills, which attempted to wipe off over £1,000,000 in land tax, which introduced l j d . postage, involving a loss of £1,100,000, as a concession to big city interests, which reduced the income tax rates by 10 per cent., and which allowed men such as Sir Sidney Kidman",23,Earlepage I N A R R I V I N G At His Chosen June As The Month With Which To

I quote a statement of the Prime Minister's, taken from the Age newspaper, which, I presume, is correct. The right honourable gentleman said, "" The wheat industry should be organized on a nation-wide basis."" That is what we ask for. A vote of this House would show whether honourable members opposite are prepared to follow the advice of their leader, so that the wheat industiy could be organized on a nation-wide basis. The right honourable gentleman then went on to say that the extraordinary powers exercised during the war had gone. He also stated that the Government was endeavouring to assist the dried fruit industry and the dairying industry. If it is possible in a time of war to override the Constitution it is worthwhile straining a point to see if assistance cannot be given in times of peaoe. more than did the honourable member when those powers were used. were "" misused."" against the use of the powers, but as the honourable member for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney) suggests, against their misuse. They were exercised in a time of emergency. There has never been a bigger emergency in trade than existed in the dried-fruit industry last year, and even this year, yet Ministers would not take a risk, and compulsorily acquire, dried fruits for export purposes. Had they done so, and had their action been challenged, three justices of the High Court would no doubt have been called upon to give a pronouncement upon the matter, and two might have been on one side and one on the other in declaring that the Government was right or wrong. The position summed up is as follows: Mr Allan, the Victorian Premier, says, "" Go to the Commonwealth, we have not the power to control trade between the states."" The Commonwealth Government says, "" We have not the power to do it . "" .And so the matter is pushed back on the states again. The present Government will not even negotiate with the states in order to arrive at some understanding It canwhich would make a pool possible. According to the Age, the Prime Minister said on Friday lastThe Commonwealth Government was not prepared to take over control of industries, and interfere with those whose legitimate function it was to control them. I should like to have had the Hansard report of the right honourable gentleman's speech, because I think his words were, -"" We are prepared to allow those who have slowly and laboriously built up a system of marketing to retain control .>f it . "" However, the Hansard record not being available, I accept the Prime Minister's statement, as reported in the Age, that Ministers are prepared to allow trade to follow its legitimate course. That is to say, they are willing to stand by and see the farmers robbed by having to pay 18s. 9d. a dozen for bags. They are prepared to continue a system that deprived the fanners of 5d. a bushel on their wheat through the rigging of the exchange position. Ministers will allow business to follow its ordinary course, and they will o one complained not interfere, but I claim that the time has come when the people of the country must settle the question once and for all, and brand the Government, as it rightly deserves to be branded, as a "" big man's"" Government, which will permit the small man to go hang.

83,Mr Hill,"I shall tell the honorahlethe price of wheat as compared with the price which was obtainable in South Australia under open market conditions. On a certain day wheat was offering at 3s. 9d. a bushel at a railway station in South Australia, whereas at a railway station in Victoria the same distance from the sea-board the price obtainable was 4s. I d . most decidedly have asked for it, but a bushel. On that particular day there was open marketing in South Australia whereas in Victoria a voluntary pooling system compelled the open market buyer to pay a legitimate price. A few days later, when a voluntary pool was set up in South Australia the price at the same railway station rose from 3s. 9d. to the parity of 4s. 7d. which was obtainable in Victoria. Therefore, I -quite agree with what the honourable member for Angas has said onthat point. The honourable member for ""Wannon Government toestablish a compulsory pool. As a matter of fact, the wheat growers have, for a considerable time past, been asking, not for a compulsory pool, that is to say a pool operating throughout the whole of the Commonwealth in which all would share alike, but for a Commonwealth guarantee for a compulsory pool in. each state. During the war period, when there was a compulsory pool operating in all the states, wheat sold in any state for local consumption was sold on account of that particular state, and wheat sold overseas was sold on account of all the states. It did not matter if a cargo from South Australia realized 3s. 5d. a bushel and one from Victoria 6s. a bushel, at the final settlement the total amount realized from all sales was averaged. Therefore, assuming that the average net realization for the whole of Australia's exportable surplus of wheat was 5s. abushel, and that the average net realization on wheat sold for home consumption in any one state was also 5s. a bushel, the price paid to the grower in that state was 5s. But actually that was not the case, because the price realized for home consumption varied considerably in the different states. asking, not for a compulsory pool as proposed by the honorahle member for Wannon, but for a Commonwealth guarantee for a compulsory pool in each state, each state actually marketing its own produce through a single selling agency, and employing one chartering agency only. It will be time enough to grant a compulsory pool extending over the Commonwealth when the wheat growers' organizations in all the Statesask for it. If they wanted one they would they have not done so. As a matter of fact, South Australia and Western Australia have decided in favour of voluntary pools. Western Australia has ""decided to continue indefinitely under the present system of a voluntary pool. I suppose that no other voluntary pool in the Commonwealth has been more successful than has that which has been in operation in the western state. Last year out of a total harvest of about 21,000,000 bushels, no less than 18,000,000 bushels passed through the voluntary pool or through the warehousing scheme, each organization receiving about half that quantity. The offer of the Premier of Victoria to have a five-years' voluntary pool has been accepted by the executive of the Victorian Farmers Union. Union has re-affirmed its belief in the system of a compulsory pool. possible to secure a compulsory pool in all the states,. Western Australia and South Australia having already decided on voluntary pools, the executive of the Victorian Farmers Union decided to accept theoffer made by Mr Allan for a five-years' voluntary pool, with a guarantee of 75 per cent.

M. Hughes) in this House on this particular subject. If the right honourable gentleman's memory is as good as mine, he will probably recall some of the incidents that occurred on that occasion. Mr W. M . HUGHES-They all attacked me. That makes no difference. What is one among so many? there was a Commonwealth compulsory pool guaranteeing the growers 5s. per bushel net, and the then Labour Government of New South Wales, to which the honourable member for Hume referred, offered an additional guarantee of 2s. 6d. per bushel, making a total of 7s. 6d. per bushel net to the grower. Thisi t was unable to pay as early as promised, and eventually the Australian Wheat Board made the additional advance of 2s. 6d. per bushel under the guarantee of the State Government. The honourable member for Hume may be interested to know that the action of that State Government resulted in a loss of £750,000 to the taxpayers of New South Wales. did it have on the quantity of wheat put into the pool? the New South Wales Government did not display any great ability in the operation and management of the pool. The honourable member for Hume also referred to a paragraph which he said was taken from the Farmers'' Advocate. Let me quote from a leading article in the same paper of Thursday last, the 19th June, in which this statement is madeThere seems, however, no doubt that the Premier took the common-sense course in putting the voluntary pool on a sound foundation, price in Australia for local consumption. instead of staking everything on a compulsory measure, which, if it ever got through the Upper House, would have been fllled with legal loopholes. article went on to say what the Premier there, the price for local consumption should do, and suggested that he should would be 3s. 9d. per bushel. come to the Federal Government. The honorahle member has conveniently omitted to quote that. It appears in the paragraph following that which he has read. says no such thing. What is at the back I have a lively recollecof this amendment? Is there an honest desire on the part of honourable members opposite to help the man on the land? I am always willing to give credit where credit is due, but in my opinion the amendment has been moved for one purpose, and one only; and that is, to harass the Government, and as far as possible to embarrass honourable members ""sitting behind the Government. I have said that in 1921 very successful, judging by the honourable gentleman's speech. not going to embarrass me. I heard at least one honourable member on the Opposition side contend that the farmer is not entitled to export parity for his wheat. A "" reasonable price "" has been suggested. Who is going to say what is a reasonable price? Assuming that a reasonable price could be agreed upon and fixed for local consumption, by what method is the grower to secure the same price for his exportable surplus, which represents approximately 75 per cent, of the total crop ? I hold the opinion that the grower is legitimately entitled, not only to export parity, but might go so far as to demand import parity for that portion of his wheat which is sold for local consumption. While holding this opinion, I would not suggest that this should be put into practice. What at least might he done through the organization of the industry is to put a price upon wheat which would be equivalent to London or European values. I would place the home consumer in the position of having to pay only the same price as the poorly-paid workers of Great Britain and the Continent. Surely there could be no objection to that! If wheat were worth 5s. per bushel net i i i London, 5s. per bushel should be the The wheat-grower would then be getting a middle price between export parity and import parity.

W it h regard to the main and most important factors in the marketing of wheat, namely, selling, chartering, and handling, and the equitable distribution of the cost,there is no possible doubt that the principle of compulsory wheat pooling is the ideal method. be gainsaid at times of national crisis such as faced Australia, and indeed the whole.world, at the advent of the great war, but conditions and national circumstances are ever altering, and this naturally affects an important principle such as is involved in a general policy of compulsory wheat pooling. No one who has followed w it h any degree of insight or first-hand knowledge the march, of our national affairs since the war and the many changes in the conditions of marketing primary products can reasonably argue that as strong a need for a compulsory wheat pool exists iu Australia to-day as in the early war period. necessity; to-day it resolves itself into a question of expediency. During the war and post-war periods the Commonwealth Government and the State Governments conducted an Australian compulsory wheat pool, and maintained one selling and one chartering agency for the marketing of all wheat beyond that required for consumption in Australia. bitterly opposed to the principle of wheat pooling can gainsay that the overseas marketing of the exportable surplus of -wheat by the Australian authority was other than a very great success from both -the -national and the wheat-growers' point of, view, An y complaints which may ""have been made concerned only inefficiency in organization and handling in certain of the states.

107,Mr Hill,"W h i l s t I am personally i ngrown, and there ia seldom a surplus over, actual local requirements, there is agovernment wheat pool. In South Australia and Western Australia the Labour Governments which hold office have been repeatedly requested to form compulsory pools for those states, but each government'has consistently declined to do so. In both cases the Government has backed, and is backing, the voluntary wheat pools operating in those states, and, to all appearances, favours the voluntary as opposed to the compulsory principle. The position in Victoria is similar to thatexisting in South Australia and Western Australia to-day. The growers, through their executive, have decided on a voluntary pool. affirmed the principle of a compulsory pool. ment proposes to submit a measure under which the voluntary wheat pool will, for five years be guaranteed advances up to 7-5 per cent, of the value of the wheat. This very satisfactory alternative will enable, the organization controlling the voluntary wheat pool, to carry on under far better conditions than are possible under the existing unsatisfactory tenure from year to year. I have had consider-, able experience of the actual operations of wheat pooling-bot h compulsory and voluntary-and can lay claim to speak on this subject with a measure of authority possessed by very few. was a member of the Wheat Board which conducted a compulsory pool for oix years, and a member, also, of the Victorian Wheat Corporation for four years. I unhesitatingly say that the uncertainty of tenure, which has beset the boards controlling the voluntary pools in each of the states, has been to the decided detriment of the pooling operations. There are many distinct advantages, of which the Victorian farmers are f u l l y cogof a voluntary system. Their action has nizant, to begained under the offer of a five years' voluntary pool, with a state guarantee-. This will enable the Wheat Corporation, which has been in existence for between three and four years, to effect early charters, and to make forward sales. This organization is working under theFriendly Societies Act. It has a large number of shareholders, and themaximum number of shares which can be held by any one person is 200. A large percentage of the wheat-growers in Victoria have taken up shares in the corporation, and to-day its paid-up capital, including reserves, is approximately £100,000. Voluntary pools of the past were crippled owing, to the fact that each year the organizations in the various states were compelled to approach their respective State Governments for help to finance the season's crop. By the time the arrangements were completed and in running, order, large quantities of wheat had been sold' on the open market, and charters already effected by private buyers. It is absolutely necessary that any organization handling large quantities of wheat should be in a position to eifect early' charters. One of the great disadvantages that the corporation has been subject to is the uncertainty of. tenure of voluntary pools and of those in charge of them, resulting in the farmers connected with the corporation receiving no information regarding the The Victorian Governfinancing and marketing of the wheat crop. This has delayed us"" in effecting charters and in getting to work. An y successful pooling system-whethe r compulsory or voluntary-mus t have only one chartering andone selling agency. The representatives of the various voluntary pools in the four wheat-growing states recently held a conference, at which it was decided to l i m it the chartering agents for the four states and also to collaborate with each other as often as required, with a view to the elimination of competition in sellI ing. I am informed that Western Australia is prepared to continue the voluntary pool, either with or without Government assistance. the competition of private buyers. ber of our growers are selfish, and, though they remain outside the pools, they take advantage of the pricescreated as a result caused the demand which exists to-day for a compulsory pool. Three states are now in a position to continue voluntary pools for some years to come. It is highly probable that New South Wales will also f a l l into line. In view of the fact that the Prime Minister has explained that it is not possible for the Commonwealth to grant a compulsory pool,, that, the Premier of Victoria has promised a fiveyears' voluntary poolwhich offer has been accepted by the",29,Earlepage I N A R R I V I N G At His Chosen June As The Month With Which To

The Government's policy lis to specting the pool? The Minister himself ensure a continuous voluntary pool, advances for which will be automatic and provided for by the changes now being made in the operations of the Commonwealth Bauk, designed for co-operation, not only in wheat, but in all other industries. -The Minister for Works and Railways( MrH ill ) , when making his speech, roamed over a wide range of territory. I "" claim to be at least half as intelligent as They have largely succeeded, and the is the average man, and yet I cannot say whether he favoured a compulsory or a voluntary pool. He pointed out the advantages of the voluntary pool, but later said that he refused to support it. The amendment moved by the honourable memasks the Government to take steps to bring about a compulsory pool, and to consult with the State Governments to give proper effect to the wishes of the wheat-growers of the Commonwealth. Before he became a Minister, the honourable member for Echuca was a consistent advocate of the farmers when they approached the Government on matters of' vital importance to them. Now that he is in the Ministry, instead of leading the farmers to the Government, he is endeavouring to keep them away. He says, "" Go away and do not bother us; we do not want to he bothered with you. We are busy building cruisers overseas, and have no time to talk about wheat pools.""

I shall produce the article for the Minister's perusal. What is the position rehas unwittingly given an excellent reason for the formation of a compulsory pool. He said that the disadvantage of a voluntary pool was that selfish farmers would not put their wheat into it . I know that in New South Wales certain growers who engaged to put their wheat into the voluntary pool, sold to speculators at l d . or l j d . a bushel above the price obtainable from the pool. The speculators deliberately purchased wheat at high prices to try to break up the voluntary pool voluntary pooling system is consequently ineffective. The whole of the facts should be placed before the farmers. In this Parliament are men who are vitally interested not only in the export of wheat, but also in rural organizations. They are running with the hare and hunting with the hounds. No one knows whicli interests are uppermost in their minds. When the last vote of the farmers was taken in Victoria, 12,600 voted for, and 1,800 against, a compulsory pool. In New South Wales a Labour Government successfully controlled the operation of a compulsory pool. : a success, because the' Government had to meet a deficit of £750,000. suggested by some of the Government supporters that the guarantee of 7s. 6d. was given to the farmers as a bribe for election purposes.

On this point let me quote, for the edification of honourable 1 membersopposite^ a statement by a well known high panjandrum of their own political persuasion. Sir Joseph Carruthers, speaking to the members of the New South Wales Chamber of Agriculture, saidTho last season has been a real good one for the wheat-grower, but the two previous seasons were responsible for a grave setback to the industry. The bad handling of the pools and the poor return therefrom to the growers caused many to abandon cultivation for a time. Luckily,, the prospects to-day are quite changed, and a harvest of over 50,000,000 bushels has been garnered, with a guarantee of 7s. 6d. per bushel. This practical result will do more to restore agriculture in New South Wales than any number of legislative acts, which ignore the fact tliat good seasons and good prices are the best remedies for agricultural depression, and without them other remedies may fail. In this there is no suggestion of condemnation of the Labour Government from the representative of anti-Labour in the New South Wales Legislative Council. On the contrary, he commends Labour, and, in effect, condemns his own party for their unsatisfactory handling of the previous wheat pools. now emphasize the advantages that will accrue to the farmers by the institution of a compulsory pool. In the first place it will mean only one selling authority, instead of six, for the whole of Australia. With independent state pools in operation there will be the risk of six sellers competing for the trade of those ""who want to buy our wheat. been remedied by the farmers agreeing to sell co-operatively. without compulsion, every wheat-grower not in a pool will also be a seller, and, in addition, speculators will compete for wheat charters. opposite represent the speculators. They want the present state of affairs to continue. Do honourable members realize what the Australian wheat-growers stand to gain from the operation of a compulsory pool which will eliminate underselling by wheat-growers who might be outside a voluntary pool? Let me state the position. It is estimated that this year wheat production in Australia will total 164,041,709 bushels, and that theexportabl<Tsurplus will be 124,000,000 bushels. If , in the absence of a compulsory pool and through the operation of speculators) we lose only ld. a bushel on the exportable surplus, the total loss to the farmers will be £516,666. If , on the other hand, we gain another l d . a bushel on the exportable surplus, we shall be to the good to the extent of over £1,000,000, that repre_ senting the difference in the two positions. I estimate that under acompulsory pool the wheat-growers of Australia will benefit to the extent of at least 3d. a bushel on sales alone. Other authorities who have studied the situation think that the saving will be more than3d., but for the purposes of my argument I estimate the saving at 3d. a bushel. If we can achieve that result it will mean approximately an additional £1,500,000 to the wheat growers of Australia, plus economies effected in handling charges at the port of shipment and further advantages to be derived from having only one chartering authority as well as a considerable saving to the community through the public control of the railways. arrangement in the different states to have one chartering and one selling Let me authority. der the voluntary system it is not possible to eliminate the operation of speculators. them up to the scratch. the "" honourable understandings "" of which we hear occasionally?

155,Mr Cunningham,"That was notthat, sir. When wheat goes into a pool it can be graded, and, notwithstanding the statement of speculators that no allowance can be made to the producer of wheat which is above the f.a.q. standard, the members of the hoard in New South Wales were of the opinion that such an allowance could be made just as easily as a. deduction is made for wheat under the standard. As a wheat-grower I see no obstacles to prevent the payment of a bonus to a farmer who keeps his field clean and produces wheat above the f.a.q. standard. At Darling Harbour the wheat was graded-; that is to say, wheat weighing, say, only 59 lb. to the bushel was mixed with wheat weighing, say, 64 lb., thus bringing the whole up to a good milling .quality. be overcome by having a greater range of classification? he possible, but there is only one standard at the present time, and the farmer who produces wheat above f.a.q. receives no special consideration. The board in New South Wales also did its own stevedoring, and earned no less than £59,567 in what is designated "" dispatch money."" They made a saving in stevedoring of £74,823 14s. 10d., or a total saving over tlie agents' offer of £91,000. That shows what can he done in a co-operative effort of this character, with the state, where it should be, at the head. It also illustrates how the farmer is robbed every year if he is not protected by a pool. Some honourable members decry the workers of Australia, particularly those who are employed on the wharfs and in connection with shipping. In reply to them, I shall quote figures relating to ships that were loaded expeditiously, and for which dispatch money was earned Time occupied Time saved Dispatch Money. Vessel. loaded. .Days.

If the stevedoring had been done by private firms, which generally refuse to pay overtime, the dispatch money would not have been earned. The payment of overtime returns two or three times as much in dispatch money. The object of a stevedoring firm is to earn money by stevedoring, whereas a pool does both chartering and dispatching. The object of the pool is to dispatch a ship quickly. Some honourable members object to a representative of the workers being on the board of management of government undertakings. I remind them that there was a representative of the men on the New South Wales Wheat Board, and that there was not a hitch in the"" loading of the wheat from the time when the first bushel came into Darling Island until the last bushel went out.

I contend that what has happened in the past is likely to happen in the future. It is f a r better for us to remove our great producing industries from political influence and control. I hold strongly that we are not justified in compelling producers were the to do anything with their produce that they do not wish to do, unless compulsion is necessary in the interests of the country. The man who tills the ground, and does all the Incompetence and exwork of production, should be permitted to handle his product as he pleases, unless the granting of such liberty to him endangers the welfare of the nation. In a time of war there may be substantial reasons for the compulsory pooling of wheat or other products, but in normal times the producers should be permitted to The handle their products as they think fit. feres with the welfare of their fellow producers ? That statement the exercise of this liberty would have that effect. Of course, many arguments may be adduced for and against a compulsory wheat pool, but personally I object strongly to unnecessary legislative interference with the liberty of our people. We all know of the difficulties that occurred in chartering ships during the period of compulsory wheat handling. They were caused because the wrong people were appointed as chartering agents. I am not complaining about what happened in those days of hurry and rush, but I say unhesitatingly that the same kind of thing is likely to happen But nothing like as again under government control. No one knows better than the honourable member for Wimmera that, although Ministers appoint to different positions men in During the period of whom they have the utmost confidence, they are frequently disappointed with the results.

Producers naturally desire to get' the most they can for their wheat, and when agents of private firms offer 6s. 3d. a bushel for wheat it is only natural for farmers to sell to them. happening is one of the arguments I have frequently used in favour of compulsory pooling. my arguments against it. It cannot be said that the wheat pools that have been formed in Australia have operated with unqualified success. I have endeavoured to find out the export prices obtained in Australia as cpmpared with those ruling in the Argentine, where wheat is sold by the quintal, which consists of 220 lb., or 3§ bushels. I had some difficulty in arriving at a comparison of prices, hecause the figures published in The Economist were given in francs. My figures cover the period from 1913 to 1.919, and I have assumed that the franc was normal up to that time. Assuming that the franc was at par, the comparison is as follows:Year. Argentine Export Parity. Australian Export. Parity. a. 1913 1914 1910 5 2 5 7 1916 1917 1918 1919 In 1920 the Australian price was 9s., but I have not been able to ascertain the price in thc Argentine for that year. quoted show that during the whole of the period in which wheat pools were in existence in Australia, the prices obtained in the Argentine were, on the average, much higher than those ruling in the Oommonwealth. hinged upon shipping.

He said that, although this Government claimed to be a custodian of the interests lof the producers, it allowed bags to be sold at 18s. 6d. a dozen, and connived at the robbery 'of the farmers, wbich was made possible by the exchange difficulty.

Surely that institution should have heen able to take such action as was necessary to prevent that unhappy condition of affairs? If , following upon'the introduction of a compulsory wheat pool, Australia is to he burdened with a government that will seek to purchase all the producers' requirements for them, the outlook for' the country will be sad indeed.

I hope that, instead of bringing forward a proposal for a compulsory pool, the Government will view with sympathy any effort in the direction of cooperation on the part of the primary producers themselves. In my own state the growers are satisfied with the voluntary pool. to help finance the voluntary pool in South Australia last year. Dr. finance the whole of the pools last year. tralia thc administration of the pools has been fairly satisfactory, and I believe a similar remark is applicable to the control by pools in Victoria; but in South Australia and New South Wales the adI ministration has been bad. If , in consequence of government interference and ing is not rendered unprofitable, in another generation Western Australia will be the largest wheat-growing state in the Commonwealth. If governments devoted their attention to devising means of reducing the cost of production, and refrained from interference with the handlingof wheat, they would probably do a great deal of good. This Government might very well appoint a commission to inquire into the reasons for the high cost of wheat production. In the event of a heavy yield* of wheat in Canada, and with Russia returning to wheat growing, as I believe she is, there might be a surplus in the world's markets, and the value of wheat would drop. As long as the price remains at 6s. a bushel, nobody can complain, but if it drops to anything like 3s. or 4s. a bushel, that will cause one of the greatest disasters that has ever overtaken Australia. In stead of talking of government control, it would be better to ascertain the possibilities in regard to wheat growing in Australia, and give special facilities to the producers to induce them to cultivate increased areas, thereby providing additional employment and building up the wealth of the community. This would be far preferable to allowing a few incompetent politicians to take control of millions of pounds worth of the people's property; but if a compulsory' pool is determined upon, the whole control should be with the producers, and import parity paid for wheat here. Sitting suspended from 6.80 to 8 p.m. Mr W. M. HUGHES (North Sydney) [8.0] I should not have intruded into this debate had not reference been made -necessarily , I suppose-to the pooling system inaugurated by governments over which I had the honour to preside.

197,Mr Gregory,"In Western Ausof bearing the speech delivered by the honourable member for Wannon( Mr way the honourable member for Swan McNeill) in moving his amendment, but I have heard much criticism of it, and from press reports have gathered a great deal of his argument. If I knew-and it is this uncertainty which adds a certain amount of piquancy to the proceedingswhat was in the mind of the Government, I might he able to give it some little assistance. I am utterly unable, however, to say whether it is or is not in favour of a voluntary pool; while, as to its attitude towards the proposal for a compulsory pool, all that I have been able to learn from it is that there are many and serious difficulties confronting any government that seeks to create such a pool. For that reason, principally, the Government is unable to see its way to co-operate with the states in this matter. The difficulties to which I have just referred are constitutional in their character. Curiously enough, those are precisely the diffitheir opposition to compulsory pools. I culties that, I understand, presented themselves to the Premier of Victoria, Mr Allan. He found that tlie powers -of the state were wholly insufficient to enable him to accede to this most reasonable and, I might say, pleasing request. For we must assume that Mr Allan, as a representative of the Farmers Union, is anxious to show what a pleasure it would be to him to fall in with its suggestions. I understand that those suggestions were put in a form that left little room for doubt as to what they were meant to convey. As I have been, all my life, until quite recently, associated with organizations that from time to time set out their ideas upon men and things, and present them to those in authority, I am perfectly well aware of the frame of mind in which Mr Allan regards this resolution of the Farmers Union. He said-in effect-that he was quite willing to go to Ariadne in her distress, but that, unhappily, he was so bound and fettered that, struggle how he might, it was quite impossible for him to assist her, and that she must, therefore, look for another protector. This, like a sensible female, she forthwith did. She oame here, but her reception was distinctly chilly, not altogether dissimilar to that which she met with at the hands of Mr Allan. one of these honourable gentlemen on my right is anxious to help her-som e in one way, some in another. In precisely what ( Mr Gregory) would help her I was not able to gather from his speech, although I shifted my tent in order that I might understand exactly how he wished to do it. They are all most anxious to go to her and to do her bidding, but, alas, are prevented by many and great difficulties. All are bursting with zeal to help her, but not a hand is lifted ! During this debate there has been little, if any, direct opposition to a pool. I heard this afternoon the attack made by the honourable member for Barker( Mr M. Cameron) upon the socialistic ideals of honourable members opposite; but even he is in favour of a voluntary pool. It is very curious to me, as one whose lot it has been to father all sorts of pools, and to create them ab initio, to hear honourable memhers refer to tfu'ir championship of voluntary pools and have never been able to understand rhedifference between them.. The difference between the voluntary and compulsorypools was merely one of arrangement; inducements and penalties were present in both. I ask myself, and incidently those who are gathered around mc, what precisely are the difficulties that this Government or Mr Allan's Government finds standing in the way of cooperating one with the other for the purpose of establishing a nation-wide cooperative voluntary or compulsory pool. The difficulties are said to be constitutional in their nature. The word Constitution is something like that blessed word Mesopotamia-it cometh forth like incense, and spreadeth itself like milk and honey over the land, covering a multitude of futilities. I was under the impression that the states had every power necessary for complete self-government, save those handed over to the Commonwealth under the Constitution Act and duly set out therein. I cannot for a moment believe that there is wanting either in the states or the Commonwealth power to do anything and everything necessary for the welfare of the whole people. If there :s, then it ought to be rectified without delay, and, although I do not profess to spe.ik as an expert in regard to the Constitution She is told that every of the State of Victoria, I believe nothing could be simpler than the procedure necessary for an amendment.

I shall, no doubt, be -told just what it is we lack to enable us -to co-operate with the governments of the .states to establish either a or a compulsory pool. say ab once where I stand on this matter. hesitancy on the part of some of my honourable friends, and it is necessary for -some one to define his attitude. sult of some years of experience, I believe that the scheme best calculated to serve the interests of the farmers, and most in 'Consonance with the spirit of the people -of Australia, is what is known as a voluntary pool. I started out, of course, with very different ideas; but I was chastised with whips and scorpions, more particularly by honourable gentlemen of the Country party benches on my right, who denounced me vehemently, -compulsion was odious to them. -arguments so impressed me that, like another Saul of Tarsus, I listened to them, and without going so far as to be converted, I yet heeded what they said. T went to the country and said that I should continue the pooling system, but on a voluntary basis. No sooner had I done this-and i oo sudden conversion-than friends, who had evidently been reading some of my previous speeches, became converted in their turn. '.had turned in one way whilst I , at their behest, had turned in another, and upon my return I found, to my amazement and .» little to my horror, that they were all in Mr W. M. Hughes. favour of a compulsory pool. I admit Kingthat they said it was a voluntary pool slightest that they wanted, but it was that kind of that the British Parliament voluntary pool under which everybody was the Victorian Consticompelled to do what .these gentlemen in any way that the Parliawanted. In which case they would be perfectly satisfied! I am in favour of that kind of pool which was in force in the last year of my administration. It Union, therefore worked very well. It placed the direct It will financial responsibility in the hands of the Commonwealth Bank. It gave to the Our own farmers control and placed . upon their shoulders responsibility, which, in To amend our Conmy opinion, is a very healthy and necesamendment sary thing for them, since, whatever they Commonwealth may be as farmers, as critics nothing like them has been seen in the I speak to-night as a humble world from the time of Adam. That is whei«e I stand. I am not opposed to a compulsory pool in the sense that some of my friends are opposed to it . Nor am I one of those who believe that there is some abounding virtue in a name. voluntary I believe that the great principle underI had better lying good government is to do that There is a certain amount of which best serves the interests of the people. Whetheri t he done hy this "" is m "" or that "" is m "" is immaterial. As a reCompulsion is neither good nor had, but as men make.it so. Honourable members all know that compulsion is sometimes necessary, and that frequently those who cry out most loudly against compulsion are its strongest advocates where it serves their own interests. Nevertheless, for the reasons that I have set out, I prefer a voluntary pool. I ask the Government, and particularly the Leader of who sit on the sacred the Country party ( D r . Earle Page), why whatever action is necessary to co-operate declaring that the idea of w i th the wheat-growing states to provide Theirf o r an effective pool is not taken? A l though the honourable member for Wannon( MrM c N e ill ) asks for a compulsory pool, I have no doubt that his constituents So would be satisfied if they obtained an effective pool, hy whatever name it was known. The farmers of Victoria are demanding a compulsory pool, and I say to this shows the danger of both the Government of Victoria and the my honourable Government of the Commonwealth that there is nothing in the constitution of either the State or the Commonwealth Unhappily, they which prevents them from establishing a compulsory or a voluntary pool. The right honourable the Prime Minister said that those war-time powers, which I exercised w it h so much discretion during the war period, are no longer possessed by us. A brooding melancholy sat upon him as he spoke. I say again that all the powers necessary for the establishment of a compulsory pool of the kind that those who waited upon Mr Allan want, or an effective voluntary pool, are vested in this Government. venient to adopt the attitude of having a burning desire to do something which impish fate prevents. A person is then in an unassailable position. His protagonists applaud him, and, when taunted with inaction, he can say that but for something which prevented him he would have done it. It is very convenient to be able to refer to defects in the Constitution. I have stated here, in season and out of season, that the Constitution needed amendment, hut I have always used the Constitution to the very limit of its authority. I have never said that a thing could not he done unless I had tried to do it, and those who sat in authority over us, as guardians of the Constitution, had declared that it was ultra vires. We are asked to co-operate with the State Governments in establishing a pool. There is nothing to prevent us from doing this. During its term of office, the Government, hy its actions, has shown conclusively that all the powers necessary are vested in it. The sugar agreement would he written in water hut for the exercise of those very powers of whose existence they now seem to be unaware. From the many speeches of the Prowse), I naturally concluded that when, by a freakish turn of the wheel, lie and his friends mounted to that pedestal on which I had stood so long, there would be an end to this infamous method of robbing the poor. But what do we find? These gentlemen dealt with the stabilization of the sugar industry by continuing my policy, but under another name. In the early months of the life of this Government, I declared that it did not mean what it said when it announced that the sugar agreement Avould only be continued for another year. The system for which that agreement provides is in existence to-day because of its own inherent merits, and because it is adapted to the circumstances of Queensland, although it imposes on the rest of the people certain disabilities. For instance, they cannot buy blackgrown sugar. If the Government can do so much for sugar, why can it not do a little for wheat? If it is good to exercise the powers of the Commonwealth to help the sugar cane farmer, why is it It is very conbad to use them to help the wheat farmer? The people of this .country will not be asked to pay any more for their bread because of the establishment of a pool. When the price of wheat was fixed, the present Minister for Works( Mr Hill) defended the action taken, and so did I . I stood by the Minister through thick and thin, although I . admit that at times it was difficult to do so because of the assistance I received from him and his friends. If the Constitution gives us power to impose an economic blockade to help sugar-to penalize the biscuit, condensed milk, jam, and other industries by one stroke, and then to put things right with another, all out of the pockets of the people-wh y cannot this little thing be done for wheat 1 The pooling system has silenced its critics. It has come-to stay. The system has won its way by its inherent virtue. We all know the farmer to be incurably conservative, but, having once got hold of a good! thing, he never lets go, and he wants the pool because he knows it to be good. Why not help him to get it?. My friends will find that this ethereal 5 talk about the Constitution will not heaccepted by the farmers. I say to the farmers of. Australia that there is nothing in any constitution to prevent a put into operation. I do not admit that a pool would impose any hardship' on any one, hut I do say that it is an in terference with the rights of the individual. While for many years I have.' been a believer in the right of the state1 to do what is necessary, for the welfare ofT the whole people, I admit that the.less we interfere with the individual the better. For that reason I stand ivnder the banner of those who' believe in a voluntary pool. What is necessary to start such 'a pool I First, there is the financial guarantee. We have the Commonwealth Bank, and all that is necessary to win the reluctant ones is to say that we are prepared to do that which we did in 1921. when the Commonwealth Bank carried",41,Eable Page W E Offered To Me That I Might Serve Some Useful Pur

The farmers collectively went to the bank in the same way that an individual does his business with a banking institution. was advanced, and the Commonwealth wrote its name on the back of the cheque .as a guarantor. I shall not follow out this line of reasoning at any great length. I rose only to say that we are entitled to know where the Government stands in this matter. Isi t against the pooling system, voluntary or compulsory? If not. w ill it take steps to put the voluntary system into operation ? In ancient Greecei t was the practice for the generals, of the army to take command in rotation, and it was found that the enemy always attacked when the biggest fool was in command. We have to-elay a Ministry composed of two parties, which are engaged in a sort of political tug-of-war. One party pulls one way, and the other in the opposite direction. I was returned to Parliament to support the party pulling in a certain direction. If another party pulls in a different direction, I am under no obligation to support it . The kind of pool tliat I fathered is that in which I . still believe, and there is nothing to prevent the Government from establishing a similar pool to-morrow. I have observed that the Treasurer has frequently of constitutionalism. tomed before he took office to hear him in the world."" have probably forgotten what that is, I shall have to recall it to their The"" greatest thing in the world "" to the honourable gentleman at the time of which I speak was the new state movement. is much the same in connection with many past events. certain when Henry throne familiar with the date of the coming of William the Conqueror. members recall those stirring speeches of the present Treasurer, and his prophecies concerning the day when the new states movement would come into its own, when they realize that he has been in office and power for over two years, that he has the power to throw out the Government morrow, and that he has done nothing to 'bring the new state movement from the Mr TP. M. Hughes. clouds, they will naturally ask why he has done nothing for so long. He could have called a convention at any time, but' he has not done so. W h y ? His reason is The money the same as that given by Mr Allan for refusing the request of the wheat-growers of Victoria, namely, that some King's Counsel told h i m that the proposed convention would be unconstitutional, and, therefore, have.no binding effect. Yet we are where we are by virtue of an exactly similar convention. What the referenda taken on the greatest question ever presented to any people:-whethe r they should fight in a certain way or not-wha t constitutional sanction was there ? There was none. Yeti n this democratic country it had the effect of law. The people had spoken; that was an end to it . If this convention had been called, and had decided this, that, or the other, it would have had as much weight as the original convention which resulted in federation. Why did he not arrange a convention! He said that some one told -him the Constitution did not give h i m the necessary power! But there was nothing to prevent a convention being called. There is nothing to prevent the Government cooperating with the states in establishing a wheat pool. We are not dealing with a new proposal. The Victorian Farmers Union demand a compulsory wheat pool, and the circumstances permit of such a pool being formed. But if they believe dipped his cup into this pool in a voluntary pool-as I do-wh y do they We were accusnot say that they are ready to co-operate to form one? Why?

Most of us are not at all concerned with the new state movement ; but I speak on this matter with some authority. It is not given to all men to have greatness thrust upon them; but greatness was thrust on me one morning, when I received an earnest request to to allow myself to be nominated as the president of the new state movement. I asked myself, ""Does this silly old world still go round in its usual ordered way, or has some mighty cataclysm thrown it from its course?"" I did not know why they had chosen me; but they had. What became of that proposal I do not know. There was an offer and an acceptance, and, although some of my friends can regard this question w i th unwrung withers, since they are not at a l l concerned w i th the new state movement, I speak as the president. I am not chiding the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) for not having done anything during all this time in regard to his great project; I am content to point to these facts, which stand out clearly and are undeniable. country wants a wheat pool; why not establish one? The sugar policy of this country is an outstanding example of the f u t i l it y of endeavouring to stand up against the cataract of circumstances. These honourable gentlemen of the Government are tossed about as corks on flood waters. They are now declaring themselves firm champions of the sugar policy, and in a little while, no doubt, w ill speak with assurance and pride of the magnitude of the fruits of their labours. We shall hear them say, "" We did this t h in g . "" There is compulsion associated with the sugar policy. It rests upon compulsion. These powers, which the Prime Minister said have been taken from us, have their grips in the very bowels of that policy. not last five minutes but that the Commonwealth with all its power ancl might stands behind and buttresses it . And yet the Government say we have not the necessary powers to establish a voluntary wheat pool. Whether the Government believe in a voluntary or a compulsory pool, or in no pool at all, they should make a plain statement on the subject. They should say, "" This is our creed, we believe in this, or we do not,"" and by that statement stand or f a l l . Unless they do so, it appears to me a confession of f u t i l it y , an indication that the ship is driftin g and not being steered by a firm hand when the Government say to the wheat-growers, ' ' We would do what is asked, but we have not the power."" It has the power, but it is for the Government to say if it will exercise it . I exercised my powers under the Constitution, and my honourable friends opposite, and every man and woman in this country know that I was never charged w it h not going far enough. I exercised whatever powers I had, and if I were now in office I would within 24 hours do everything necessary on the part of the Commonwealth to establish a voluntary pool in which all the wheat-growing states could co-operate. glad of the opportunity to express my views on the amendment moved by the honourable member for Wannon( Mr. McNeill), the. effect .of which is to reduce the vote by £1 a*, an instruction to the Government to in troduce a compulsory wheat pool. TheI do not intend to support the amendment. I should have been glad of the opportunity to assist the farmers, and would have been able to do so if the amendment had been framed to ensure that a pool if established would be free from political control, and that import parity would be paid for wheat used for local consumption -That would have shown a genuine desire to assist the wheat growers. When one considers what"" was proposed to he done by a Labour Government under a State Wheat Marketing Acti n New South Wales and in another state, one hesitates to place the whole of the farmers' industry at the mercy of the TradesH a l l oflicials. Under the New South Wales Wheat Marketing B ill of 1921, the M in It could ister of the day had the power of veto in connection with this great industry. The Government in a suggested compulsory pooling arrangement proposed to fix the. maximum price, but did not make any provision for a minimum price for wheat. In these circumstances farmers w ill not be easily led away by the suggestions of Lahour members representing country constituencies, who claim to be "" as good as a Country party man,"" in an endeavour to hold' their seats. Farmers have seen the attempts made by the TradesH a l l , through Mr Holloway, in conjunction with Mrs. Glencross, to reduce the price of wheat sold for local consumption, and I can assure Lahour members representingcountry constituencies that they will find themselves outnumbered by their confreres in the city if they endeavour to give the farmer a fair deal. The honourable member for Gwydir( Mr Cunningham) endeavoured to prove that what I regard as the Labour party's",44,Eable Page W E Offered To Me That I Might Serve Some Useful Pur
199,Mr Prowse (Swan) [ 8 . 3 6 ],"I ambid for political power in New South Wales, when it offered the farmer an extra 2s. 6d. per bushel, was made after the state elections. Murray electorate in New South Wales at the time, and on more than six occasions I heard Labour candidates say that if a State Labour Government was returned it would give a guarantee of 2s. 6d. per bushel i u addition to that guaranteed by the Federal Government, thus malting the amount 7s. 6d. per bushel. When ibe Labour Government came in it carried out that promise, at the public expense. It s promise i u this regard is very similar to another which it made recently, and which is also to be carried out at the expense of the public. In the Sydney newspapers yesterday, it is announced that the Government proposes to hurry on the bill to give effect to its promise-and perhaps rightly so-to provide widows with an allowance of 20s. weekly. That, like the promise of an additional guarantee of 2s. 6d. per bushel, was made to get them into power. The right honourable member for North Sydney( MrW . M . Hughes), who has just resumed his seat, has also made many promises. He seems to think that there is no constitutional difficulty in the way of either the Federal Government or a State Government introducing a compulsory or voluntary wheat pool. I was a member of many deputations representative of the whole of the wheat-growers of Australia, which waited on the ex-Prime Minister when he had f u l l power under the War Precautions Act. We had .a compulsory -wheat pool and he said to us, ""Organize! organize! organize! and you w ill get anything you want."" We took the right honourable gentleman's advice, and framed what came to be known as .the McGibbon scheme for a complete compulsory wheat pool to be carried on as it was under the War Precautions Act, except that it was to be under the control of the farmers with a representative of the Government to watch the position in regard to local reqiurements. We organized. We carried out his suggestion. We gave h i m a complete scheme; but his was the greatest of all "" Yes n o"" policies. Honourable members can turn up speeches made by him during that period which represent every shade of political opinion. If it is fcueh a simple thing for this Government to establish a pool, why did not the ex-Prime Minister form either a compulsory or a voluntary wheat pool, and I was assisting in the give binding effect to the proposal put before h i m hy us? He did not make any attempt to do so. The responsibility of wrecking what would have been an excellent proposal for the expansion of the wheat-growing industry in Australia is his more than that of any other Tjerson. He refused to allow the machinery to be under the control of the growers. The fact that the right honourable gentleman did not have legislation enacted to establish either a voluntary or a compulsory pool permitted the middleman to step in and wreck the voluntary scheme which was subsequently introduced. The wrecking proved more effective in some states than in others. In Western Australia so complete was the organization of the farmers and so loyal were the wheat-growers to .their voluntary pool that it was successfully financed, and last year out of a total yield of 21,000,000 bushels of wheat the farmers' organization handled 18,000,000 bushels. The Western Australian wheat growers were forced into their present position by the refusal of the Hughes Government to give them what they prayed for , and as honorahle members opposite did not then give the farmers that support which would have enabled a united scheme to come into operation, I refuse How to be cajoled into voting for a motion introduced by them for party political purposes. It is all very well for the right honourable member for North Sydney( MrW . M . Hughes) to refer to the honorahle member for Dampier( Mr Gregory), now the honorahle member for Swan, but I can assure honourable members that that honourable memher has never expressed himself as being in favour of a compulsory pool. He has not done so, either in this House or among the people in hia own state who were out-and-out in favour of a compulsory pool. He has always stood his ground in that respect, and has been perfectly consistent in his attitude. The gentleman who has heen grossly inconsistent in these matters is the right honourable memher for No r t h Sydney.

A deputation from tlic Butter and Bacon Factories Association of Western Australia asked the Minister for Agriculture ( Mr Troy) to-day to include the state butter factories in the Paterson butter proposal. Thc deputation read a letter from Melbourne indicating that those interested in thc proposal were within measurable distance of obtaining a95 per cent, agreement. Mr Troy said that in Hobart Mr establish the bulk-handling system in Paterson had proposed that there should be a levy of ld. a pound on butter produced, in order to pay a bonus of 3d. a pound on -butter exported. The Western Australian consumption was 10,000,000 lb. a year, while its production was a mere bagatelle. It would be much better if the £125,000 that -would he levied on Western Australia were distributed among the Western Australian producers. We all know that he Mr Troy is a member of the Labour Government, with his eye on the consumer, and the city that carries the greatest number of votes. He admits The farmer is comthat the production of butter in Western Australia is a mere bagatelle. The farmers had evolved a scheme under whicli they were agreeable to levy I d . per lb. on butter in order to pay an export bounty, and thus assist to develop the dairying industry and allow the men who have been placed on the land in Western Australia to make a living, even if it were But that is a horse of another only a bare living.

I have seen enough as a wheat-grower, ancl as a representative of men on the land, not to he misled by legislation setting up a pool, compulsory or otherwise, where the control is to he exercised by the Government. For example, the New South Wales legislation declared that only unionists could be employed in the handling of the wheat. The honourable member for Gwydir has referred to the saving of time and bags in the loading of wheat by the adoption of the bulk-handling system in Sydney. I Yet honorahle do not wish to touch on that point, beyond reminding honourable memhers that the This is seen in every state. It wheat was loaded by the mere turning on of a tap; it was like filling a tank w i th water. To get a proper comparison we should compare the Sydney system w i th similar systems in Canada. I do not know whether the Sydney method is faster than the Canadian method. The Commonwealth Parliament agreed to lend £500,000 as a first instalment to the Western Australian farmers if they would put up £300,000 among themselves to their state. There were two obstacles to the success of that scheme. One was that the then Premier( S ir James Mitchell) would not permit the clients of the In dustries Assistance Board to contribute",47,Eable Page W E Offered To Me That I Might Serve Some Useful Pur

205,Mr Prowse,"I have read his reply to the scheme. The other was that the Labour Opposition in the State Parliament wanted the money to be advanced hy the State Government, so that the scheme would be under the control of the Government. The farmer wants to control these things himself. He is quite capable of doing so. The reason for the successf u l handling of wheat in Western Australia is that Westralian Farmers Limited has been given control, and all middlemen have been practically wiped out. As a consequence, the wheat has been handled much more cheaply than it would otherwise have been, and all the advantages to which the honourable member for Gwydir has referred have come ahout. There are great advantages to be gained by co-operation, and by having ful l trucks of wheat on the rail, enabling by the honourable memher for Angas( Mr the farmers to telephone to the Oommissioner of Eailways and tell him to remove 20,000 tons all ready at a certain station. That wheat goes right down to the ship's side, and is loaded right away. A wonderful saving can be effected in that way. In conclusion, I can assure the right honourable member for North Sydney and honourable members opposite that, if sympathy had been displayed when the time was ripe for it, and if hongreat deal through it in the West. orahle members of the Labour party had thrown in their lot with the farmers at the proper time, all the advantages which they have mentioned would have beeu gained. The sympathy they now display is too belated to bear the stamp of sincerity. The honourable member for Wannon( Mr before the last harvest it received about McNeill) has raised a very big question in his amendment, affecting not only the primary producers, but also all sections of the community. It raises the very important question of the organized marketing of primary products generally. The Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) has rightly pointed out that we cannot apply a principle to the marketing of one product and deny it in the marketing of another; hut it is rather extraordinary, as the ex-Prime Minister( Mr W. M . Hughes) has quite correctly pointed out, that a government which baulks at the organized marketing of wheat with any compulsory flavouring ahout it has already adopted compulsion in respect of the sugar industry. Parliament we have already had introduced and passed by the Government legislation for thc marketing of primary products into which the element of compulsion very largely enters. The Dried Fruits Export Control Act makes it mandatory on every grower of dried fruit to export a certain quota of his produce as fixed by a board. Compulsory provisions also apply to the dairying industry. The producer of butter cannot market his product under any conditions he chooses. He is compelled to adopt what some regard as an odious form of compulsory marketing conditions. I think I am an average sample of the primary producer, and while I do not relish compulsion, I agree very largely with the principle enunciated Gabb). If both methods were equally effective, I should plump for the voluntary system against compulsion every time. Unfortunately, after giving the voluntary system a thorough trial, we have found that it is not an effective means for the marketing, of primary products. That is the conclusion to which I have reluctantly arrived. conditions in Western Australia, but in Victoria we have a voluntary wheat pool. It is well managed, and the Minister for Works and Railways( Mr Hill) is one of its directors. Three years ago that pool received approximately 80 per cent, of the wheat grown in Victoria. In the year 60 per cent. I am not certain as to the percentage it has received this year, but I have heard it rumoured-and , certainly; deliveries from farmers in my electorate would seem to confirm the rumour-that the pool is not likely to receive much more than 40 per cent., if as much, of the wheat grown in Victoria this season. admit that the high opening prices had a great deal to do with that. pertinent and fair.

These figures seem to indicate that the voluntary system has been tried and found wanting. It is not a question of the opinion of honourable members. Let us take the views of the farmers as expressed through their organization. They have been referred to by the Minister for Works and Eailways this afternoon. At the annual conference of the Farmers Union held in March last, the question of the marketing of wheat was on the agenda-paper. cussed, and a motion was carried affirming the principle of compulsory pools and requesting the State Government of Victoria, with a Country party Premier at its head, to take a ballot of the growers forthwith, and if that ballot were favorable, to bring in a bill to establish a compulsory pool. That conference was attended by nearly 400 delegates from"" every district in Victoria, and the motion affirming the principle of compulsory pooling was carried unanimously. That motion was presented to the Victorian Government requesting it to take a ballot forthwith. behind the question of constitutional difficulties. It sought legal advice, and obtained it. The legal advice was that even if the Government did have constitutional power to take this action it would not be effective, because there would be leakages over the border. The suggestion was, apparently, that farmers would cross the Murray River at night with their wheat in a canoe to market it in New South Wales. Whether intentionally or unintentionally, the Minister for Works and Railways, by the remarks he made, would convey to those not acquainted with the council, of which he and I are members,'the impression that it had changed its attitude and did not now favour the compulsory principle, hut had adopted the voluntary principle. In order that honr orable memhers may he quite clear on this matter, I propose to read the actual resolution that was carried. So far from changing its attitude the council has re-affirmed its belief in compulsory marketing. It went further and stated that it was a matter which should be transferred from the state to the federal sphere. This is the resolution to which it agreed: That the Central Council, whilst expressing its firm belief in the principle of compulsory pooling, after hearing the explanation and 1 statement of the Premier approves of the action taken hy him. The Central Council further approves of the voluntary pool that the Premier proposes, and will strongly support him in giving effect to such voluntary pool for a period of five years, with a guarantee of 75 per cent, of the market value of wheat at the time of delivery. The Central Council is strongly of opinion that to be fully effective a compulsory pool should be Australia-wide. The Minister for Works and Railways ancl I were both present when ihat It was dismotion, if not carried unanimously, was certainly carried without dissent. in all the states. the Postmaster-General( Mr Gibson) was also present when that resolution was arrived at. I also want to bring him into the business.

I want to he perfectly -clear and perfectly fair, and I should say that this resolution has yet to he submitted to the state organizations for their endorsement.

215,Mr Batlet,"Who moved that resolulution, and I might say that it was carried unanimously. I come to the executive of the state organization to which I belong, and fight valiantly for a compulsory pool. The Country party Premier of Victoria stoutly contends that he has no power in the matter, and his eloquence and the tremendous emphasis with which he makes this point so persuaded the executive, or the majorit y of it, that they agreed that he has no power, and that it is purely a federal responsibilit y which the Federal Government must undertake.. The Premier of Victoria succeeded in the stand he took in the regrettable absence of constitutional powers to carry the conference resolution into effect. When I come into this chamber I find that the Prime Minister has also made a speech. He made an eloquent appeal and gave the impression that he is f u l l of regret at his helplessness because he has not the necessary constitutional power. I understand the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) to say that that statement is not correct, but it is certainly as I understood the Prime Minister.

225,Mr Stewart,"I favour a pool conIn 1905 and 1907 I travelled overseas in British sailing ships, carrying wheat from the port of Melbourne. In the harbours of Queenstown and Falmouth were anchored from 20 to 30 ships, mostly sailing vessels, loaded with Australian wheat. These vessels arrived in a continuous stream, and the whole of their cargoes were forced upon the wheat market of the world, irrespective of its capacity to absorb them. The same thing is going on to-day. It was recently reported in the press that in two days 3,000,000 bushels of last season's Australian wheat were sold on the Baltic Exchange. The marketing of our primary produce in that way is not advantageous 1 to the producer, and reacts detrimentally on every section of the community. For that reason an Australia-wide pool, with one selling agency overseas, scientific feeding of markets, and one chartering agency, is the only system that I consider will ever give the Australian primary producer f u l l market value for his wheat. The Prime Minister referred to those gentlemen who had spent their lives in studying the science of marketing. I myself know gentlemenI am not going to mention names-wh o have spent their lives marketing wheat. I should not be averse to appointing on a hoard four or five of those very able business men, some of them brilliant, paying them a handsome salary, and saying to them, ""Your job is to place scientifically 100,000,000 bushels of Australian wheat on the world's markets, and to dispose of it to the best advantage of the primary producers."" In that way we should make the best use of those gentlemen. We have recently experienced a remarkable fall in wool values. clearly that the haphazard system of marketing our primary products, whether it be wheat, wool, or butter, is not the best policy, and that institute some form . of organized marketing? fruits, the Oommonwealth Government passed last session, a hill which, although it went a certain distance in the desired direction, did not go far enough. But even as far as it did go, from present appearances it seems that the result of that legislation will he very beneficial to. the dried-fruit producers. The Butter Export Control Act provides for one brand of butter, strict supervision over exports, and the limitation of the freedom of the individual. It restricts the right of the individual to send overseas any kind of butter or any class of primary product that he thinks he can market at a profit, irrespective of the effect the sale of such commodity would have upon his fellow-producers. I propose to vote for the amendment. If it is carried, I shall, at the first opportunity, move a motion embodying definitely vital principles that should be adhered to in carrying into effect any federal compulsory pool. We must all realize that if the amendment is carried, the effect, either for good or evil, will be far-reaching in respect of one of the most important primary industries in Australia.. I have listened with interest to honorahle memhers who have dealt with this subject on theoretical grounds and from the point of view of the onlooker. Some of us have very short memories. I suppose that I can claim to be the largest wheat grower representing the State of New South Wales in this Parliament. I have very painful recollections of the treatment meted out within the last ten or eleven years to wheat-growers of New South Wales owing to the existence of compulsory pools. The Prime Minister pointed out what might happen, and what I remember very well did happen under a compulsory pool. One point he made was that in number the wheat-growers are comparatively small and the wheat consumers are comparatively large, and that when the interests of the majority conDoes that not indicate flict with those of the minority the latter frequently do not receive justice, and consequently go to the wall. That hag we must happened actually. I speak particularly of the pool that existed in New SouthI n the case of dried Wales. In 1913-14 we had a touch of governmental control in the form of price-fixing. The total wheat yield was a little under 13,000,000 bushels, which at that time was more than enough for our own consumption. In that year there was a light crop in Victoria, one of the lightest on record, the total yield being under 4,000,000 bushels. The price of wheat consequently rose in this state. In New Sou.th Wales, after previous bad years we looked to the southern markets for an increased price for",51,Eable Page W E Offered To Me That I Might Serve Some Useful Pur
226,Mr Manning (Macquarie) [9.23],"our wheat. The Government of the day, however, stepped in and commandeered the whole of the wheat at 4s. 6d. a bushel, although it was worth 6s. 6d. across the border. That was the position taken up by the Lahour Government then in power. Afterwards, when the case was fought before a tribunal, the growers received an increase of 3d. a bushel. Next year we were, unfortunately, plunged into the war. New South Wales had the biggest wheat yield in its history, but the growers were faced with the position that there was no possible chance of marketing the wheat under the conditions then existing. The Government stepped in with a compulsory pool, and made advances against the price of wheat. That system continued for a number of years, and the prices obtained were extremely unsatisfactory. The pool was under Government contrail. vernment of the day did not realize what a vast undertaking it was, and instead of engaging the services of men of the calibre mentioned by the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart), it appointed a subordinate officer f roEi the Deable member's speech was an absolute compartment of Agriculture as the supreme head over the whole of the transactions of the Wheat Board in New Sonth Wales. The result was disastrous. The wheat accumulated for two or three years, and owing to the lack of shipping, the mice plague, wet seasons, and the damage sustained to the wheat through weevils and other pests, the farmers'had a very rough spin. Before the term of the compulsory pool had expired, the warended and wheat prices abroad increased. There was a considerable demand for wheat. We were still being paid from 4s. 9d. to 5s. a bushel for wheat which was worth considerably more abroad. A few years ago the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr W. M. Hughes) was present at the annual conference of. the Farmers and Settlers Association of New South find I, a delegate there, asked him would he undertake to see that the farmers received export parity value for their wheat. He answered the query in his own inimitable way. He said that it was a broad question, in which great issues were involved. query, and sat down without answering it. If export parity for our wheat had Mr Manning. been granted, it would to some extent have compensated us for our losses. I put in the 1916-17 pool the largest crop that I ever harvested. I hold scrip for 25,000 bushels of wheat put in that pool and anybody may have it for 25 pence. I was paid 3s. 3£d. a bushel. The price should have been less, because the Government of the day in financing the pool had been misled respecting the amount realized, and had overpaid the pool something like 5£d. a bushel. A claim was afterwards made, and a tribunal was appointed to adjust the amount that had been lost to the farmers through the mismanagement of the pool. That tribunal decided that the farmers were entitled to be paid over £400,000 on account of that loss, but as the government of the day had already overpaid to the amount of £700,000, it naturally declined to accept any further obligation. Unfortunately the GoThe honourable member for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney), speaking with that air of authority which he usually assumes, said that the farmers of Riverina were in favour of a compulsory pool. Upon this matter, as upon many others, the honorpendium of inaccurate information. I am a wheat farmer in ' the Riverina, and I am not in favour of a compulsory pool. The majority of the growers, I think, are of the same opinion. I realize what wonderful results have been achieved by the wheat growing industry in the development of semi-arid regions, and how remarkably the wheat belt has been extended. I/may claim to have done my share in extending it in New South Wales. In 1906 Mr Coghlan, the then State Statistician, published a map with a line denoting the limit of safe wheat-growing. I purchased land beyond that line, and staked all my money and experience upon the growing of wheat there. A few years afterwards, when we were battling hard with the government of the day for the construcWales, tion of a railway' into that country, the Government Statistician stated . in the press that the whole of it was outside the limit of safe wheat-growing. Being much less experienced than I am now, I entered the lists against him, but I found to my cost that the Government Statistician, He evaded the even when he is wrong, can get the better of an argument. I retired from the contest, but I continued to agitate for a railway. I also continued to grow wheat, and to-day my farm is part of what is recognized to.be one of the most valuable wheat-growing districts of New South Wales. Any man who says that he can to-day mark what w ill be the l i m it of safe wheat-growing ten or fifteen years hence is either very wise, or knows a great deal less than he thinks he does. There have been times when wheat-growing was nonpaying, but only to one class-the farmer. To everybody else, and to the community as a whole, wheat-growing has always been a . thoroughly satisfactory industry. I recollect that i u one year, soon after I started my farm, I had 300 acres under wheat. I had bought the freehold blocks of what had been a very large estate, and on my property was the woolshed. The farmers on the surrounding subdivisions had no other place in which to shear their sheep, so I shore for them on contract 31,000 sheep that year, and I paid less carriage on the wool from those sheep to r a i l than I paid on the wheat from 300 acres in a year when the harvest was not particularly good. conditions; the greater burden is on the wheat-grower. A. man can f a r m 30 per cent., and possibly 50 per cent., of his country in the northern Riverina without any substantial reduction of its sheepcarrying capacity. If he carried sheep on the whole of his area, except for the additional expense of shearing, and possibly two or three days' extra work once or twice during the year,.he would not employ more labour to look after the stock than he does when he farms a third or half of his holding, and he saves the whole of the cost of the labour required for the growing of wheat. The machinery factories, too, are further evidence of the wonderful benefit conferred on Australia by the wheat-growing industry, and we should hesitate to tamper with it in the way proposed in the amendment. For my own part, after years of experience declare became the law, I would immediately abandon wheat-growing. would do the same. There are other ways of utilizing our land, which, if the price of wheat fell, would probably be as remunerative to the land-holder as is the growing of wheat, but not nearly as remunerative to the country. That is the point I wish honorahle members to bear in mind. We should do nothingwhich would endanger one of the greatest industries in Australia. The honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart) said in support of his claim for a compulsory pool that each year the voluntary pool in Victoria is handling less wheat. The Ministerf o r Works( MrH ill ) asked, by interjection, whether that was not due to the high price of wheat at the opening of the season, and the honorahle member for Wimmera admitted that it was. But I regard that diminution in the quantity of wheat pooled as further evidence that farmersare beginning to lose f a it h in the pooling system. Let the voluntary pools be continued; that can be done without passing any special legislation. The honourable member for W i m mera read a resolution by the Federal Convention of Farmersi n favour of a compulsory pool, aud asking the Government to advance 75 per cent, of the price of wheat to the grower. How any sane body of men could pass such a resolution is beyond my comprehension. In some So, too with lahour circumstances an advance of 75 per cent, would be absolutely safe; in other circumstances, it would he absolutely unsafe. I u 1920, the price of wheat was 12s. per bushel, and a 75 per cent, advance on that extreme figure would have represented 9s. per bushel. When the New South Wales Government guaranteed 7s. 6d. per bushel, the crop realized over £800,000 less than was required to pay the guarantee. If the price of wheat is low, a guarantee of even 80 per cent, might be perfectly safe, but when the price is high, a 75 per cent, advance might be quite unsound. This proposal must be very carefully investigated. Another advantage which some honorahle members have said would he derived from a compulsory pool would be the cooperative buying of sacks, and in support of that contention the high price of hags during the last season has heen emphasized. Some honorahle members may of compulsory pools, I not be aware of the circumstances which that if compulsory pools caused that high price. Until this year the only considerable demand for sacks Many others has been from Australia Last year, the importers who bought early in previous years, and had a rather unfortunate experience, kept off the market for a while, and then, in the middle of the buying season, the Chilian Government came upon the market and bought 20,000 bales of wheat sacks. That purchase, in ""conjunction with the rather lean jute crop in India, put the holders of jute in a very advantageous position. Australia had enjoyed beneficial rains in the early spring, and that fact had been made known to the Indian jute-holders almost as soon as it was known to the people in thc capital cities of Australia. The jute merchants knew, also, that the Australian importers had not sufficient stocks in hand, and that there was a shortage of jute in India; and, consequently, every order for an extra 1,000 bales of sacks increased the price by 6d. Only a limited number of bags was indented to be imported in October-November, and it became obvious that if the farmers desired to have hags in hand at the beginning of the harvest, as they usually do, prices would soar to an abnormal figure. Considerably bigger orders had been placed for delivery early in December, and it was confidently expected that the price would then recede. But shipping trouble developed, and the bags could not he unloaded. During the recent election campaign in New South Wales, Labour candidates and their supporters blamed the Government of the day for not having commandeered bags and placed them on the market at a.reasonable prico. But in December they did nothing to induce the unions to make the bags available to the farmers. That delay in unloading caused the price to iise hy leaps and bounds. If those bags had been unloaded when they arrived, as they would have been under normal conditions, the prices would have receded from the beginning of December. Speculation in jute is known to he exceedingly risky. tion that owns the jute. there is a compulsory wheat pool, controlled by a board formed under Government auspicee. That board was requested hy the wheat-growers to purchase sacks for the coming season, but it declined to do so, because it considered that gambling in wheat bags was too risky.

I ask honorahle memhers to imagine what would happen if there was a complete cessation of shipments of bags from India. If that happened in the early months of spring, what would be the effect upon Australia? I shall give another instance of the danger of speculating in jute. During the past four weeks, owing to over-importation hy speculators outside the ordinary channels, it has been possible to buy wool packs in Sydney for 7d. less than would have to he paid for them if purchased from the manufacturers and delivery taken in India. No more constitutional power than we already have is needed"" to form a voluntary pool. Any wheat-growing state that asks for a reasonable advance against the value of its wheat crop will have no difficulty in obtaining it. Such advances have been made regularly in the past, and can he made in the future. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr W. M . Hughes) said he did not know what the attitude of the Prime Minister was, but I was under no misapprehension on that point. To me the right honorahle gentleman could not have made a more emphatic statement that the Government did not intend to form a compulsory pool. When Parliament was dealing last year with the export control of dried fruits, the right honourable the Prime Minister said that the Government could not see its way to grant a compulsory pool.

I doubt whether, in any debate in this Chamber, tliere has been such a diversity of views expressed hy honourable members representing the same interests. Those honorahle members on this side who represent wheat-growing areas have declared emphatically for a compulsory pool, and in doing so have stated that a majority of the wheat growers favour such a pool. other side of the House only one honourable member who represents a wheat growing constituency has declared that the wheflt-growers in Victoria are in favour of a compulsory pool. That was the honourable memher for ""Wimmera( Mr Stewart). As against that we have the declaration hy many country memhers that the farmers are opposed to a compulsory pool.

The debate has shown conclusively that on this matter country representatives speak with two voices when they should be unanimous. at one time. tunately for the honourable member it is becoming generally known that, owing to the differences of opinion between the two sections of the Composite Government, honourable members of his party have sunk their principles to obtain place and power, and the solidarity that formerly existed has disappeared. meet the needs of the wheat-growers hut a compulsory pool. A voluntary pool cannot he effective. There is a voluntary pool in existence, but it is most inDunn has proved himself worthy of the effective, because no large body of producers can be satisfactorily controlled except by a compulsory pool. When a pool is voluntary the farmers commence io compete against one another in order to secure markets, and they place wheat in the hands of a buyer outside the pool in return for a special inducement. Some of them make huge profits thereby, hut the pool suffers. The only pool that can exist is a compulsory pool. I am pleased to learn from the right honorahle member for North Sydney( Mr W. M . Hughes) that the Commonwealth Government has power to create a compulsory pool. T point out, however, to him that ths amendment asks the Government not to create a compulsory pool, but merely to negotiate with the State Governments for that purpose. Mr W. M . HUGHES I said that we had all the power necessary to co-operate with the states for creating a compulsory pool On the amendment asks for. One honorahle member said that the object of the Opposition was to get this business into the hands of the Labour Governments of the states. If the Commonwealth Governr ment enters into negotiations the business will be in the hands not of any one Government, but of all the State Governments, the wheat-growers, and the Commonwealth Government.

There was never a difference of opinion on the board regarding the administration of the pool, and it has already been shown that in handling wheat they saved £91,000 that would have gone to the agents if the work had heen done by tender. That £91,000 went into the pockets of the farmers of New .South Wales, and it was saved by the board. Does' the fact that there are Labour Governments infive of the states justify any honourable member in saying that there should not be a compulsory wheat pool? Does it justify the argument that the Labour Governments should not be approached to ascertain whether they are prepared to work with the Commonwealth in creating a pool? It cannot he said that honourable memhers .of the Opposition are asking for this pool because Labour Governments happen to he in power in five states. We have asked for it for years before the recent elections that returned Labour Governments. Wo advocated a compulsory pool even when it would have been administered hy National Governments, and we did so hecause we believed it would be in the interests of the producers.

That would be putting the cart before the horse, and would probably make the effort a failure. We cannot dictate to the State Governments, hut can only approach them in a reasonable way, saying, "" In the opinion of the Federal Parliament a compulsory wheat pool should be established in the interests of the farmers. Are you prepared to do your part in it ?"" Tf the State Governments agree, they must then discuss how to give effect to their views.

My Government believes that, if the above proposals were adopted, it would be possible for the industry in the period of three years contemplated to place its finances in a position where governmental assistance would be rendered unnecessary. They will also ensure the proper organization and control of the marketing of the export surplus during the period mentioned, and result in the creation of a permanent organization, which, free of Government control, could operate independently for tlie benefit of the industry. I shall be glad to have your reply as early as possible. Yours faithfully, (Signed) Prime Minister. Following the receipt of the letter discussions and negotiations occurred and correspondence between the Commonwealth and State Governments passed to and f r o u n t i l September. Some of the states wanted a voluntary pool and some wanted a compulsory pool, and all sorts of conditions were requested. The matter remained in suspense for so long that the states were forced to take action singly and in different ways. We suggested a constructive policy w it h the object of enabling the wheat-growers to free themselves for all time from the necessity for coming, cap in hand, to the Government every year to ask for a guarantee. suggested hy the wheat-growers themselves. If it had been adopted, sufficient capital would have accumulated in the various voluntary pools during the three years to render unnecessary any Government advance to continue the pools. But this Government has gone a great deal farther since then. It has transformed the Commonwealth bank whicli can stand behind the industries of the country and be of some definite value to them. In the last eighteen months the bank has stood behind our industries in every way. It rendered possible the financing of the wool clip and the wheat crop last season. In addition, it led the way in bringing down the rate of exchange Dr. Earle Page. 5s. That meant about 2fd. a mained in the Victorian pool. More than that, the Government has indicated in the Governor General's Speech that it intends to bring down, at the first opportunity-as soon as the Opposition will give it a chance to do so, by ceasing to move motions of censurea proposal to create a rura l credits department in the Commonwealth Bank to enable any co-operatively organized industry to obtain-any advance that it might need, not by the cap-in-hand method, hut automatically, as of right, on a commercial basis. We have already made arrangements through our own hank for voluntary pools to he established on the lines successfully adopted last year in Western Australia. In Western Australia, by reason of the methods adopted last year, the organizaS. M. BRUCE, tion in charge of the voluntary pool was able to control 87 per cent, of the total quantity of wheat grown in that state, or roughly 18,000,000 out of just over 20,000,000 bushels. A similar policy for other states is favoured by this Government, and a definite statement to that effect has been made repeatedly. Yet the right honourable member for North Sydney( MrW . M . Hughes) asks i o r a definite statement on the subject from the Government! He says he did not hear the speech by the honourable member for Wannon( MrM c N e ill ), nor did he listen to that made by the Prime Minister. A p parently he prefers to take notice of mere hearsay remarks in the lobbies. If he does not wish to listen to the debates Our method was' originally that take place in this chamber he should certainly read them, so that he might he armed with knowledge of the facts. The amendment before the Chair would jeopardize the satisfactory handling of the wheat crop for the current year, hecause the establishment of a compulsory pool would involve concurrent action by all the State Parliaments concerned. The Bank into a central possibility of securing that may be gauged by a reference to the history of compulsory pools. What is the history of compulsory pools in Victoria? For five or six years this matter has been in the cockpit with every political disturbance. A t least two elections have been fought upon the issue, and I do not know how many governfrom £3 10s. to ments have heen formed in consequence of it . Attempts have been made to establish compulsory pools, and when the necessary measure has been sanctioned by the lower Housei t has been rejected hy the Legislative Council. One-third of the members of the latter chamber have recently come back from the hustings, and the number opposed to the principle of a compulsory pool is only one less than before, so that there is no chance of a measure to give effect to such a scheme being .passed by the Parliament of Victoria. It is said by every legal authority that, unless there is agreement between the states and the Commonwealth, we cannot have a compulsory pool that will be effective throughout Australia. Similarly in New South Wales a bill for a state compulsory pool has not been passed by their Parliament since 1920-21. In 1921, the Labour Government i u New South Wales attempted to pass a measure providing for the establishment of a compulsory pool. On account of the conditions contained in their Wheat Marketing Acti t was strongly opposed by the farmers of that stale, and all the members who fought against triumphantly returned at the next election. The party opposed to their compulsory pool was thus given a working majority during the next Parliament. The measure was carried through the lower House on the casting vote of the Deputy Speaker, but it was rejected by the Legislative Council. member for North Sydney has had the unfortunate experience of having proposals on which he agreed with the State Governments rejected by the State Parliaments. South Australia aro well aware that, as the two local chambers are now constituted, there is no chance of a compulsory pool being agreed to by the Parliament of that state. If the Government accepted the amendment, it would inevitably result in delay and uncertainty in finalizing arrangements for the marketing of this year's crop. The annual agitation for compulsory pools has been responsible for retarding the development of permanent methods of marketing in the wheat-growing industry. Do the farmers of Australia desire a compulsory pool controlled by governments? frequently asked the question. honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart) read a resolution affirming that the farmers of Victoria wanted a compulsory pool, controlled by their own elected representatives. That does not mean a compulsory pool controlled by outsiders. They have always voted in the same way. In 1921 a ballot of the farmers of New South Wales was taken on the following questions:"" (1) Are you in favour of a compulsory wheat pool, controlled by representatives elected by ballot of th© wheat-growers? (2) Are you in favour of a continuation of the pool controlled ' by a board consisting of two government nominees and three farmers' representatives, elected by ballot of the wheat-growers ? (3) Are you in favour of a compulsory pool under the present conditions of control ? (4) Are you in favour of an open market?"" When the votes were counted it was found that 6,345 farmers favoured a compulsory pool, controlled by representatives elected by ballot of the wheat-growers. The second proposal received 2,443 votes, the thir d 2,895, and only 1,782 farmers voted for an open market. In other words, three times as many farmers favoured a it were compulsory pool, controlled by their own representatives, as voted for a pool with government control or government representation. That was a definite expression of opinion by the farmers. During the last few days I have spoken to representatives of organizations of farmers in New South Wales and Victoria, and have also The right honourable had a telegram from the farmers' organization in Western Australia, and all say that if there is to be government control w i th any compulsory pool they want a voluntary pool. The legal opinion is that Honourable members from the necessary powers to give effect to a compulsory pool cannot be vested in any outside organization, but must lie in the Crown itself. The farmers say, ""Under those circumstances we stand for a voluntary pool."" W it h in the last twelve months they have shown where they stand. Last year, when the negotiations between the Commonwealth and the states fell through, the Government of the State of Western Australia said that it was prepared to give a compulsory pool to the farmers of that state. When the farmers examined the conditions they found that They have been it was sought to interpose certain condiThe tions that were intolerable. They said, "" We w ill have nothing whatever to do with any government pool in which the conditions are so onerous,"" and they formed a voluntary pool. able to secure financial backing without the intervention of the Government. I am satisfied that the measure which this Government will bring down within the next month or two will make such provision that every wheat pool in Australia and every other industry that is organized on a similar co-operative basis will be able to secure all the financial hacking needed without being exposed to the whim of any ministry or to political expediency. legislate for all time. upon legislation on this matter that no future Government will alter, because it will be so universally esteemed. The farmers are justly suspicious of government control, more especially of control by a Labour government of wheat pools, because they have had an unfortunate experience of compulsory pools controlled by Labour administrations. Honourable members are aware of the conditions that existed at the had to representation! Another memher outbreak of the war. A t that time there was a drought in New South Wales and in many other parts of the Commonwealth. rise. New South Wales said, ""We will be short of wheat,"" and it commandeered the whole of the wheat in that state at 5s. a bushel, despite the fact that the market price was from 6s. 6d. to 7s. a bushel. wheat which customarily was sent across t.o Victoria. The only means that the farmers had of sending their wheat out of the country was the Victorian transportation system. The New South Wales Government seized the wheat as it was being carted across the bridges hy the farmers, and forced them to take it hack to their farms, where it was commandeered for 5s. a bushel, although 6s. 6d. was the price at which the farmers had contracted to supply it to the Victorian millers. thing; but the Liberal Government in the farmers elect those three men."" The Victoria did exactly the same thing. that the honorahle memher for Wimmera( Mr Stewart) has made that interjection, ( Mr Cunningham) claimed to-night that They' -were because it gives greater point to my argument as to the danger of government control, no matter what party is in power. I stand for the control of an industry hy the people who grow the product, and I shall do all I can to ensure that that principle is followed. On the contrary, I shall oppose, so far as I am able to do so, any attempt to place control in the hands of those who have nothing to do with the industry, and I urge similar action on the part of those who have at heart the interests of the producers, whether they he primary or secondary producers. There was a compulsory Commonwealth pool in 1920-1. the statute-book this year The Government of the State of New South Wales operated the pool in that dare to state under agreement with the Commonwealth Government. The whole of the New South Wales business was handled by a board of five members. The Minister for Agriculturea Labour Ministerwas the chairman.

Goodness alone knows what right they of the board was said to represent what unionists would call ""scab"" wheat farmers in .

There was this tremendous outcry because for a month or two towards the close of the year the price of wheat in Australia to the local miller was higher than the price outside. That is what happened under a compulsory pool. In 1921 the New South Wales Labour Government said, "" We think we will keep this thing going. We shall have another pool next year. The Commonwealth Government will not come into it . but we shall carry legislation to enable us to have a compulsory pool in New South Wales."" The Government brought down its measure^ and forced it through the Legisfarmers of New South Wales, were set lative Assembly. It was carried by the casting vote of the Chairman of Committees or Deputy Speaker. It was fought right through by the representatives of country interests in the New South Wales Parliament at that time. Within a year or eighteen months at the outside a general election took place in New South Wales, and the men who had opposed that measure tooth and nail received general support, and a verdict from the country endorsing their action. Why did the general public stand behind them? It was because of the provisions in the Compulsory Acquisition Bill for the creation of a board of control of the whole of the wheat to be compulsorily acquired. That board was not to be an elective board as in the case of voluntary pools, nor an elective board such as the Australian farmers' federal organization stands for, as mentioned this evening by the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr members can read for themselves in the Stewart). The board was to be a nominee board. The Ministeri n charge of the hill said that he was going to put on the hoard the same three men as had heen on the previous board. There was to be the Minister, the representative of the Australian Workers Union, and a representative of the Lahour party in the Upper House, and two farmers. come in? Progressives in New South Wales asked the Government. They did not object to a representative of the consumers on the sentative of the men who handle the wheat. They regarded them as servants the honourable member for East Sydney asks, ""Where is the consumers' representative?"" The bill, fortunately, never hecame law, because it was thrown out by the Upper House in New South Wales. Under the bill, the Government took absolute control of the wheat. It took complete charge of representation in London, and the method of handling and delivering wheat in New South Wales. The Minister openly stated that the whole of the business of selling the wheat was to be handled by Dalgety and Company. The co-operative companies,, representing 60 per cent, of the wheataside and rigidly excluded from any participation in the business of selling the wheat. The Minister said that there was provision made for a maximum price for wheat. He was told that if he fixed a maximum price he should fix a minimum price as well. He steadfastly refused to do this. There was no provision made that the Government should take any responsibility for any mistake made by the servants of the Wheat Board. The Government compulsorily acquired the wheat and accepted no responsibility for any loss to the growers as the result of their wheat being placed in the pool. It was urged time and time again that there should be some responsibility taken by the Government, but the Labour Government in power in New South Wales at that time contemptuously rejected all suggestions of that nature. I have given the facts, which honourable New South Wales Hansard. To mention a compulsory wheat pool, controlled by the Government, to the wheat-growers of New South Wales is like waving a red flag before a bull. Last year the Government of Western Australia expressed its anxiety for the interests of the farmers, but it was endeavouring to look after so many other interests that the Farmers Association of that state said they would not have the pool, as the price to be paid for it was too great. They were not willing to submit to the conditions which would have been imposed on them. Today, throughout the whole of Australia,",62,Eable Page W E Offered To Me That I Might Serve Some Useful Pur

261,Dr. Earle Page,"That is what thethe producers want to have the final decision regarding the disposal of their produce. The policy of this Government throughout has been to so organize the producers that they will be able to control their industry as they themselves think f it , and I am satisfied that if they combine they will be able to secure for themselves that effective protection which most of our secondary industries now enjoy. If I can do anything to assist them to that end, I am prepared to do it. they cannot have government control without having hampering restrictions placed upon them. Even with voluntary pools, certain guarantees, in the nature of restrictions, are required. Another reason for the unpopularity of some of the pools is that under the system of pooling it is obligatory to retain in Australia sufficient stocks to meet local requirements. It is because of the government guarantee that this condition is imposed. Three or four months ago New South Wales could have disposed of approximately 3,000,000 bushels of wheat at a price higher than that at present ruling,, but it could not be done under the system of pooling then in operation, because it had to be held for local consumption. That is the price that the farmer has to pay for government assistance. It is the intention of the Government this year to t r y to place the producer in a position where he w ill be independent of government assistance. Not only would that assist the producers, hut the community generally would benefit, as a continual purchasing power would be placed in the hands of the farmer, which would enable h i m to pay for his requirements as he needed them, and so lead to more regular employment in manufacturing and distributing industries. I urge the committee to reject the by the honourable member for Wannoni t would be to perpetuate the con-. dition of uncertainty and chaos which has existed during the last four years.

For the reasons, first, that it is impossible to bring about a system of compulsory pooling without very grave constitutional ' difficulties; second, that the conditions inseparable from any compulsory pool must interfere, with the profitable and satisfactory handling of his crop hy the producer; and, third, that even if it were possible to establish a pool this year by bringing the whole of the states into line, there would be no guarantee of permanency, I urge The producers also recognize that the rejection of the amendment. In due time the Government w ill bring down its proposals for a proper and permanent solution of the whole of the difficulties now confronting the wheat industry, and so enable this, the second industry of the Commonwealth, to take its r i g h t f u l place, and to work out its own destiny in a proper way, without fear of the future. amendment by the honourable member for Wannon( MrM c N e ill) practically amounts to a request to the Government to enter into negotiations with the states for the purpose of considering the establishment of a compulsory wheat pool. What objection has the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) to such a proposal? AlthoughI listened to h i m for nearly an hour, I heard no reason advanced against it. I do not pose as an expert in this matter, but, from the facts which have been placed before me, I can see no reason for the rejection of the amendment. I understand that a large majority of the farmers of Victoria, and, indeed, of the Commonwealth, are in favour of a compulsory wheat pool. That being so, what valid objection can the Government have to it? Has the Government any objection to entering into negoamendment tiations with the states regarding the establishment of a pool? The Treasurer but he gave no reason for the refusal of the Government to accede to the request of the farmers. As a member of the Country party, the Treasurer probably agrees with the party's official organ that the establishment of a compulsory wheat pool is desirable, but as a partner in the composite Ministry, he refuses to endorse and permanent the request of his own party. If he had said that he, personally, objected to the It has done this for pool, one could have understood his",63,Eable Page W E Offered To Me That I Might Serve Some Useful Pur

263,"( Mr Mcneill), As To Agree To Told Us Nothing. He Said Many Things,","He made affirmations about various subjects, but upon the matter under discussion-whether there should or should not be a compulsory pool-he said not a single word. He stated that there was no power to establish a pool. It is strange that memhers of the Country party in their constituencies, and as members of farmers' organizations, stand for a compulsory wheat pool; but no sooner are they elected to this House, and linked -with the Nationalist party, which stands for the interests of big business, than they rate. oppose all that they supported on the hustings. two grounds. The first is that the state has no power. That is the position adopted by Mr Allan, the Premier of Victoria, who personally believes in a compulsory pool. The second reason was given hy the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce), who said that the Commonwealth has no power. Is there anything more absurd than to suggest that a great country such as Australia, working under a Constitution such as we have, has not the authority to act in this manner? give my endorsement to the legal opinion given. Government is sufficiently powerful to accomplish its end in one way or another. If the farmers in the Commonwealth desire a compulsory wheat pool any government should be prepared to supply them with the requisite ways and means within the Constitution to give them what they desire. Treasurer said we have, per medium of the Commonwealth Bank, rendered great assistance to the farming population of this country. thing the Government did, on the 1st January, was to compel the Commonwealth Bank to raise the rate of interest to 7 per cent., thus making a levy of 1 per cent, on all the producing elements of this country. arrangement they enabled the export of the products of this country to be financed. They did. When the House was in recess they advanced millions by way of Commonwealth Bank notes to the private hanking institutions at the ratei of 4. per cent -and upon these the private banks built their credit. As a matter of fact, the Commonwealth Bank found, the means. This Government, which is supposed to represent the country's interests, made the Commonwealth Bank an instruMr Anstey. mentality of the private corporations of Australia, and gave them these notes, nominally at 4 per cent. If the Commonwealth Bank could give to the private banking institutions the ways and means to finance the export of the produce of this country, the Commonwealth Bank itself should have heen able to finance those exports. The money advanced to the private banks at 4 per cent, should have been advanced by the Commonwealth Bank to the exporters at the same Asi t was, the bank gave away this business and the profits They excuse themselves on attaching to it. The Government gave to private financial institutions the assistance which should have been directly afforded to the producers through the Commonwealth Bank. The action of the Government was a buttress to the arsenal, and enabled private institutions in this country to make money out of the primary producers hy means of credit created by the Commonwealth Bank itself. That was the attitude adopted hy the Government, and that is Personally, I do not the way these people, linked up as they are with the monetary in-r Personally, I believe that any terests of this country, the banking corporations and export agencies, aid the' producers. The Treasurer has the impudence to say upon public platforms throughout the Commonwealth that he represents the primary producers. But he as a memher of the Government represents the monetary interests which stand Amongst other things the behind him and his colleagues. It has been said that they take the money of the financial interests, that they obtain their aid through the newspapers, and in reThe first turn utilize their powers as a government to buttress the great private exporting agencies in this country. The question before the committee is one relating to the establishment of a. compulsory wheat pool, and whether this Parliament shaSl He said that hy this support a co-operative system for tliose actually producing wheat. It is desired to create a large co-operative society so that producers can follow their product from the farm right through to the point of consumption, and so feel assured that, they will derive all the benefit to which they are entitled from the point of production to the stage at which it is consumed. We desire to k>now whether the producers themselves are to secure the savings so made, or are the profits to go to Dalgety and Company Limited or otlier private firms, all of whicli make enormous profits at the expense of tbe producer. We wish .to know whether one of these vast exporting agencies is to do this work or whether it is to be done by the primary producers themselves. On the platforms the Treasurer and his supporters have said that, vested with political power, and having the instrument of government in their hands, they will act in the interests of the primary producers, but behind the screen of government their acts of administration and their legislation show that they are operating in the interests of the opulent in this country. That is their attitude in connection with the Commonwealth Bank. They have made it an instrument for the exploitation of the people of this country"". I venture to say that if the Commonwealth Bank had been used as it should have been, the money would not have been advanced to private banking institutions, but the Commonwealth Bank would have been used to directly assist the producers. Instead of that, the Government have been helping those who have assisted them. Money obtained, as I have said, at 4 per cent., is advanced by the private hanks to the producers of this country at 7 per cent, or 8 per cent. When the Commonwealth Bank Bill was before us, how these gentlemen opposite protested against the issuing of notes in this way to private corporations ! Did not the Treasurer most emphatically state that money could not he advanced in this way to the private hanks-that to do so would be a menace and danger to the community? Did not the honourable member tell us that the banks would immediately build a superstructure of credit-that with an advance of £10,000,000 in Commonwealth notes they would establish a credit of £25,000,000? That, he said, would inflate the currency, and so enormously increase prices and create disaster throughout the couutry. In the first place, he said it could in the way. There is no constitution not be done, but, driven hy the pressure of the powers behind him, and with Parliament in recess, he ultimately did that which he said in this House could not, in -the public interest, he done. On the floor of this House he told us, as a member of the Government and as a public man, that it could not be done, hut when Parliament went into recess he began to do those things which he said could not be done. In discussing the question before the committee orable member did that. duced the financial aspect of the subject, and I am entitled to reply. The Treasurer brought the matter forward in order to side-track this issue, and it would have been better had he been silent, because neither on the floor of the House nor on any public platform could he justify the action taken by the Government during the recess. I should like to know whether the Treasurer really favours a compulsory pool. Is he in favour of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Wannon? He is silent. able member a definite statemeut. if he is in favour of entering into negotiations with the states.

The Treasurer says, in effect, that the Commonwealth has no power, but it intends to exercise power. It has done nothing, but it proposes to do something in the future. These honorahle gentlemen representing the primary interests have done nothing, but in their dying hours, as a government, intend to do something if they do not die in the attempt. It has repeatedly heen stated by honourable members opposite that neither the Commonwealth nor the states have power to create a compulsory pool, but again I say that if this Parliament makes up its mind and desires to do something, there is no constitutional difficulty which limits the prerogative of a great national Parliament. What it cannot do in one way it may do in another. If it has no power to legislate for a compulsory pool, it has unlimited power to deal with the imports and exports of this country.

Those powers have never been questioned. But Ministers will not give a direct answer on this question, either to us, to whom they have no responsibility, or to the farmers, to whom they have a responsibility, and to whom they must reply sooner or later. They have endeavoured to hedge round the issue with all sorts of irrelevancies. They have referred to certain Labour men who were connected with pools, and to what happened in New South Wales and in Victoria. Those are not the issues before the Committee. IfI were a Minister and the Opposition submitted a proposal of this character for negotiation with the State Governments, I would say, "" Certainly, gentlemen. In order to save argument, I promise now that the Government will enter into the negotiations with the states in accordance with the demands of the farmers. I do not know whether anything can be done with regard to a compulsory pool or a voluntary pool, but to oblige you the Government wiU negotiate."" What real objection can be offered to such a course? If the Government desired to do anything at all, it could have stated at the outset of this discussion that it was prepared to negotiate, and there would have been no further debate and no waste of time. We have had two days of talk because the Government has not ""nous"" enough to undertake to negotiate. Why does it not do so? Ministers reply, ""What is the use? The states will do nothing."" If Ministers really believed that the states cerns, the shipping companies, the bankwould do nothing, they would accept with avidity the proposal to negotiate. But thoy are afraid that if they submit a proposal to the states it will be accepted, arid they will be put in the unfortunate position of having to retreat, explaining, as they do so, ""Gentlemen of the states, we made these proposals to you, but for subterranean reasons we cannot carry them out. We cannot explain why, hut the reasons are connected with funds for the forthcoming Excuse me if I appear to be suggesting sinister motives, but I notice that even the Prime Minister is learning these Mr Anstey. tactics. He spoke of certain memhers on this side of the House, probably including me, who are venomous or vicious. I admire those methods, and I urge the right honorahle gentleman to take a few lessons in them, and be a little stronger, a little more vicious, a little more* venomous. Let him try what he can do. The Prime Minister will not object, I am sure, if I say that the whole time spent on this amendment has not been wasted. It has demonstrated that the Government has no intention to do anything, hecause it must placate the particular interests that honourable memhers opposite serve. That statement is not personal; it merely focuses actual facts that confront the country. Ministers are not only a body of politicians who happen to he ocoupying the political stage for a time, they represent definite economic interests. Honourable members on this side of the House represent the great organizations of Labour that support them. They stand for better clothes, better homes, and better conditions for the workman. They represent the workers with all their virtues, errors, and follies. On the other hand, honorahle members opposite represent the great monetary interests. There are no other interests that they can serve. They must necessarily draw their support from the Tory elements in the community, hut behind them and dominating them, is a group of men, few in number, but great in wealth. Whilst we on this side of the House represent numbers with little money, honourable members opposite represent much money and relatively few people. They are the parliamentary serThat is not the explanation. vants of capital-the great exporting con-. ing corporations, and the large importing houses of Plinders-lane. No matter what the professions of Ministers may be, every thing the Government does is a concession to the powerful monetary interests. Th°.y throw a few crumbs to the masses, and some bonuses to the farming community, just as an opulent highwayman collects money with one hand and with the other hand distributes largesse amongst the populace in order to gain their sympathy. election campaign."" In like manner did the Government dispose of the woollen mills in order to please the importers in Plinders-lane; in like manner, it emasculated the Commonwealth Banki n the interests of the p r i vate banking corporations'. In like manner, for the protection of vested interests, it now refuses to assist in the establishment of a compulsory wheat pool. That, Mr Chairman, is my contribution to the debate. It is not much, but it is the best I can offer at this hour. Having taken a keen interest in wheat pools eVer since their inception, I cannot give a silent vote on the amendment. 1 appreciated the referencesby the Treasurer to the political agitation and electioneering that have been associated w i th this question, and the endeavour to make this Parliament the mere tool of party politics. The best, simplest, and most effective wlieat pool was the voluntary one in 1921, when the Government's guarantee was administered by the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank. One pleasing feature of that pool was that whereas prior to its establishment motions for the adjournment of the House were moved time after time, and honorahle memhers were constantly trying to make political capital out of the unfortunate farmer, after the business was handed over to the Commonwealth Bank the matter was not further raised in Parliament. I have always heen emphatically opposed to compulsion in connection w i th wheat pools, because it is not in the in terest of the wheat-growers or the people generally, but I am in favour of a voluntary pool, guaranteed hy the Government upon the lines that were so successful in .1921. Some honorahle members think that a compulsory pool would stabilize the price of wheat and ensure, a better return to the grower. As a matter of fact, the whole wheat production of Australia is not sufficient to influence prices in the world's markets. The honourable member for Angas( Mr Gabb) quoted statistics to support his contention that a compulsory pool would improve the lot of the grower. It would do nothing of the sort, but it might ensure to h i m a f a i r average price throughout the season. The honorahle memher spoke as if high prices were always obtainable at the beginning of a season. I remember that early in the nineties wheat was sold at the beginning of the season for Is. 9d. a bushel, but I h i l d my wheat for six months [17] and received for it 4s. 6d. a bushel. The wheat-growers should be given an opportunity to obtain a fair average price for their product, and this can best be accomplished under a voluntary pool, with a government guarantee. In the early days, when wheat prices were low, several experienced farmers in South Australia decided when the harvest was gathered to fix upon three, dates during the year on which to sell their wheat. They did this for a considerable number of years, and averaged prices higher than those obtained by any one else in the state. The struggling farmer cannot afford to hold ' his wheat. A guarantee under a voluntary pool would give this class of farmer"" an opportunity to obtain a fair average price for his wheat, aud for that reason I favour a voluntary pool. I do not believe in compulsory pools, controlled by the Government. We had an awful example of the mismanagement of compulsory pools established during the war period. The Treasurer said a l o t , about compulsory pools in New South Wales, but he did not tell the Committee that they lost a train load of wheat one night, which was never recovered. in the 1916-17 wheat pool in South Australia wheat was sold to the Imperial Government at 5s. a bushel. Owing. to the mice plague and the neglect of the wheat stacks, the farmers obtained 3s. 3d. instead of 5s. a bushel. The Government was proceeded against by a committee representing the farmers, who obtained a_ verdict in the Supreme Court of South Australia. The Government appealed to the High Court of Australia, which reversed the decision. An appeal was then made to the Privy Council, which upset the High Court's decision, and ordered the case to be retried by the Supreme Court of South Australia. In South Australia 99 out of 100 farmers are against government control or a compulsory pool. I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Wannon( Mr McNeill). The time has arrived when we should prevent gambling in wheat, the staple food of the people. A t one time our wheat was exported from New South Walesi n such large quantities that there was no seed wheat available for the following season, and supplies had to be obtained from overseas by the Government.",66,Eable Page W E Offered To Me That I Might Serve Some Useful Pur

271,Mr West (East Sydney) [11.16],"There surely should be some government supervision of the export of wheat. The aim of the Farmers Union is to obtain fair values for the product of the primary producer. No member of the Labour party would deny that to the farmer.

The proposal is that we should release the farmers from those private interests that have had a strangle continue much longer. When it ceases hold of them for many years. Any one connected with primary production .knows that the farmers have been bled by the privately-owned ""octopus"" that has handled their wheat. No better suggestion has been made for overcoming the evil than 'a compulsory wheat pool. There are persons in this community who have made fortunes out of marketing wheat and other produce, and we on this side consider that we are on solid ground in endeavouring tb prevent further inroads being made into the farmer's profits.. The public as well as the farmers will benefit by the creation of a compulsory wheat pool, as it will prevent Australia being left without supplies for her own needs. I am not a wheat-grower; I represent a large district populated by consumers, who ought to be able to purchase wheat at a price that is reasonable to them and profitable to the producer. The evil of gambling in wheat should be stopped. Not many years ago, when wheat was short in this country, a firm in Sydney sent men to Sydney Heads to warn off vessels that were loaded with wheat, and in that way prices were inflated. Any one who has knowledge of the manipulation of primary produce by private interests must agree that the present method of distribution should be superseded by a better one [11.24] I apologize for obtruding my different circumstances I should haye views upon honourable' members at this late hour, but as a representative of one of the largest wheat-growing districts in New South Wales, I desire to explain very briefly why I intend to vote against the amendment. Personally, I favour the principle of a compulsory pool for the Commonwealth. I am influenced in that opinion by the obvious failure of the voluntary wheat pools in practically all the states, with the exception of Western in * New South Wales. Australia, about which I know nothing, more than I have heard during this demoving the amendment, has bate. It is evident that in all the states voluntary wheat, pools have been a diszation, and sympathetic Government backing, the pool that has existed -in New South Wales for the last three years is liably informed by those who control it that it is very doubtful Avhether it will to exist the wheat-growers will be again at the mercy of private buyers. Those honourable members who have lived very long in wheat-growing districts can recall the time when the growers were under the thumb of private buyers. The high prices offered hy buyers to-day are designed to kill the voluntary pools. That is recognized by the wheat-growers. The great majority of wheat-growers in New South Wales are, I think, in favour of a Commonwealth compulsory pool, and the reason why I am speaking is that I have received several requests from farmers' organizations in my electorate to support a compulsory pool. I did mot need those requests because my opinion had long heen that the voluntary system of pooling had always been, and always would he, a failure,, because it is impossible to bring in a minority of farmers who will always stand out . in the hope of getting higher prices, regardless of the welfare of the majority I do not know how the proposed compulsory pool will be established, and this dehate has not enlightened me on that point. I have been very anxious to find out how the Commonwealth should set. about creating the proposed organization. I feel sure that it can be done, hut it. will require some time to do it. That brings, me t'o the reason why I shall vote against the amendment. I thoroughly sympa-",68,Eable Page W E Offered To Me That I Might Serve Some Useful Pur

If it is carried it w ill rethe farmers. present a direction not from the wheat growers, who are the people vitally concerned, but from the Labour party in this House, to the Government to immediately take steps to create a Commonwealth wheat pool. I believe that the majorit y of the wheat-growers of New South WalesI am not speaking for those in the other states-are , in the light of their experience since the war, favorable to a compulsory wheat pool, and would welcome action by the Commonwealth Parliament. But they have not . taken steps to bring their wishes before Parliament. Beyond a few resolutions conveyed to me by organizations of farjnero and torate, I have no assurance the view I hold is shared by the majority of farmers. I am not pretending to speak on their behalf, for the two or three resolutions I have received do not entitle me to say that I speak for thousands of wheat-growers, hut from what I know of their feelings, I think I am safe in saying that they are behind the opinions I am voicing. action should be a definite indication from the men vitally concerned that they want the Commonwealth Parliament to do what the honourable member for Wandone. It is not f a i r for Parliament to tell the Government that it should take steps to find out what the growers want it to do. When the fruit-growers wanted a pool they took every means in their power to bring their wishes under the notice of the Government. Deputations waited upon Ministers and upon representatives in this Parliament almost daily. sugar-growers wanted a pool they also took every opportunity to make their wishes known. now in trouble. They want a pool. But they are not leaving it to some more or less irresponsible members of this Parliament to insist that the Government shall take action. They are acting for themselves. Until the wheat-growers bring under the notice of the ' Government, through their recognized organizations,, their desire for a compulsory wheat pool, I shall not vote in support of the proposal. The honourable member for Wannon( Mr McNeill) submitted no evidence that he spoke on behalf of the farmers, or at the request of the recognized organizations of He spoke for himself. Until he produces his authority to speak for the farmers' organizations I shall not stand behind him. I do not blame him for making political capital out of this matter. He and other honourable members of his party are entitled to do so if they care to, and if they think the farmers w ill accept them more readily for so doing. My reason for voting against the amendment is that I deny the right of the honourable member who moved it to speak wil h sufficient authority to direct the Government to do as he wishes. settlers in my elecI had no intention of speaking to the that amendment u n t i l the honourable member for New England( Mr Thompson) delivered his most remarkable speech. It is the most remarkable address that has been delivered in ' this Parliament for many sessions. He waited until late in the evening to speak, so evidently he does not desire his remarks to be reported in the The first press. It will probably be the duty of honorahle members on this side of the chamber to let his constituents know exactly what he said and how he voted. He stated definitely that the New South Wales voluntary pool had proved a failure, and was liable to collapse. He also observed that he had not the slightest doubt that a huge majority of the farmers -in New South Wales were in favour of a compulsory pool. He had nothing to say about the constitutional aspect of the matter, so he is evidently quite satisfied that the Prime Minister was wrong when When tha he said that the Government had no power to organize compulsory pools, Simply because the amendment was The wool-growers are moved by a meniber of the Opposition ha is willing to play into the hands of Dalgety and Company Limited, Goldsborough, Mort, and Company Limited, and other big wheat-buying concerns.

Although he said that the honourable member for Wannon does not represent the farmers, he will hardly deny that there is no honourable member in ""thia chamber who knows the wishes of the Victorian farmers better' than does the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr. Stewart).

274,Mr Mcgrath (Ballarat) [11.33],"ask MrA l l a n , the VicLorian Premier, to organize a compulsory wheat pool. They simply asked that a vote of the farmers should be taken on the matter. The honourable member knows very well t h a t . if a vote were taken the decision would be twelve to one in favour of a compulsory pool. ber for Wimmera does not claim to represent the farmers. MrM c GRATH He does represent the farmers, and he knows very well that when he fell foul of the wheat-buyers in this country he had to resign from the Ministry. I am surprised that the representatives of the wheat-growing constituencies, not only in this Parliament but also in various state Parliaments, have heen so untrue to their platform promises. The example was set in Victoria. I remember when the members of the Farmers party coalesced with the members of the Labour party, in this state and caused a double dissolution of the State Parliament. In the election campaign that f olloAved, the members of the Labour party went right through the industrial centres of the state, and advocated the formation of a compulsory wheat pool, notwithstanding that the proposal was anything but popular with the masses, who thought that it would mean dearer bread. We risked losing seats, because we were not willing to leave the farmers to the exploitation of the big financial institutions of the country. The election resulted in the return of a majority of memhers who were in favour of a compulsory pool, but when the Labour party took action to organize it the farmers' representatives proved faithless to their constituents. they again promised to work for a compulsory pool, but when they formed a coalition with the Nationalists an'd became, as the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey) so aptly put it , part and parcel of the Nationalist party, that was the end of the compulsory wheat pool. I can well remember the honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Gibson) declaring in this House that if he had a machine gun he would shoot the profiteers who were fleecing the producers of the country. Yet he has joined this Ministry. three members of the. Ministry, who previously were strong advocates of the compulsory wheat pool, are now able to find reasons why it should not be formed. Their change of attitude means, as the honourable member for Eaglehawk, in the Victorian Parliament, declared, "" the break-up of the Farmers party."" MrM c GRATH I do not think the honourable member for Wimmera, notwithstanding his radical tendencies, will be able to rally his forces again. The farmers have been betrayed. Even the farmer Premieri n this state, who, two months ago was at a farmers' conference which voted in favour of a compulsory pool, and who a month before that supported the Labour party in its effort to obtain a compulsory pool, has now joined forces in the State Parliament w it h the Nationalists, and can find reasons why a compulsory pool should not be formed. The honourable member for In d i ( Mr. Cook) and the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson), who claim to represent the farmers in this Parliament, are also willing now to hand over t h e i r constituents to the tender mercies of the financial institutions of this country. But that is their funeral. I shall vote for the amendment, although I do not expect that it will be carried. I have very little doubt, howeyer, that before many months are over a party will be in power in this Parliament which will take the necessary action to provide for the compulsory marketing of wheat.

The honourable member for theTellers: Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson) desires Francis, J. to exercise his right, as a member of thiscommittee, to express certain views underthe first item.

It has come down to this Parliament from the Mother of Parliamentsthe House of Commons of Great Britain. I hope that you, sir, will reflect upon the serious consequences of your decision, and realize that on .this item, a general discussion may take place. We have alreadyhad upon an amendment moved by the honourable member for Wannon( Mr. McNeill) a discussion relating to the establishment of a compulsory wheat pool. That subject has no reference to PartI . , "" The Parliament,"" but the discussion was made possible because of the well established practice that honourable members may, under the first item, discussithe whole gamut of government. I am at a loss to know The TEMPORARYCHAIRMAN T think that the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Mahony) is under a misapprehension, inasmuch as he has in mind the general discussion that usually takes, place upon the first item of the Estimates. We are now in committee on a bill, and are discussing a specific item, on which the honourable memher for WannonI take it that the previously moved as an amendment, ""That t.he amount be reduced by £ 1 , "" for a certain definite purpose.

The Northern Territory is as much an activitv of the Government as a wheat pool would be. I maintain that my remarks would be quite, in order at the present stage. The TEMPORARY. CHAIRMAN. I have pointed out to the honourable member that his privileges will not be curtailed ih the slightest degree. Part V., ""Department of Home and Territories,"" he can deal with any phase of Northern Territory administration, but under PartI . , ""The Parliament,"" he would not be in order in so doing. self of the opportunity to have a general discussion on the administration of the Northern Territory. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN Under this item any matter that is extraneous to the Parliament can be discussed only by an honourable member moving an amendment, as was done by the honourable member for Wannon. in dealing with the Northern Territory, one cannot confine oneself to a particular -department. In the Northern Territory there is administration hy the Postal Department, the Department of Works and Railways, and the Department of Defence, in addition to the Department of Home and Territories. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. I allowed the honourable memher a certain amount of latitude, because I hoped that he would connect his remarks with the Parliament. this Parliament of the Northern Territory, I thought that he intended to speak along those lines, but as he dealt with matters in general, I suggested to him that he should await the time when the committee was dealing with Part V. "" Department of Home and Territories."" this Parliament is .responsible for all administration, I contend that the time is now most opportune for >me to discuss the matters that I wish to raise I therefore ask you to allow me to proceed with my The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. I have pointed out to the honourable memher that he must confine himself to fhe discussion of something that closely affects the Parliament. I assure him that under Part V. "" Department of Home and Territories "" he will he free to speak as he desires. desire of every honourable member that we should observe a proper and orderly procedure. There is, of course, the established rule that on the first item of the Estimates a general discussion may take Under place. The reason for that is that in the Estimates there is no other appropriate place for a general discussion. The committee is now discussing a Supply Bill, and has reached a stage subsequent to that at which a general discussion may take place. I am sure that the honourable' member for Dalley( Mr Mahony) will readily agree that, on the motion for the second reading of this measure, no limitation was imposed upon the right of any honourable member to fully discuss it. Similarly, now, there is no limitation of the right to discuss any particular department when that department is before the committee. The only way in which an extraneous matter can he' introduced is to move that the amount of the item he reduced. That course would not suit the honorahle memher for the Northern Territory, because, if he adopted it, he would he limited to a discussion of the reasons for the specific reduction. I suggest that the recognized practice of Parliament will he observed, and that the honourable member will have f u l l latitude to bring up any matter affecting the Northern Territory, if he refrains from proceeding with his remarks at this stage. the Northern Territory fears that if he is not now allowed to speak a precedent may be established, and a recognized custom departed from.",72,Pairs

The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. The Chair cannot accede to the request of the honourable member. It has one duty to perform, namely, toconduct the business of the committee in the proper way.

There can he no amendment bofore the Committee until it is stated from the Chair. I contend that you are wrong in asking that the niotion be submitted in writing at this stage. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. The honourable member for the Northern 'Territory has already stated his motion, -and I have requested that it be handed in in writing. The amendment having been submitted in writing, and the question stated, monstrating the maladministration in connection with the Northern Territory, I desire to quote section 13 (1) of the Public Service Ordinance of the Northern Territory, which readsNo person shall be admitted to the Public Service of the Northern Territory unless he is must be supplied in connection with such a natural born or a naturalized British subject, and has submitted satisfactory evidence as to the date of his birth, sound bodily health and freedom from physical defects, and possesses good character. I desire particularly to emphasize the necessity for a person appointed to the Public Service possessing a good character, as that section of the ordinance has not been adhered to in the case of the appointment to one of the most responsible offices in the Northern Territory. I refer to the position of Government Secretary, the occupant of which is the permanent head of .all the departments .in the Territory. I want to know why the Minister did not comply with the terms of the ordinance in connection with the appointment of the officer referred to. I point out that this oflicer was relieved of his command in the 37th Battalion after the Battle of Messines as the result of an inquiry into his conduct, and the manner in which he behaved under fire. He was practically cashiered out of the Army. Subsequently, because of some big "" p u l l "" which he possessed, ho received employment in the delousing depot, and, later, with the Comforts Fund Department, where he was again court martialled for selling to French civilians goods belonging to the comforts fund. Were all these facts taken into consideration when the filling of the vacant office was under consideration? There is ample evidence available in Melbourne as to the character of this man, and it is astounding that he should have received the appointment. I have also before me a list of dis4 qualifications and suspensions decided upon by the Western Australian Turf Club. The list sets out the names of all individuals who have been warned off the various race-courses in Western Australia. Among the names is that of A. C. Braham, and the particulars concerning him are as follows:By whom disqualified -The Western Australian Turf Club. Date of disqualification -17t h August, 1921. Form of disqualification -Warned off. Offence -Defaultin g bettor. I desire the Minister to ascertain if this person is identical with a man recently appointed Crown Law Officer for the Northern Territory. Asi t is provided in the ordinance that proof of character an appointment,it should he an easy matter for the Minister to ascertain if the person appointed is the one to whom I have referred. Such officers would naturally bring the administration in Darwin into contempt. able member can submit proof of his statement. proof of what I am saying by producing witnesses in Melbourne and supplying all the necessary details. I have mentioned these cases in order to show the justification for the complaints I have made, and how essential it is that persons not only of ability, hut also of good character, shall be selected to administer the affairs of the Territory. If the greatest care is not exercised one cannot wonder if the conditions there become chaotic. Any one opposing the views of the Administration is immediately pounced upon and victimized. I desire also to direct the attention of the Minister to the treatment meted out to Captain Bishop, at present the veterinary oflicer for the Northern Territory, and who, in view of the fact that the",74,Pairs

Captain Bishop is spoken of as an exceptionally capable 'officer by the pastoralists in the (Northern Territory, but unfortunately more than half of his time is spent in performing clerical work which could be undertaken*by a third or fourth-grade clerk. In these circumstances he is unable to perform necessary work in the outback country. He is also in the unenviable position of having his requirements in the matter of increments reduced hy one-half in order, it is assumed, to compel him to resign his position. action has been taken by the authorities merely because he will not become a party to the maladministration of the Territory. He has been in the service of the Commonwealth for ten and a half years, four and a half of which were spent on active service. His remuneration is £675 per annum, but had he been paid the increment to which he is entitled he would be receiving £750, which amount is paid to other officers of a similar grade sent to the Territory by the Department of Works and Bailways to supervise road construction. This action is supported by men whose names appear on the racing calendar and who are not -permitted to enter any race-course in Western Australia. If the A. C. Braham referred to in the report is the same person, I do not think the legal fraternity in the Northern Territory would, if acquainNavigation Act concerning the engageted with the facts, have allowed him to occupy the position to which he has been appointed. The charges I have made warrant the appointment of a select committee to conduct a thorough investigation into the appointment, and I am quite prepared to substantiate all I have said if such a course is adopted.

We do not know how far-reaching that decision may be; it may render invalid much of ourlegislation.
