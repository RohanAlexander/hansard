Last year there was a surplus of only about £500,000 after all expenditure on postal works had been met. It is thought that, within the next few years, expenditure will increase considerably, owing to the erection of new post offices, and the inauguration of new cable and telephone services, so that there is not likely to .be any surplus in future.

That speech was made nearly two years ago, and still the proposal is on the shelf. The Ministerf o r Trade and Customs( Mr White), at the opening of We will undoubtedly manufacture motor vernment is doing everything possible to for the hasten that. We all thought that the Government was sincere. The Prime Minister, the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties, and the Minister for Trade and Customs said that the proposal was practicable. They agreed that motor car engines, like railway engines, aeroplane engines, and much other intricate machinery, could be economically and efficiently manufactured in this country. During the year 1935, 22 manufacturers in Australia made 4,700 internal combustion engines. Of those, S2 per cent, were petrol engines. It is interesting to note that no fewer than 20 types, ranging from 1\ to 80 horse power, were made in Australian factories dn 1935. Last year the Dominion""of Canada made 207,000. The scheme is a practicable one and the Government has failed to carry it out. I am trying to prove to the Government that it should not have hesitated for so long. A careful analysis, according to evidence before the know that about £5,500,000 sterling Tariff Board, showed that the cost of manufacturing a motor car engine in Australia would compare favourably with the average cost of manufacturing one in Great Britain. to the House, I point out that the merits of the question of manufacturing motor car engines in Australia cannot be debated on this motion, which deals solely with the failure of the Government to give effect to a certain policy. Mr Speaker. We have ample evidence that the Government, having brought down a proposal over two years ago for the manufacture of motor car engines in Australia, and having collected approximately £775,000 for the purpose, and then having failed to go ahead with the proposal, is indeed deserving of severe censure by the House. The honourable member for Henty( Sir Henry Gullett) must, in his own mind, if he dares to speak-if he fails to speak member for Henty brought his proposal in criticism of the Government he is not so candid as he usually is able member must not reflect on another honourable member. sorbs 70,000 motor cars and trucks per annum, and the market is expanding so rapidly that it will not he long before the number will be 100,000. ' With that knowledge in mind, the Government could, with complete confidence, have carried out its promise to encourage the establishment of a local industry. The Government should know that the manufacture of motor cars is the greatest labor-providing industry of our times, and that its value to other industries is considerable, as it permeates through all industries and becomes a vital and dominating factor in the industrial life of a country. The Government, by its failure to go on with the policy so eloquently enunciated by the honourable member for Henty two years ago, has deprived of employment the large number of people who would have been employed in the manufacture of the raw material needed by such an expansion of the motor car industry. It must in 1935, and £6,700,000 sterling last year went out ""of this country for the purchase of motor car engines and chassis. Its failure to establish the industry in this country has, as it were, knocked sideways-Australia's. trade balance, The far-reaching consequences of its neglect can be seen in true perspective by the fact that £60,000,000 is spent annually in Australia on auto-motive transport. If the Government had gone on with that scheme, which, we were told by the honourable member for Henty, was introduced after full consideration had been given to it, and after all investigation that was necessary had been made, much of this vast amount of money would have been saved to Australia. The then Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties and the experts of the Customs Department had conferred with the hig engineering firms best able to undertake the manufacture of motor cars before the proposal was made. When the honourable before Parliament, we gathered from his statement to the House that it had received the unanimous endorsement of the then Ministry. I maintain that the failure of the Government to go on with its policy is a hreach of faith, and is against the best traditions of honest government.",18,Manufacture Of Motor Car Chassis Formal Motion Fob Adjournment

51,Mr Forde,"Australi a to-day abI t is considered by those .best able to judge that motor car engines can be economically'and efficiently manufactured in this country. The Government must be aware of that fact, and.must take the blame for the fact that no steps have been taken to establish the industry. In the statement made by the honourable member for Henty, to which I have already referred,'no reference was made to the trade diversion policy. This was something apart, and it was intended to stand alone. The honourable member said that it stood as a beacon light. He elaborated the scheme, and urged the necessity to carry it out rapidly by sayingTo provide tlie funds needed to encourage the Australian manufacturer of. engines, steps will be taken forthwith. Has the Government done so? He proceededI t is proposed to impose an additional duty of .7d. per lb. on imported motor chassis and parts. impost will average over the range of imported chassis approximately' '£5 each. The honourable member said then that there was no need for delay, that the Government had made up its mind, and that tliere was no need to refer the proposal to the Tariff Board. The exact amount of the bounty on each engine was to be referred to the Tariff Board later, but the Government was making a definite declaration that the bounty in 1938 would be £38 and, in 1939, £26 on each engine. The exact payment necessary for subsequent years would be inquired into by the Tariff Board. He saidWe, after careful consideration, have come to the conclusion that this is a question of far-reaching importance and there is no necessity for further delay. The honourable member's colleague, the Minister was so enamoured of the scheme that he said} in reply to interjections when he produced the tariff schedule, that there was no need for further delay. The Government has raised £775,000 as the rpsult of the bounty duty. So there is no need for dela'y on the score of not ""having necessary funds. We know that the money is available. According to the Government's programme, the work should have been put in hand two years ago. Intending manufacturers should ilr. Forde. have been able to go ahead with the production without fear of having their plans thwarted. The Government, I know, will claim that there is difficulty in inducing firins to go ahead with production, and that further inquiries are necessary. But the facts are against the 'Government. Does it expect the general manager of General Motors Limited, which has its roots in the United States of America, to say "" We can and will manufacture in Australia"" ? He would get the sack next day if he did so, because he represents a large organization whose interests are overseas and whose American factory manufactures for a world's market. Buti f the Government had carried its plan out and had said "" This must be done in Australia !"", General Motors Limited or Ford's would have wasted . no time in establishing a plant in this country, because the demand for 70,000 cars and trucks per annum, which is increasing Generally speaking, this additional every year, is substantial. Some factories are operating successfully in other countries on a production basis of from 5,000 to 10,000 units a year. The honoraible member for Henty is not a man who usually makes up his mind in a hurry. He made a searching investigation, and said that he was convinced that there was no need for further delay. In bringing this matter before the House, I have in mind the 10,000 people who would be employed directly and indirectly in an Australian motor car industry if the Government had the courage to go on with the scheme. I do not blame the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs. He has not been in .the Ministry for long, and I have found him courteous and definite in his answers to me in respect of this for Trade and Customs, matter. There has, however, been a recantation of policy, and side-stepping by the Government. This matter was referred to the Tariff Board in December, 1936, nearly two years ago. Reference of matters to the Tariff Board is a favourite means of side-stepping a thorny problem. The Tariff Board made its investigations and report. The Minister for Trade and Customs said that he had seen the report, but that his colleagues had not. I am not ready to believe that statement. The matter was sent back again to the Tariff Board and the Tariff Board made a further investigation and report which the Minister took with him to London. I have asked questions, but have not been able to get a reply. The vaccillation of this Government is deserving of condemnation. able member's time has expired. Minister for Trade and Customs) [3.39]. -With much of what has been said by the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Forde), I am in perfect agreement, and I venture the opinion that the Government would have been in agreement with much of what he would have said had Mr Speaker given him permission. full agreement with what was said by the honourable member for Henty( Sir Henry Gullett) when he made his pronouncement in the House in May, 1936. The Government was behind him and most of the House, I believe, was behind him. The proposal was brought in at the time when the unfavorable position of the trade balance between the United States of America and Australia was a matter of concern. The adverse trade balance with the United States of America, however, was not the only reason for the introduction of the policy; it was, as the honourable member for Henty said, "" Able to stand on its own feet"". The Government promised to take active steps to carry out that policy, and it did so. One of its first acts was to submit the matter to the Tariff Board. the original decision. of the Government at the* time, but it an economic basis. was not a surprise to me to learn that the proposal was submitted to the Tariff Board."" The proposal was sent to the member for Henty say that., the fullest board in December, 1936, and it was not possible investigation into the . industry until the 7th September, 1937, that the had been carried out before the proposal board's report was received. When was submitted to the. Government? Did further information is required, as the he not say that the policy which he honourable member for Henty( Sir Henry advocated had the unanimous support of Gullett) and the Deputy Leader of the his colleagues? Opposition ( Mr Forde) are well aware, the report has to be referred back to the the whole matter must receive the most board. required additional information and the ture is incurred. The latest suggestions report was returned to the board for further investigation. When the additional information was received the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr White), who was about to proceed overseas, had not time to study the latest report before he left Australia. Accordingly he took the report with him and later communicated his comments to the Government. It may befortunate or unfortunate that this additional delay occurred. Although the matter has been in hand for two years, it has come directly under my notice only since the Minister for Trade and Customs left. Australia. He has since had an opportunity to peruse the latest report of the Tariff Board, and has submitted certain suggestions to the department. Before The Ministry is . in action can be taken the Ministers suggestions have to be submitted to the Tariff Board, which is now sitting in Brisbane, and nothing can be done until the Government receives the board's comments on the latest developments. There has been no unnecessary delay or change of policy on the part of the Government, and even if the honqrable member for Henty were still a member of the Cabinet, I do not believe that the, position would be in any way different from what it is to-day. The Government is anxious to proceed with the establishment of this industry, but does not wish to do so until it has all the available facts at its disposal. It cannot be accused of having delayed the proposal unnecessarily and the cause of the delay is well known. The Government will take the necessary steps to establish the industry if it is a practical proposition, but it thousands of pounds until it is satisfied I was not a member that the industry can be established on In this case the Government careful consideration before any expendi-",20,Manufacture Of Motor Car Chassis Formal Motion Fob Adjournment

I cannot undertake that the latest recommendation will be brought before the House during this period of the session. justify delay of over two years when the Government previously said that it had already made up its mind in the matter? cumstances it is not unreasonable. believe that the people of Australia will admit that the delay is justified. [3.35] I do not think that any one can deny that there has been a good deal of unnecessary delay in establishing the motor engine building industry in Australia. The only opposition to the proposal submitted by the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties ( Sir Henry Gullett) two and a half years ago came from those who thought that the supplies should not be excluded from outside ' too hurriedly. with the representatives large engineering firms in Australia, who admitted that, regardless of their fiscal beliefs, they knew that sooner or later the industry would be established in Australia. Their only fear was that the Government would expect them to commence too soon, and they hoped that some months would elapse before they were expected to enter the business. Preparations were made in many directions. For instance, those controlling technical colleges began to select suitable youths to be trained to ' work in the industry. Several conferences were held with the idea of urging students to undertake vocational training so that they might become fitted for the work. A large company which purchased land .at Fisherman's Bend,' anticipating developments in this direction, selected a site close to the River Yarra, so that its supplies of iron and steel could be brought by water and discharged direct into its works. Regardless of the opinions which they knew would be expressed by their American representatives, they realized that eventually this work would be undertaken in Australia. In justification of the long delay the Government will say. that its attention has been concentrated upon its defence programme; but the development of this industry is essential to the defence of Australia. The members of the Opposition did not oppose the scheme because they knew that Australia could not be a self-contained nation until it is capable of building motor car engines and aeroplane engines in Australia. We knew that the establishment of the industry was inevitable, and, as aircraft and motor engines should provide our first I line of defence, we supported .the Minister who first introduced the proposal. We have in Mr John Storey a designer, inventor and engineer who, American experts agree, is equal to any one to be found elsewhere, and that gentleman and the company with which he is associated are anxious to begin the manufacture of motor car engines in their workshops at Fisherman's Bend. Other companies which had not been manufacturing motor engine parts commenced their manufacture as soon as the Scullin Government imposed embargoes oh the importation of I conversed certain parts, until to-day practically the of many whole of the car except the chassis is built here, and these companies, if encouraged, are prepared to commence the construction of motor car engines immediately. They have been ready for some time. If the Government had proceeded with this scheme the industry would have been established now and would have conferred a great benefit on unemployed youths in the Commonwealth. Hundreds of young men are to-day anxious to be apprenticed to this branch of the engineering trade. ment would not allow them to be apprenticed. The trade union movement is interested in all proposals for the training of' youths in useful occupations. It has its representatives on the council of the Working Men's College in Melbourne, and nearly every year a representative of some trade union is appointed as president of one of the technical colleges. Trade union organizations have done more than any other body in Australia to further the vocational training of our youths and returned soldiers.

They believe that if the Government allows this proposal to lapse because it is so busily engaged on other war preparation work it will be guilty of a most serious blunder, because when these works cease those engaged in them will swell the ranks of the unemployed. This scheme is the finest that the Government has ever propounded. I agree with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde) that no further time should be lost, and I am sure that his action will be endorsed by the people of Australia. When the scheme was first mentioned some of us, myself included, required further information. I remember speaking to the honourable member for Henty( Sir Henry Gullett) who was then the Minister directing negotiations foi trade treaties. I told him that the Labour party was behind him in the scheme, our only fear being that it might cause some unemployment if imports were ended too suddenly. He replied that there was no such intention, and that within the next two years the scheme would be in operation. proved by the fact that the amount of bounty was fixed on a sliding scale. For this year, the first year of production, it was fixed at £30 for each engine, for 1939 at £26. for 1940 at £8, and in 1941 at £3 15s. makes some protest at the delay, and unless it urges the Government to put the scheme into operation at once, it will be missing an opportunity to do something in the interest of Australian industries and the people of this country. Only by establishing this industry for the building of motor engines can we expect to make Australia self-contained and secure. This is one of the key industries. Indeed, it mrfy be regarded as our first line of defence. These things are so linked that the proposal to establish, this industry is one of the most important issues that has ever been raised in this House. [3.44] I thank the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Ourtin) for 'having informed me, by telephone, soon after 2 o'clock to-day, of the intention of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde) to move this motion for the adjournment of the . House. That was the first intimation I had that action was to be taken. I do not think that I would have chosen this particular time to bring this matter before the House, but since it has been brought forward, I very warmly support practically everything that has been said by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I understand that in the debate on this motion we shall be confined to the question of the failure of the Government to establish the industry for the manufacture of motor car engines in Australia. I shall endeavour to keep within the scope of the motion. At the outset I should like to go back to the origin of this proposal and to trace its progress, because only in this way can I give force to my support of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in his contention that the Government has failed. This matter had its origin in the Department of the Treasury, as had the whole trade diversion scheme of 1936. It began with an intimation to the Customs Department that the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) was concerned about the This is adverse overseas trade balance. sity to limit discussion of this topic, but it must be realized that . the motion relates to a definite matter of public importance., namely, the failure of the Unless this House Government to do something that was announced by the Ministry would 'be done. Therefore, the origin of the scheme, the circumstances in which it was brought ibefore this House, and whether or not it was justified, cannot be debated. Speakers must confine their remarks to the subject-matter of the motion. respect, Mr Speaker, I submit that as failure is charged it must ' be clearly shown that there was a definite commitment on the part of the Government. I propose to establish .briefly that such a commitment was entered into, other(Henty) wise there could have been no failure.

65,"Sir Henry Gullett,","With allnegotiations for trade treaties. The Government was very definitely committed to establish, this industry. As honourable members opposite have pointed out, it was committed first „ of all under its general trado diversion policy, but in addition to being a trade diversion measure, this scheme for the local manufacture of motor car engines was introduced and sponsored by the Government because of its great importance to this country. Further evidence of the Commonwealth Government's commitment was the consent of the Government of the United Kingdom, conveyed by cablegram, to the proposal to offer a bounty on the manufacture of motor car engines in Australia. Had this consent not been given, the offer of that bounty would have constituted a breach of the Ottawa Agreement. The Prime Minister submitted to the British Government that this matter was of such great national importance as to warrant the British Government giving way and permitting the bounty to be offered. able member must confine his remarks to the motion before the Chair. wish to establish the fact that defence was involved. To the best of my knowledge the question of Australian and Imperial defence was specifically mentioned when the matter was referred to Mr Baldwin. The original intention was that the scheme should not be referred to the Tariff Board. From the moment, some months later, when, against my strongly expressed wishes, it was referred to the board, the Government has been failing in its original intention to. encourage this mysterious, by the speech delivered here indtistry. At the outset it was not referred to the Tariff Board for the simple reason that-, we knew, as has since been proved,. that the board could not obtain tlie necessary evidence in this country. .Obviously importers, could not be expected to give evidence in favour of home manufacture, nor could overseas manufacturers exporting motor car angi'nes to Australia be expected to give this evidence. It was therefore decided that no good purpose'could be served by obtaining a report from the Tariff Board. Cabinet then decided that the matter should not be referred to the board, but that it should be dealt with immediately as one of great national importance, and associated with the problem of defence. It was considered that the board should investigate the position of the industry soon after its establishment, when evidence would be available as to the relative costs of Australian-made and imported chassis. The failure of the Government is further emphasized by the obvious fact that the speech which I made in this chamber at the time was not in any way a personal one. No matter ever raised in this House was more completely discussed and endorsed by the Cabinet as a whole. Every word of my speech had been read by the Prime Minister himself before I came into the chamber. I now come to the change in the attitude of the Cabinet to the proposed new industry. The wilt on the part of the Government with regard to the great importance of establishing a new protected industry began with the reference of the matter to the Tariff Board. All that I could say was that, although the matter should go before the board, the offer made by me in this House should remain. ""We now have the anomalous position that the proposal is being subjected to every possible delay, even to the extent of being taken for a trip overseas by the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr White). The Government could bring this industry into being immediately, because of the offer which it made in this chamber, and which is on record. The Government's failure is emphasized, and is made completely to-day by the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Perkins). I have no disagreement with that honourable gentleman. He was not a member of the Cabinet at'the time, and, with all respect to him, he does not know what took place before the proposal was introduced; indeed, he admits that. Yet he says that the Government is still whole-hearted with respect to this matter! If so, it has £750,000 in hand, collected under a special duty on motor chassis, tabled by the Minister for Trade and Customs on the",24,Manufacture Of Motor Car Chassis Formal Motion Fob Adjournment

67,Sir Henry Gullett,"I merely22nd May, 1936. If the Government has the desire to assist in the establishment -of the industry, and as it has the necesrepeated assurance that it is wholehearted sary funds to provide the promised bounty, I can assure the House that manufacturers are now waiting to put the industry into operation. I knew, however, that once the proposal was sent back adherence to the policy of protection. If to the Tariff Board, exactly what has happened was intended to happen. There is one matter on which I should like to inform the House, to show the keeuness of local industry to engage in this task. I have been approached for advice by no fewer than three groups of men in Australia-representing , in one case, the highest achievement in motor car manufacture in the world-wh o are supported by plenty of capital. I admit at once that the British and North American companies are not prepared to manufacture chassis in Australia unless pressure is put on them. It was always my intention, and that of the Cabinet, to put that pressure on them. We began to exert that pressure when we brought the North American companies down to the quota that they had reached during the year ended April, 1936. These groups have asked for my advice whether it would be safe for them to go on with the scheme to manufacture chassis in Australia. Each time, unfortunately, owing to the inaction of tlie Government, and the lack of any further pressure, I have been impelled to advise them not to risk their money at this stage. [Leave to continue given.] On each occasion when I have been approached, I have said to the prospective Australian manufacturers that, as long as the North American companies. stand out, they will be risking great sums of money in this enterprise. I pointed out that, immemember for Henty pointed out, that it diately it became known that any local company was about to begin operations in Australia, the North American companies would smother them because of their greater wealth and backing, and their greater readiness to embark upon the industry. So this proposal is held up in this wretched manner to-day. In view of the important business awaiting the consideration of the House, I do not intend to detain honourable members longer at this stage, but I do say that the Government has failed. One must regard with the utmost suspicion its in the matter, and is waiting'for an opportunity to go on ^yith the scheme. The whole of the party behind the Government is really on trial with respect to its this Government or this party stands for protection, it should not hesitate to assist immediately any interests offering to engage in the manufacture of motor car engines in this country. importance of the motion submitted by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde) is indicated by the able manner in which it has been supported by the honourable member for Henty( Sir Henry Gullett), whose speech has been most illuminating to honourable members generally. In view of the remarks of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who has deplored the delay that has occurred in giving effect to the policy declared by the Government as long ago us 1936, a strong protest should be made against the Government's failure to do its part in establishing this new industry. I believe that the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Perkins) has spoken in good faith, but he was not a member of the Ministry when this matter was first discussed, and the argument advanced by him has been effectively disposed of by the honourable member for Henty. It has been asserted by members of the Opposition that the matter was referred to the Tariff Board only for the purpose of delaying the establishment of the new industry. In the first place, the proposal was supported by almost every honourable member, and most enthusiastically by the Opposition. It is true, as. the honourable was never intended by the House that the matter should first be referred to the Tariff Board, because it was desired to establish a new industry that would be of value in connection with the defence J programme of the Government. For some reason, a change of policy on the part of the Government has occurred. It is amazing to hear that a report on the matter has been submitted to the Government, by the Tariff Board,""and that the",25,Manufacture Of Motor Car Chassis Formal Motion Fob Adjournment
68,Mr Barnard (Bass) [3.58],"The Government intends, apparently, to await the return to Australia of the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr White) before giving further consideration to the proposal. As the honourable member for Henty has stated, attention was directed to the desirability of establishing the ininto effect without inquiry. Eventually, dustry because of the serious effect of imthe Government agreed that the Tariff portations of motor cars on our trade balance. The Treasurer ( Mr Casey), in a recent public statement, issued a warning regarding the danger of the heavy . importation of goods into Australia, having an adverse effect on our trade balance. He remarked that we ought to "" build up a body of money in London as a shock-absorber against a bad season, or a number of bad seasons, in Australia "". Chair that the honourable member is departing from the terms of the motion. The question at issue is the failure to give .effect to a certain proposal. is of the highest importance that the industry should be established at the earliest possible date. No effort should be spared to make this country economically self-contained, and we cannot be self-contained until the manufacture of motor cars in Australia becomes an accomplished fact. There is in Australia for the manufacture of cars. I trust that the Government will take heed of what has been said, and that there will be no further procrastination. I support the motion of the'Deputy Leader of the Opposition, to whom credit is due for having brought this matter forward. gravamen of the charge against the Government seems to be that it has not, without inquiry of any sort, launched the country upon a new policy which might have the most serious economic effects. honourable gentleman has caused the Government to change its mind. against the honourable member for Henty( Sir Henry Gullett), rather than against me. About two and a half years ago he came before Parliament with a trade diversion policy which he himself, only a little while before, had denounced more bitterly than any one else could have done. Included in that policy was a proposal for the manufacture of motor cars in Australia. Immediately afterwards, the question arose as to whether the Government was pledged by the honourable member for Henty to put the new policy Board should inquire into the proposal. Honourable members would be justified in demanding an alteration of the law to require Tariff Boardreports to be presented to Parliament within a certain time after coming into the possession of the Government. Parliament and the public have a right to know what is contained in these reports. Under the law, as it now stands, reports are held back by the Government for months on end. Sometimes they are referred back to the board, and Parliament never sees them at all. This is a most important matter. We have to decide whether we should impose further taxation on the people to permit of the manufacture of motor cars member is now discussing the merits of the proposal to manufacture motor cars. That cannot be done in the terms of the motion before the House. the raw material suitable to point out the effect of this policy if put into operation. The report of the Tariff Board is not before us, but I assume it would point out that it would be uneconomic to manufacture motor cars in Australia, having regard to the limited output. We know that Great Britain is able to manufacture cars much more cheaply than Australia could hope to do, and yet British manufacturers, despite the advantage of lower wages, arc unable to compete against the manufacturers of the United States of America, because, in the latter country production is so much greater, and more scientific methods are employed. Cars can be manufactured in the United States of America at less than half the cost of cars made in Great Britain. posal was brought before the House to impose a duty for the purpose of providing a bounty to encourage the manufacture of motor cars.

The proposal cannot be debated again. whole of the speech of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde), but the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway) was allowed to say that various parts for motor cars were being manufactured in Australia, and to point out the great possibilities of the industry in the future. AmI not justified in arguing that the Government's proposed policy in regard to the manufacture of motor cars would be bad for the country ? member does that tie will be debating a proposal which has already been agreed to by tlie House. show the absurdity of the proposal to manufacture cars in Australia. Any attempt to do so would merely result in trebling the cost of the motor car. The honourable member for Swan( Mr would be very interesting to know the Gregory) said that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde) wanted the Government to rush course of action inquiry. Deputy Leader of the Opposition merely called attention to the fact that the Government, after the most exhaustive inquiry, and after having come to a definite determination regarding a policy, has since that time refused to put the policy into effect. I think the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is to be congratulated for endeavouring to make the Government shoulder its responsibilities, and to realize that any further delay is likely to be disastrous to Australia. The longer that delay lasts, the worse will the position become. The Acting for Trade and Customs( Mr Perkins) said that the Government could not, without further inquiry, agree to the spending of hundreds of thousands of pounds of that, because of the action taken by the honourable member for Henty( Sir Henry Gullett) when he was in office, the money is already in the Treasury. Treasury? has collected the money, not .from the general taxpayers, but from the motousers, and £775,000 should be in hand for the specific purpose of paying a bounty for the encouragement of the manufacture of motor cars in Australia. Where is that money? Can the Minister tell us whether it is still in the Treasury, or whether it has been diverted to other uses? If the Government has used the money for other purposes, that probably accounts for tbe delay in putting this policy into effect. If the money has not been spent, there is already more in hand than would be necessary to carry out, during the years 1937 and 1938, what the honourable member for Henty proposed should be done. It amounts almost to a dishonest use of public funds if the Government has used this money for purposes other than that for which it was collected. The honourable member for Henty v.sed strong language when discussing this matter. He said that the whole business was full of suspicion. It reason behind the present delay. Have the big motor importers sufficient into a influence to delay the carrying out of without proper this policy? We know the history of That is not true. The many of the combines that operate in Australia and other countries, and we know the immoral things they are prepared to do in order to hold their trade. They do not hesitate to prevent the economic development of a country if, by so doing, they can preserve for themselves a market for their goods. The big motor and machinery firms of the United States of America are notorious in this respect. If the Acting Minister had given a satisfactory reason for the delay, honourable members would not have been compelled to seek Minister reasons for themselves. Why was not the report of the Tariff Board presented to Parliament? Why was it sent round the world to London? In any case, surely there is more than one copy of the report public money. The fact is in existence. We know that the manufacturers of petrol-driven internal combustion engines are concerned, not only because of the possible manufacture of such engines in Australia, but also is it in the because of the development of other kinds of engines.

82,Mr Lazzarini,"-The Governmentover the world who keep a watch on developments in every country. Government, the manufacture of cars in Australia, is striking a-serious blow at the economic development of the country. The general development of this country is threatened every day we leave this industry at the mercy of outside interests. It will rest with those interests to say whether we shall be able to meet our transport emergency. Government is failing in its duty to the country. Surprise has been expressed that an additional £30 is involved in Australian factory costs in respect of imported chassis frames, but is it not far more to the point that at present we pay from £450 to £500 for cars which sell in the United States of America for £117. The Plymouth, Ford and other makes of cars sell in Australia at three times the price they bring in the United States of America., and the position is nearly as bad with respect to several makes of British cars. Australian users of motor cars will continue under such disadvantages until the motor-car industry is fully established in this country. Furthermore, these excessive purchase payments tend to pile up onr debt to a country to whicli we can sell hardly anything in return. The Government should have developed this industry long before this, and I regret very much its failure in this regard. Above all, honourable members who claim to represent country interests should take this opportunity to make life easier for settlers in our outback areas. So long as they support the Government's procrastination in developing this industry, they delay the day when these people particularly will be enabled to reap benefits from an Australian motor-car industry. aircraft engines. been established largely because of its importance froni the point of view of defence. I should say that the establishment of the motor-car manufacturing industry is also of great importance from a defence point of view. For want of such an industry our defence programme will he seriously held up. I raised this matter in connection with the tariff, and 1 The now repeat the views I then expressed. by thus delaying In view of the fact that an Australianbuilt car has been driven from Adelaide to Melbourne, involving a cost of only £1 for fuel, when American cars would use up to £7 or £8 worth of fuel for the same mileage, we need no further argument to be convinced of our ability to manufacture motor cars economically. I refer to the performance of a Dieselneeds in a time of engined car, a report of which was pubI n that respect this lished in last Sunday's press. When it lia3 inducements of that nature before it, combined with the fact that an amount of £775,000 has already been collected from users of motor cars for the payment of a bounty on manufacture, the Government, to say the least, is guilty of criminal folly if it refuses to'go ahead immediately with the establishment of this industry. The motion before the House is specific, It charges the Government with failure to go ahead with the proposal to manufacture motor cars in Australia, and, in moving it, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde) contended that the Government had committed a breach of faith in this respect. The relevant point to be considered at this juncture, I suggest, is whether the Government is definitely committed to this proposal, and whether there has been a breach of faith on its part. In order to deal with that aspect, some re-statement of the events leading up to the proposal is necessary. The tariff policy of this Government differs entirely from that of the Opposition. Generally speaking, the policy of this Government is to have a careful inquiry made by the Tariff Board before imposing a. duty, whereas the policy of the Opposition is to allow a. duty whether the industry proposed to be established promises to be economic or not. % honourable member is misrepresenting the policy of the Opposition. able member must not interrupt the debate. ment at the outset was prepared to get away from its policy that an inquiry by the Tariff Board should first take place, and that it con-",28,Manufacture Of Motor Car Chassis Formal Motion Fob Adjournment

That, however, was not the last word of tha Government on this subject. Its last word was not known until it announced its decision following all of the discussions which took place on this matter in Cabinet and in this Parliament. That decision was made known by the honourable member for Henty( Sir Henry Gullett) when he was Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties, in making his last speech in this chamber on the subject, which is reported, in ttatn&ard, Volume 152, page 2543; the honorahle member saidI give my assurance at this stage that if this industry could be economically the Tariff Board after an inquiry arrives at tlie conclusion that I am totally wrong, and that this industry 'would be uueconomic and expensive, I shall be finished with the project? It can be deduced from its failure posal. In that regard I speak for the Government. The question as to whether the Government has committed a breach of faith, clearly rests, therefore, on what is embodied in the report of the Tariff Board. report? awaiting it. The point I make at the moment, however, is that the Government has committed no breach of faith, because it is not committed to go ahead with the proposal unless it is assured by the Tariff Board that this industry will be economic and will not involve a. tremendous expenditure. Until we have the report of the Tariff Board on the subject it is quite impossible to decide that point. It looks very much to me. however, and I think, to most honourable members, that the Tariff Board is not favorable to the proposal. We know that the board's report has been received by the Government, and we can judge that, apparently, it was not acceptable to the Government for the simple reason that it was referred back to the board in order that additional information might be obtained. The board then handed a report to the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr White) on the eve of his departure for Great Britain, and he apparently had digested its contents and returned it to the Government. It appears quite certain that, the Tariff Board has, in the words of the ex-Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties, found this industry to be uneconomic and expensive. ber seen the report? If not, is he justified in making that statement? delay which has taken place we can assume that what I have said is correct. We must remember that the Government, even according to a statement made by the ""Acting Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Perkins) to-day, is anxious to go ahead with this project. If the report of the Tariff Board was conclusive on the point that established in Australia, why is not the Government going ahead with the proto do so that the Tariff Board has not been in complete agreement with the Government. I repeat that the Government cannot be said to be committed to this project until it has received the report of the Tariff Board, and as we can only guess as to the contents of the report, we cannot decide whether or not it has been guilty of a breach of faith. As the import duty of .7d. a lb. on motor chassis still exists, and already the sum of £775,000 has been collected by this means from Australian purchasers of motor cars, the Government should have made an early decision on this matter. The Tariff Board's report should be liberated to honourable members, and if it does not favour the Government's going ahead with the proposal, tbe duty should be removed a-t the earliest possible moment. It should, in fact, be removed immediately, because the total amount already collected by this means is sufficient for the payment of a bounty 1 for at least twelve months, if not for a longer period. Eveni f the Tariff Board's report proves the industry to be economic we must face the fact that it will take the manufacturers at least twelve months to commence operations. Should the existing fund not be considered sufficient, we shall have sufficient opportunity to reimpose the duty.

Sir able member simple enough to believe that? that point but I do not intend to do so at the moment. I suggest also that honourable members were not surprised to hear that an officer of the department gave evidence before the Tariff Board that this proposal was not essential for, defence purposes. direction of a Country party Minister who stands for free trade? gave evidence at the invitation of the Tariff Board. not send out written requests to people to give evidence reasonable to assume that the Tariff Board would seek evidence from the Defence Department as to the value of this industry from a defence point of view. Apparently, the defence authorities were not. impressed with the necessity to establish this industry in Australia. But. even if it were necessary for the adequate defence of the Commonwealth, why should the users of motor cars pay for its establishment? To many persons, especially those living in country districts, engines and other parts are still being motor cars are a necessity. Why should such persons have to bear the cost of establishing this industry if it is from the aspect of defence? matter may not be debated on this motion. is unsound. ber's time has expired. The honourable member for Deakin( Mr a motor show, like that which was held Hutchinson) has advanced some remarkable arguments. "" I accept his word that the Minister for Defence( Mr Thorby) informed him, in answer to a question, that the manufacture of motor car engines in Australia was not necessary for the defence of this country; but one does not need to have any great knowledge of warfare to realize that, in the event of war, transport in Australia would depend largely on motor vehicles. In such an emergency, we could not for a possible future need,' encouragement is given to the manufacture of numbers of articles which, at the moment, cannot be produced economically. The apology of the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Perkins) for the Government's inaction does credit to his heart more than to his head; as a member of the Government he believes that it is his duty to stand by his colleagues. He has made the best of a bad case. He has told us that the delay, has been caused by the necessity to refer this matter again to the Tariff Board; but, as the honourable member for Henty( Sir Henry Gullett) told us, it has been before that body for about two years. Indeed, the Tariff Board has submitted a report, but it has been asked to give the subject further consideration. I do not say that there is anything suspicious about this matter, but I should like to know why we cannot obtain a copy of that report. We all know that, ever since the protectionist policy was put into operation, the big importing interests in this country have used their influence to discourage the manufacture of anything in Australia that they were importing. Although General Motors-Holdens Limited and other concerns manufacture motor car bodies in Australia, motor car imported. When he was Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties the honourable member for Henty said that about 80 per cent, of every motor That car in Australia was of Australian manufacture. about 80 per cent, of the cost represented Australian industry and profit. in Melbourne recently, to realize the capacity and versatility of Australian workmen.

The Acting Minister said that in the absence of data, the Government had not yet made up its mind on this subject. It is therefore interesting to recall what the then Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties said when he introduced his proposals on the 22nd May, 1936. He told the HouseThe Government anticipates that satisfactory importance, namely, the failure of the engine production can be commenced within two years, and that within five or six years Australia should bo producing SO per cent, of its engine requirements. Not one member of this House would say that the Minister was deceiving himself when he spoke in that way. He spoke for the Government of which he was a member. The honourable gentleman has crossed swords with honourable members on this side of the House on many occasions, but no one will deny his ability to complete a task which he has undertaken. The trade diversion policy inaugurated by the honourable gentleman has been severely criticized, but I have seen nothing to supplant it. It was introduced because of the necessity to do something to adjust the balance of trade between Australia and countries which, while exporting goods of considerable value to Australia, bought little from us in return. on to sayAt this stage, I do not propose to exhaust the House with excessive details, as these can be announced from time to time as progress is made. I now ask whether there has been any report as to the progress made. We have heard nothing. Indeed, the Government would have remained dumb had not this motion been moved this afternoon. Where is the Tariff Board's report? If I were of a suspicious nature, I should say that the reason it has not been produced is that the Government has something to posals introduced by the then Minister hide. In the speech to which I have directing negotiations for trade treaties referred, the Minister also saidImportant decisions have been made by the Government with the object of increasing our of a session when no opportunity for full exports of primary produce, expanding seconconsideration of them existed. dary industry, and bringing about a considerable increase of rural and industrial development. will not continue to remind honourable members of the terms of the motion under discussion. Had those terms not been definite, the motion would not have been allowed. I ask honourable members to confine their remarks to the motion. Mr Speaker. I must have put a wrong interpretation on the motion before the House. The purpose of the motion is to discuss a definite matter of urgent public Government to encourage the manufacture in Australia of motor car chassis, &c, in accordance with the policy enunciated by the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties ( Sir Henry Gullett) on the 22nd May, 1936. I was attempting to describe the policy enunciated by the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties, with a view to showing that the Government had failed to carry it out. The Minister pointed out the importance of the industry to Australia, and stated that the diversion of the manufacture of motor chassis to this country would represent a value of over £4.000,000 per annum. There is no justification for the delay which has occurred. Over two years ago we were promised that in 1938 the production, of motor car chassis in Australia would reach 5,000 units, but the truth is that not one unit will be manufactured here during this year. Indeed, the Acting Minister's remarks showed clearly that no effort will be made to proceed with the manufacture of motor car chassis in this country. The Government is faced with an adverse trade balance of £12.000,000. Were this industry producing motor car chassis to the value of £4,000,000 a year, not only would it be unnecessary to send that money out of the country, but in addition, large numbers of Australian workmen would be employed, thereby helping to keep this country solvent.

109,Sir Henry Gullett,"That is not so.22nd May, and the session ended on the 11th December. the proposals were not discussed by Parliament until long after they had been introduced. The honourable gentleman had succeeded in impressing his colleagues in the Ministry with the desirability of manufacturing motor car chassis in Australia, but he submitted an ill-digested scheme. [Quorum formed.] The Minister remained in office about two and a half years, but was unable to find any manufacturers who were ready and willing to commence the manufacture of motor car engines in Australia, even on the attractive terms offered. At the end of that period the Minister retired from the Government with his ambitions unrealized, and he left the Government to carry the baby that he brought to the Cabinet door. The Government sought to give the youngster a decent burial by sending it to the Tariff Board, and I am inclined to think it would be pleased if the scheme did not reappear. for Perth has heard something that the House has not been told. We want, the facts. that when the Tariff Board report appears, if it over does, it will state that this is one of the uneconomic industries that should never be established in Australia. on which to base the daily motion for the adjournment of the House, the Labor party seized on the manufacture of motor car engines. By trying to resurrect the dead it tried to perform a miracle that could not be performed. The subject of defence has been mentioned rather freely, t am not surprised that the representatives of the Defence Department have reported that the manufacture of motor car engines is unnecessary for the purpose of defence. We have in Australia to-day sufficient motor vehicle engines to meet requirements for three or four years, and there was a similar state of affairs when the slump occurred. The slump caused a suspension of importations, and it became obvious that there were more motor cars than we required. I believe that if a war came the first thing the Government would do would be to put an embargo on the importation of motor cars. Therefore, I do not attach any importance to the argument about defence. What we do require for defence are aeroplane engines. cuss that matter on this motion. being manufactured by the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation at Port Melbourne. One point that is worth mentioning is the .7d. duty imposed on motor car chassis. About a month ago I asked the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Perkins) how long it was intended to keep the duty on. The reply I received was that the Government was waiting to peruse the report of the Tariff Board. That is not satisfactory. I feel that the Government is not at all enthusiastic about putting the proposal into practice, because it knows the effect of giving a monopoly to the manufacturers of motor bodies. Something like £1,000,000 a year profit has been made by a manufacturing company, and motor users are paying about three time3 more than they would pay for similar bodies in other parts of the world. If a similar monopoly were given to manufacturers of engines the public would be I feel quite confident charged still more for motor vehicles. believe that the Government has definitely failed to give satisfaction in connection Being in need of a subject with tlie development of the motor chassis and engine industry in Australia. It is carrying out a contradictory policy, and that has created difficulties in giving effect to the original intention. It was on the 22nd May, 1936, that the Government brought down a proposal to place a special duty on motor chassis with a view to encouraging the manufacture in Australia of engines, chassis, and accessories. For the twelve months ended the 30th June, 1935, 54,499 cars valued at over £4,097,000 were imported. For the twelve months ended the 30th April, 1936, immediately preceding the imposition of the special duty, the importations were 72,818 cars, valued at £5,329,000. The Government has not attempted to stem the tendency for importatations to increase, as later figures show. For the twelve months ended the 30th June, 1937, importations were 78,500 cars",32,Henby Gullett I S The Honor Import Them I N Order To Make Provision

115,Mr Clark (Darling) [4.55],"1 .of a value of £5,592,000. More recent figures for tbe nine months ended March of this year show an increase of importations, compared with the same period of the previous year, amounting to £1,626,000. The increase is continuously going on. I received statistics to-day for the ten months ended the 30th April, 1938. The value of importations in that period was £6,769,666. Those figures show an increase of about £1,440,000 over the twelve months preceding the date when the Government brought down its policy. The importations for the concluding two months of the present financial year can be estimated at over £1,000,000, which means an increase of about £2,500,000 for this financial year, as compared with the twelve months immediately preceding May, 1936. These figures show that the Government has definitely failed to encourage the manufacture of motor cars in this country, but has facilitated an increase of importations. Tho volume of imports indicates that the industry could be profitably established in Australia. For the twelve months ended the 30th April, 1935, 54,500 motor chassis were imported, and for the same period of 1937, 73,500. Of motor bodies-whic h are manufactured in this country-im portations for the first of those periods were 2,300 bodies, and for the second period a little over 900 bodies. The motor-body industry has been established because of the protection given by the import duty,, and to-day, despite the greatly increased number of new cars, the industry is quite competently meeting the demand. The policy of the Government is contradictory. The policy of granting special bounties has been countered by the action taken to license the importation of certain chassis. As the result, firms selling those chassis have a complete monopoly, their quotas being based on their previous importations. It is not desirable for them, from a business point of view, to undertake the manufacture of motor cars, because they have a field preserved to them by their previous importations. Under the present system of licensing, a new brand of car cannot be imported because tliere is nothing upon which to base a quota. The method is entirely wrong. It encourages the importation of cars by those firms [Ml which already have an advantage. General Motors Corporation and the Ford Company arc not likely to undertake the manufacture of motor cars in Australia, because they already have enormous advantages. The honourable member for Perth( Mr Nairn) said that the Government had successfully buried its policy. I do not believe that the policy should be buried without reference to Parliament. I believe that companies should be forced to establish manufacturing plants in this country. The Tariff Board, I understand, is inquiring into this matter now. It was stated by the honourable member for Perth that the referring of the matter over and over again to the Tariff Board was a means of burying the proposal. I hope that that is not so. I do not know whether he is speaking with any inside knowledge or on behalf of the Government; but, if he is, he has made a sinister admission, because the Tariff Board should not be used for this purpose. Ill-feeling between this country and other countries was created when the policy was first enunciated. That has to a large extent now been smoothed away, but the Government, has not done its duty. Import figures show that there is an increasing market for motor vehicles in Australia, and if their manufacture were embarked upon in this country there would be widespread benefit. The motion for the adjournment of the House is to allow the discussion of, The failure of the Government to encourage the manufacture in Australia of motor car chassis, &c, in accordance with the policy enunciated by the Minister directing negotiations for Trade Treaties( Sir Henry Gullett) on the 22nd May, 193C. I direct the attention of the House to the fact that the policy enunciated by the honourable member for"" Henty had certain qualifications. The honourable member when he espoused the cause of the Government did so by taking into consideration the fact that the Tariff Board would have to inquire into the economic possibilities of the industry. This undertaking was extracted from the Minister by the then honourable member for Indi( Mr Hutchinson), now the honourable member for Deakin, and also by the honourable member for Parkes( Sir",33,Henby Gullett I S The Honor Import Them I N Order To Make Provision
116,Mr Harrison (Wentworth) [5.6],"Charles Marr), both of whom asked the Minister specific questions and wrung from him the reply that the proposal would he proceeded with only if the Government were satisfied that it would be economic to do so. Replying to the then honourable member for Indi as the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties ( Sir Henry Gullett) saidThe reference of this matter to the Tariff Board is undoubtedly a venture, but I give the committee my assurance at this stage that if the Tariff Board itself, after an Inquiry, arrives at the conclusion that I am totally wrong, and that this industry would be uneconomic and expensive, I shall be finished with the proposal. In that regard I speak for the Government. It will not proceed with the expansion of this industry if the Tariff Board declares . that it will be uneconomic. The honourable member for Henty in his speech this afternoon answered his own argument when he said that from the moment that the matter was submitted to the Tariff Board, the Government had failed to proceed with the project. Debate interrupted under Standing Order 257B. In Committee: Consideration resumed from the 7th June (vide page 1905). Clause 18Persons, not having attained the maximum age, shall, subject to this act, be insured, under and in accordance with this act as voluntary contributors, if (a) they have been employed, and insured as employed contributors, for a period, whether continuous or not, of not less than one hundred and four weeks since their last entry into insurance; (6) they have ceased to be employed; (o) they have given notice as prescribed that they desire to become voluntary contributors; and (d) they have paid contributions in accordance with this act. [5.10] -This is a fundamental clause because it deals with the insurance of voluntary contributors. I am opposed to it in its present form, and wish to amend it with a view to making it less sectional than it is at the moment by making it possible for a great many more people to come within its scope than is now possible. That is my wish, but I am not sanguine as to my chances of the Chair accepting the amendment which I have circulated. As a matter of fact, I can already feel the sharpness of the axe on the back of my neck. Before the axe falls, however, I desire to direct the attention of the committee to the fact that, if this clause is allowed to stand as printed, thousands of people who are just as much entitled to enjoy voluntarily the benefits of health insurance as other persons now covered by the clause, will be excluded. The people I have in mind cannot become compulsory contributors, but I see no justice in preventing them from becoming voluntary contributors. I refer amongst others to the thousands of self-employed persons who do not average the maximum wage limit fixed under this bill-smal l shopkeepers, small .contractors, small farmers, and those people engaged in viticultural and horticultural pursuits on a contract basis. In the rural industries there are thousands of persons who are never employed directly and never work for .a fixed wage. All of those people will he excluded. There is a greater percentage of that class of work in the rural industries even than in the city industries, and accordingly what I am about to put before the committee should appeal to members of the Country party as well a3 to honourable members who represent city constituencies. This clause readsPersons, not having attained the maximum age, shall, subject to this act, be insured, under and in accordance with this act as voluntary contributors, if {a) they have been employed, and insured as employed contributors, for a period, whether continuous or not, of not less than one hundred and four weeks since their last entry into insurance; (6) they havo ceased to be employed; (o) they have given notice as prescribed that they desire to become voluntary contributors; and ((2) they have paid contributions in accordance with this act. Paragraphs c and d would permit the people whom I have in mind becoming members of the insurance scheme on a voluntary basis, but paragraphs a and 6 exclude them because it is impossible for them to comply with their provisions. A great deal of the opposition to this bill",34,Henby Gullett I S The Honor Import Them I N Order To Make Provision

The clause should be postponed so that it can be redrafted in order to cover the persons referred to by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. What the honourable member has said assists my argument. The small farmer or business man and other classes of self-employed persons are not in the category of eligible persons, though their incomes, in many instances, may not equal that of the ordinary worker in industry. I know of no valid reason why they should be prevented from becoming voluntary contributors. The Treasurer has not advanced adequate reasons for his objection to the amendment. that category have full coverage? titled to full coverage if , as employed persons, they had made 104 contributions. I am not convinced by the statements of the Treasurer relating to the exclusion of small farmers, to whom members of the Country party referred at great length in the second-reading debate. Nor should the casual worker be debarred from the privileges of the scheme. Large numbers of men engaged in various occupations in country districts, such as mail contracts and other kinds of Belf-employment, are taxpayers, and although their incomes may not exceed that of an employed person, their requirements in respect of sickness, disablement or pensions are not less; therefore, they should not be excluded. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports has request, which should receive the support of the committee. The Treasurer has told us that later he proposes to introduce a scheme of an entirely voluntary character, which will cover all those classes of persons who are excluded from this proposal. I believe, however, that if such a thing is to be done it should be done at once. Therefore I support the amendment. Unless the Treasurer can convince me that the request is not practicable, I urge honourable members to vote compulsory for it. We may then discover the real reason for the exclusion of these classes of persons. I should like the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) to define the position of relief or intermittent workers, whose claim for inclusion was stressed by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway). The honourable gentleman has told us that if employees in this category wish to become voluntary contributors they must have been insured as employees for two years, and have made not less than 104 contributions. need not be continuous. where, in the bill, is the provision relating to persons on relief works? the first schedule. work two weeks in five, or one week in three, so their employment cannot be termed regular. excluded from the scheme. included ? member for Melbourne Ports realizes the clanger of their exclusion altogether, and he asks the committee to postpone consideration of the clause in order that provision may be made for them. honourable gentleman is that we cannot embrace the whole bill in one clause. that, and if the Treasurer will give me an assurance that these people are covered made a very reasonable by the scheme, part, at least, of my objection to the clause will be removed. honourable member is important, but it is not relevant to this clause.

144,Mr Casey,"The point made by thtbe ample opportunity to deal with the matter when the Committee is considering the first schedule. will come when the Treasurer brings down the next bill. what the Treasurer means. There appears to. be some doubt as to whether relief workers can be included in the scheme as voluntary contributors. ' I wish that doubt to be removed. contributions they certainly may be included. relief workers will be greybeards before they are able to make 104 contributions. The fact that these people are prepared to pay voluntarily the double contribution is an earnest of their desire to pardifferent, the class of life to be insured ticipate in the benefits of the scheme and I fail to understand why the Government is so niggardly as to refuse their request. As has been pointed out by the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) they ""contribute to the general revenue as taxpayers and they are entitled to consideration. In the debate on the second reading members of the Country party protested loudly against the exclusion of small farmers and other self-employed persons in rural districts. Are they now prepared to vote foT the amendment? If they do not they will close the door and the people on whose behalf they have said so much will be excluded from the scheme. The majority live in sparsely populated districts and have not an opportunity to join a friendly society. Therefore their claim to be included in this national insurance proposal is irresistible. The same may be said of relief workers. Unless all these categories are embraced in the scheme it will not be national in character. The only way to make sure that they will participate in its benefits is to vote for the amendment. If it is carried it will be an instruction to the Government to redraft the clanse to nice; the wishes of the committee. 15.4S| -The honourable member for West unemployed or self-employed persons, Sydney( Mr Beasley) has urged that the whose needs are to be provided for in clause should be widened to include selfdue course. em ployed persons such as small farmers and others; the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway) has declared it should be widened to include casual workers, and the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) has contended that it should make provision for the unemployed relief workers and others whose employment is intermittent. An approach to a subject of this character necessarily involve' fi broad classification with certain classes and types of the people who might be covered by national insurance. The most readily classifiable type of person is the person who is employed. Unemployed persons and small farmers fall within another class. Eor obvious reasons, it would be extremely injudicious not to provide separate schemes of insurance for these distinct classes. Their modes of living and their needs are differs, while the incidence of illness among insured persons affects people of these different classes in various ways. When a small farmer, for instance, becomes ill for a few weeks, he does not suffer financially to the same degree as an employee, because his business goes on while he is ill. His illness may result in a slight increase of the cost of the management of his business, but he does not lose so heavily as a man who has to leave his employment on account of illness. Only by providing separate schemes for broadly classifiable groups can the scheme be freed from intolerable anomalies from the administrative point of view and from the point of view of the persons to be insured. The acceptance of amendments, such as that moved by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway), would set up a disequilibrium in this measure which would render its proper administration impossible. Therefore, I urge honourable members of the Opposition to exercise a little patience, and realize that persons of the class which the Government proposes to insure under the bill are readily classifiable and require this kind of insurance; not the",38,Nation Al Health And Pensions Insurance Bill 1938

149,Mr John Lawson (Macquarie) Kind Which Would Have To Be Provided For,"The honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr John Lawson) contends that it is wrong to include any voluntarily insurable person under this scheme, because this bill is only a first instalment, and a .separate scheme is to be introduced later for voluntary contributors. But this clause implies that if a person has been employed for two years consecutively, has paid contributions for 104 weeks, and has become a small farmer or self-employed worker or shopkeeper, he may then continue as a voluntary contributor under this scheme, in which it is argued that it is undesirable that there should be mixed classes of insured persons. If , on the other hand, a person has been a self-employed worker for 104 consecutive weeks, he cannot be insured under this scheme. It is' only when he ceases to have economic independence and hc>'ic mes a worker for wages in a factory that he acquires the status necessary to qualify him to come under the scheme. Then, having acquired that status by becoming a member of the proletarian class, if he happens to have been continuously employed for 104 weeks and again becomes a self-employed worker, he receives what he did not have before-the right to become a voluntary contributor. gentieman deny him that? ( Mr Casey) and those who support him are the exclusionists. Honourable members of the Opposition realize that the easiest class to insure is that composed of employees. After an employee has been insured for 104 weeks, he can, by meeting the total liability, become a voluntary contributor. The honourable Holloway) contends that if an insured person pays his own contribution and that which in otoher circumstances might have been paid by . an employer, he should be treated in the same way as a person for whom the same contribution is made from two distinct sources. No actuarial problem arises in. this matter. It is true that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports seeks to extend the scope of the bill in its application to insured persons, but I understand that the Government has already promised the members of the Country party that it will introduce a system of voluntary insurance, so that self-employed workers, small farmers and shopkeepers may participatein the benefits of this national schemeThat, I understand, is the price of those honourable members who support the bill. I put it to them that now is the time forthem to show that they are in earnest. only a device. that the Opposition is inviting the committee to do what it understands the Government has undertaken to do, he is quite right. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports suggested a formula, and, because it was ruled out of order, he has moved for the postponement of this clause as an instruction to the Treasurer to give effect to his suggestion. I understand that the Treasurer has undertaken to do this in a different way at another time. He says that his object is to avoid anomalies, but anomalies are already present in the bill, and nothing he can do by resisting the proposal of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports will remove them. Instead of eliminating anomalies, the Treasurer is providing an incubator in which they seem to be multiplying amazingly. matta) [6.2] -This bill contemplates the provision of medical attention and certain other forms of security for 1,850,000 persons who possess the qualifier!: ion of being employees.

The British Medical Association has lately proposed that the scheme should be further extended to embrace still another 20,000,000 residents of Great Britain. Sir Henry Brackenbury, a past president of the British Medical Association, whose services were recently made available to the New Zealand Government, has suggested that New Zealand should not confine its scheme to employees. In the National Insurance Bill which was submitted to this Parliament in 192S, provision wa3 made for the inclusion of contributors other than employees. These persons have as much right to the protection contemplated in the measure as have their fellow-citizens who are to be included, but I do not intend to wreck this bill. I should be prepared to take a very definite stand regarding this clause, were it not for the fact that at an early stage another measure will be introduced to extend the benefits of insurance to persons of the class particularly mentioned this afternoon. I hope that the time taken to promulgate the second measure will not he so long as that occupied in preparing the bill now before us. support the amendment submitted by the honourable Ports( Mr Holloway). distinction should be made in connection with the benefits to be conferred under this bill. I hope that the Treasurer will take into consideration the suggestions of honourable members on this side . of the House for the improvement of the bill. It does not seem right that a person, cretion of the Chair. merely because he has been employed for less than the stipulated period of two years, should not be allowed to participate in the benefits of the scheme. Those persons who most need the benefits which the scheme has to offer, and who are most likely to require medical attention, will he excluded. I trust that Government supporters who have spoken in favour of the inclusion of self-employed persons will now vote for the amendment. A few days ago the honourable member for Parramatta ( Sir Frederick Stewart) said that the bill did not provide all the benefits which he thought it should, and that it excluded many people who, in his opinion, should be included. He was prepared, he said, to co-operate with other honourable members in attempts to have the bill amended in the directions he thought desirable. This afternoon, however, he said that he was not prepared to kill the bill by voting for the inclusion of those persons whom the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway) proposes to include. The utterances of the honourable member for Parramatta are most inconsistent. In fact, his behaviour, ever since he has been an honourable member of this House, has been full of inconsistencies. ,1 trust that his conscience will prick him into voting for the amendment now before the Chair. Honourable members of the Country party have spoken strongly in favour of the inclusion of small farmers, but now it appears that they, too, are reluctant to kill the bill. Evidently, they would rather the farmers were killed. The honourable member for Parramatta has always boasted of his interest in the workers, and of his desire to help them, but the fact is that never, since he has been an honourable member of this House, has he ever done anything to help them.

161,Mr Anthony,"Members of theThis is one of the most important clausos in the bill. While I believe that the scheme is not so wide as it should be, 1 do not wish to delay the hill because I am anxious to see placed on the statute-book legislation which will be beneficial to large sections of the community. I feel that the people whom I represent are not getting the deal to which they are entitled, but I believe that volunof dependants, or persons getting tary contributors should be included, not in this bill, but in a supplementary measure. Sitting suspended from 6.15 till S p.m. Honourable members opposite contend that members of the Country party are obliged to support the proposed postponement of the clause because of certain action which we took at an earlier stage of the measure. That is not so. One must consider what is the alternative to this particular provision, and whether any amendment of it would affect the bill as a whole or the interests of that section of the community which members of the Country party are considered particularly to represent. I claim to represent not only the primary producers but also a very large section of the rest of the community; in fact, to the limit of my ability as a parliamentarian, I claim to represent all sections in the electorate of Eichmond. The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr me. I am merely endeavouring to help Beasley) said that the only change which would be involved in permitting persons voluntarily to come under the scheme would be that instead of an employer having to pay a contribution in respect of voluntary contributions those persons themselves would make a double contribution. At first glance that contention seems to be feasible, but on examining the measure one finds that it does not represent the position at all. If this scheme were made semi-compulsory and semivoluntary, its whole basis would be destroyed, for the reason that in respect of a compulsory scheme for employees, the actuaries know to within a reasonable measure of certainty just what the ages of the particular groups embraced in it would be. They know also how many of such persons are single, and how many are married, and on that definite information are able to arrange a basis of contributions, which shall govern the benefits payable. If a person were permitted to come under this scheme voluntarily, the likelihood would be that instead of getting an average risk oyer the whole of the community we should get a large proportion of those knownin insurance as the worse risks, such asfamily men with varying numbers well up to the age limit. It would be of vast advantage to such people to come in but the young person of sixteen, or the single person would probably stay out; ultimately a position would be created whereby the benefits which it is at present proposed to confer upon those already embraced in the scheme would be reduced. A voluntarycum-compulsory scheme would reduce the beuefits available for the working community. One of the most important factors in a scheme of this kind is that it should be on an absolutely sound basis so that persons who become contributors in their youth, should, after paying into the fund for 40 or 50 years, be certain that when they reach 60 years of age they will receive the benefits promised to them when they entered the scheme. the honourable member during dinner hour. members of the Opposition to secure a measure which will meet the requirements of that section of the community which they claim to represent. Tn spite of the objections which .1 have to some features of this scheme-and they are very strong objectionsI submit that the responsibility rests on every honourable member to endeavour to make this scheme as sound as possible. The inclusion of voluntary contributors as suggested by honourable members opposite would undermine the very fabric of the bill. A responsibility rests on every honourable member to ensure that persons who come under the scheme in youth shall be guaranteed certain benefits on reaching old. age; that widows and orphans, for instance, shall be assured of those benefits for which the bread-winners have contributed.

164,Mr Anthony,"Nobody has got at the inclusion of a considerable section of persons who are a bad insurance risk, the possibility of carrying through that guarantee in its entirety will be diminished. The views which I have expressed are not only those which I personally hold, but are also supported by the experience of other countries with their Other have a combined voluntary and compulsory scheme. In 1930, France adopted a scheme very similar to this, the original act including a provision similar to that which honourable members opposite wish to insert in this bill in order to enable a person to come under the scheme as a voluntary contributor. In his book, -Security Against Sickness, published in 1-930, I . S. Falk, saysUntil recently, the law permitted self-einJrioyed persons (and those who had been insured under the compulsory provisions but who became self-employed) to take out insurance voluntarily, provided they were French citizens under GO years of age, and their income was not in excess of the maximum specified in the law. These persons could insure for any or all risks covered in the law except that their total contributions could not exceed 10 per cent, of income. Persons who had been compulsorily insured but whoso incomes had come to be in excess of the statutory limit had been permitted to insure voluntarily against all risks if their wages did not exceed the statutory limit by more than 2,000 francs. The insurance rates for voluntary subscribcre were higher than for compulsory subscribers; there were no employers to divide contributions with them and their premiums were set higher in order to afford the societies linancial protection against an excessive proportion of bad risks. This voluntary insurance, practised since 1030, was ended for non-agricultural workers by the decree-law of the 28th October, 1035. Thus, in spite of the safeguards provided in the French law, voluntary insurance in conjunction with compulsory insurance was abandoned by France. man knows that the clause as drawn does not satisfy the stipulations set out in the recital of the French experience. hill does not satisfy my stipulations, but I am endeavouring, at least, to see that the persons covered by this scheme w ill be assured of certain benefits for many years to come. I believe, also, that if the proposed amendment were accepted, it would destroy any possibility of a voluntary scheme such as the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) has promised to introduce at a later date. It is not possible to combine voluntary and compulsory contributors in the. one scheme. However, as much necessocial insurance legislation sity exists for the protection of that large countries, notably France, section including small employers and endeavoured to introduce the self-employed as for the protection of the wage-earning section of the community, and it is the duty of the Government, therefore, to bring down a scheme which will not only cover those people, but will also be based on a rate of contribution low enough to enable them to come within it. member's time has expired. As no other honourable member has risen, he may take his second period now. needed to cover self-employed persons, embracing small farmers and shopkeepers, as much as any other section of the community, but I cannot sec how such a scheme could be linked up with one of this kind, which is designed primarily to cover wage-earners. AlthoughI shall support this clause, I reserve the right to determine at a later stage whether that very large section of the community not covered ""by this scheme is being entirely neglected for the benefit of other sections. I am opposed to voluntary contributors being included in this scheme. but only because the experience of actuaries has shown that they are only a negligible proportion of the number embraced, and also because they have been a part of the wage-earning community; consequently, they constitute a spread risk. It is the duty of the Government to indicate just what are the terms of the supplementary scheme which it proposes to introduce; in fact, the supplementary scheme should have been brought down simultaneously with this, so that honorQ u it e a .lot in this able members would have been enabled to examine both schemes side by side.

Australia will not be satisfied with the assurance of the Treasurer that, in due course, another bill will Australian Government is to do. I want be introduced to rectify the anomaly created by clause IS, in that it excludes many thousands of Australians from what is called a national .insurance scheme. There are 369,000 self-employed persons in Australia who, although equally as worthy of insurance benefits as are others for whom provision is made, are not included in this scheme. In addition, 270,000 employers, many of whom do not earn the basic wage, are excluded. ""Were it not so tragic, it would be amusing to hear honourable members opposite plead for the exercise of patience, pending the introduction of another measure. What the people want is justice, not patience. I say emphatically that if it be possible at this stage to insure 1,850,000 persons, it should be possible to insure an additional 576,000 persons, who are now definitely excluded from the scheme. Throughout Australia there are thousands of unemployed and unemployable persons, as well as small farmers, shopkeepers and others, who believe that they will be covered by this measure. If the suggestion to include them be not accepted, they will be greatly disappointed. Do honourable members opposite think that the small farmers, shopkeepers and other self-employed persons in the community will be satisfied with the promise that, if they exercise patience, they will eventually be treated as other citizens are to be treated forthwith? I see no reason for any distinction between the different classes of people. Although now definitely excluded from the scheme, possibly one of the most worthy sections of the community are the 40,000 men and women who in the last census returns were classified as helpers. They are people who, without fee or reward, work in their homes, on farms, in shops and other places in order to help others. They are definitely excluded. Are they to exercise patience while being treated as inferior to other persons who are definitely included in the Government's scheme? I listened to the riddle of the honourable The member for Richmond( Mr Anthony), who told us of tlie practice and experience of other countries in national insurance.

198,Mr Mccall (Martin) [8.32],"I amscope of the bill. The Treasurer has not advanced any cogent reasons in support of i hat contention. I do not agree with the honourable member for Richmond( Mr party, on this side of the House, on behalf Anthony) that the inclusion of self-employed persons would make the bill actuarially unsound. It is very easy for an honourable member to say that this or that would make the bill actuarially unsound, but why would it do so? What evidenco has the honourable member for Richmond or the Treasurer this alteration will have that effect? A suggestion has been made that if the bill be amended in the direction desired, it will have to be scrapped. If it is so absolutely impossible to include self-employed persons, I want to know why it was not thought to be impossible by Sir Earle 3?age, when he introduced a national insurance scheme in this House some years ago? Clause 42 of the bill presented at that time statedAiry person of the age of sixteen years and upwards but under the age of forty-five years who is not employed within the meaning of this act, .but who is engaged in some regular employment on whicli he is wholly or mainly dependent aud whose total income did not in the preceding twelve months exceed four hundred and sixteen pounds shall be entitled to become a voluntary contributor under this act, and to receive the benefits conferred by this act, upon such terms aud conditions as are prescribed. Werei t a question of avoiding actuarial disequilibrium, I can see no reason why a higher maximum income limit than that already applied to compulsory contributors should not be applied to voluntary contributors. The clause goes on to sayProvided that in the case of applications for ment; also ambulance service;-whic h is admisHion to voluntary insurance received by approved societies and notified to the board within twelve mouths after the commencement of this act, the rate of contribution payable by the insured person shall be 2s. per week in the case of a man and Is. per week in the case of a woman. If that was possible then, it is possible now. The bill from which I have quoted was compiled on the advice of the most expert persons available at that timeactuaries and leading economists of the day. years ago. if it was ten years, or even 50 years ago, the principle is the same. The bill was introduced by the Deputy Prime Minister, who was also Leader of the Country of a government of the same political complexion as that which I support to-day. The honourable member for Richmond said that if self-employed persons were brought into the scheme, a great burden would be placed on the fund, because a large proportion of them that would be bad risks. I submit that they will pay for what they receive. is sixteen years of age. sixteen years of age, the honourable member did not tell the committee how the scheme would be actuarially upset by the inclusion of these voluntary contributors. I desire to contrast the position of a selfemployed person under this scheme with the position of an employed person. The bill, to some extent, may be termed an employees' scheme, but it is pleasing to have the assurance that the Government does not propose to stop at that. I am .glad for a number of reasons. As an example, consider a self-employed person in a small business. In no State does he receive tbe benefits provided for employed persons by the various workers' compensation acts. The workers of New South Wales receive wide and extensive benefits under the legislation of that State-benefit s which the self-employer does not receive. In cases of total or partial incapacity, the compensation includes weekly payments and the cost of medical and hospital treatnot provided for in the Commonwealth scheme. In the event of the death of a worker, his dependants are entitled to compensation. I could quote many more examples of the benefit the Workers' Compensation Act of New South Wales is to employees as compared with the person who is self-employed. Again, it must be remembered that th« self-employed person is subjected to great fluctuations of income. The great majority of those who would elect to come ten under the bill as voluntary contributors would be those whose occupations are such as would bring about a complete cessation of income in the event of their",45,Nation Al Health And Pensions Insurance Bill 1938

The honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr John Lawson) said that the majority of self-employed persons were not subjected same loss of income as the employed person. To an extent that is correct, but I believe that those voluntary contributors who would elect to come under the scheme and pay a considerable sum of money would be that section of self-employed persons who would suffer a if incapacitated. We ought also to he given an indication whether, in the supplementary bill which is promised, the benefits and contributions of self-employers will be those prescribed in the present bill. We have had no indication of the conditions under which the self-employed person will be allowed to come under the scheme. I am far from convinced that the difficulties in the way of the inclusion of selfemployed persons in .this bill are insuperable. immutable! Surely some means can be improvised to permit these people to enter! I should be pleased if the Treasurer, in his reply, would set out the reasons why self-employed persons cannot be brought under the scheme. The Government has accepted the principle that they should be covered by the scheme, and, therefore, I ask him to give categorical evidence of why they cannot be included in this measure. support the amendment moved hy the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway). I have heard it said that certain sections in the House have been promised that the things they have complained about will be rectified by a bill to be introduced later. As I am on the "" outer "" at the moment, as far as my Country party friends are concerned, I have not been officially approached. I am not prepared, therefore, to accept promises of that sort. I do not question the sincerity of the Government, but there are possible obstacles in the way of the implementation of that promise. I doubt, for instance, whether it would be possible for a supplementary bill to be passed during this period of the session, and after the 30th June there will be a new Senate. Therein lies the danger. It is not necessarily the function of the Opposition, with a majority in the Senate, to support the to the proposals of the Government, meritorious though they might be. If members of the Country party, who, during the second-reading debate, attacked the omission from this bill of small farmers and the like, were sincere, this is their opportunity to stand up for the principles that they enunciated. I have complete cessation of income other objections to the bill, but this is the they were ill or otherwise particular point that 1 wished to make. I feel that I should be unfaithful to the trust reposed in mc, and that I should not be squaring with my previous attitude on this bill if I did not support with my similar to vote the amendment moved by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. I rise to oppose the amendment. I do that with certain qualifications. With other honourable members on this side of the committee, I have already made to the Ministry Surely the bill is not representations of a somewhat similar nature to those which the Opposition is making at the moment, and I suspect that the assurance given to us is what has caused < the suggestions that have -been made by the Opposition. The Opposition realizes that ministerial supporters have stolen their thunder and, for political reasons, they feel it necessary to make a demonstration. The suggestions made by honourable members opposite have been very helpful, so helpful, in fact, that if adopted they would help to wreck the bill. For their purpose, honourable members have selected a clause inserted for the specific purpose of admitting those insured persons who at some time had been compulsorily insured in the scheme, and were entitled by their former contributions to continue their insurance by voluntary payments. There are limitations in the drafting of this measure with which I entirely disagree, and I feel with other honourable members that if this bill were, as it should be, a more national measure, the anomalies now objected to would not appear. This bill, however, is merely the first instalment of the national insurance scheme, and, as such, obviously cannot be comprehensive. I join with the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr John Lawson) in appealing to honourable",46,Nation Al Health And Pensions Insurance Bill 1938
203,Mr Wilson (Wimmera) [8.44],I,47,Nation Al Health And Pensions Insurance Bill 1938
204,Mr Harrison (Wentworth) [8.47].,"members opposite to have patience, and to remember that no first instalment can contain everything that every section of the community would desire. Honourable members who have made suggestions to the Government for the inclusion within the scope of the bill of self-employed persons, such as small shopkeepers and small farmers, cannot appreciate the problem that the Government would have in policing such a provision. Not one suggestion as to how it could be policed has been made by honourable members of the Opposition. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway) has indicated that he wants clause 18 postponed as a direction to the Government to do a certain thing. The honourable member, in expressing his desire, has not said, "" This is an easy matter, because you can do it by adopting this or that principle"". He says, "" We want this done, and we do not care how you do it, or if the bill is held up indefinitely"". Something more concrete must be presented before the committee can take his suggestion into serious consideration. The very matter that he has raised is being considered at the moment by the Government, which proposes to explore the possibility of bringing the several sections farmers, whom, the honourable member is of the community referred to under one comprehensive supplementary plan, not associated with the compulsory scheme, provided for in this measure. I am prepared to accept the Government's assurances, and my support is given on the assumption that those assurances will be honoured. If the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) is not prepared to carry out the assurance to the House that within a reasonable time the supplementary bill will be introduced, honourable members may have to consider their position. I do not desire unduly to stress my reasons for the appeal I made in my second-reading speech, that the Government should make this scheme more national in its scope. able members are fully aware that this bill is not intended to cover all sections of the community. If honourable members opposite can put forward some cut-anddried scheme which will help the Government to implement the policy whicli they are now advancing, the Government will be very thankful to them for their help and, no doubt, will be prepared to hasten the legislation. I am prepared to accept the assurance of the Government that a further bill will be brought down, but I deplore the fact that the incidence and the coverage of this bill cause anomalies that invite criticism. strange to hear ministerial supporters devote half of the time occupied by their speeches in committee to apologies for the speeches that they made on the second reading. I was not aware that we had in this chamber such a fine acrobat as the honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony). When he made his second reading speech the honourable gentleman made the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) shudder. Glowering savagely at him, the honourable member for Richmond, who, like myself, has a great number of small farmers in his constituency, declared, "" I shall support the second reading, but you will have to bring down a bill to provide for the small farmers. Do something for them!"" Yet to-night he made a complete somersault and the savagery which had characterized his second-reading speech had given way to happiness, despite the fact that the Government has completely forgotten to assist the small pledged to support. I , however, am not concerned as to what honourable members opposite do; I am here to represent the small farmers, of whom I have many among my constituents. Those people who employ two nr three hands are, as the result of the poor returns from the fruit crops of the last three or four years, living on a pittance. They will have to contribute to the national insurance fund in respectof their employees, but they themselves will not be able to enjoy any benefit from the scheme, although their circumstances demand they should. All honorThe small saw-millers in my electorate are in the same plight. They are making little more than the basic wage themselves, but while they will have to contribute to the fund for their employees, they will not be able to contribute for benefits for themselves. Another class of persons, of whom there are thousands in Australia, who have been overlooked are the daughters in large families who sacrifice themselves and",47,Nation Al Health And Pensions Insurance Bill 1938
205,Mr Frost (Franklin) [8.57],"It isremain single in order to care for their ageing parents. I remind the committee that the property clauses of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act operated harshly on those self-sacrificing persons; they are beirig treated just as harshly now. I concede that 'when the parents die, the girl who cared for them generally inherits a small home, but she is left with no means of sustenance. She cannot get a pension because she has not been employed, and must go out in the cold world in search of a livelihood. Fishermen, small storekeepers and others, who are earning only sufficient to maintain themselves, would welcome some assistance under a scheme such as this. A comprehensive national insuiance scheme would be of great benefit to a majority of the Australian people, but this proposal has been brought forward merely with the object of placing upon the shoulders of the workers the responsibility of finding the money to meet the cost of invalid and old-age pensions. If the members of the Country party wish to assist those whom they represent, they should support the proposal of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. Unfortunately I was absent from the chamber when the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway) gave his reasons for asking the committee to agree to the postponement of this clause; but I heard, the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin), and I think that I am representing his views fairly when I say that the gravamen of his case is that no actuarial problem is involved in the proposal of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. If it can be proved that an actuarial problem is involved, I feel sure that the Leader of the'Opposition, fair-minded and reasonable as he is, will inform his colleagues that they are basing their arguments on wrong premises and suggest that the proposal be withdrawn. I shall prove to the committee that there is an actuarial problem which cannot be. disguised. The main basis of the scheme is. of course, compulsion, and the object of compulsion in all national insurance schemes is to include good and bad risks, and by so doing enable the contributions to be reduced to a reasonably'low level. All employees are being brought under this compulsory scheme so that there shall be a wide spread of risks and so that the contributions shall be small. Unde"" this bill, there is room for a number ol voluntarycontributors, who, as employees, have paid a minimum of 104 contributions. It appears that the number to be included is likely to be relatively small, and that the actuaries have taken that fact into consideration in assessing the rate of contributions. the honourable member for saying that the number will be small? What evidence has he of that? worker is involved, and it is admitted that as the majority of them earn uuder £365 a year they will remain under the scheme. ceased to be employed may become employers, farmers or shopkeepers. fied in the bill arc from sixteen to 65 years, and the average age of those who will come under the scheme will be between 31 and 32 years. If we include any voluntary contributors we have to determine whether the average age of shopkeepers and small farmers will be similar to the average age of those who are to be covered by the bill. It must be admitted that the majority of the voluntary contributors would be between 30 and 50 years of age. Very few would be between 16 and 25 years of age, and therefore we can assume that as the average age would be higher, the actuarial basis of the bill would be seriously interfered with'. persons would be higher amongst the voluntary contributors. have to realize that a voluntary system would not have such a large number of contributors; the experience of friendly societies tells us that. Of the 1,850,000 to come under this bill we have been informed that only 400,000 are voluntary contributors to friendly societies. It is, therefore, fair to assume that possibly only 25 per cent, of the small farmers and small shopkeepers would insure, and this limited number of contributors would be of greater average age than that of the compulsory contributors; this would",48,Nation Al Health And Pensions Insurance Bill 1938

According to the statistics appearing in the Australian Medical Jowi-nal of the 14th May, the average age of contributors to friendly societies is about 41.9, but under this scheme it will be only 31.5. That being so, the sickness rate will be 30 per cent. less. misunderstands the scheme. This bill provides for a longer contributing period than under friendly societies' schemes. the scheme and the amendment perfectly. If we allow a large number of voluntary contributors to be included in this scheme the average age will be higher, the sickness rate will be higher, and the proportion of married men will be greater. In these circumstances I defy any one to disprove my contention that an actuarial problem is involved in the amendment. Tf the proposal of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports be adopted the bill will have to be withdrawn until fresh actuarial calculations have been made. If tlie class mentioned by the honourable member be included, the contributions of the workers will have to be increased, and if that is the aim of the Labour party it is just as well that it should be known. Self-employed, persons and small farmers should be provided for apart from this proposal, and the Government has already given an assurance that that will be done. port the proposal of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway) that the clause be postponed with the object of providing that voluntary contributors who comply with the provisions of paragraphs c and d of this clause may be covered. Honourable members opposite are sheltering under the promise made by the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) and the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons), that another bill will be introduced later in which provision will be made for those whom the honourable member for Melbourne Ports seeks to include in this bill. I cannot understand why the honourable member for Deakin( Mr Hutchinson) should suggest that if the persons whom, we wish to include were covered by this sound. The honourable member endeavoured to show that the average age of the voluntary contributors would be over 30 years, but he failed to take into consideration the children of self-employed men; many of the children would come in at early ages from sixteen years onwards, and they would help to offset the age factor which the honourable member stressed. Why should those who are sheltering themselves behind the promise made by the Treasurer to introduce a supplementary bill, be satisfied that the new bill will be more actuarially sound than would the present bill if amended as we desire? If it is possible to provide for voluntary contributors in another measure, why should they not come under this scheme? The honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) asked how it would be possible to police a voluntary scheme associated with the compulsory scheme. How is it going to be policed under the now bill ? It is logical to assume that, if the Government intends to introduce a new measure to cover those people who are excluded from this scheme, it will make some arrangement to police the scheme. I submit that it is equally possible to do that in this measure. Obviously, those Government supporters who criticized this weakness in the scheme last week are now running to shelter because the Government has intimated, so we understand, that the bill must be passed. The honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) suggested that honourable members of the Opposition are perturbed because Government supporters have taken this matter up, and have cramped their style. I believe the honourable gentleman said that the Government had stolen our thunder. If he will examine the printed amendments circulated by the Opposition he will find that the proposal on this clause was decided upon before any action was taken by Government supporters, so it is logical to assume that pressure was brought to bear upon the Prime Minister by his own supporters. We have adopted the suggestion of the Assistant Minister for Commerce( Mr Archie Cameron), who appealed to honourable members on thiB side to co-operate with the Government.",49,Nation Al Health And Pensions Insurance Bill 1938

215,Mr Barnard (Bass) [9.10],"I supWe are offering constructive criticism of the hill with a view to improving, the scheme. But what do we find? The Treasurer sits back and, apparently, is not prepared to accept any suggestions from this side of the chamber. The Commonwealth Year-Booh shows that there are 2,099,000 persons in the selfemployed group in the Commonwealth. The amendment has been drafted with a view to including not the whole of the people in this category, but at least some of the self-employed as well as those who have been for 104 weeks contributing to the insurance fund as employees. I fail to see how the adoption of the amendment would destroy the actuarial balance of the scheme. I appeal to the Treasurer to give further consideration to the amendment, so that even-handed justice may be meted out to the people. -Had this bill been drafted on a purely national basis, there would not have been occasion for the debate which has taken place this evening. Why those people who will be affected by the amendment were not included and adequately provided for in the bill is beyond my comprehension. I have always been a strong advocate of the inclusion of the small employer and self-employed person, and I was hoping that some amendment would have been submitted to include them. Unfortunately, from an actuarial point of view, the amendment of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr for the simple reason that that proposal Holloway), though admirable in intent, is not practicable. I am afraid that its repercussions would be detrimental to the general scheme. In the first place, the actuarial calculations on which the ibill is based are founded on the vital statistics former bill the contribution rate was prepared by the Commonwealth Statistician, and' have definite relation to compulsory contributions to a national insurance scheme. Therefore, it is not actuarially safe to include in one measure, as is now suggested, provisions relating to compulsory and voluntary contributions, 'because these must necessarily be estimated on different actuarial bases. blemish in this bill. think honourable, memlbers of the Opposition have missed the point which I desire to develop, namely, that this scheme is founded on compulsory contributions. In other words, in order to become a voluntary contributor to it, the insured person must go through the gate, as it were, of compulsory insurance contributions. contention extent: the features or factors upon which the success of this national insnrance proposal depends have been taken into consideration by the actuaries and they fixed the contribution rate of 3s. for males in conformity with parallel vital statistics. In order to make a proper actuarial calculation, it is necessary to have definite figures, particularly as to minimums and age groups. In their calculations in connection with this proposal, the actuaries knew from the vital statistics at their command the age groups of the people who have to be provided for, and from whom contributions would be received. On that basis, they determined the amount of weekly compulsory contributions to the scheme. If , therefore, it is desired to include in this scheme a considerable body of voluntary contributors, it is important to know, first, the number to be provided for, and secondly, the groups or age compositions of those who are to be introduced. The actuarial calculations under the scheme introduced by Sir Earle Page in 192S were on a different basis altogether, provided for voluntary contributions, which is not the case in connection with this scheme. This proposal definitely disregards as a Abase the voluntary aspect of national insurance, whereas under the based on a certain risk for voluntary contributors. regard voluntary contributions. my Labour friends that if we introduce into this scheme the principle of voluntary contributions, regardless of the circumstances and health conditions of the people to be included, and without accurate knowledge of their numbers and age compositions, the effect will be either",50,Nation Al Health And Pensions Insurance Bill 1938

I have been looking for a way to provide for that important section of the community, the small employer groups. The income of many of these people is below the -basic wage. I confess that I have not much faith in the soundness of voluntary proposals to relieve properly this section of the people. say quite candidly that I do not think that the Treasurer can bring down a measure to include these people that will be acceptable to me, at all events; but I think we can provide equitable treatment for those who are unfavorably affected by this measure, by limiting their responsibility as employers. In my opinion the amendment will upset the actuarial calculations on which the soundness of this scheme depends. My experience suggests that we should not take this risk, particularly when the alternative is to increase contributions. If the bill is actuarially sound, and is based on the exclusion of voluntary contributions, it is logically impossible, withTreasurer and of the honourable member out adding to the risk, to include at the same rate, a large group of citizens making voluntary contributions. The bill is bad enough in its present form; I urge honourable members not to make it worse. Mi-. Curtin (Fremantle) [9.29] The substance of the argument of the honourable member for Darling Downs( Mr Fadden) is that the actuarial basis of the scheme will be disturbed if the committee postpones consideration of the clause as an instruction to the Government to widen the range of voluntary insurance. I point out to the honourable gentleman that the Treasurer has already secured ""the authority of the committee, re-inforced by a message from the Administrator, greatly to extend the obligations of the Crown. fore, from the time that this bill was introduced, we have seen its actuarial -basis changed from point to point. When the Treasurer, after' a series of caucus meetings, decided to frame amendments to his own bill, he found that the actuarial basis of the measure had been so disturbed as to make it imperative for him to get from the committee two appropriation resolutions in respect of the one measure. be the fact. the second-reading stage had been passed, he obtained the approval of the committee to a resolution for an appropriation sufficient for the purposes of the bill as drawn. Then he prepared a list of amendments to his own bill, and because I these would have involved a larger appropriation than had been provided for Treasurer narrows it down. The actuarial basis as originally framed has been shattered by the Minister himself, and one appropriation measure was inadequate. The next point I wish to make is in relation to the contention by several honourable members opposite that -it is not practicable to have voluntary insurance under a bill which provides for a compulsory scheme. That is the argument of the for Darling Downs( Mr Fadden). The answer is that clause 18, with which we are now concerned, deals exclusively with the persons qualified for voluntary insurance, and prescribes the conditions under which voluntary insurance may be effected. It also states what those who desire to be voluntarily insured have to do in order to come within the limiting qualifications which the clause specifies. The difference between the clause and the proposal of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports is that the latter proposes that a wider section of the community than mere employees shall be given an opportunity to take advantage of the measure. Several honourable members opposite are anxious that that Thereshall be done. The honourable member for Parramatta ( Sir Frederick Stewart) remarked that one of the cardinal blots",51,Nation Al Health And Pensions Insurance Bill 1938

The honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) also said this, and went .on to point out that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer had promised to bring down a supplementary measure to cover the persons excluded by the clause as drawn, but who would be included if the proposal of the honourable member for Melbour«e Ports were accepted. terial the assurance given by the Government. I do not know whether I am wan-anted in accepting the assurances of Ministers in this respect, any more than those with regard to air-mail services or a 40-hour week. Can the promises of the Prime Minister be accepted ? What did the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) say of assurances given by the 'Government? Ho now sits at the table as Assistant Afinister for Commerce, but on the 22nd October, 1936, he"" quoted from a letter he had written to the Prime Minister, and remarked:. I concluded the letter by telling the right honourable gentleman that it would be useless to tell the people in my electorate to trust the Government in this matter, because, speaking quite frankly, they distrusted it. That is the certificate of credibility which the Assistant Minister gave to assurances tendered by the Prime Minister. The issue is clear-cut and simple. Certainly the proposal .of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports would involve the use of the power which the Treasurer obtained for himself yesterday, namely, the power to""., submit which would have the effect of increasing the -> appropriation. Treasurer has authority, tue of the., decision of the committee, to move such amendments, even though they might increase the amount of the appropriation. for Melbourne Ports proposed that we should postpone this clause, as an instruction to the Treasurer to bring down an amendment to, widen the scope of the clause as drafted. quite recognizes that the burden on the budget would be increased by enabling an individual who. was not an employee to come in as an insured person Mr Owtin. by paying both the employee's and the employer's contribution. . That would put the person whom we might call A in the same relation to the Crown as another person, B, except that B would pay half the contribution, and B's employer would pay the other half. In both instances the relation of the Crown to the insured person would be actuarially identical. I disregard the arguments of the honourable member forDarling'Downs( Mr Eadden). MinisNo proposal for the improvement of the supporters have accepted conditions of the working classes has ever been advanced without statistics being submitted to prove the impossibility of giving effect to it, although, a year or so afterwards, experience has shown that what was said to be impossible of achievement could easily be done. Therefore, I decline to subject this important measure for improved social services to the decision of the mere arithmetical calculators. I prefer that this Parliament should use the resources of the nation to give effect to the kind of national insurance scheme which we believe should be the first and most important contribution to a general enlargement of Commonwealth services. [9.39] -The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin), in his earlier remarks, said that this amendment would involve no actuarial problem. man did not use the word "" insuperable "". The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley), in supporting the amendment, said that he could see no difference amendments between a voluntary contributor under the clause as now drawn and a voluntary The contributor under the clause as it would by virread if amended as proposed. Those two statements, taken separately or together, seem to indicate rather a lack of appreciation of the principles underlying this The honourable member measure.

We should get persons who are married, and probably have large families, rather than young bachelors. The factor of selection against the fund is to an extent inherent in this clause as now drawn, but the guarding qualification is that the persons to whom voluntary insurance is to be given will have already been employed, and, were, when in employment, part of the average cross-section of the Australian working community. Those persons will have been in work for at least two years, probably for considerably longer. qualification for admission of the compulsorily insured person. working man is reasonably healthy. Mi*. CUKTIN -Not more so than the average self-employer -from each industrial contributor to quite right and proper that a clause of this kind, as now drawn, should be included in this measure, so that we could offer to those who had been compulsorily insured an opportunity, if they so desired, tary contributors, and so they are to be to continue as voluntary contributors. I should think that a large proportion of them would wish to continue their insurance. In other wo,rds, this clause permits voluntary insurance in a manner which is purely incidental to compulsory insurance. The persons who would come in under this voluntary arrangement would have previously been accepted by the Government as a risk and would have been insured. Therefore, the Government does the reasonable thing and continues their insurance when they happen for one of several reasons to graduate out of compulsory insurance. The introduction of voluntary contributors, who would come in because they had a great deal to gain, would upset the actuarial basis of the seheme, and, if the contributions remained as now proposed, the Government grant would probably have to be largely increased; in fact, the actuarial basis of the scheme would be grievously disturbed. I need not repeat what has The persons .who been said regarding what the Government intends to do in the future. suggests a very definite actuarial problem with regard to the next bill. is well able to cope with the problem, and it will introduce the second measure as soon as possible. Treasurer has stated that elderly and sick persons, and not the young, are the class likely to become voluntary contributors. He said nothing about people who maj be described as self-employed. They are not necessarily old; neither are they sick, and many of them arc not married, yet no provision is made for them. The Treasurer said that the scheme was not going to usher in a new heaven aud a new earth. There is no need to tell us that. The unemployed are quite well aware of it also, as are the doctors, who are being asked to give their services for lis. a head, although in my district they are now receiving an average of 52s. cover Jiis family.

Any person who has not an employer cannot' become a voluntary contributor; this is unfair to many in addition to the unemployed. This has been called a -"" national insurance scheme. It is a scheme, all right, and a very shrewd scheme,"" too. The Government proposes to take contributions by force from those people who, in the ordinary course of events, would never be able to save anything from.their wages, and who must, perforce, rely upon the old-age pension when they can no longer work. Under this scheme, the Government proposes to make them, contribute towards their pensions, but the Government is not fooling the people. It may be a shrewd scheme, but, thank God, honourable members on this side of the House have seen through it.

237,Mr James (Hunter) [9.45],"Thethat the Government stands to gain so much when the present old-age pension scheme, which is costing £15,000,000 a year at the present time, is abolished. will be very small when this scheme is fully developed. No provision is made in the scheme for dairy-farmers, for instance, on whose behalf many honourable members opposite pleaded so eloquently. I notice that those same honourable members were brought to Canberra a day earlier this week to attend a party meeting so that the steam-roller might bs put over them, and all rebellion crushed out of them. It must be amusing to visitors in the gallery, who sat through the debate on the second reading of the bill, to see honourable members opposite turning somersaults member must address himself to the question before the Chair. I am hard to understand, but that is what I am trying to do. I was pointing out that some honourable members on tbe other side had taken up a certain attitude during the second-reading debate, and had criticized this very clause. Now they are prepared to accept it, regardless of the hardship placed upon small farmers, business men and others. The motion by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway) has for its purpose the inclusion in the scheme of self-employed persons, such as dairy-farmers, milk-vendors, small business men, auditors, &c, most of whom would like to come under it. Sir are included now. order if I answered the honourable member as he deserves. no provision made for auditors who have no permanent employers. The honourable member is the greatest hypocrite and twister in the House. The bill makes' no provision for such self-employed persons as postal contractors, carriers, teamsters, taxi-drivers, Avith an accident, or sickness for which fishermen, fruit barrowmen, hawkers and showmen, including boxers and ""bone crushers"". under the scheme, and not all of them are old or sick, or even married, and the Treasurer has suggested that only the old, the sick and the married will seek to become voluntary contributors. The honourable member for Parramatta ( Sir Frederick Stewart) said that the purpose of the motion was to wreck the bill, but that is not true. Honourable members on this side of the chamber should be given credit for trying to improve the billfor trying to make it a real national scheme. Last, but not least, we come to the greatest tragedy of all, the exclusion from the scheme of the unemployed. Again aud again on the hustings, government supporters have told the people what the Government would do for the unemployed if it were returned to office. The unemployed were told that, if they would vote for the 'United Australia party, they would get good jobs at steady wages. Now, the very Government that gave that promise, .proposes to exclude the unemployed from the benefits of this insurance scheme. We have been told that the scheme is, in many respects, a replica of the English one. I do not know why it should have been thought necessary to bring an English expert to Australia to advise us. Evidently the Government has no confidence in its own advisers. Perhaps the idea was that the English expert, instead of the Government, should bear the odium for the shortcomings of the scheme. We have always prided ourselves in Australia that we led the world in social legislation, but in regard to the number of contributions necessary to qualify for benefits Ave are definitely behind schemes in many European countries. I have not heard a satisfactory explanation from the Treasurer why the There is number of contributions has been fixed at 104, or Avhy it is stipulated that 26 contributions must be paid before a contributor shall be entitled to receive sick benefits. It is possible, that a miner, for instance, might have made only ten payments, or five, or even one, when he meets compensation is not provided, that Avill put him off work for a conThey would like to come siderable time.

That is grossly unfair. The Minister stated that inquiries had been made of friendly societies and insurance companies before the present scheme was drawn up. I have here the rule books of the Miners Federation, and if the Treasurer had read them he would be ashamed of the damned rubbish that ho is putting before the people as a national insurance scheme. It is a disgrace when an oi-ganization like the Miners Federation is able to operate a better scheme than the one which the Government proposes. scheme covers, not only the miners themselves, but their families also, and by the payment of an additional 6d. they make provision for their unfortunate unemployed comrades to enjoy medical benefits for themselves and their families. only elementary justice that these men I repeat that the Treasurer ought to be ashamed of himself for bringing in a scheme like this. ashamed. ment have said that all possible inquiries were made.

The honourable memCurtin) said that he would disregard the arguments of the honourable member for Darling Downs( Mr Fadden), but he did not attempt to refute them. honourable gentleman also persistently asserted that the clause as drafted deals and, therefore, all voluntary subscribers might be covered by an amendment of the clause. It is only a halftruth to say that this clause deals with voluntary subscribers; it deals with voluntary subscribers who have been, for a minimum period of two years-the period may be 20, 30 or even 40 yearscompulsory subscribers as wage-earners. Whilst the minimum, number of contributions is 104 in order to permit a man later on to become a voluntary subscriber, it may be that some of these people will have paid 1,000 or even 2,000 contributions. Mr HO.LI.OWAY -The honourable member is drawing a long bow. subscriber will have paid 2,000 contributions in 40 years, and some of those covered by the scheme may contribute The miners' for a period of 49 years. It is probably safe to say that employees who become self-employed, and go on to the voluntary basis, will on the average have been compulsory contributors for about. 25 years. In those circumstances, it is should be able to retain their insurance by continuing to contribute voluntarily. It is to meet such cases that this clause has been drafted. I point out, however, that this is entirely different from the proposal to include as voluntary subscribers persons who have never been compulsory subscribers. Voluntai-y subscribers who have not entered as wage earners, will be provided for under another bill to be specially drawn to suit the circumstances of their case, and, in view of the promise given by the Government that such a measure will be brought down, the proposed amendment is entirely superfluous. stances exist in their case? been so fully described by other honourable members that I do not propose to go over in the measure introduced in 192S, provision was made to include voluntary The subscribers.

250,Ber For Martin ( Mr Mccall) Said That,"that in its promised bill to provide for self-employed persons, the Government, will set a higher age limit than was proposed in the 1928 bill. I agree with the honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony) who, in his admirable speech, contended that it was udvisable to keep the compulsory schemo and the purely voluntary scheme in separate compartments. If that be done, it will be very much easier to know just what the liability is under each, and if the liability under the voluntary scheme is found to be a great deal heavier than had been estimated, it can be niore easily dealt with separately. Nearly all of the arguments advanced by honourable members opposite seem to have been based on the premise that no provision is to be made, other than what the amendment proposes, for small self-employers. If that were actually the case, at least some of their arguments would be admirable, but those honourable gentlemen know perfectly well that the promise of the Government to bring down a supplementary measure to cover such people, will be honoured. made? the Prime Minister in the course of his second-reading speech on this measure. In view of that fact the adoption of the proposed amendment would mean, in effect, that we do not accept the Government's assurance that such a measuro will be brought down, and it would be charging the Government with acting in bad faith. I am not prepared to do that. I am just as much concerned as are honourable members opposite that some provision should be made for small employers generally, such as small farmers, fishermen, shopkeepers, &c. know that, the supplementary measure is being prepared. been assured of its early introduction by the Treasurer as well as by the Prime MinisterI accept the Government's assurance in that respect. For that reason, I repeat, the amendment proposed to this clause is entirely superlation exists to show at what age people fluous. his amendment the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway) seeks to provide for voluntary contributors, embracing within the scheme unemployed persons and persons self-employed, as well as persons who have been in business, and for one reason or another have withdrawn from the employer class or retired from business altogether. It is amazing to hear repeated the same ingenious arguments put forward at an earlier stage by honourable members opposite, in an endeavour to convince somebody, even if they cannot convince themselves, that they have perfectly logical reasons for voting against a proposition which they advocated a few days earlier. The Treasurer ( Mr Casey) and the honourable members foi; Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) and Darling Downs( Mr Fadden) have been very hard-pressed to. show that the proposed extension of the scope of the bill would be unworkable. So far as I can understand them, they say that the only people who would come under a voluntary scheme-and apparently they forget that this clause already deals with voluntary subscriberswould be the aged and the sick, and, generally, persons who are bad insurance risks. The Treasurer said that the principal argument against combining the voluntary contributors in this scheme with the compulsory contributors, was that the former would represent a selective class of contributors, who would merely invest in the scheme in order to make something out of it. I point out that the clause as it stands at present is selective because a person who, after having contributed for two years, becomes unemployed goes out of the employee class, has the choice of becoming a voluntary contributor or drifting right out of the However, I scheme entirely. Such persons enjoy a selective risk as much as any who might We have be embraced in the scheme if the proposed amendment were adopted. for which such persons will have paid compulsorily, will be 25years. drift out of employment or business, and any calculation the honourable member or his informants may have made in this respect",56,Frederick Stewart Auditor S The Legislation For National Insurance

254,Mr Patebson,But the average period,57,Frederick Stewart Auditor S The Legislation For National Insurance
255,Mr Rosevear,"No basis of calcuis purely 'speculative. Persons drift out of business at all ages and for all sorts of reasons. The point I emphasize is that the clause, as it stands at present, remains selective so far as voluntary contributors are concerned. After a person has contributed compulsorily for a period of two years qualification under the hill is two years, and after having contributed for two years, a person has the choice of remaining a voluntary contributor or drifting right out of the scheme altogether. One such person may assume that he will remain healthy and, therefore, does not require insurance; another may he a sick man and may elect to become a voluntary contributor because he thinks he will get cheap insurance. Thus the only people who will be salvaged under this clause as drafted, are siek people who are looking for cheap insurance. Therefore; the conditions involved in the proposed amendment, which the Treasurer contends will be fatal to the scheme, namely, that only the sick and the aged will insure voluntarily, applies with equal force to the clause as it stands at present. The honourable member for Darling Downs( Mr Fadden) contends that it is impossible to blend a voluntary scheme with a compulsory scheme. I point out that such a blending has already been effected, because this bill contains a provision that all persons employed must remain contributors, and those who emerge from the employee class may exercise their own discretion as to whether or not they will remain in the scheme as voluntary'contributors. Another objection raised by the honourable member for Darling Downs to the proposed amendment, is that the basis of this measure is compulsion. He asked how could an assessment be made of the voluntary contributors who would be offering for amendment were adopted. In reply, I an assessment could be made of the number of insured persons who would elect to remain as voluntary contributors under Actuarially that estimate would be just as problematical as the assessment of the number of persons who would be offering as voluntary contributors under the amendment. The honourable gentleman further questioned whether the financial stability of the scheme would be assured were the amendment adopted. Last week the honourable gentleman himself went to great pains to show that under the scheme generally there would be an enormous surplus annually, and he challenged the basis of the calculation made by the Government's advisers in respect of tbe financial stability of the scheme. He suggested that this scheme is too heavily loaded with contributions and would produce an enormous annual surplus. The honourable member for Darling Downs admits that if a new bill is brought forward to cover all those classes which honourable members on this side desire to bring in under this amendment, the rate of contributions will be practically prohibitive. If the proposed amendment involves an extraordinary insurance risk because many voluntary contributors will view the scheme as a profitable investment, and as the scheme as it stands will show a huge annual surplus, then this is certainly the best opportunity to include small farmers or self-employed persons in a national insurance scheme. We should prefer to embrace them in a scheme which promises on its' present basis to show an annual surplus, rather than to provide for them in a new bill by means of a purely voluntary scheme which will involve prohibitive contributions. This bill has been put forward as a health scheme, but if it is to be a health scheme in reality it should covei , not only those ; persons who are actually employed in industry, but also those who are competent to be so employed. One of tlie principal inducements held out to employers by the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) in his second-reading speech-, as a set-off 1 against the tax they will have to pay, insurance if the proposed was that the tax would be a profitable inask the honourable member how vestment, because th'eir employees would be kept in excellent health. If that is a good reason for taxing employers, it is an equally sound reason for providing for the clause as it stands. potential employees so that they will he in good health when they obtain employment.

256,Mr Anthony,O r ten years or more.,58,Frederick Stewart Auditor S The Legislation For National Insurance
257,Mr Rosevear,"The minimumits refusal to cover the children of insured persons. I claim then, that any scheme that takes up a person only when he becomes a unit in industry, tackles the problem too late. The Minister said that relief workers can come under the scheme, but the conditions covering relief workers make it virtually impossible for some of them ever to enjoy any real benefits under the scheme, as either compulsory or voluntary contributors. There are many thousands of relief workers in Sydney alone who work one week in four. If they have to coutribute for 104 weeks before they can become voluntary enjoy certain other privileges, eight years will elapse before some of them will have a chance to share in the benefits of this scheme. Yet no workers are so greatly in need of a health insurance scheme as are the unemployed. Those who are least fitted to face the rigours of life are forced to maintain themselves on one week's pay in four. They are the most underfed, the most poorly clad, and the worse housed section of the community. But if they can become voluntary door should be left open for that to be done. If the amendment be carried, that door will be left open for them, whereas under the clause as drafted they will be excluded from the benefits of the scheme. E disagree with the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr John Lawson), who suggested that acceptance of the amendment would lead to intolerable anomalies. It is ridiculous to provide that an employer of labour can be taxed to pay contributions in respect of his employees and yet be prevented from becoming a voluntary contributor in the event of his failure in business. Such a man would have paid half the insurance premiums of each of his employees, and yet be debarred for each insured person. from enjoying any benefits of the scheme. Last week an employer of labour told me that, although he had paid a week in wages to over twenty employees, £3 10s. to maintain himself and his family. Had this scheme been in operation, most of his profits would have been absorbed by insurance premiums, and yet he himself would be excluded from the benefits of the scheme. Mr Rosevear. The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) stated that any honourable member who supported the amendment would, by that action, indicate that he did not believe the promise .of the Government to introduce a second insurance measure to ci-ver self-employed persons. I do not hold that view. I accept the Government's promise, but in my opinion such persons could easily be brought within the scope of this measure. The Government has admitted that self-employed persons should be included in a scheme of national contributors and insurance. I desire to compare the contributions. of a self-employed person, if he were provided for in this measure, with the contributions he would have to pay under the legislation which the Government has promised to introduce. A t this stage, the amount which he will be called upon to pay under the promised measure cannot be accurately estimated, because we have been given no definite information regarding the Government's intentions in respect of this section of the community. Under the contributors, the bill now before us the employer will pay Is. 6d. a week, the employee will pay a similar sum, and the Government's subvention, on a flat rate, will amount to £1,000,000 a year. It is reasonable to assume that with the same benefits under the supplementary bill a self-employed person would be called upon to pay an amount at least equal to the combined contributions of the employer and the employee under the bill now before us, namely 3s. a week. Surely it is not suggested that under the future scheme there will be no government subvention! The flat rate subvention under the present bill works out at 2-i-d. a week If the benefits under the supplementary bill for the self-employed person are to be the £95 same as under this bill, it is reasonable he had drawn only to conclude that the contribution will be not less than about 3s. a week, and that the Government's subvention will be at least 2£d. for each insured person. If the statements made are correct, that the majority of persons who will elect to come into the voluntary scheme will be bad risks, the Government's subvention",58,Frederick Stewart Auditor S The Legislation For National Insurance
258,Mr Mccall (Martin) [10.21],"will have to be much greater. As made of the number of voluntary ex-employees who are likely to come under the provisions of this bill,, it should be possible to estimate the number of self-employed persons who would come under the supplementary bill. ThenI say it is possible for the Government to bring down a message from the Governor General providing for their j inclusion and increasing the Government's subvention accordingly. In order to cover self-employed persons, it may be necessary for the Treasury to provide an additional £250,000. If some such amount will have to be provided under the promised bill, why cannot it be done under this bill? Some age limit would, of course, be necessary. The bill introduced in 19.28 by the then Acting Prime Minister, Sir Earle age limit future bill it might be found that the age limit would have to be higher or lower. There would, of course, have to be a government subvention. If that would be necessary under a supplementary bill, I do not see why similar provision cannot be made in this bill. If it were provided in this bill on the same basis as it will be the supplementary bill comes before calculated under any future measure, in what way would it upset the actuarial basis of the legislation now under consideration ? The honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) said that no concrete proposals had been outlined by any honourable member. He asked how the selfemployed persons would be policed, if included in this measure. themselves. I ask the honourable member for Wentworth how he thinks the commission which is to be set up under this legislait did so because of an urge from Geneva, tion would police the employee who becomes I himself. He would go to the nearest post office and purchase stamps to the amount of the payment required. If he did not make the necessary contributions he would automatically drop out of the scheme. The ex-employee who elected voluntarily to be included in the scheme would be induced to stay in it because of apparently estimates can be the fact that he had made 104 contributions. If , however, he dropped out of the scheme, because of an increase of his income, or a decision to become self-employed, or on account of unemployment,, he would still have to make his payments. Therefore, the argument advanced by the honourable member for Wentworth falls to the ground. The honourable member for Eichmond( Mr Anthony) stated that the voluntary insurance phase of the French scheme had been a failure. That scheme operated from 1930 to 1935, during which period France passed through the worse economic crisis in its history. It is only reasonable to expect that a voluntary insurance scheme would break down under such conditions. I am not convinced that provision for self-employed persons cannot be made in Page, provided for an this measure. It may take more time, of 45 years. In a and it may delay the passage of the bill, but a matter of this importance would justify the delay. I am most concerned that no intimation has Ibeen given to the committee of what lines the supplementary bill will follow. I believe that that could be done by the actuaries who have laid the basis of the present scheme. If Parliament and we decide that the contributions are too large, or that it does not provide for these people as we think it should, we shall then have to act as we might think proper at the time. For those reasons I should like to see the amendment incorporated in this bill. [10.32] -Before I try to reply to some of the contradictory remarks made by honourable members, I should like to draw attention to what is to me a most disheartening feature of the attitude to this measure. When the Government talked about introducing this legislation, and because of the reports of delegates a voluntary contributor. who had attended conferences there. The submit that he would police urge was to spread and enlarge the field of social legislation, which was meant to raise the physical and economic standards of the people.

261,Mr Holloway (Melbourne Ports),"social legislation. receive a report from Geneva showing that new and amending social legislation. The last one that I received last week dealt with a poor and small country, with a population no larger than Yugoslavia. The scheme there has many better features than the one before us; it is more comprehensive, and it will be no more expensive. My disappointment is because the committee, in discussing the bill, seems to have forgotten the fundamental requirements. Hearing one member after another telling the Government how to make the scheme more secure by getting rid of the dangerous risks and selecting the good ones, one would think that the discussion was taking place at a meeting of a -board of directors of an insurance company, or of a board of directors associated with a money-lending scheme. We are losing sight of the purpose of national insurance. I have read probaibly more than any other member of this committee about schemes of insurance passed in other parts of the world, and about amendments of schemes previously in operation. I admit that most of those schemes are not of a national character-that say, they are not run by the government of the countryconcerned. They ar.e either associated with groups of industries, or are run by municipalities or groups of employers, but they are more complete, they provide more safeguards, aud they give larger and greater benefits to the people than the scheme now before us proposes. Every scheme in existence is a three-party scheme, which means that the 'Government stands behind it. The government concerned never did, and never will be able to calculate accurately all the losses and to estimate exactly the amount of money required. In all the schemes of which I have read it is mandatory for the Government to determine from time to time what its quota shall be in order to keep the scheme solvent. There is no fixed amount of government contribution. from time to time, add to its subvention to seasons, depressions, and the it is impossible to calculate such Mr Holloway. Every week we things on a purely actuarial basis. I am disappointed very much at the turn other countries are passing the discussion has taken, and I believe that the people of Australia will be dissatisfied too. They believed, when the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) introduced the Australiabill, that it was meant to be what he said it would be-somethin g that would add to their economic security, something that would raise their standard of living and improve them physically, mentally and economically, both in their early years"" and in their old-age. But the bill does not mean that at all, according to the calculations made to-night. Having said that, and having expressed my disappointment, I should like to refer to two or three statements that have been made. I think that the two most constructive speeches were made by the honourable member for Darling Downs( Mr Eadden) They were both keenly critical and full of constructive arguments, but, even in them, there was a glaring inconsistency. In the first speech, he criticized the whole scheme and the Government's outlook, and charged the Government with being is to too pessimistic. He showed, successfully, that the £10,000,000 budgeted for was in excess of what he considered would be the requirements. He pointed out that the Government was too careful, and was either charging too much or giving too little. Very cleverly and constructively, he backed up every suggestion, and proved to his own satisfaction, and to mine, that the Government had been too cautious and had made too sure of having surplus money to play with. To-night, be struck an entirely different note. He said we must be very careful and must work out the calculations exactly, and he tried to show that we could not include too many self-employed persons. He said that provision for both voluntary and compulsory contributors could not be included in the same bill. When answered on that point, he admitted that we are already, in this bill, grouping toThe 'Government may, gether compulsory and voluntary insurance; but he never, and neither did meet the effects of bad the Treasurer ( Mr Casey), explain like, why the two classes were not included in the scheme in its original form. member know any country that has successfully grouped them together? about schemes in other countries a3 the honourable member. I have read them and pondered them so much that I am sick and tired of them. Some one has said that there would be difficulty in policing the voluntary contributors. 1. answer that by saying that history and experience show that we have had to employ highly-paid inspectors, and we have had to invoke the aid of the police in order to enforce arbitrary law-made agreements. There is not half tlie difficulty in policaptitude for mathematics. .1 remember ing voluntary arbitration agreements as tliere is in policing compulsory awards. are also an admirable example of the success of voluntary schemes. honourable member. Friendly societies lire established on the same basis as I would have for the voluntary contributions under this bill, that is to say, if contributions are paid up, the benefits of membership accrue to the member, but, if .they arc not, the member's name is removed from the list. friendly societies penalize themselves; they do not have to be policed. The same state of affairs would exist in respect of ibis bill if my amendment were carried. There is no reason why this bill should not be extended in its scope in the direction that I desire; already it makes provision for not only compulsory, but also voluntary contributions. The Treasurer said that that was partly so, but added that the Government under this bill had selected the safest and strongest classes to enjoy the right to make voluntary contributions. This bill, therefore, was introduced to help, not the sick and needy, hut those who least need it. That is a contradiction of the fundamental principle of national health insurance-assist said that if the clause were left as printed ance to those who most need it. The only inference that can be drawn from the Treasurer's remark is this: ""We are taking the best risks in under this bill, and tlie worse risks will be covered in legislation to be introduced later"". If it"" is impossible for the Government, with the help of all the contributions of the compulsorily insured persons, .who are the best risks, to accept more voluntary contributors, how will it be possible for it to introduce another scheme, which will not have that backing, to take in the worse risks ainong?t voluntary contributors? Honourable members who are pinning their faith to the assurance given by the Treasurer, that supplementary legislation will be introduced, should give close attention to that phase of the matter. From what I have been told of the ability of the honourable member for Darling Downs( Mr Fadden) I have the greatest respect for him. He has reached a high place in his profession, and has an that the honourable gentleman cited figures to show that a gigantic surplus was to be accumulated, in the national insurance funds. Yet, to-night, he advanced the theory that if the classes of persons to whom I have referred were included as voluntary contributors, the whole scheme might be thrown out of balance. After having forecast that the fund would have a huge surplus, the honourable member is now of the opinion that, if more voluntary contributors than are already provided for in this bill came under the scheme, the fund would not be able to Members of remain solvent. He would, he said, pin his faith to the supplementary bill which will introduce a scheme to cover all the worse risks, which will not have the backing of the contributions from the best risks.

268,Mr Lazzarini,"No r do we! Omwomen who, after having contributed on a compulsory basis, elect, when the compulsion disappears, to continue their membership of the scheme on a voluntary basis. I dare say that the time will arrive when two-thirds of the married women of Australia will be voluntary contributors to the national insurance scheme as it is proposed to-day. I have no statistics, but my wide experience of the country suggests that from two to seven years after taking jobs, girls, who, by reason of their employment, will be compelled to contribute to the fund, will marry. Under this bill every one of them will be entitled to make voluntary contributions to continue their membership of the insurance scheme. In justification of their opposition to tbe amendment the honourable member for Darling Downs( Mr able member for Parramatta ( Sir Fadden) and the honourable member for New England( Mr Thompson) declared that we could not have two schemes, one compulsory and the other voluntary, running together, but -1 point out that eventually about half of the adult population of Australia will enjoy the privileges of national insurance as voluntary contributors. That destroys the validity of their arguments. I was astounded at the cold-blooded manner in which the Treasurer spoke. Before the elections he and his colleagues told the electors of what they were going to do for humanity by introducing a national insurance measure which would provide for all the people. The failure of the Government to carry out that pledge reminds meof the fact that whereas, when our soldiers were going to the Great War, they were told that on their return, they would have everything that the country could give to them, actually every concession to them was measured with miserly care. Before the elections, ministerial supporters told the people that they were to be given health insurance which would cover everybody. Now they are telling the people that, like the insurance companies, they can take only the best risks. we should do exactly as we are now doing. sort. I can bring to this chamber the pamphlets that were issued and fling them in the honourable member's teeth. The Treasurer to-night was like a butcher weighing a bullock to see how much meat and profit it would yield. His statements were not humane, but cold-blooded commercialism, and showed no consideration for the sick and unfortunate. The Treasurer's attitude is that he should go through the people like a drover, draft out the good lives, and throw the others aside to die. Honourable members opposite are steeped in the psychology of commercialism and profit. Not even in a measure which purports to be humane can they take any other attitude. I rose also for the purpose of expressing amazement at the way honourable gentlemen opposite have handled this question. I regret that the honorFrederick Stewart) is not in the chamber. The honourable gentleman said that he approved of the whole of the proposal. Of course, he did! He has been whining ""national insurance "" all over the country, and has built his political career on it. He attends mothers' meetings and discusses at. length the advantages of a comprehensive national insurance scheme,. but in this chamber he declines to support those whose claims he is alleged to advocate. He is the biggest political humbug and hypocrite in the Parliament. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Nairn) -'Order!

280,Member For Melbourne Ports ( Mr Hol,"included in a supplementary proposal. Those who come in on a voluntary basis under the supplementary legislation will be compelled to pay higher contributions than insured persons under this scheme. Can the members of the Country party justify their action in this regard? The honourable member for Wimmera( Mr will be able to do all that is claimed for Wilson) is the only member of the Country party who has been consistent in expressing the view of the country people. Darling Downs( Mr Fadden) referred somewhat extensively to the actuarial position. I have heard a good deal about not able to say what calls would actuaries' and a'bout figures, hut I do not know that figures in this instance prove a great deal, particularly when handled by unscrupulous individuals. It has also been said that "" figures can't lie, but liars can figure"". When we examine the figures that have been put forward there is eviconsidered. What will happen to the dence of the fact that liars can figure. The honourable member for Darling Downs, when speaking earlier, said that the actuaries had failed to fix a contrito this scheme, are called up for naval bution in keeping with the benefits which and military service? The bill provides insured persons would receive, that the contributions had been based on too high a level, and that the Government would build up an enormous surplus. The honourable member now says that the actuarial that the Government does not guarantee calculations cannot be interfered with, and that the small farmers, although they the actuaries have had to depend are recognized by Government supporters as among the worse insurance risks, should come in under some other scheme under which they will have to pay higher contributions than will be required under this bill. As a matter of fact, the honourable member for Darling Downs said that if the scheme were widened to include small primaivy producers and other small self-employed persons, the workers would have to pay a higher contribution, otherwise the scheme But what does the honourable gentleman would be actuarially unsound. If his previous statement that contributions have been fixed on too high a scale, is correct then it must be possible to bring general elections and upon which in additional classes, even if they are ""bad insurance risks"", without increasing the contributions. Another honourable member said that any interference with the actuarial basis of the scheme would jeopardize the position of i l r . Word. those who would come in at sixteen years of age, because there would be no guarantee that when they reached the age of 65 years they would receive benefits to which they would be entitled and for which they had contributed all their lives. There is no guarantee that the scheme it. The Government itself does not guarantee the solvency of the fund out of which payments are to be made. The The honourable member for actuaries who fixed the contributions were necessarily obliged to base their calculations on the available data and they were be made upon the fund in the future. I notice that in another part of the bill there is provision that persons who served in the military or naval forces will be relieved of the necessity to make contributions to the fund. That opens up a wide possibility, which I think should be fund if , unfortunately, Australia becomes involved in another war, and large numbers of workers, who will be contributors that they will be relieved of contributions to the fund, the soundness of which will therefore be affected. This reinforces my contention that the scheme is weak in the solvency of the fund, and upon the available data and cannot say definitely what calls will be made upon the fund in the future. Let me examine the attitude of Ministers and some ' Government supporters. The Treasurer, when introducing the bill, said .the intention was to place on the statute-book a scheme giving ample insurance cover for employees in the Commonwealth against certain contingencies. now propose? He proposes a scheme entirely different from that which the Government promised the people at the the actuaries based their calculations. His changed attitude shows conclusively that the Government's purpose was to relieve its wealthy friends of the responsibility to provide, by way of direct taxes, the funds necessary for a full range of social services in this country. I have had some doubt as to my attitude to the proposal, because I recognize that benefits will be given to only a small proportion of those who will be covered by this scheme. I put it to the Government that if it is right to argue that the widening of the field of insured persons will increase the appropriation, it is equally right to contend that a reduction of the number to be covered by the scheme will reduce the amount of the appropriation. I suggest that instead of compelling workers, the great majority of whom do not Want to be covered by the scheme, to contribute to the fund, the Government should allow them to be excluded, and allow small farmers and other rural selfemployed persons, a great many of whom it is said by the Government supporters desire to be covered, to be included. If the workers were given the opportunity to express their opinion of the scheme they would tell the Government in no uncertain terms that they do not want to be included in it. It will satisfy nobody, because it includes workers who do not want the protection Avhich this Government says it is going to give them. They know, from bitter experience, that when this Government talks about bestowing benefits on the workers their position will I regret that I did not hear the remark. as the result of such legislation be worse than ever it was. If members of the Country party are consistent, and want to have included in the scheme tbeir small farmer friends, for whose welfare they say they are so much concerned, let them now vote for the amendment. I well recollect members of the Country party on other occasions making excuses in this Parliament for speaking in favour of a certain course, and. then voting against it. No doubt they will do the same in connection with this scheme. The honourable member for Wimmera( Mr cannot be depended upon. If honourable Wilson) is the exception. It is refreshing to hear a member of the Country party vote in accordance with his declared convictions. Up to the present, at all events, that honourable gentleman has not been side-tracked by promises of Cabinet rank, like the honourable member for Wentworth The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN tunity ( Mr Nairn) -'Order! The honourable contributors if they wish to do so. member must not discuss the motives The suggestion has been made that the [BO] actuating the honourable member for -Wimino'ra or any other honourable member. desire to say about the honourable member for Wimmera. The Government, as I have said, is encountering many difficulties in connection with this scheme. Take, for instance, the attitude of the British Medical Association to the per capita payment of Us. The Treasurer made certain promises which members of the British Medical Association are not prepared to accept because they cannot depend on the word of the Treasurer. ask that that remark be withdrawn. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. I was not observing what the honourable member for East Sydney said. had been listening it would have heard him. for East Sydney said that my promise to the British Medical Association was not dependable; that remark is offensive, and _ I ask that it be withdrawn. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN members of the British Medical Association were not prepared to accept an assurance by the Treasurer, and some of them informed me that they could not accept his word because they could not depend upon it. And that, is the attitude of the people generally, and the workers in particular who will be compelled to contribute to the fund. I ask honourable members not to accept any promise which the Government may give. The Ministry has proved that its word members wish to do the right thing by their constituents they will vote for the amendment.

286,Mr Bernard Corser (Wide Bay),"scheme should be extended to embrace small primary producers and other selfemployed persons, but I do not consider that it would be right to require the farmers in this class, who probably have lower incomes than the average employed person, to make a double contribution. I suggested on a previous occasion that if the Government paid one of the contributions required of small self-employed persons, no grave injustice would be done sound, and is in accordance with the to the taxpayers. No section of the comviews expressed by most honourable memmunity is in greater need of insurance and medical attention than are the small primary producer's. Efforts have been made from time to time to induce the Government to bring them within the scope of the scheme on an equitable voluntary basis, and the suggestion is now made that, if this clause were postponed, it might be possible to devise a scheme in their interests. It has been said that members of the committee who favour such a proposal will indicate that they do not trust the Treasurer, who has undertaken to safeguard the interests of these producers under the second bill, which is to be introduced shortly. I do not subscribe to that view. I accept the assurance given by the Minister, although he has not given all of the information for which I had hoped. I realize that actuarial calculations are necessary, but the scheme has been under consideration by the Government for a long period. Every effort should be made to provide insurance and medical benefits for country dwellers, who do not enjoy the amenities of city life. They are heavily taxed to provide benefits for city workers. The farmer and the members of his family find it necessary to work for very long hours, and they have few, if any, holidays. I should like definite information regarding the benefits proposed to be given to this class under the measure to be introduced in the near future. I do not expect the Treasurer to furnish full details, but the committee is certainly entitled to more information than it has at the present time. The unhatched egg which the small farmers are promised may prove to be addled. I am inclined to support the amendment of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports so that my vote may be consistent with my speech on the second reading of Mr Bernard Corser. the 'bill. I hope that, before long, the Treasurer will be able to give honourable members some details of the supplementary bill which, we have been assured, will be introduced to cover primary producers and other self-employed persons in a voluntary scheme. proposal of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway) is bers during the debate on the second reading of the bill. One speaker after the other protested"" against the exclusion of certain groups of persons whom the honourable member for Melbourne Ports now proposes should be brought into the scheme. The Treasurer ( Mr Casey) stated that it would be necessary to introduce a new bill to provide for these groups, because it would be difficult to collect their contributions if they were included in this measure. I submit that there would be no difficulty if the contributions were collected by approved societies. I have great respect for the friendly societies, recognizing as I do the wonderful work they have performed in Australia during the last 50 years, and I am convinced that they would continue to do good work under this scheme if given the opportunity. The actuarial objections which the Treasurer advanced as reasons for not including these new groups in the present bill would, in fact, be much stronger if they were included in the separate measure. The purpose of the amendment is to enable unemployed and self-employed persons to become voluntary contributors. Those are the persons who, before all others, are entitled to the benefits of an insurance scheme. For that reason, I believe that the clause should be postponed so that the Treasurer and his actuaries may give the matter further consideration. It is claimed that the scheme, as it now stands, will affect 1,850,000 persons. Are we to assume that, if the number who actually come under it is, say, only 1,400,000 the scheme will be actuarially unsound, and will break down? If that is so, then the inclusion of these additional groups of persons, as suggested by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, would help to make the scheme financially sound.",66,Frederick Stewart Auditor S The Legislation For National Insurance
