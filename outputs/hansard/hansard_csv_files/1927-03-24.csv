CASE OE ROBERTDENHOLM . Groom) I have received an intimation from the honourable member for Melbourne ( D r . Maloney) that he desires to move the adjournment of the House to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, "" The case of Robert Denholm, formerly employed in Parliament House."" Five honourable members having risen in {heir places, Question proposed. -This being the last day that honourable members w ill have an opportunity of speaking in this chamber, and at the earnest member for Melbourne Ports Mathews), I shall endeavour as I did on my first appearance here 38 years There has, in the case of Robert Denholm, been a tangle of legal and other opinion whch has been unjust to that unfortunate man. of the ease is briefly this-When the a wfu l epidemic of influenza was raging My injuries arose from the time.

Otherwise, I doubt whether he would have used the serum. Honourable members may wonder why I , as a medical man, take a conservative view of the treatment with serum, and I can only refer them to this episode. A t one time in the treatment of disease in England bleeding was considered a cure for all ills. Thati t saved some lives I do not deny, but that it was the means of losing many lives I certainly affirm.

T wish to show to honourable members that Eobert Denholm should never have had the serum passed into his arm. So alarming were the symptoms after the treatment that D r . Stephens himself did not repeat the injection. A t that time, to completo the treatment, injections were given two or three times. Upon my advice, this man underwent a course of electrical massage. There is clear evidence that his present state of helplessness is the result of the injection of serum. H a d this man been in ordinary outside employment, he would have had a claim under the Workmen's Compensation Act ; but, unfortunately, Parliament House is not subject to its provisions. might, during the recess, consider the advisability of bringing parliamentary affairs under that act, and also the Public Service. admit that he has had good treatment. He obtained admittance to the Homef o r Incurables at Heidelberg, which institution can be mentally likened to Dante's Inferno, above the entrance to which was inscribed ""Abandon hope all ye who enter here."" an invalid pension, but it is of little help to him. I hold in my hand a final report of the select committee on this case, and I thank ex-Senator de Largief o r the great work that he did in this man's cause. The recommendation for a joint committee would have been accepted had not objection been taken under parliamentary rules by an honourable member who before he died expressed to me his heartfelt regret for his action. Any one who reads Kobert Denholm suffered. wards received £50 which the Minister, in. his kindness of heart, granted; but I do not think that the Minister imposed the stringent conditions under which the money was given. Mentally, Denholm is very clear, and always has been. This is what he writesThe application for a compassionate allowance was sent to the Treasurer on 12th MaTch, 1925. Six months later, from information T received, I telephoned the Treasury Department. T was told that my case had been finalized, and the Joint House Department would pay me a compassionate allowance. A week later, 25th September, I got a friend to take me to interview the Secretary of the Joint House Department. Owing to the state of my health I wa« not able to go about by myself. I interviewed Mr U'Ren, the Secretary of the Joint Houst Department at 12.30 p.m. I asked him had ht a compassionate allowance that was to be paid to me. He replied that there was a compassionate allowance for me, but he had been too busy to see about it, and if I wanted it 1 would have to sign a deed of release. I told him I was ill, and in need of the money. Hp told .mo to call back later in the day. As1 did not understand the deed of release, I asked him for a copy of the deed of release, but my request was refused. I interviewed Mr U'Ren again at 2.30 p.m. He told me to go to Mr Broinowski's room and he would pay me. Mr Broinowski put two papers before me to sign. I was too ill to read them or understand what was read to me. It was an effort for me to sign my name. After signing my name, Mr Broinowski had not got the cheque to pay me. nett, and told him to take me across to tlie The Government Treasury Department and see that I received the cheque. I received no notice from the Join! House Department about the deed of release other than what I have stated. HadI received notice, I would have got advice before I was This man is in debt. I compelled to sign. HadI known the signing of those papers would end my claims, I certainly would not have attached my name to them. Granted that the deed of release is a legal discharge, there still remains a moral This man is in receipt of claim, and if I did not, from the bottom of my heart, believe that to be so, I should not be speaking on the man's behalf on this, the last, day of the present sittings. BeforeI conclude I wish to make a public apology to a Parliamentary official whom I have greatly wronged; I allude to Mr. Broinowski, of another place. Every time he came into my presence I used to insult h i m by asking h i m what he hafl done with a certain two guineas. To mv deep regret, I did him a great wrong. the report will see how There is an official higher than he who He aftertook the two guineas, and I leave h i m with his conscience for his punishment. If he was wrong in taking the miserable two guineas, he was still more wrong in allowing a junior officer to be insulted unjustly by me. I leave him, with his increasing years on his shoulders, to reflect on those two wrongs, aud to settle with his conscience whether he acted rightly. When Denholm was employed in this House, he was an active man, and every one who came in -contact with hi m can testify to his activity and willingness. He was here for ten years, or thereabouts, and did whatever he was told. When a man, in a subordinate position like his is told by",14,Formal Motion Of Adjournment

Maloney), and the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Mathews) in their efforts to obtain justice for Robert Denholm, who, for many years, was an attendant in this House. I have interested myself in the case, and, on many occasions, have accompanied those two honourable members when they have interviewed the Treasurer, and the ex-President of the Senate (Senator Givens). Denholm was an employee of the Joint House Committee, and, in 1914, in the course of his employment, met w i th an accident. Although, at a later period, he stated the nature of his accident, it was impossible to obtain proofs from the records of the Parliament of his absence from duty owing to the accident; but, in the opinion of D r . Kerr, the accident was a likely cause of his disability. In his report the doctor saidI t is hard to be sure of the right decision in this case, but, my opinion is, that in the absence of better knowledge of this disease, it is possible that the accident to the head and the meningeal irritation following later brought about in this case the condition of the spinal cord, known as syringomyelia, perhaps beginning with a small haemorrhage. Consequently, I felt that if it is at all posNo doubt the Treasurer ( D r . Earle Page), sible after confirming the truth of the head injury as described by Mr Denholm, as I had only Mr Denholm's statement to go on, every consideration be given to the granting of a compassionate allowance in view of the fact that the alleged injury to the head was sustained when Mr Denholm was employed at Parliament House. Later, as the honourable member for Melbourne has stated, injections of serum were given, and immediately the man's disability became so severe that he had to relinquish his employment. Several honourable members, who knew h i m before and after his disability, have been tryin g for years to obtain justice for him. The negotiations reached the stage at which he was to receive a compassionate allow-mce of £50, but when he went to draw the allowance he was asked to sign certain papers. He states that he did not know that he was signing a final deed of release. When a man, in ordinary commercial practice, has made a claim and had it satisfied, documents are signed to close the matter; but, in this case, Denholm did not know that he was signing a final release. He asked for, and was reI fused, a copy of the document. He was not in a condition to know what he was signing, and, unfortunately, the machinery of this Parliament was used to trick h i m in a way which was, in my opinion, to say the least, sharp practice. I do not blame the officer who, acting under in structions, protected the Government, but I do say that those who were responsible for using officers of the Parliament to do such things, indulged in very questionable practices. Groom) -To what action does the honourable member refer? one in authority in instructing a subordinate officer of this Parliament to place the document before Denholmi n circumstances that were not merely questionable, but unjustifiable. Two papers were placed before h i m for signing, and he was not allowed to have a copy of them. Thoso of us who have watched this man's in creasing disability, from the time when he was apparently quite well, u n t i l now, when he is an invalid, know quite well that he would not be in his present condition but for the unfortunate accident. the honourable member for Herbert( D r . No t t ) , and the honorahle member for Melbourne, with their medical knowledge, can speak w i th more authority on that aspect of the matter; but it is safe even for a layman to say that to expect an invalid to transact legal business while refusing h i m a copy of the documents he is required to sign, so that he may take them away and obtain advice on them, should not be condoned by this Parliament. The position now is that this Parliament holds a final deed of release from Denholm, who therefore has no legal claim. the accident? an accident in the dining-room, and sustained injuries to the head.

40,Mr Blakeley,"D e n h o l m met withto the hospital, and later developed meningeal irritation, from which he is now suffering. I am informed that his condition could be caused by an injury to the head. If , in the opinion of honorhis condition arose spontaneously, fpr able members, there is even a possibility that his invalidity was caused, or contributed to, by the accident, the duty of this Parliament is clear; the deed of release ought not to absolve us from paying compensation, if compensation is due. I feel very strongly that if there is the slightest by the inoculation. Clearly Denholm's suspicion in the minds of honourable members that we owe a debt to this ex-employee, we should pay it. I ask the Treasurer and honourable members generally to deal sympathetically with this application. I remember this young man when he was employed in this House. He was a mere youth, with his life opening out before him; he was bright, intelligent, and normal in every way, and seemed quite healthy. I have seen him at various times within the last twelve months, and have noticed that to all intents and purposes the gates of life have now been slammed against him. He is a shattered wreck. His condition resembles that of a shellshocked soldier; his case seems similar to one which was unhappily before our eyes for some years in this chamber. Denholm alleges that from robust and joyous health he has been brought to a state of death in life by reason of an inoculation he was obliged to undergo while employed by this House. Some ground for that belief is provided by the fact that he was given a sum of £50 by this Parliament. Like the honourable member for Darling( Mr been very interested in this case, which was Blakeley), I am not skilled in medicine, but it is evident that in the minds of the President and Mr Speaker, or of the House Committee, or of whoever was responsible for the settlement of this matter, there was doubt as to whether the man's condition was not due to that treatment. I do not know what defence may be offered on behalf of the authorities concerned, and until we have heard the defence we cannot make any counter charge. It would be idle to say that inoculation does not, in some cases, completely wreck the lives of the persons inoculated. While it may prove salutary or defensive in 999 cases, it may kill the 1000th case. There is a duty upon us in this case, to compensate with money, so far as that ia possible, the injury received by this officer. It would be idle to say that there must always be an anterior cause. Assuming that there is certain probable cause in this case, no sensible medical man would deny that the state of the man's health at the time that this cause afose is material to the consequences produced health was reduced below par by the inoculation. That, of course, is not always the result of inoculation. I have been inoculated several times. I was inoculated a couple of days ago, but I was able to make a speech here shortly afterwards. Please GodI shall inoculate myself in the future and make more speeches. But that happy result does not follow in every instance. If I had to deal with this case I would put this man in the position of being sure at least of the ordinary comforts of life. It is true that he was only a humble attendant and not a. member of the Parliament; but, nevertheless, we met him every day and he was one of our number. To put it in another way, he was a private in an army in which we are officers. He was stricken down while doing his duty. Surely we are not obliged in such circumstances to examine with microscopic exactness into the precise causes of his trouble. Let us treat-'the case as human beings, and give the man something. We have been in occupation of these buildings for 26 years; let us on the eve of our departure do at least one just and generous act. brought under my notice in the first place by a circular; but I did not know until the Treasurer-stated.it by interjection that this unfortunate man was in the condition that is medically known as syringomyelia. I venture to suggest, and I think the Treasurer will agree with me, that the case has been fairly and amply put by the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes). The honourable member for Darling said the man's neurotic condition was the consequence of an accident which he sustained through falling on his head, when several stitches had to be inserted in the wound.

The man's condition, the ideology of which is imperfectly understood, cannot be attributed or explained by the serum inoculation; still I think, on the compassionate grounds advanced by the right honourable member for North Sydney, it is the obvious duty of Parliament to assist this man and free him from the need of relying upon individual and private charities to make his remaining days something more than an existence. I feel sure that I am doing the righ t thing in supporting the claim, although I could not support it on the medical suggestions that have been made. It would be unfair to allow the suggestion to go abroad that the serum injection to which this man was subjected had the damaging effect that haa been attributed to it . The anaphylactic effect of a serum injection cannot be compared with the untold benefits thaifc accrue from it . I support the claim purely on compassionate grounds. surer) [11.25],-Undoubtedl y the case of this man deserves our deepest sympathy. The man's condition is incurable, and it must become worse as time goes on. In -..consideration of his condition he was awarded an invalid pension some years ago. sidered the case sympathetically from the time when it was first brought under notice two or three years ago. I personally have very carefully looked into it to see whether there is any possible justification for the claim, that the man's condition is due to anything that occurred while he held his position as an officer of this Parliament. As the honourable member for Herbert (Dr. Nott) has stated, the relationship, if there is any at all, is extraordinarily remote. Mr Denholm is only 34 years of age. He was employed here for a long time aa a temporary liftman and casual waiter. 1914 he accidentally received a knock on the head from a plank, and had to have several stitches inserted in the wound. Unfortunately, there is no record of the accident, nor of his having received leave of absence at the time, though I have no doubt <that what he 'says is quite correct. bis condition to Five years later he was inoculated with influenza serum, and although he suffered was a rather severe re-action I do not think that it can be maintained that his present I do not think that either condition is due to the inoculation. he inoculated ? serum, which contained several antibodies.

I have examined the case most carefully. The position is not quite as the honourable member for Melbourne put it . The officers of this House come under the provisions of the Commonwealth Workmen's Compensation Act.

The of whose illness has not been definitely payment was made on the definite understanding that there was no admission of liability on the part of the Government. I join issue with the honourable member for Darling, who suggested there was sharp practice on the part of the Joint House Committee in connection with the signing of the deed of release. I assure the House that the ordinary procedure was followed. under duress. honourable member for Darling suggested that Mr Denholm was ignorant of what took place. As a fact, the matter was fully explained to him, and, as the honourable member for North Sydney drew atable member for Melbourne, remarked, his mind was very clear upon it.

67,Mr Speakee (Hon. Sir Littleton,"three years prior to leaving the Service. A f t e r he had left it , he claimed that, as a result of the inoculation, he had become ill . The matter was gone into f u l l y by the then President of the Senate, and the circumstances of the inoculation were in vestigated. On the 13th of March, 1925, Senator Givens addressed a letter to the Department of the Treasuryi n which the following passage occurs:Some time after leaving the Service he developed some peculiar condition, which practically left his arm useless, and he claims that that condition was due to the inoculation against influenza. However, I have seen no medical evidence which would confirm that statement. The Joint House Committee made in quiry to ascertain if there was any relation between the officer's condition and his employment in the Service. D r . G. Stephens, an eminent medical man, declared that he could not affirm that the man's inju ry was due to inoculation. As however, the man's dered Senator sympathetically, recommended the Treasurer for early and favorable consideration. The case was looked into by the Treasurer. An additional statement was that the man's condition was due to an accident which had taken place at a very much earlier date. Inquiries were made of the parliamentary officers, and the following reference to it was found in the files, dated the 24tb June, 1925Mr Denholm further stated tliat, in 1914, while employed as a waiter at Parliament House, he accidentally knocked his head against a plank. Inquiries on reference to the files showing the various occasions on which leave of absence had been granted, there was nothing to show that a report or complaint had ever been received, or temporary leave of absence applied for, in connection with any such accident in 1914. I have before me a record of the details submitted to the Treasurer. granted to Denholm are as ""Four three catarrh); two weeks from 18th ber, 1918 (influenza); cember, 1918, and two weeks, 1919 (nature of illness not stated). Mr Speaker. minute bearing on this case, said to be an extract from D r . Kerr's report, is aa follows:It is hard to be sure of the right decision in this case, but my opinion is that, in the absence of better knowledge of this disease, it is possible that the accident to the head and the meningeal irritation following later brought aibout in this case the condition of the spinal cord known as syringomyelia, perhaps beginning with a small haemorrhage. There is nothing to confirm the statement that the accident occurred in the course of employment. I noticed that, in the petition presented today, no reference is made to the accident. The first question, therefore, is whether Mr Denholm suffered any in j u r y in the course of his employment. There is no definite evidence to show that the in j u r y resulted from the inoculation. I find that my predecessor reported to that effect to the Treasurer, and the compassionate allowance was made in the circumstances which the Treasurer has described. There are one condition renor two comments I desire to make in him unfit for employment, connection w i th this case. The honourable Givens, viewing the case member for Darling suggested, in the first it to instance, that there had been sharp practice on the part of the Joint House Committee. I think that he withdrew that expression; but he indicated that Mr. Denholm, as the latter said in his own petition, had been practically compelled to sign the deed of release or receive nothing. Mr Denholm stated in his petitionI was compelled to sign a deed of release, being told by the secretary of the Joint House Department, that if I did not sign the deed of release, I would not receive the money. I waa ill at the time, and in need of the money. I had no otlier option but to sign. were immediately made, and The secretary of the Joint House Committee said that that was not correct. The document was sent on to be signed, and Mr Denholm was pleased to receive the money. There was no sharp practice, and no application was made for the document. What motive would that officer, in the ordinary course of his duty, have for acting as was alleged^ The pracThe particulars of sick leave tice on all occasions has been to deal follow:with the officers in a sympathetic rather days, March, 1916 (gastritis); than in a stern manner.

The matter of the compassionate allowance was concluded by my predecessors. When I took my present position, the deed had been signed, and the grant had been made. the files disclose, the most sympathetic thought appears to have been given to the case, and the opinion evidently was that, although no relation could be established between the man's condition and his previous might be done as an act of grace.' That has been done. I am greatly disappointed w i th what I have heard, as I did expect that some sympathy would be expressed in this case. 1 asked the Treasurer whether he would give the serum in the case of a man who had a severe attack of typhoid complicated w i th symptoms of brain trouble. The honourable gentleman said that he would; but, although I have put the same question to dozens of the best medical men in Melbourne, and some in Sydney, none of them gave me a similar answer. The fact that D r . Stephens did not give a second injection shows clearly that he was alarmed at the symptoms. If I took the Treasurer on the hop in asking the question, I am sorry, because I think that, upon reflection, he w ill agree that I have been right in what I said. be suffering from typhoid fever when he was given the injection for influenza? from an attack of typhoid fever. tween his recovery and the injection of the serum? made some three weeks from the time the man was carried out of the hospital after an attaclc of typhoid. ' I was not treating this man as a medical man. I sent bim for treatment to men better able to deal w i th his case. I ask honourable members in a spirit of justice to look through the evidence taken at the inquiry. The y-ung man's mother made a sworn declaration that she had never said a word against him, although she was accused by a high official of another place with having sent him a letter in In his own which she complained of the young man. That letter could not be produced. If we had a national system of insurance in force, appeals of this kind would be avoided. When men speak w t h feeling they sometimes say things which would be better lef t unsaid. If Sof a r as I have said anything offensive to the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page), I hope he w ill pardon me. I appeal to h i m now to make this man some allowance u n t i l the Government and the Parliament, in their wisdom, bring into operation a employment, something national system of insurance. I would cut my tongue out before I would make such a request if I thought that this man was a malingerer. D r . MALONEY M e n who knew this young man as I did are not now in this chamber, and the majority of the present members of the House know very little about the case. I hope that something w ill be done to carry this man over the interval between now and the time when a national system of insurance w ill be brought into operation.

Does provision exist under the Income Tax Collection Act 1923 whereby these officers may receive compensation? 3. Should such provision not exist, is it in tended that such Act be amended in order that similar compensation be made to these officers as was given to officers previously retired under similar circumstances? 4. What principle w ill be observed, in the event of Federal Taxation officials now attached to the State Department being transferred to the Federal Service, in regard to their status and salary? I a m n o w in a p o s it i o n to f u r n is h the of his communication to the press he following replies:1. Yes, two officers. Mr W. A. Pert, clerk (salary, £505 per annum), services not required consequent upon the reduction in work. Miss P. M . Byrne, telephonist (salary, £178 per annum), services not required owing to installation of State Telephone Exchange, rendering the employment of Miss Byrne as telephonist unnecessary. 2. No. Under the 1923 Act compensation can be paid only to officers whose services are no longer required in consequence of economy rendered possible by tlie arrangements made under that Act for the collection by the States of Commonwealth income tax. The officers referred to are not being dispensed w it h in consequence of economy rendered l ossible under these arrangements. 3. No. The policy of the Government has been to provide for compensation on retirement only in cases where it has become necessary to dispense with the services of a large number of officers within a short period as the result of some heavy reduction in work consequent on some important change of Government policy. Wliere, in isolated cases, officers become excess, efforts are made to find suitable positions for them in some other branch of the Commonwealth Public Service, and efforts in that direction w ill be made in the cases of the officers referred to. 4. The Public Service Board w ill endeavour, wherever possible, to allot such officers to positions equivalent in classification to those previously occupied by them prior to transfer to the State Service, or to which, in the opinion of tlie Board, they might have attained, with salary (exclusive of allowances) at the rate they would have received had they not been transferred to the Service of the The following papers were presented:Taxation-Tenth Report of the Commissioner, years 1923-24, 1924-25, and 1925-26.

Mr Wolskel took an interest in this phosphate company when he disposed of his own concern to the farmers, becoming general manager, and he has failed since to produce manure for the farmers. liminary statements I shall deal with the charges made. Mr Wolskel, first of all, refers to "" Mr Eodgers' attack on the Phosphate Co-operative Company."" I made no attack on the company or its shareholders, and never at any time placed any impediment in its way. I challenge any one to deny that statement. I refer now to Mr Wolskel's fourth charge, which, after all, is the gravamen of the accusations he has made against me. He saysMr Rodgers' role as a champion of cheap superphosphate is interesting, in view of the fact that the now discredited sulphur duties were imposed during his tenm as Minister for Customs, and that he strenuously resisted their withdrawal. AllI have to say is that the sulphur duties were not imposed during my time as Minister for Trade and Customs. They were included in the Massy Greene tariff brought down to this House when 1 was not in charge of the Trade and Customs Department. Deferred duties were proposed to come into operation on a date fixed. In the interval changes of office took place; Mr Massy Greene went to the Defence Department and I took charge of the Trade and Customs Department. In the ordinary course of events I signed the proclamation bringing the duties into force, but no representations were made to me on the subject hy anybody. Those are the facts, and they cannot be disputed. Mr Wolskel says that I strenuously resisted the withdrawal of the sulphur duties. In this connection I may say that a deputation, which was more in the nature of a demonstration, waited upon me on this subject. After hearing the representations of the deputation, I referred the whole case to the Tariff Board for reconsideration. The Tariff Board recommended that the duties be not withdrawn, and they have not been withdrawn; they have been merely suspended, and a bounty has been paid, but not on the recommendation of the board, which has consistently adhered to its original attitude. The letter continuedAt the same time, he supported the new duty on superphosphate. Everybody knows that that duty is inoperative. That statement is another portion of a deliberate fabrication to deceive the shareholders; but it does not deceive the country. Another statement is:The duties were replaced by a sulphur bounty, but no Australian sulphur has yet been produced. In that paragraph also subtle deceit takes the place of truth. The Government never pretended that sulphur could be produced in Australia. Sulphur is not a constituent of superphosphates, but sulphuric acid is, and the Commonwealth has paid over £170,000 in the form of bounty on locally-produced sulphuric acid. Statements of this character, made deliberately for the purpose of misleading the public and honest co-operators who have invested in the company, are unworthy of the person who made them. In my opinion, the time has arrived when a royal commission should be appointed to investigate the operations of this company, which has been holding the farmers' money for years.

Particulars of such expenditure must afterwards be included Postmaster-General's Department, in a parliamentary appropriation. The Supplementary Estimates now submitted to members relate to the accounts of the year 1924-25. It is usual for such Estimates to be submitted after tlie annual report of the Auditor-General and the Treasurer's financial statement have been presented to Parliament. As the last Parliament closed shortly after the end of the financial year 1924-25, it was not possible for those documents to be laid on the table of the House before the new Parliament met in January, 1926. of the Commonwealth -The Pressure of business during the first period of this session was so great that there was no previous opportunity to bring forward Supplementary Estimates. the Department of The vote for the Treasurer's Advance for 1924-25 was £1,500,000, and the expenditure therefrom was £1,339,058.

I can recall the tariff imposed when the late Mr Tudor was Minister for Trade and Customs. It was discussed almost immediately afterwards. It is true that no considerable amendment of the tariff can be discussed immediately, but there is a vast difference between discussing a thing immediately and allowing it to remain undiscussed for twelve months or more. In the history of this Parliament there has been every session about it in a rush to reach recess, and we have consequently been denied opportunities for procedure proper discussion.

115,Mr Scullin,"I protest .against the delay in tabling the report of the Commissioner of Taxation. I asked the Treasurer the other day a question about the report, and he replied that it was being prepared. That report is usually laid on the table on the last day of the session. is the report of an officer who collects and controls more millions than any other department, except the Trade and Customs Department. of all the direct taxation imposed by the Commonwealth, and this report >s an account of his actions, and of the work of his department, for the year 1925-26. Honourable members are not being given a proper chance to discuss it . a previous occasion I had to protest that one of the Commissioner's reports w,as not presented for three years. Since then we have been presented with a report each year, usually on the last day of the session, and on one occasion within twenty minutes of the close of it . Before we can properly discuss the financial affairs of the country, we need the information that these reports contain respecting the collection, assessment, remission, and reduction of income and land taxation. only the olher day an important report relating to taxation remissions, and we have not had an opportunity to discuss it. I make no charges against the Commissioner of Taxation; but I hold that as the custodians of the public purse we should have within a reasonable time the information .which he is required by statute to supply to us.

Scullin. is not under a deep debt of gratitude to the officers of the Hansard staff. A claim for a revision of salaries was made on behalf of the officers twelve months ago, and no decision in respect to it has yet been announced. Six months ago a It definite promise was made by the President of the Senate (Senator Newlands) that the matter would receive attention, and several replies have been made since He has control then that it was being considered. Since the outbreak of the war the cost of livin g has risen by 74 peT cent., but the average increase in the salaries of our parliamentary officers has risen by only 25 per cent. Some officers, as a matter of fact, On have received only a 12 per cent, increase. The increase in the pay of the general public service has averaged 70 per cent., so that even the public officers outside of Parliament have not received enough to cover completely the increased cost of living, but the parliamentary officers, who are nearest to us, and under our eyes practically every day, have been left in a shocking position. I make an appeal for something to be done for them at once. Some officers of this ParliaThe Treasurer tabled ment who have held their positions for 20 years are receiving less than £4 10s. a week. of these men who will be transferred to Canberra, w ill 'actually have to incur debts in order to pay their way.

116,Mr Sculltn,It is a shame. Some,30,Honourable Members Shame
117,Mr Bowden,"Mr Speaker stated thisThe claim was made twelve months ago, and the increases should be retrospective. If private employers delay the hearing of claims before the Arbitration Court in the hope that they may save money, the judge takes care to frustrate them by making the new rates retrospective to the date of the claim. If we consider that that is a proper policy to apply to private employers, we should apply it to ourselves. It is easy to delay making awards, and then grant them only from the date on which a decision is reached; but it is not fair to .do it. I ask the Government to give every consideration to these claims. For many years the whole of the Commonwealth Government printing has been done in the Victorian Government Printing Office. I understand that we have paid half the expenses of the printing office; but it seems to me that, as a matter of grace, if not as a matter of justice, though, perhaps, the interests of both would be served, it would be a reasonable thing, now that the Commonwealth is about to sever its connection with the State Printing Office, for it to make a grant to the printing ofiice employees in recognition of their arduous work in our behalf. The employees there have often had to work from 5.30 p.m. till 4 a.m., and sometimes even for fourteen hours on end, to keep our work up to date. It would be a fitting thing for. the Government to make an inquiry and grant some monetary recognition to the men whom they consider deserve it.for their extra work. In conclusion, I feel constrained to urge again the fairness of giving immediate consideration to the claims that have been made on behalf of the parliamentary officers. I trust that, when this Parliament meets in its new home at Canberra, we shall change our methods considerably, and deal with our business in such a way that honourable members will be able to djgeuss it fully. I emphasize the remarks of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) respecting .the delay in tabling revised tariff schedules. I greatly regret that nothing is likely to be done in the near future to increase the timber duties. Some of the mills in New South Wales will probably have to cease operations before we shall be able to give consideration to this matter next September. I dislike the imposition of high duties, and am glad that we have constituted the Tariff Board to advise us in respect to the rate of duty which should be imposed on various commodities; but unfortunately, the board has been overwhelmed with work. It is highly desirable, in my opinion, that another member should be appointed to the board, and that the act should be amended to enable the commissioners to take evidence individually. The attitude that the Defence Department has adopted in meeting claims for compensation in respect of trainees who are killed in training operations is most unsatisfactory. The department, in cases where it is not proved that relatives are dependent on the trainees who lose their lives, makes a grant of only £15 towards funeral expenses. I am afraid that I must accept the responsibility for fixing that amount; though, on my own behalf, may I say that I increased it from £10? I now know that that figure is quite inadequate. The Navy Department has adopted the practice of making a grant of £50 in respect of the death of trainees on service, regardless of whether there are dependants; and that vote is not at all too large. It often happens that the family of the deceased trainee is not in a good financial position, and is sometimes seriously embarrassed in consequence of the expenses that must be incurred. I have in mind the death of a young man named Aitcheson, at the Liverpool camp last year. The father of the boy is a railway pensioner, and neither he nor his daughter could prove that there was any actual dependence upon the lad, who was in the last year of his apprenticeship. Both of them, however, were expecting to receive considerable help in the following year, when the youngman expected to begin work as a journeyman tradesman. Eventually the Military Department agreed to pay the whole of the funeral expenses of the boy, which amounted to about £30. I urge the Minister for Defence (Senator Glasgow) to make the practice in the Military Department uniform with that which is followed by the Navy Department. Our young men aro compelled to enter camp, and in the",30,Honourable Members Shame

Sitting suspended from 1 to 1.^5 p.m. I rise to join in the protest made yesterday by the honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann), and the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin), against the procedure adopted by the Government in introducing tariff duties in the dying hours of the session. I do not propose to discuss the merits or demerits of duties, either on rice or on iron and steel; but I pared literature-no t pounds of it, but protest against the highly irregular procedure that has been observed. On 12th August last the schedule of the iron and steel duties was laid before the House for permission to discuss the proposed the very day before the Parliament rose for the year. The schedule dealt with highly important items, and provided for heavy increases of duty on iron and steel, has been given to us to debate that matter. including fencing wire, wire netting, barbed wire, and other articles of first importance to the farming community. I recognize that no notice can be given by the Government of the introduction of such schedules, and it is true, as the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Company's shares were in strong demand. Pratten) remarked this morning, that it is not usual to have them immediately adopted; but, as indicated by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, at least some reasonable degree of decency should be observed in the matter. The iron and steel duties were brought down last year before the Tariff Board's inquiry into all phases of the industry had been completed. I believe that one copy of the board's report was in the hands of the Minister. The Leader of the Opposition saw it, but I did not, and have not yet seen it. Altliough a considerable time has elapsed since the schedule was presented, honourable members have not received the complete report of the board. been tabled, because it has not been comtheir profits; but the introduction in the pletely deal,t with by the Government. progress report? position all the more extraordinary. I worse than a crime. take it that the investigation has been completed, and the report is not yet procedure, and I protest against it. issued; but honourable members are entitled to the reasons for the introduction of the schedule. There was a carefully prepared plan of campaign in the agitation for the iron and steel duties. For many months prior to their introduction there were half-page and full-page advertisements in the press, calling attention to the importance of the industry. Simultaneously, there was an application to the Tariff Board, and evidence was given by highly skilled accountants on behalf of the companies interested. Nobody can complain about that. Our letter boxes were filled with expensive and well-preliterally hundred-weights of it. WhatI do object to, however, is that when the honourable member for Perth and I asked duties it was refused, and the House rose for the year. Now the present session is drawing to a close, and no opportunity I call attention to the manner in which tariff legislation influences the business community. The day after the presentation of the iron and steel duties there appeared a report in the Melbourne Herald stating that the BrokenH ill Proprietary The report showed that shares which, on the 31st of March were quoted at 26s. had, through successive stages, closed that evening at 32s. 4d. in an excited market. shares already 6s. above par? Post of the 14th August, the day after the House rose, announced that the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company advised having sent a cablegram to its office in London, stating that its profits for the year ended 31st May amounted to £303,000,. after allowing £293,000 for depreciation. I do not suggest that the Commonwealth Government is in league with the large dying hours of the session of legislation financial and business world should not be tolerated. -",31,Honourable Members Shame

It is a part of the rush policy of the present Government. Members of the Government appear to think that if they want to have anything done they must rush it . If you want to win an election, rush it . If you want to win a referendum, rush it-bu t in that case the rush tactics did not come off. I have no wish to make a party issue of this matter, but we are all deeply interested in the Tariff Board's reports. get them in time. them in proper time, and the Government should withhold legislation of this kind until honourable members an opportunity of digesting the Tariff Board's reports.

If he w ill look up the remarks I made in tabling the resolutions covering the iron and steel foreign duties in August last, he will find that the Tariff Board had reported certain things to the Government regarding the position of the whole industry, and that there was a threat from the continental steel trusts against the iron and steel industry of Australia, which demanded the most urgent action. I am proud to be able to say that, when these matters are discussed, figures will be submitted which will show that the imposition of these duties entirely checked the threatened assault on that basic industry. I said at the time of the introduction of that tariff schedule, and once or twice since, that the Government has not yet completed its consideration of the recommendations made with regard to the British side of that great basic industry. I say now, deliberately, that the Government has not yet finalized its policy with regard also to other items of the tariff. I am, however, very hopeful that in the not very distant f u ture we shall be able to submit up-to-date necessary tarilf legislation for the further protection of Australian secondary industries. can be quoted, I contend that the Government is pursuing a course which has the entire approval of a majority of the members of this House.

Another matter to which I wish to refer is the employment of Italians on public works. Asi n the course of the next ten years this Parliament will have voted some £20,000,000 for the construction of roads in Australia, it should be vitally interested to know who are to receive payment for work done on those roads. The Croydon Progress Association, in conjunction with the Australian Workers Union, haa made a protest in regard to the employment of Italians on road work, and according to a report in the Aye of the 16th of M a r c h district branch of A.W.U., yesterday reported having interviewed a Britisher who complained tliat he had been rejected by the contractor in favour of an Italian. This man had informed him that when he asked the contractor for a job the contractor told him that if ho were wanted ho would be sent for. Ho was not sent for, though afterwards foreigners were engaged. The man who was thus treated had enlisted from Australia, and on his return from the war set up as a dairy farmer, but was forced to relinquish it on account of adverse conditions. Unable to get sufficient work I want to tell the honourable to support his wife, he was sending her back to England, while he, disgusted at the treatment meted out to liim, was packing up his swag and going into the country to look for giving preference to foreigners was growing to be a common occurrence.

Some time ago 99 per cent, of the Australian population was of British origin ; to-day the percentage is down to 97 per cent. Is this dilution of our population to continue? It is high time that this Parliament adopted some policy which would ensure that 98 per cent, of Australia's population shall be of British origin. I have nothing to say against any man on account of the country of his origin ; but by means of the tariff, wages boards, and Arbitration Courts, we have built un in this country standards of living and working conditions which must be preserved, and the Government should do everything possible to prevent foreigners being admitted and given preference of employment to the detriment of the sons of Australians, many of whom are farmers and orchardists.",34,Honourable Members Shame

I add my emphatic protest to what has bei n already j said against the irregular and growing practice of tabling schedules of n«w tariff duties in the last moments of a series of parliamentary sittings. procedure is tantamount to holding members of this Housei n the utmost contempt; through the Minister for Trade and Customs the Government is holding us much top cheaply. The new duties on rice will increase the cost of living of every household in Australia. Rice is an important foodstuff that goes into universal consumption; yet the Minister for Trade and Customs tabled an increase of duty which will make this com modity more costly, and the duty immediately became operative without any explanation or justification of it having been offered to Parliament. The cost of living was thus increased by an arbitrary Ministerial action which I regard as entirely unjustifiable and unparliamentary. We had to submit to the same indignity-last year in connection with the new steel duties. The cost of what is a parent material in Australian industrial life was increased without the representatives of the people of the House' being consulted or allowed to express any opinion. principles"" cannot be suspect, for, except cm two occasions, I voted with the M i nister in support of last year's list of new Customs imposts. come ing the honourable gentleman testifying from his place in this House to the extraordinary .prosperity and increase of production and employment which have followed each new increase in the tariff. What is the true economic position ? In the great city of Melbourne the cost of in any other city of the world, with two exceptions, and a further increase is involved in the new rice duties which, without one word of explanation or discussion in Parliament, are now being collected. Despite all that the Minister has told us of the increased employment given by the fostered industries, the ratio of unemployment during the last four years has been higher than at any previous time in the history of this country, and it is almost twice as high as it was before the war. These facts are exceedingly serious, and should dissuade the Government from further increasing the cost of living with, possibly, a further increase in the ratio of unemployment, without giving to this House an opportunity to express its opinion. ThisI sincerely associate myself with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr. Scullin) in the plea he made on behalf of the staff of this Parliament. I have been familiar with many of these officers almost from the inception of federation, and I have had from thetm nothing but courtesy, kindness, and valuable assistance. I hope that the time is near at hand when the parliamentary staffs w ill be removed from the direct and special control of Parliament, and w ill , like all other public servants, have their conditions of employment regulated by the Commonwealth Public Service Arbitrator. [2.25] -S of a r as my knowledge goes, the Ministerf o r Trade and Customs was totally wrong in saying that the majority of members of this chamber approve of his action in tabling new tariff duties, and not affording Parliament an opportunity to discuss them.

A few days aeo I susrerested that the time has arrived living is already higher than for the tariff machinery to be overhauled. My own opinion is that the Tariff Board has become overloaded and unworkable. It consists of four members, three of whom represent the great secondary industries, and it is gradually assuming control, not only of the secondary industries, but also of the primary industries. In this way its scope. and power are being enormously increased, and it behoves Parliament to consider the effect of this development",35,Italian Labourers Employed Rochester Tuesday Th E Blue Metal Quar

If a trade war has started there, is it not obvious that there was a necessity for it; that the primary producers of New Zealand have revolted against the prices charged them? That was the casus belli, of which honourable members might well take notice. Meanwhile, our primary producers are paying 25s. a ton more for superphosphate than the primary producers of New Zealand, and to that extent are handicapped in the markets of the world. Our dairymen are to-day seeking an increase of the duty on butter, to protect themselves from the competition of the New Zealand dairymen, who are at a decided advantage, because they pay less for their superphosphates. Prime Minister something more than he has promised. I am sorry that he is not present in the chamber. I am not satisfied with his statement that an investigation of the position will be undertaken by Mr the raw material, and it cannot escape Clive McPherson, the newly-appointed Australian representative to the Phosphate Commission. I want a first class investigation industry of Australia, from the hewing of the phosphate rock to the manufacture want to know, on behalf of the Australian primary producer, if the rock is being hewn, put on board ship, and carried overseas on the most economical and scientific basis. A complete investigation should be made into the manufacturing process and method of distribution in Australia. I know Mr Clive McPherson, and I have a personal regard for him. He is a first class man of the land. The Minister may be assumed to be a man of the land, too, but he would scarcely have the presumption to investigate a highly scientific industry, and to decide whether the process of manufacture was economical or even right. ducer is not competent to undertake this inquiry into one of the basic requirements of the man on the land. I can point to the honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann) who served with distinction an an agricultural chemist in . Western Australia, and to other honourable members with long experience of primary production, who could be appointed to a if r . Rodger*. royal commission to investigate this subject. I would have no objection to Mr Clive McPherson being a member of such a commission. He is new to his office, and he has yet to familiarize himself with the whole conditions of the Phosphate Commission. business man. man of the land, and as such is not capable of undertaking an investigation of this description. He must rely upon second-hand information. He has no technical knowledge, and therefore could not, after inquiry, present to the Government a report that would satisfy it that he had scientifically and intelligently examined the industry from every possible angle. The Government is priI certainly expected from the marily interested in this matter, because it is in partnership with the Governments of Great Britain and New Zealand in this great enterprise. The Government is primarily responsible for the supply of responsibility for the conditions of manufacture in Australia. It has put its hand to the task, and it must not place the of the superphosphate industry entirely at the mercy of the trade. This subject is far too important for the Government, in the dying hours of superphosphates. I of this session, to brush aside, in the hope that it will be forgotten. It will not be forgotten by me or by the primary producers of Australia. The supply of superphosphates is fundamental to Australian production. To satisfy the primary producers, the Government should appoint a strongly equipped royal commission to investigate the industry from beginning to end. Such an inquiry would probably bring about a cheaper and more liberal and satisfactory supply of superphosphates. Why should the primary producers be supplied with superphosphates on a hand-to-mouth basis? The Prime Minister the other day, in reply to A primary promy statement, said that there was an excessive demand for superphosphates, and that the price had consequently increased. My experience . is that the greater the output the lower the cost of production. That is the economic factor in all businesses. An increased output means reduced costs of production and distribution.

I made a specific charge against the Government. 1 complained of the procedure adopted in presenting tariff schedules in the dying hours of the session, without permitting honourable members to have access to the reasons which actuated the Government in presenting them. I made no reference to the merits or demerits of high or low duties on iron, steel, or rice. Yet the Minister has seen fit to make a personal attack upon me. He made reference to my infrequent visits to this chamber; which presupposes that I am neglecting my duties as a representative of the people. That charge I emphatically resent. It ill becomes a Minister who, by the f u l l and free acquiescence of honourable members, obtained four months' leave of absence only this morning. The Minister also referred to the action that I the nexion with a certain engine contract. What on earth has an engine contract, entered into years ago, got to do with the speech I made to-day complaining about the introduction of tariff schedules in the dying hours of the session 1 The Treasurer went to my constituency last week and referred to the same thing. Both those honourable gentlemen know that by virtue of my position at that time as a member of the Cabinet, I am unable to make the most effective of all replies to that charge; but I go so far as to say-for I shall not sit down under this kind of treatment-that as the Minister for Works at that time. I made a certain recommendation, and I challenge the Minister for Trade and Customs, and the Treasurer, to read it to the com. mittee. I leave the matter at that. The Minister for Trade and Customs, in looking for something to allege against me, wandered to the field of dates, and waved most dramatically a document which-to use the phrase of the man in the street-wa s going to blow me "" kite high."" He read what he would ' lead honourable members to believe was unimpeachable evidence of my inconsistency. He said that a certain deputation introduced by me advocated a duty on dates, and when I asked him to read I the speech that I made in introducing the deputation, he did not do so. All he has proved is that a certain deputation, which I introduced, made a request for a duty on dates. When the time comes I shall make my attitude clear on that matter, or on any other, but the honourable gentleman jumped right away from the point that I made. I admit that he was hard up for an argument, and had to draw half a dozen red herrings across the t r a i l ; but, allowing for all that, he might have been a little more decent in what he said. He spoke of a sum of £250,000 that had been handed to the dried-fruits industry in the form of protection, but he did not say that those engaged in the industry are paying a much larger sum than £250,000 in the increased cost of production resulting from the protection of secondary industries. He did not say that they were receiving Australian prices for one-fifth of their produce, and were paying Australian prices for 100 per cent, of their requirements. Although the protection of the took when a member of industry has undoubtedly been responBruce-Page Ministryi n consible for its development, I challenge the honourable member-and he has plenty of secretaries to search the records for him -to point to one speech that I have made advocating duties or increased duties on dried fruits. WhatI have objected to is not the imposition of duties, for I am prepared to agree that in certain circumstances duties are permissible, but the continual increasing of duties. If the Government brought forward a proposal to remove all duties I should oppose it as vigorously as would the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Watkins)'., or the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton). I assert that the enormous revenue now being derived from Customs duties is of no value to the primary producers, and I respectfully suggest that it is doing no good to the secondary industries. I wish to join with my honourable friend, the member for Wannon( Mr Rodgers), in protesting against the increase in the price of superphosphate: and I join with him, also, in expressing the hope that the Prime Minister will grapple with this subject as one that calls for immediate action.

Tlie Minister was once a dairyman, and no one ought to be more conscious than he of the crisis that now faces the industry. if the Government and its advisers produce before January next a positive formula that w ill enable the dairyman to manufacture and export butter without the use of preservatives, and to land it in a condition that w ill admit of its being sold as first class butter. I make no apology for taking up the time of the House with this matter. This is the last opportunity I shall have to speak on this subject before the export season opens. I wish to read a short extract from the report of the Dairymen's Conference, held in August, 1926""Australian manufacturers of butter will be in a serious position from January, 1928, when the use of preservative in butter exported to Great Britain will be prohibited,"" said Mr J. Proud, at the butter factory managers' conference. Mr Proud is the representative of th« Association on the Australian Dairy Council. 'Tho Victorian butter manufacturers are unanimously in favour of the use of boric acif'i, and will lie particularly hard hit. The whole industry will have to face a most critical periorl on account of the British Govern meat's action."" The President of the Association, Mr L. YV. Lucas, said that on tlie whole non-boric butter entered for the Association's competitions was a failure. A serious crisis faces au industry which is, even to-day, struggling for its existence. No other industry has been so hard hit by economic conditions, and I should like from the Government a definite and positive assurance tha* it has taken fundamental action, and will be able to make an announcement shortly as to whether butter can be satisfactorily exported without the use of preservatives. The Government must have realized the seriousness of the position, because it approached the British Government and obtained a postponement of the date of operation of the regulation. In a country so wide, and with a climate so varied as ours, the problems associated with the production and marketing of butter are extremely difficult of solution. may be certain localities where, on account of climate, soil, or herbage, butter can be made without preservatives and shipped successfully; but in a hot climate the butter business is surrounded with serious difficulties.

Tasmanian apple-growers would not agree to the appointment to the board of men like the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Manning) or Mr Smith, M . L . C , of Victoria, who appear to have a set against Australian f r u it . The following sentence appears in the last report of our High Commissioner in London: Tasmanian apples were clean and well packed, but tlie apples packed in these cases were of a very common type. I have yet to learn what is a "" common type "" of apple. Possibly the officers who advised the High Commissioner consider that the Codlin, Ribstone, Hollow Crown, PrinceA l f r e d , and Alfriston are common apples. If so, I disagree with them. The High Commissioner's report also stated that thesie common apples were produced probablv from old trees. That shows how little the writer of the report knew about fruit-growing. trees grow f r u it which has better keeping qualities than the f r u it grown on new trees. cannot permit the honourable member to discuss the varieties of apples under this clause, for it deals with the appointment of the board. . the first documents that will be placed before this board after its appointment will be the High Commissioner's report, and I wish to give reasons why the report should not be seriously considered, insofar as it relates to apples. The board might decide that apples of the class I have mentioned should not be exported, and that would be fatal to the Tasmanian apple industry. the honourable member to deal with hypothetical cases. of Codlin apples is between 2\ and 3 inches. member must not continue along those lines. likely to have a much more serious effect upon Tasmania, than upon the mainland, for apple-growers on the mainland have a local market for their f r u it , while Tasmanian growers have to export the bulk of their f r u it . The bill is therefore of vital concern to Tasmania. The measure was introduced on Tuesday morning, and The was debated for ten hours. We had reached clause 5 when the debate was adjourned.

When I was recently in TasmaniaI was told by many growers, who were keenly interested in the matter, that while they would prefer to have three Tasmanians on the board they regarded that, after all, as a matter of minor importance, and were prepared to accept two. A t the outset of the board's operations there might be Old a slight doubt as to the attitude of the representatives of the various States; but soon the board would function very much as the board of directors of a company. During the last two years, the Dried Eruits Export Control Board has had. many discussions, and it has always come to unanimous decisions, although it is composed of four growers, and three commercial men, representing different States. Any distrust that may now exist regardthe proposed board will quickly disappear, because its members will adopt an Australian rather than a parochial view. am opposed to the amendment, to the clause, and to the whole bill. When the measure was brought forward before I was attending an important fixture in my electorate. The fruit-growers in the I cannot permit various States are not unanimously im favour of the Government's proposal, and I think that the Minister should be content with the boards of control that already exist. The GoT h e honourable vernment has constructed machinery for a form of control that it may some day wish to abolish. Boards have been appointed to deal with the export of butter and dried fruits', and in New Zealand even meat export is controlled in that way.

Australia do not ask for it . Tasmania produces more apples than the other States, but the quality of the f r u it is not superior to that grown on the mainhind of Australia. I notice that the bill provides for a representative of Western Australia. No better apples are obtainable than those grown in that State, except, perhaps, those of Victoria. support the amendment. half the apples exported from Australia are grown in Tasmania, and that State produces far more varieties than any other part of the Commonwealth. mania produces the best specimens of eating apples grown in the Commonwealth. I am in accord with that opinion ; but, after all, the most important consideration is the favorable judgment of the public of Great Britain. The Minister referred to the Dried Fruits Export Control Board, and suggested that the experience of that body showed that State differences were sunk. I point out that dried f r u it s are produced on the mainland, and the interests various mainland States are identical. But Tasmania grows different varieties of apples from those produced on the mainland, and if the other States, through their representatives on the board, placed an embargo on a number of varieties grown in Tasmania, that State would be injured in its export trade. further examination of the clause, I see that there are to be two represen tatives of Tasmania, one for Victoria, one for New South Wales and Queensland, and one each for .South Australia and Western Australia.

Howare we to know that the practice of appointing London agencies is working satisfactorily? takes Australian products out of the open market to sell them in a particular way, and we are entitled to know what has been the effect of this practice, and how the system of appointing London agencies of these boards has worked.

For tlie purpose of enabling tlie board effectively to control the export and tbe sale and distribution after export of Australian fresh fruits, tlie Governor General may by proclamation prohibit the export from the Commonwealth of any fresh fruits except in accordance with a licence issued by the Minister subject to such condition's ancl restrictions as are prescribed after recommendation to the Minister by tilie board. (2.) This section shall not apply to the export of fresh fruits to any port 'between the Ninetieth ancl One hundred and eightieth degrees of Kast Longitude and North of the Thirtieth parallel of South Latitude. In my opinion the passing of this clause will jeopardize the whole apple and pear industry.

Buyers came from Great Britain to Australia and spend, a great deal of money here in the purchase of f r u it .

If the board is given power to divert shipments of f r u it from, the ports to which they are consigned, many firms will not buy f r u it again in Australia. What would be the position of the wool growers to-day if. buyers did not come to Australia to buy wool ? The clause gives the board altogether too much A London agency power. The growers are to have the right to vote for representatives on the board, and I intend to go through my electorate and inform the growers that the bill is not what it was represented to them to be when the Minister for Markets and M i gration was in Hobart. I directed attention to this clause at meetings at which the Minister was present, and said that it would interfere with buyers sent from England to purchase f r u it in Australia. The Minister assured the meetings that it would not have that effect. I have since had a good deal of advice, and it seems that the board, under tihis bill, will have complete control of all the fruit s exported from Australia. Minister's responsibility for the action of the board 1 agencv of the board will have all power to deal with f r u it exported to England. its action here? clause is a very arbitrary one. The object of my amendment is to protect the operations of buyers of f r u it in Australia for oversea firms, and to ensure that the firms to whom Australian f r u it is consigned will have control of it when it is landed in England. [3.45] I have already indicated that I am opposed to the bill in its entirety. This clause, and clauses 19 and 20, are the vital features of the measure, and I propose to say a few words in support of the amendment. When speaking on the second reading, I quoted from the leading f r u it newspaper in support of my argument that this industry is not analogous to other industries which are already under control.

The main purpose of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Franklin is to retain the f.o.b. buyer. A great deal of the export trade-in some States 50 per cent, of it-is done through the f.o.b. buyer, who will not come into the Australian market to operate under the restrictions that are proposed in this bill. The position of the f.o.b. buyer of f r u it is different from that of the f.o.b. buyer of other primary products, and I suggest that the committee should bear that fact in mind. The bill provides that the buyer must first apply for a licence to export, which the board may or may not grant. Having been granted a licence, any contract for the shipment of the. f r u it abroad must be made by the board or in conformity with conditions approved by the board. If other control boards had been demonstrably successful, it would not necessarily be wise to extend the same system of control to fresh f r u it , but in any case the committee should not apply to the The anapple and pear industry, which is in need of all the assistance that can be given, a form of control which may make its position worse than it is at present. ter for Markets and Migration) [3.53] The honourable member for Franklin stated that the provisions of this bill are different from what I said they would be when I spoke in Hobart.

The best answer to the statement that f.o.b. sales will not continue if this bill is enacted is that f.o.b. sales do continue in the butter industry, despite the existence of a similar provision in the Dairy Produce Export Control Act passed by this House some years ago. from f r u it . tions of the two industries are analogous. The clause now before the committee is the vital part of the bill, and if the amendment were accepted we might as well throw the bill into the waste-paper basket, because it would be useless. The extent of the control to be exercised by the board under this and subsequent clauses would be set out in the conditions of the licence. The board would have no It does power to interfere with any business arrangements made by f.o.b. buyers, unless it included in the licence a. specific condition relating to such sales. It is inconceivable that members of the board, elected by the growers at a time when a huge majority are in favour of retaining the f.o.b. trade, would do something inimical to the growers' in terests, and break down a system in which they believe.

Much of the practice which governs them is unwritten. As every member of Parliament here, to I can only plead, Sir, on my ownwhatever* branch of the legislature ha Parliament belongs, will recognize, it is not only the Standing Orders which govern us, but a great traditional practice. The whole is In the cirsubject to the influence and government of what is called the feeling of the House, perhaps, which is supreme, and, in its very essence, depends upon public opinion.

That' is the very essence of our Parliamentary institutions. Every Minister It in office remembers that some day he must be in Opposition, and every Leader in Opposition hopes that some day he arms, and will be in office. The consideration which those reflections import is responsible for the high courtesy which characterizes the proceedings in our Houses of Parliament.

I have here, Mr Speaker, a roll upon which are recorded the names of those luho have joined in making the present which I am about to unveil, and I hope it will be accepted by you, Sir, on behalf of the Parliament, as a record. I have only, in conclusion, to express my humble thanks for the kindly attention with which you have listened to me, and our profound appreciation of the welcomethe "" brotherly"" welcome, if I may use the phrase-which you have afforded us. I can assure you that, to the last days of our lives, we shall recollect with gratitude the kindness of the people and Parliament of Australia. The Marquess of Salisbury having unveiled the Chair, the Speaker of the House of Representatives (the Hon. SirL ITTLET ON GROOM) then delivered the following address:My Lord and Members of the United Kingdom Branch of the Empire Parliamentary Association -The of the Commonwealth of Australia accepts most gratefully and with pride the magnificent aift which you have presented. It will long be treasured by the people of Australia as one of their' most sacred historic possessions. It stands here as a connecting link between the great mother of Parliaments and the free Parliament of the great Commonwealth of Australia, as emblematic of Parliamentary Government, and of our Parliamentary institutions. gift for which civilizaton has to be thankful to our nation, it is the gift of a model of a free Parliamentary institution. has presented that gift to all the great Dominions across the seas, and we here recognize that, in our legislature, we have a free people exercising its sovereign power through a well-known institution for the purpose of securing freedom, liberty, and justice amongst the citizens of the. Commonwealth. To-day, in your presence, we desire to express our grateIf we work in that ful recognition of this great inheritance. 'This Chair also stands for the authority of Parliament, for its honour and for its dignity. Be assured that this presentation will inspire us all as members with the desire to worthily maintain the traditions of that great Parliament across the seas. We do not forget that in a Chair like this, for a long period of time, a line of illustrious men has presided over the destinies of the House of Compnons. They have preserved its sacred privileges, and secured freedom of speech and liberty to all its component members. 'Their precedents arc accepted as rulings, binding all throunh the British Empire, wherever Parliamentary institutions exist, and by preserving these precedents and, following them, we have been able to secure that full-matured deliberation of measures combined with freedom of discussion that is absolutely essential for the making of sound laws and the maintenance of a great nation. We are grateful to that line of speakers for their fine traditions, and this Chair will ever be a reminder to us for their grand work. It speaks also, from the historic associations connected, with it, of the great statesmen who have spoken and offered their views before such a chair in the Parliament mother of Parliaments. We in this land are ever grateful to those statesmen, great men of the past, who by their wisdom, judgment, and foresight have rendered it possible to build up the Empire on the stable foundations of self governing communities. We are not forgetful of our historic past. We know, as far as we are concerned in Australia, that the history of our people does not begin from the date of the occupation of this continent by the British. For the proper If there is one understanding of our very existence, and what rights and privileges we possess, we have to go back to that island across the seas. We study these rights and priviThe mother of Parliaments leges and take pride in them, deriving inspiration from them for the building up of the Greater Britain across the seas. We gratefully acknowledge to you our indebtedness to our Motherland. When we gaze upon this Chair we shall be ever mindful of those traditions, and will be careful that Australia will derive from this Chair in this building fresh inspirations to enable us to follow in the steps of your great land. Not only with admiration shall we look upon this Chair, but with deep-rooted affection and goodwill. This is a unique ceremony. We are about to commence the enactment of national legislation in our own home here in Canberra, where, we hope, free from the dominating influence of any State to express the will of the Australian people, so that our laws may reflect the matured judgment of the whole of the citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia. are a new country facing new conditions, necessarily taking a new outlook upon things. We are adapting old principles to new conditions. turned towards the seas regarding the history of our own race, hoping that, by the guidance of the wisdom and experience of statesmen of the past, we, too, may temper our actions in the future so that we may develop a greater nation here in the Commonwealth of Australia. rejoice that this is an occasion when all parts of His Majesty's Dominions are here to express their goodwill to us. We all are here in the spirit of unity. By the personal touch.we have been privileged to enjoy the grip of the hand of true feUowship. May we henceforth cherish the vision of that brotherhood, of the great commonwealth of nations, realizing our ideal, so that it may be an organization for the maintenance of the peace of the world, and the promotion of the material and spiritual welfare of all peoples. We thank you for this gift. It will be dear to us because it is from the hands of you whom we know to be members of each of the parties of the House of Commons, who have sent us some of their most capable representatives. We feel honoured by your visit, and I hope, Sir, when you return, vou will tell your colleagues in both Houses how truly grateful we are for this magnificent and historic gift, and that you will also convey to the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom our apvreciation of the kind wishes conveyed in his most welcome letter. The Hon. EARLE Prime Minister) -On people, the Parliament and the Government of Australia, I tender to the Members of the United Kingdom Branch of the Empire Parliamentary. Association our thanks for the gift of this Speaker's Chair, ivhich is to grace the National Parliament in its own permanent home here in Canberra. We are deeply sensible of the honour which has been done us by the visit of the leader of the Delegation which is presenting this chair-a man who not only has rendered notable service to the Empire, but comes of a family whose distinguished services have been valuable to the nation for hundreds of years. The people of Australia very deeply appreciate this practical expresWe sion of interest, on the part of the British Parliament, in the establishment of the Federal Capital of Australia. Next year we are to have a further demonstration Our eyes are still of that interest in this venture of ours when their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of York will come to Australia to open the first sitting of the Parliament, in this its permanent home, just as 26 years before His Most Gracious Majesty the King opened the first session We of the Federal Parliament which was then housed in its temporary quarters in Melbourne. We feel that the establishment of this national capital will do much to promote an all-Australian sentiment. It will teach us to think more and more of Australia as a united whole, and also to foster a more intense Australian patriotism. We deeply appreciate this gift to the Australian Parliament from the mother of Parliaments-a gift to the future, as well as the present legislators of Australia. The Chair will be a fitting and abiding reminder of the loving bond of unity between the British people and this Parliament, and, in fact, the Parliaments throughout the whole of the British4 Empire. There is no doubt that the sentiment which binds the Empire is founSded largely on the kinship of blood, b'ut, to a very large extent, it is due also to the Parliamentary institutions throughout the Empire. These institutions, which sprang from the British people, whose emblem is really in the Chair you have presented to us, stand for the security of the people in all those PAGE (Acting matters that affect the liberty, freedom, behalf of the and welfare of the nation. The material of which the Chair is constructed, quite apart from its beautiful this is the first ceremony that has taken workmanship, makes it of special interest to us. Part of its wood, we understand, has been drawn from Westminster, from the mother of Parliaments itself. It will be to us always a reminder of the wisdom of the statesmen of that great Parliament, and the eloquence of its orators. It will bring vividly to our recollection the illustrious Speakers who have presided over the House of Commons, and have there shown, as the nobie Marquess has said, how well Parliamentary institutions work in Englisli-speaking countries. Another part of the material of the Chair comes, we understand, from HMS. "" Victory,"" Lord Nelson's flagship at Trafalgar. interest to us. The sight of British oak, drawn from that source, will not only remind us always of the steadfast character of the British people, in prosperity or adversity, bub also of the national victory of Trafalgar, as the outcome of which' the Empire has had undisputed supremacy of the seas for the last century and a quarter. That was really the factor which permitted the sound and safe development of the various colonies established by Britain throughout the world, permitted the growth of our nationhood, and made possible the formation of the great British commonwealth of nations, which is now becoming a most potent factor in the prosperity and progress of the world. We feel that a Chair, drawn from such sources, will afford inspiration to our statesmen, and assist us to build up gradually a tradition which will be not umuorthy of those with which the mother of Parliaments endowed us at the beginning of our national existence. I have much pleasure, Mr Speaker, m moving a very hearty vote of thanks to the United Kingdom Branch of ihe Empire Parliamentary Association for this_ gift to the Australian Parliament and to the Australian people. Opposition in the House of Bepresentatives) -I seconding the motion which has just been moved by the Hon. the Acting Prime Minister (Dr. Earle Page). It is true, as Mr Speaker said, that this is a unique occasion. It is unique not only because place in the new home of the Commonwealth Parliament, but also because we have gathered here in the Federal Territory more representatives of the Empire Parliaments than have ever before met in conference. I am very pleased thai we have the delegates with us, and thai they have been able personally to present to the Australian Parliament this beautiful Chair, which you, Sir, at present adorn. While listening to those who have preceded me it occurred to me that the description of the British Parliament, as the mother of Parliaments, is most apt. So far as our own Parliament is conIts wood is of special cerned, every time a difference of opinion arises on a question of procedure, it is debated upon both sides of the House, and then you, Mr Speaker, promptly quote May to us, and rule accordingly. That is the beginning and the end of the matter. The relationship of the several portions of the Empire may be likened to that of the members of a family with each other and with their mother. When a member of a family is about to set up a home for himself or herself, the mother will present him or her with some token of affection and goodwill. 'That gift, whatever it may be, is always regarded by the recipient as the most valuable in his or her home. Members of the Federal Parliament, and may I go further and say the people of Australia, will realize that this Chair, the gift of our Mother across the sea, indicates that, although thousands of miles separate us, she does not forget us in Australia. Nothing could have been presented to this Parliament which would better convey to us the goodwill of the members of the British Parliament. The gift of this replica of the Speaker's Chair in the House of Commons, by Members of the United Kingdom Branch of the Empire Parliamentary Association, will evoke the admiration of every Australian citizen. I hope that when the delegates (Leader of the return to their homes, after what we all trust will be a pleasant sojourn here, they have very much pleasure in will take with them a wider understanding of our problems in Australia, and that Ihe free and frank exchange of views will be followed by a solution of some of the difficulties that confront us. I would",48,Parliamentary To Our Colleagues In The Parliament

Sir LITTLETON going to ask those present to break away from Parliamentary carry the motion in an extra-Parliamentary way. An additional advantage will accrue from that procedure in thai it will enable Australian citizens, who are not Members of Parliament, and who are with us to-day, to join in the adoption of the motion.

In making this motion I desire to voice the appreciation of this Parliament, and, I believe, of the people of Australia, of the courtesy of the Government, the Parliament, and the people of Victoria, for having made this building available to the Commonwealth Parliament since the [42] commencement of federation. We shall have an opportunity, on another occasion, to acknowledge our obligation more fully, Parliament, it being proposed to invite the members of the Parliament of Victoria to a banquet in this historic building before we Canberra. But as we are now terminattradition and to ing our last meeting in Melbourne, the Government feels that, as good tenants, we should not only leave this building in good order, but should also do something to provide a memorial in it of the fact that, for the first 26 years of federation, the Commonwealth Parliament sat in these halls. The bill of which I have moved the second reading provides for an appropriation of £50,000 to meet the cost of such a memorial. Every member will, I think, agree to this proposal. This Parliament first met here when no man knew what would be the result of the experiment in government that was then being entered upon. To-day the people of Australia realize the great benefits of federation. Those who were the peoples of a number of separate colonies have been welded together into one great nation, which passed through the crucible of war and has proved itself worthy to enjoy the great destiny which we hope awaits it. The statutes which embody the great Australian ideals of to-day were initiated in this chamber, and came into existence during the years in which this Parliament has sat here. The briefest survey will show how much that period of political history means. The White Australia policy, which aims at the purity of our race and the preservation of the highest standards of social and economic life, was first enunciated here, and was here carried into effect. Within these halls we have seen the fashioning of all the legislation on which to-day we pride ourselves; here we have established au Australian Navy, and an Australian system of defence. During the past quarter of a century Australia, from being almost a dependency of the British Crown, has become one of the great self-governing peoples which constitute the commonwealth of British nations. It is desirable, therefore, that there should be a permanent memorial of the period during which the Federal Parliament has sat here,",52,Parliamentary To Our Colleagues In The Parliament

I sincerely hope that when the Victorian Parliament reassembles in this building it will keep alive the best traditions that were created by it when it met here before federation. I congratulate the honkins) and those other honourable members whose association with this Parliament has been continuous throughout the period of Commonwealth endeavour. their membership will long continue at what we might call another "" other place."" I congratulate you, Mr Speaker, I say upon the fact that, after a quarter of a century of parliamentary life, you are well in the flesh, and in the chair are upholding the honoured name which was referred to by the Postmaster-General( Mr Gibson). I have no claim to speak in this chamber on this occasion other than that in my own small way, with manifold shortcomings, I have endeavoured to Although the circumuphold those traditions to which I have referred. Politicians receive many hard knocks. No doubt, they enjoy compensating privileges, but I believe that very few people outside recognize how strenuous is parliamentary work, how great a toll it takes, and how great a d r a f t it is upon the vitality of the men who conscientiously do their duty. However, we can but do our best in our day and generation. Leaving this chamber with grateful recolI n memory at lections of those who have gone before us, we can go back to the let our salutation be"" Australia F e l i x !

This is so unique in my experience that I propose to put the letter in Hansard, and will do my best, as requested, to fight against the combine that is unjustly controlling the amusements of the people throughout Australia. The letter I have received is as follows: Dear Sir, I am desired by the City Council to bring under your notice that a company has been formed in Australia whioh controls the selling and performing of practically all the saleable music which has been composed throughout the world during the past 50 years. This company has notified the council, and, I understand, other public bodies controlling halls, that licence fees must be paid in respect of such halls, otherwise the authorities controlling the halls will render themselves liable to prosecution for a breach of the Copyright Act if the performance of musical, literary, or dramatic works-the performing rights of whioh are held by the eompany-is allowed therein. It is considered by the council that the claims of the company in question are unreasonable; but, unfortunately, under the law at present existing, this eompany may have power to enforce most of its demands. The council considers that an act should be passed by the Federal Parliament to provide I hope that the owner of a hall who hires or letB the same to any person shall not for the purposes",56,Adjournment Valedictory Remarks

I am, therefore, directed by the council to request you, as one of tlie city's parliamentary representatives, will endeavour to assist in securing the introduction of the desired legislation. When the proposal was made to vote £50,000 for the improvement of this building, I would, but for the occasion, have raised a protest against the Government leaving the splendid post office in Elizabeth-street characterized attached to that fine building as a t in can tied to the tail of a noble dog. I wish to endorse every remark of the speaker who so eloquently the references to the final meeting of the Parliament in this chamber, and those of my beloved friend, the honourable member for Newcastle, the only honourable member now present who was a member of the first Parliament It is with feelings of regret that I speak on this subject. Thirty-eight years ago in this very month I came into this chamber, and picked out my seat directly to the Gillies and Deakin Ministry. was informed by the Clerk of the Parliament that only ex-Ministers were allowed to sit on that seat. I have lived to see that seat occupied by a galaxy of men, not one of whom had been an ex-Minister, and that was when the Labour party first formed the official Opposition, and occupied these benches. eloquence that fell from the lips of Judge Higinbotham, nized the injustice done to the workers. When the so-called masters of that day would not meet the workers in conference, he felt the injustice so much that while the refusal continued he contributed a week to the funds for the support of the women and children of the strikers. For that humane act his name will be honouredby the workers for all time. remember how, as an entomologist a moth with a pin, he impaled with his power of debate the great Mr .Rogers, of the Colonial Office. Years later, I heard him deliver a speech full of eloquence, acknowledged the resolution conveying to him the thanks of Parliament for his great work in consolidating and simplifying Dr. Maloney. laws of Victoria. He also removed the words "" master and man "" replacing them with "" employer and employee."" I held in my arms the first Speaker of the Federal Parliament as he expired in the corner of this cham-' ber, and, within too short a time afterwards, stood in sorrow in the Queen's H a l l beside the lifeless form of a former Minister of the Crown( Mr Roberts), who had collapsed alongside the statue of Queen Victoria. Sir, I was not in this Parliament when your dear father was here; but memories of him have been told to me, by Queensunfinished. I have land representatives especially, and I am the miserable annexe glad that you, whom I have known as always f a i r and just, and, above all, a most courteous man, are occupying a seat in the chamber to which he brought honour. introduced And 1 hope that when the time comes for you to vacate the Speaker's chair, you will be succeeded by another as worthy as yourself. Mr Charles McDonald was the first Speakeri n Australia to discard the traditional wig. As Speaker and as a of the Commonwealth. man he was beloved by every member on either side, and I hope I may give no offence by confessing that many times I thought he was not just to me and my opposite party when he gave preference in his call I to members of the opposite party. But I know that he was animated always by a rigid sense of justice. I say of him and the other dear dead whom I have known and loved in this chamber, God rest them! I hope that when our t u r n comes to pass through the shadows, we shall be greeted on the other side by every one whom we I have listened to the have loved and lost in this life. Having represented the district in which I was a Chief Justice who recogborn, either in the Victorian Parliament or the Federal Parliament, since March, 1889, I cannot but feel grief at leaving this building. But, being of a hopeful disposition, I believe I shall live to sec £10 on the statute-book of the Commonwealth Parliament the power of the electors expressed in the initiative, the referendum, and the recall. That is the only plank I that remains unfulfilled of the platform secures upon which I was elected in 1889. I have had a hard fight to get that principle accepted. It took a quarter of a century to induce the most powerful newspaper in dignity, Victoria, the Age, to adopt it , and I take and feeling, in which he this opportunity to pay the tribute of a grateful heart to that journal for having done more than any other agency to imthe plant that great democratic principle in the mind of the Australian people. Second only to it , is Australia's greatest weekly newspaper, The Bulletin, which also has adopted the principle. The Australian Natives Association, the largest and most powerful friendly society in our continent, also has subscribed to it . Once to its eternal honour, the Nationalist party accepted the principle, but through some malign influence did not put it upon its platform. I wish I had the opportunity to physic the men who put that obstacle! in the path of a great reform. The eminent Gladstone and, later, Lord Salisbury, father of the nobleman who visited Australia recently, advocated the referendum. Nestlingi n the bosom of the Alps, Switzerland, the political genius of all nations, in whose parliament three languages are spoken, has the initiative, the referendum and recall in operation. W it h that love of freedom which is characteristic of all mountain peoples, the Swiss have embodied that triumph of democracy in their constitution. When people object that it cannot be adopted in Australia, because of our great distances, I have replied, "" The difficulty was much greater in the Federal Parliament of Switzerland, in which three languages are spoken, than in a country where the people from north to south and from east to west speak, write, and think in the same language."" If a line is drawn from north to south through the great TJnited States of America all the states on the left side of it , with one exwelfare of the citizens of the Oommonception, have in operation in some form the initiative, referendum, and recall, and all but three of the eastern states can make the same proud boast. I wish that a splendid map of the TJnited States of America, published in the Age, could be shown in every school roam in Australia. My ears have drunk in the eloquence of Edmund Barton, the first Prime Minister of Australia. Those who care to refer to Hansard may read my eulogy of him at the time of his death. On that occasion I expressed my regret that when Sir Samuel Griffith, the first person in the history of the world to hold the position of Chief Justice of a continent, retired from the bench, the government of the day did not appoint Mr Justice Barton to the position, that he might thus fittingly complete one of the most illustrious careers in the history of Australia. Of the orators I have heard in this chamber, two stand out in my recollection, one was William Shiels, whose speeches in Hansard will repay reading by any honourable member, and the other, and most eloquent of all, was A l f r e d Deakin. How often have I sat here and admired him. L if e is but a brief span; I hope that I may be spared to live a few more years, but whenever my call comes I trust that I may go as suddenly as did thp first Speaker of this chamber. Despite vhe heat and occasional bitterness of political strife, I have always given to every honourable member, regardless of the party to which he belonged, credit for honesty of purpose. Deep down in the heart of each of us is love of Australia and humanity, and each is trying with such capacity as the good God has given him, to make the world the better for his having lived. though I am one of the comparatively new members of this chamber, I experience some of that reminiscent sentiment that must possess the older members to a more marked degree on the eve of leaving these legislative halls. When 38 years ago I first came to Melbourne, and saw James Patterson, George Turner, A l f r e d Deakin, and many of their contemporaries coming to this building, the most handsome in Australia, I scarcely realized what business they were about. As years passed one began to realize the importance of their work. When a person who has been entrusted with the wealth, looks back upon the work of those men, he can appreciate what they did. We are leaving this place, and I feel certain regrets. I think, however, that we are going to our proper place. We owe a debt of appreciation to the people of Victoria for allowing us to be their guests for 26 years. I trust that when we transfer the Parliament to Canberra we shall there continue the labours that have for that long period been carried on here with benefit to the people of Australia and credit to those who conduct the affairs of the Commonwealth. We feel regret at leaving, a place that we have occupied for years, because we have felt the homeliness of the building even if the atmosphere of this chamber has not been so healthy as we should have liked. Nevertheless, our associations in this State have been all that could be desired, and we appreciate the hospitality that we have",57,Adjournment Valedictory Remarks
275,Mr Prowse (Forrest) [5.50],"Alhad in this great and handsome city of Melbourne. though this is not the end of the session, it is really the end of the meetings in Melbourne of the Parliament of the Commonwealth, and speaking on behalf of the Opposition, I wish, Mr Speaker, to express to you our appreciation of the way in which you have presided over our deliberations in this chamber since your election at the commencement of the present session. I do not think that any one will contradict me when I say that you have filled your position with credit, and have honorably carried on the traditions of your predecessors. You have been uniformly courteous and impartial, and no one could expect more consideration and help than you have shown to the members whose deliberations you control. The observance of the forms of the House, and the upholding of the dignity of this national parliament, require net only the services of a good Speaker, but also the co-operation of honourable members, and that co-operation is impossible when there is any sense of unfairness respecting the actions of the Speaker. We have confidence in you because of your impartiality, and even though occasionally we may not have thought your rulings to be correct, we have bowed to them without protest, knowing that you endeavour at all times to act with scrupulous fairness. I should like also to thank the clerk and officers of the House for the arduous work which they have done in our service. They have been unfailing in their attention to their duties, and because of that the wheels of parliament, have ru n smoothly. Of the Hansard staff, I would say that every member of it is a capable officer, and their reports have been done well, and more than well on many occasions. As for the other officials of tihe House, and the messengers, everything in their power has been done to make the tasks of members lighter. On behalf of this side of the HouseI thank them for their services. I trust that we shall meet you, Mr Speaker, the clerks at the table, the members of the Hansard staff, and the other officials, messengers, and attendants of this House at Canberra, and that the pleasant relations which now exist between them and honourable members will continue unimpaired. Groom) I appreciate the kindly referpride and satisfaction in the knowledge ences to myself and to my occupancy of the Chair, but I must admit that were it not for the courtesy and hearty cooperation of honourable members my office might not have been so successful as perhaps it has appeared. I greatly appreciate the consideration and respect which honourable members have paid to me personally, and the assistance which has been given by the officers whose services so materially aid our deliberations. We cannot but feel a deep emotion now the hour has struck when we must leave for ever this historic chamber. Inevitably during the past week, as we have sat within these walls, the recollection of those who have gone before have filled our minds, and we have, perhaps, felt something of their lofty inspiration in our work. A sentiment of gratitude to the people, the Parliament, and the Government of Victoria for all that they have done to make our stay here pleasant is mingled with our regret at going. Our relations with the State authorities have been at all times of the kindliest and most agreeable nature. They have been more than generous in the privileges that they have given to the members of the Eederal Parliament. We leave with a deep sense of goodwill towards them, and we believe that our good relations will continue when we are at Canberra. We look back to the beginnings of our national life, when we launched the ship of state upon what was practically an uncharted sea. Very heavy were the responsibilities laid upon the statesmen who first occupied the federal benches at the commencement of the nation's career. The bias that was then given was to determine the future devolopment of Australia, and despite the criticisms levelled at them at the time from all sides, their politics were characterized by the vision of statesmanship. They did not look to establish their own positions, but took a broad Australian view. They had belief in this young country, and were confident that it would gain in the years to come a prominent position in the British Empire, and possibly take its place among the nations of the world. They .came with high ideals, and cherished and maintained them. Now, after 26 years of legislation, a great many of those ideals have been realized, and have become an integral",59,Adjournment Valedictory Remarks
