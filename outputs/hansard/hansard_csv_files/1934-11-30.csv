I can form my own judgment in regard to the attitude of the honourable member. I believe that it coincides with the judgment of many other honourable members. I proceed, then, to reply to the question. The reason for the appointment as Parliamentary Underthe Secretary of the honourable gentleman who is dealing with employment, is to give him higher status than he would have were he merely Director of Employment. As Parliamentary Under-Secretary he has access to the Cabinet on all occasions when it is dealing with the matter of unemployment. me that before? to-day that he has access to the CabinetI asked a straightwhen matters affecting employment are being dealt with. That very fact, I think, justifies the attitude which I adopted towards the honourable member, who ought to set a better example to honourable members of this House. appointing a parliamentary under-secretary for employment did the Government follow the precedent set by a Labour government in South Australia four years ago, and will the Prime Minister confer with the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin) in the matter, with a view to avoiding a repetition of the unpleasant happenings which led to' the resignation of the person so appointed in South Australia ? precedent referred to by the honourable member, but I understand that a previous Commonwealth Government established & precedent when it appointed a parliamentary under-secretary.

( Mr Menzies). Hpwever, I waive that The matter was referred to the Prime aside, being content to let the public Minister, Mr Asquith, and later, judge for themselves the justice of the action was taken by Sir Rufus case. I first became concerned over this Isaacs and Herbert Samuel in a claim subject when, upon the advice of a wellagainst Mr Cecil Chesterton for known journalist, I attended one of the sittings of the royal commission which wag inquiring into the petrol industry. The room in which the inquiry was being held all the advocates appearing foT the oil combine to get seats at the table. They were led by the most important legal man in the State of Victoria-the Attorney-General-and there were no fewer than nine altogether. There was not one legal man representing the public. I make no accusation whatever against the commission, of whom the members were Messrs. S. F. Lamb, H . J. I Gunn, and J. Hancock. They are as acting in the capacity-of judges. There was an officer in attendance appointed by the Government to assist the commission, but no legal man had been briefed to cross-examine the witnesses for the combine, though the witnesses against the combine were rigorously cross-examined by counsel which the combine had retained. The sense of injustice aroused in me was so strong that I resolved that I should try from my place in ParliaI have now ment to prevent such a thing ever occurring again. I am anxiously awaiting the appearance of the report of the commission, as I believe that it will be of great use to Australia, and will assist those who are fighting against what is the most powerful combine in the world. Be that as it may, I wish to recall the connection of Lord Reading, formerly Sir Rufus Isaacs, with the Marconi interests while he was Attorney-General in the British Government. The case was referred to at the time as the "" Marconi Scandal."" Sir Rufus IsaacB was bitterly attacked by Mr Cecil Chesterton, brother of the great G. K. Chesterton. In the Eye Witness he stated bluntly: "" Isaacs' brother, Samuel, is chairman of the Marconi Company. It has, therefore, been secretly arranged between Isaacs and",15,Attorneys^General An D Private Practice Formal Motion For Adjournment

61,Dr. Maloney (Melbourne) [11.10].,"damages for defamation. Mr Justice Darling heard the case. The defendants put in an expression of regret and full apology. Nevertheless a very strong team of advocates, headed by Sir Edward Carson and Mr E. E. Smith, was briefed by the plaintiffs. Had Sir Rufus Isaacs made any money by taking these shares neither he nor Mr Lloyd George, who shared them, would have risen to the great positions they attained in their political careers. Luckily for Sir Rufus, he lost money on the shares he had bought. He had purchased them believing that the Marconi Company concerned-the American company-ha d nothing to do with the English company in London. Luckily for him the shares dropped in value, but the public outcry which followed this case emphasized the intense feeling against any suggestion that a British Attorney-General should go outside his position to make money, and gives rise -72 the conclusion that such action on the part of such an officer would have condemned him to certain oblivion so far as his parliamentary .career was concerned. During the whole of the time this case was being tried in court, Sir Rufus had the decency to follow the well established English precedent of absenting himself from his seat in Parliament. The chairman of the committee, which was formed to inquire into the matter, reported that Sir Rufus had acted in perfectly good faith, believing that the American company in which he had bought shares was not connected in any way with the solvency, success, or contracts of the English company. To the honour of Sir Rufus Isaacs let it fee said that he would never have done what he did had he realized the consequences of his action or the assumptions that would be based upon it. So much for Lord Reading! I come now to the case of Sir William Irvine. The Marconi Company was again involved. Apparently it secures on its behalf the services of the highest whether these men happen to be members of a government or not. I maintain, however, that any gentleman holding the high and sacred position of Attorney General should never, on any account, accept from such a collection of human Dr. Ufaloney. beings as the oil control whether they be combines, individuals or corporations. I could not imagine a Higinbotham or a Higgins, or even a gentleman of the type of Mr Latham, who has just vacated the position of Attorney-General in this Parliament, doing such a thing. When Sir William Irvine was accused of being in the pay of the Marconi Company, the only difference between his case and that of Sir Rufus Isaacs was that he made money out of the shares he held and retained it. whereas Sir Rufus lost money. Furthermore, Sir William Irvine followed an unprecedented course which only such a man as he would follow-h e remained in Parliament while his case was, as it were, being tried by his colleagues; and when the division took place he was saved by one vote, that vote being the majority by which the Cook Government held office. Let me now refer to the Stavisky scandal which caused such a stir in France, and caused the public throughout the world to believe that judges, Attorney-Generals, and even members of Parliament were controlled by Stavisky for his own fell designs. Dealing with tliis case the Fortnightly Review, of March, 1934, statedThe immediate reactions of this scandal have been political and professional. Among the latter is a severe decree issued by the Ordre des Advocate, which declares that a barrister who is also a deputy, must not in future appear in any case for or against the Government, and must not defend or advise any one accused of a crime connected with a public appeal for money for the director of a company so accused. I have been informed by one who is conversant with French law that this provision will in future absolutely prevent any member of the French Parliament from acting as an advocate in any case against his country or the interests of his people. So much for the Stavisky scandal! I shall now deal with an incident legal authorities available which occurred in the New South Wales Parliament. . A motion similar to mine was moved in that parliament by a private member. . So severe were the strictures passed in the course of the debate on the actions taken by those who any fee or emolument sat on the Government benches that many statements had to be withdrawn. Ultimately the discussion resulted in a 1893, page 1742, in which Sir George memorable division-the ayes securing Dibbs, dealing with the resignation of 69 votes and the noes 48. In consequence B. R. Wise a3 Attorney-General in the of this decision, Mr Edmund Barton, Parkes Ministry, saidthe then Attorney-General, and MrB . E. O'Connor, Minister for Justice, the same tions. When the honourable and learned memnight, resigned their positions. Dealing ber with this ease, the Honourable George Attorney-General Black, in vol. 3 of A History of New demning the honourable member. Whatf o r t South Wales Political Labour Party, of That he marked his own briefs as Attorneywhich he was one of the founders, saidOn 7th December, 1803, C. A. Lee (member for Tenterfield during 33 consecutive years) on a motion of adjournment, discussed a recent declaration by the Attorney-General (Edmund Barton, QC.) to the effect that: "" The Railway Department, ae regards the Crown Law Department, had ceased to be a department of the Crown, and, therefore, that the Attorney-General and other members of the Cabinet were entitled to appear against the Railway Commissioners in the law courts "". This announcement was so clearly made in order to permit the heads of the Crown Law Department-Th a General and the Minister for Justioe-to earn large fees by appearing for the great railway contractors, Proudfoot, McSharry, and others, then continually before the courts, that the House was eager to show its disapprobation of what was generally viewed as dishonest and disloyal behaviour. audacious and abusive (juibbling in defence did not better the position, nor did his ad misericordia-m statement that an adverse vote would cover him, "" a n honourable man . . . with infamy and dishonour"". Cook said, "" It sounded like an appeal from Dr. Jekyll for mercy for Mr Hyde"". Nor did Crick's threat, that the Ministry would resign if an adverse vote were taken, prevent a number of the Government's followers from voting against them, and so the numbers for the ayes were 69 and for the noes, 48. Of those who were originally returned as Labourites, Gough, Hutchinson, Johnston, Morgan, Murphy, Newton, Nicholson, and Sheldon voted with the Government. Despite Crick's threat that the Ministry would resign if the control of the House were taken out of its hands, Dibbs excused himself on the following day (8th December) for clinging to"" office by saying that he refused to be dismissed by a snatch vote (of 117 out of 141 members) and thereupon adjourned the assembly until 16th January, 1894. In the interim, he purged the Cabinet of some portion of its delinquencies by securing the resignation of Barton and R. E. O'Connor from the positions of Attorney-General and Minister for Justice. The marooning of those members of the crew did not, however, cleanse the administration ' from complicity in the eyes of the country. Dibbs was doomed to dire defeat, and his followers already felt it the Hast:in their bones. I have here also an extract from New South Wales Hansard, of 7th December, I only desire to make one or two observafor South Sydney, Mr Wise, was in the Parkes Administration, I placed a motion on the paper conGeneral in the Crown Solicitor's Office, and that a gentleman in his position had no right to receive a salary from the Government for performing the work of Attorney-General and to mark his own briefs, and thus estimate the value of his own services. That is what I called the attention of the House to by motion, and 1 presume that is the reason why the honourable and learned member retired from the Parkes Administration. No man can serve God and mammon; no man can serve two masters; no man should be allowed to take money from Attorneyhis country, and, at the same time take money, in the shape of fees, or in any other way, to fight against the interests of his country on behalf of any combine or oil company. If this question were put to the people I would stake my Barton's .political existence on my claim that they would uphold the views I have just expressed. I am reminded of the betrayal jof Christ by Judas, as described in holy As Joseph writ. Whence came the 30 pieces of silver which Judas took? They did not come from. God; they came from mammon, and for that paltry sum Judas betrayed his Master to His crucifixion. I hope this House will definitely express its views on this matter in such a way that no Attorney-General in the future history of this Parliament will dare to take money from his country, which pays him well for his services, and at the same tirde^ccepTTmoney to act on behalf of interests which are opposed to the welfare of his country. The history of the oil industry is one of murder, bribery and corruption. In this connection I invite the attention of honourable members to the following statement by the Right Honourable Sir ArthurH . Hardinge, at page 278 of his book A Diplomatist in The first important duty which confronted me a few months after my"" arrival at Teheran was that of securing for a British company an important concession of Persian oil-fields. Although oil was buiieved to exist in abundance on the shores of the Persian Gulf, its deposits had never been seriously developed; but my predecessor, Sir Henry Drumniond Wolff, believed-and bis opinion was supported by a Persian-Armenian financier named Kit&bji Khan-that it might not improbably be found in abundance in the Turco-Pereian frontier region, which is traversed by the great pilgrim road from Teheran through Hamadan to Bagdad. Sir Henry Wolff accordingly wrote a letter of introduction, brought by a Mr Marriott, whom he recommended in it to my good offices, and who would, he went on to say, explain to me f u l l y the character and objects of his mission. Its main end, which appeared to me well deserving of support, was to win the goodwill of the Persian Government by assigning shares in the proposed development of the rich oilfields believed to exist in Western Persia to some of its most influential Ministers, including the Grand Vizier himself. I accordingly at once interviewed that statesman, and strongly urged that the concession, which had been already laid before him and which, if I remember correctly, gave exclusive rights to dig for oil throughout Persia, except in the provinces bordering on Russia-Azerbaijan, Ghilan, Mazenderan and Khorassan-to an Australian mining magnate, a Mr D'Arey, who was ready to finance the undertaking. Grand Vizier declared himself prepared to fall in with the project, but he suggested that a letter-to be written by me, in the Persian language, embodying its main featuresshould be immediately drawn up for submission to the Russian Legation. He woe aware that M . Argyropulo could not read Persian, more especially in the written or "" shikoete"" character, which is illegible, owing to its peculiar abbreviations, even to scholars familiar with the printed language. from his own spies that the Russian Oriental Secretary, M . Stritter, who alone could read it, was about to leave Zergendeh, the summer residence of the Russian Legation, for a short sporting excursion in the neighbouring hills. He therefore sent the letter to Zergendah, where it lay several days untranslated, awaiting M. ""Stritter's return, and as no objection to the proposal contained in it was made by the Russian Minister, who could not read it , and never suspected the importance oT its contents, all the Persian members of the Government supported the Grand Vizier's decision to sign the concession to Mr D'Arcy. M. Argyropulo was far from pleased when he learnt what had actually happened; but the Grand Vizier could not be blamed for the accidental and temporary absence of his Legation's Persian translator, and the Russian Minister accordingly adopted the sensible course of accepting the accomplished fact. He required, however, some compensation at the hands of the Persian Government, though he had to wait a little time for it . That the honourable member have leave to continue his speech. Dr. Maloney. in Australia a distinguished visitor, in the person of Sir John Cadman, who was sent to Persia to deal with matters arising out of the rescission of the Anglo Persian oil agreement. Persia was naturally extremely disturbed over the way in which the business had been handled, and demanded the payment of £1,000,000 in the first year and £1,000,000 in the following year, as compensation. Ultimately it was agreed, after a terrible fight, that Persia should be paid £1,000,000 a year for 60 years in settlement of its claims. In view of this experience, the Commonwealth Government should do everything possible to ensure that its oil resources are not in any way alienated from the Australian psopl© wish briefly to supplement the remarks of the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney). In my opinion a person who occupies an office of profit under the The Crown, ' and particularly a responsible Minister, should by his acceptance of such office place the whole of his services at the disposal of the Crown. It should not be possible for wealthy individuals or corporations to call upon his services for fee or reward. This should be particularly so when there is any likelihood of the affairs of such an individual or corHe also knew poration being made the subject of investigation by the Crown. We must most jealously guard the rights of the people, and take all possible steps to prevent the improper intrusion of wealthy persons or institutions into affairs that are the concern of the Government. A gentleman who accepts such an office as that of Attorney-General should not desire or be permitted to accept a brief from an outside body. I do not suggest that persons who accept such an office as that of Attorney-General should be expected to surrender all their outside interests, because they cannot expect to retain office permanently; but they certainly should not be permitted to become pecuniarily interested in proceedings that are the subject of investigation by the Crown.

64,Mr Maktn (Hindmarsh) [11.36],"Ia time of crisis when their services might be of immense value to the whole community. With all respect to the present distinguished occupant of the office of Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, I submit that Parliament should indicate very definitely that Ministers of the Crown shall not allow their services to be retained by rich corporations, such as the oil companies, at a time when their practices are the subject of investigation by the Crown. monwealth. "" whether it be the State or the Commonwealth. In my opinion persons who occupy offices of profit under the Crown do not act with strict propriety when they accept private briefs. I hope that in the future we shall jealously guard the interests of the people in this connection. Wealthy individuals and institutions should not be allowed to intrude into spheres from which they should be excluded, and persons who accept office under the Government, whether as Ministers of the Crown or otherwise, should not be permitted to accept lucrative briefs if by so doing there may arise even a suspicion that they are putting their private interests before the public welfare. This motion is timely, for we should indicate clearly that in the opinion of this Parliament responsible public officers are guilty of definite impropriety in accepting briefs from rich corporations the activities of which may at any time be the subject of investigation by the Crown. As a working class member of the profession which, according to Shelley, is "" skilled to snare the feet of Justice in the toils of law"", I venture to say a few words on the motion of the honourable member for Melbourne. The honourable gentleman has raised a question which is, at once, interesting and important. Naturally I should be one of the last to restrict or curtail the rights and privileges of members of the legal profession. It is sometimes necessary in this, as in other unions, to stand shoulder to shoulder with one's colleagues to protect their rights and submit the view-point of the profession or. calling concerned. As I have said on other occasions, the Attorney-General and I are not members of the same union. I am a member of bhe union which habitually does the work; the honourable gentleman is a member of the union which habitually draws the fees. fashion in my time. is kinship between us, and by virtue of being a. general practitioner I am permitted to occupy a position of respectful homage to members of the other branch the Comof the profession. I have no desire to restrict the rights or privileges of memI say "" by the Crown "", bers of the legal profession, but it is true, and I am sure that the Attorney-General will be the first to admit it, that the public interest is paramount and above private considerations. The public interest in this matter has more than once been debated in this House. The present Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Hughes) has himself taken part in discussions of a similar character and laid down high ethical principles. I recall that this matter came up for consideration as far back as 1913, and as recorded on page 944 of Hansard of the 9th September of that year, Mr Fraser, who was then the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, moved the following motionThat, in the opinion of this House, Ministers of the Crown should not violate the code of rules of positive obligation laid down by the British Prime Minister( Mr Asquith), whicli rules readFirstly-That Minister ought not to enter, into any transaction whereby their private pecuniary interest may even conceivably come into conflict with their public duty; Secondly-That no Minister ought to accept any kind of favour from persons who are in negotiation with or seeking to enter into contractual or pecuniary relations with the Government; I have no knowledge, certainly within recent years, of any member of the bar having consciously or even actually violated that rule, but there have been occasions when the borderline has been reached. I i i that debate a number of members of the bar participated, including the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), the late member for Bendigo( Mr Arthur), a distinguished member of the bar, and other legal men, all of whom debated the matter on a high plane. It was pointed out that public opinion was naturally somewhat sensitive",19,Attorneys^General An D Private Practice Formal Motion For Adjournment

69,Mr Brennan,"iNevertheles s thereupon this subject and that the positive obligations laid down by the late Mr Asquith should be most strictly observed. Mr Asquith practised that he did, with distinction, in many courts. During the debate on this subject in 1913, in which 1 took a subordinate part, Mr Arthu r saidClearly, tlie question is not whether the ruins of the profession govern the matter, but whether the Attorney-General can stand before tlie community and say, "" AlthoughI am retained by the Marconi Company, I can still maintain an unbiased attitude. I cannot be suspected even by many people of being biased."" He knows, and we, too, know, that he is not, but it is the suspicion of the many to which we must have regard, and it is by that principle that the honourable gentleman should steer his course. The then Attorney General had a general retainer fro m the Marconi Company, which was in litigation with the Commonwealth. I cannot, of course, go into details. The position envisaged by the honourable member for Melbourne ( D r . Maloney) is, however, somewhat different, but not, in my opinion, essentially different. O i l is a subject on which l it i tion of the Attorney-General of the Comgation is frequently, if not constantly, had. Certainly it is constantly under discussion in the parliaments of the States, of the Commonwealth, and of the world. It lies at the very basis of peace and war, order and good government. Every one knows that vast interests are involved iu oil. Its production and sale are disturbing factors in the relationship of nations as well as individuals. Competition for oilfields has been a potent factor in bringing about war. The matter which we have in mind at present, is the royal commission which inquired into certain aspects of what is known as the oil combine. A royal commission takes its authority from the Crown itself; it is investigatory, but also judicial. The inquiry was into a subject which not only appointed to assist the commission? would be likely to be a matter for dismission in the parliaments of the country, but would almost certainly become so. In there to represent the public interests, the motion of the honourable member for and to cross-examine such witnesses as Melbourne there is no suggestion that any might be called. In addition, if any honpositive rule of law or of practice has orable member, in a moment of great been violated; at least that is the manner leisure, cares to peruse the records of the in which I prefer to interpret the Royal Commission on Petrol he w ill find motion, but there is involved in it a quesr tion of judgment and good taste. The position of Attorney General-the leader of the bar of the Commonwealth-is , as I think that the late the honourable member for Melbourne suggests, perhaps not a sacred one, but one I have no doubt which cails for the deepest respect. I suggest that in matters of that kind, which are of great public interest and which are discussed in Parliament, the country should have the first call upon the service and disinterested advice of its chief law officer, and that he should keep himself free and disentangled from pecuniary interests-fro m accepting a brief on behalf of any oil company, trust or individual likely by its or his operations to prejudice the public interests. ber has exhausted his time. General) [11.53] I agree with what is implied in the observations of the honourable member for Batman( Mr. Brennan)-that this subject, which can be discussed quite dispassionately, raises a general issue which is not without importance. I want to take this opportunity to point out to the House the posimonwealth, as I understand it , and, incidentally, I . shall probably refer to the position of an attorney-general of a State. But before doing so, I should like to correct one statement made by the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maioney), which has been made elsewhere and which he has no doubt inadvertently repeated. He said that in connection with thp. recent investigation by a royal commission into the petrol industry the public' was not represented by counsel. The public was represented by counsel throughout the inquiry.

In the first place, the Royal Commission on Petrol was a commission appointed by the Commonwealth Government. In so far as any government had any interest in the proceedings of the royal commission, it was the Commonwealth Government, and no Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, in my opinion, would consider himself at liberty to appear as counsel before a Commonwealth royal commission, because the general object in appointing such a commission was to inform the mind of the Commonwealth Parliament, and to invoke the judgment of the Commouwealth Government. The Petrol Commission was a Commonwealth commission, and its work was not participated in to any extent by any State Government.

Mr Isaacs, as he then was, during the time he was Attorney-General, quite properly maintained the largest practice at the Victorian bar. Mr Latham's opportunities for practice, like mine at present, were severely restricted by the fact that this Parliament meets in Canberra. But, to the extent that he could, in very occasional instances he appeared in Court. My learned friend, the honourable member for Batman, is not, as he has pointed out with becoming modesty, a member of the bar; but he is a solicitor of long and extensive experience and practice, and I have yet to learn that he retired from practice when he was Attorney-General of the Commonwealth. On the contrary, I venture to think-in fact I have personal reason to know-that he continued his practice as a solicitor, and no doubt he continued to act as adviser and solicitor to the large organizations which had engaged him in the past as their legal adviser. briefs ? this matter in a perfectly dispassionate particular client, or. that some medical way.

That is the legal profession. as I hope I have, without much difficulty, the right of an Attorney-General to private practice, let me turn to the. specific allegation which is involved in the motion : which is before the House. The mover objects to an Attorney-General taking money "" to represent combines, oil companies, or individuals, against his country or the interest of its people."" That proposition involves a series of conclusions which may or may not he wellfounded. The honourable member submitted his motion on the assumption that the Shell Oil Company of Australia, for whom I appeared before the royal commission, is automatically to be regarded as an enemy of Australia. That, may I point out, was one of the matters to be inquired into by the royal commission itself. I do not desire, and I suggest that no honourable member should desire, to anticipate any conclusion to be arrived at on that point. The same principle is involved when attacks are made upon criminal advocates. Some persons have said to them: "" You are appearing for a murderer "", or "" You are appearing for a burglar"". A little wisdom and suspension of judgment would indicate that the very matter to which that advocate is directing his attention is whether his client is a murderer or a burglar. If we do not wish to rush to conclusions, we lawyer has broken his obligation to The motion refers to combines, comprivate practice, in a matter in which the no interest either for or against, must, from now on, say to any client in respect thing else, "" I cannot appear for you "", a perfectly legitimate argument, because",22,Attorneys^General An D Private Practice Formal Motion For Adjournment

89,Mr Menzies,"Having established,I have appeared many times for trade unions. If the principle of the motion is to be accepted, on what basis is the Attorney-General to decide in future whether he is to exercise his admittedly sound and well-founded right to practise in his private capacity? I suggest to honourable members that the assumption underlying this motion is ill founded. I agree, in the main, with the general observations of the honourable member for Batman upon the standards to be applied to this question. I have indicated, right in the oil business, and that there as shortly and as clearly as I may, such qualifications as I myself would make in relation to it, but I suggest that no motion should be carried which would lead inevitably to the conclusion that the man who happens to be the law officer of the Crown at any given moment is to be submitted to exclusion from any participation in his private affairs, which is not warranted, and, therefore, we are justiequally applied to other persons in Parliament. As honourable members know, particularly for those who practise professions, and whose incomes, therefore, cease when they walk out of their own doors, it is not a very easy matter to enter Parliament. When they become members of Parliament, they necessarily sustain losses, and when they take ministerial office they necessarily sustain much greater losses. But it is a wise provision that, to the extent that the time which the due discharge of their public duties will permit, such as are members of the legal profession should be allowed to engage in their own affairs in order to maintain contact through practice and hard experience with the body of law which they have to administer. -The Attorney-General's answer to the motion suggests that the assumptions advanced are not well founded, and that, in effect, we should not rush to draw conin this Parliament from that of any clusions without being apprised of all the circumstances of the case. If the honourable gentleman had been a member of this House on the occasion when an adjournment motion was submitted by me for the purpose of securing the appointment of a royal commission to inquire into the operations of the major oil companies, and had listened to the comment and general approval of honourable members on all sides of the House, he would have been forced to recognize that the general opinion of the Parliament, which, after all, is a reflection of that of the country, was that there were good grounds for the conclusion that these companies were not operating in the best interests of the people. The whole problem must be approached from that angle, and honourable members can only be guided by the information at their disposal. It is fairly safe to say that everything is not quite is something radically wrong in regard to the charges imposed by the Shell Oil Company, and the remarkable power and' influence which it wields both in Australia and in other parts of the world. On that, score, we are entitled at the outset to claim that our assumptions are not groundless; that our suspicions are fied in taking some steps to check this company's operations. A point has been raised as to the right of the Crown in the Commonwealth and the right of the Crown in the Stateswhether the authority of the Crown is similar in both spheres. In a strictly technical sense, there may be grounds for the conclusions of the Attorney-General in that regard; but, when the interests of the people are at stake, we must take a practical view of the matter. The community has the right to combat the inroads made upon its interests, whether by combines or anybody else, and to talk about the difference between the authority of the Crown in the States and its authority in the Commonwealth is only splitting straws. Such arguments carry no weight with the public at large. Apart from the views which the members of the legal fraternity might advance, it has to be remembered that the legal profession is on an entirely different footing other. Parliament, makes the laws with which the legal fraternity are concerned. Therefore, members of the legal profession do not fall within exactly tlie same category as medical men, or men of any other trades or professions. When royal commissions are appointed, terms of reference are drawn up, and by this means the scope of inquiries may be restricted or widened in accordance",23,Attorneys^General An D Private Practice Formal Motion For Adjournment
90,Mr Beasley (West Sydney) [12.9].,"with the wishes of those whose legal mind is applied to the basis on which the inquiries shall be conducted. Have we not all noticed, on many occasions, when royal commissions have been appointed to investigate the operations of public activities, combines and the like, that those who stand for the interests of the people are prevented from carrying out certain investigations because the chairman of the commission says that these inquiries are not included in the terms of reference? It shows what power and influence are exercised by those associated meet the particular case in question. The with the legal profession in determining how far a royal commission may go in its inquiries, and, consciously or unconsciously, the ambit of these investigations is frequently restricted. Members of the legal fraternity hold retainers from certain big combines, of a character which, though not actually requiring them to appear in the courts on behalf of their clients, calls upon them stand for it. The question of the price to determine from time to time the action which should be taken in relation to certain matters. Suppose, for instance, that the Attorney-General of this Parliament held such a retainer, and that he had been advising such a combine in regard to its public activities over a long period flamed on the subject of oil prices. In of years, and suppose at some stage later on, while he was still holding the office of Attorney-General, this Parliament saw fit to appoint a royal commission to inquire into the activities of that was considerably stirred.

We all have our feelings in one way or another, and it would be unnatural if we were not influenced by our convictions. When the Parliament decides to undertake certain inquiries, the terms of reference are determined by the chief law adviser of the Commonwealth. They may be disclosed to Parliament, but without legal training honourable members generally are obviously unable to say whether the terms submitted are sufficiently embracing to determination of these questions must he left to the Crown Law Department over which the Attorney-General has control. This is a most unfair and unsatisfactory position if the Attorney General has outside interests. I concur in the opinion expressed by the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney) that, if this matter were submitted to the people, they would not of petrol was a very live one when the royal commission to inquire into the activities of the oil combine was set up.

The speech of the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley), however, makes further comment necessary, for it reveals a misunderstanding of the position as set out by the honourable the Attorney-General. Briefly stated, what the honourable member for West Sydney eaid was that a lawyer ought not to act for any individual or corporation in matters opposed to "" public interest"" and, in the opinion of the honourable member, "" public interest"" is so easily determined that, once having been given expression through the agency of any governmental institution, whether municipal, State or Federal, there is no room for any misunderstanding as to what that is. In other words, the voice of the people once having been heard, the legal profession, and particularly the head of the legal profession, the Attorneyvolved in some violent outbreak-w e have General, is precluded from ranging himself against that voice, no matter whether he be ths Attorney-General of a State or of the Commonwealth. I do not agree with that contention at all. What is in the public interest ? How is this to be ascertained ? Take the position of a lawyer who appears on behalf of an oil company. My honourable colleague pointed out that the question at issue in any inquiry, whether it be before a commission or a judicial tribunal, is whether the oil company is acting against public interest. ' That is the question before the court or commission. If the point had been established so clearly that the guilt of the company was patent, there would have been no need for the inquiry. stand in the position of defendant? court is to inquire into and report upon the charges levelled against it. It was alleged in the recent inquiry that this company was a monopoly, and that it was acting against the public interest. The company denied this. Mere assertion is not proof, and consequently the question was remitted to a royal commission. In effect, we said "" Find out the truth."" The position of the company was analagous to a case in which a man is charged with murder or with burglary. The question the court has to decide is whether he is a mnrderer or a burglar. Tn this case the point to be decided was whether, as a fact, the oil company had acted against public interest by charging an excessive price for oil. At the time the Attorney General appeared that point had not been decided, and no one was able to Bay whether the company had acted against public interest or not. Are we to saj that a man who has appeared for a corporation, whether it be an oil company or any other company, before accepting the office of Attorney-General is unfit to hold that office? If so, no man who has ever appeared for an oil company or for any other corporation could enter Parliament. ing a retainer. able member appeared for atrade union and later on that trade union was innever had them in this country, but it might easily happen-woul d he say that he should never enter this Parliament because' his clients had committed some offence against the law and against public interest ? the honourable member an illustration to show how difficult it is to determine what is and what is not the interest of the public. In 1911 or 1912, the government of the day prosecuted what was known as the Coal Vend, a combination of coal and shipping companies. It was thought that they were acting against public interest and a prosecution was launched. Mr Justice Isaacs, in a lengthy, and what I regarded as a magnificent judgment, decided in favour of the company. The case was taken to the High Court on appeal, and the High Court held that the alleged monopoly was not acting against public interest, but that, in fact, it was responsible for reducing the price of coal, and freight rates. Further, the High Court held that higher freight rates could reasonably be charged in order that decent wages might be paid to the seamen. So that after years of effort to restrain this monopoly and to protect public interestI was the spearhead in this effort-the court held that this monpoly was not against public interest, but had, in fact, promoted it.

Would honourable members say that a lawyer should go through life with his client's misdeeds hanging like a millstone round his neck. What is public interest? vanced by the honourable member's advocacy of certain principles? We deny that. I say that the public interest is advanced by the advocacy of right principles. member's time has expired. -The argument in the interesting speech General( Mr Menzies) consisted, in effect, of two propositions and a conclusion. The first was that the Attorney-General has, while Attorney General, the ordinary rights and duties of a professional advocate. The second was that the ordinary right of a professional advocate is to accept briefs from any client, and that the ordinary duty of a professional advocate is to accept a brief from any client without deciding himself whether that client's case is right or not. From that he drew the conclusion that he, as Attorney-General, was entitled, while Attorney-General, to appear for any client. With the second proposition, I do not very much disagree. I concur in the view that it is not for a professional advocate to refuse his services to a client because he may not be sure that his client is an honest man. The actual determination of whether a client has or has not committed the offence with which he is charged, or whether he is or is not subject to liabilities to which it is contended he is subject, rests with the court. If each professional advocate were to say, We will refuse to appear for a man of whose As honourable right, of whose equity, we are not convinced beforehand,"" it is clearly then a combination of professional advocates to do that would deprive men of the right to be heard in' court. A professional advocate's duty is to say on behalf of his client such things as his client would honestly say A lawyer is a person who on his own behalf if he could speak for himself. If the major premises of theargument is to be conceded-and I do not concede it-the Attorney-General hasestablished his case. If an Attorney-General is, while Attorney-General, to have the ordinary right, and the ordinary duties of proIs public interest adfessional advocates, it follows that he cannot be required to discriminate between his private clients, and that hecannot properly be asked to say, "" I will deny my services to this defendant; I will give it to that defendant"", or that, *' I will deny my services to this plaintiff honourable and give it to that plaintiff"". No professional advocate can be called upon to do that. His duty, as I apprehend it , is that he is to regard himself as a made by the Attorneyminister of justice and the vindication of justice can be achieved only after the interests of the different parties-whethe r they beCrown and subject or party and party -hav e been tried by a competent tribunal and decided on the evidence adducedBut because I hold that view I disagree with the major premises which theAttorney-General has advanced. I do not think that the Attorney-General should have the right of private practice. The Attorney-General described it as au undoubted right. It is "" undoubted "" only as many other things are said, because they are customary, to be undoubted. A famous Lord Chancellor -Nottingham-in the time of CharlesII . , when he received a present, as was the custom in those days, to influencehis decision in a case, used to put the present beside him and exclaim, "" O tyrant custom "" ; but he did nothing to break down that custom. Ultimately it was broken down. The Attorney-General of the Commonwealth occupies a position different from that of an ordinary advocate. He is at the summit of the legaT",26,Attorneys^General An D Private Practice Formal Motion For Adjournment

104,Mr Blackburn (Bourke) [12.30].,"profession. He is the leader of the legal profession in the Commonwealth, as in my State. He owes that position hot merely to his professional ability and training, but to the fact that he has heen appointed to be the Crown's legal Adviser in the Commonwealth. In other ,words, he is the legal adviser, the legal representative, of the people of the Commonwealth of Australia. I think that the public cannot feel certain that such a man is doing his duty to the public if at the same time they see him appearing as the advocate of persons whose interests may come into collision with the interests of the public. It may be conceived, although I find it difficult to -conceive it, that a man is able to keep his mind divided, so to speak, into .watertight compartments-to keep entirely distinct the impression he receives as advocate for a private interest and the impression he receives as representative of the public interest. The virtue of a man may be over-estimated, and many things that we say of one another are merely polite hypocrisies. We do not believe that a man can at the same time be the guardian and custodian of the -Commonwealth interests, and the private -advocate of a person or a corporation, whether it be a trade union or company, which may from time to .time come into conflict with Commonwealth law and the public interest. This view of the position of Attorney-General was taken by a man who stands out in .the history of Australian public and professional life-as ihe Bayard of the legal and public life of Victoria. Higinbotham, when he first became Attorney-General of Victoria, and, later on, when he again filled that office, took the stand that he would not engage in private, practice, that the allowance which he received from the State entitled tbe State to He conducted a considerable practice, but appeared in court only as an advocate for the State. He was engaged in numerous cases in Victoria, including the famous case against the railway contractors, appearing for the State without fee or reward other than his salary as Attorney-General. He did not appear against the State, but he did conduct State cases. We have such cases to-day. Although Attorney-Generals are by the Constitution forbidden to take fees from the Commonwealth, we have had cases in which they have appeared for the Commonwealth, and have done so obviously without fee or reward. It is quite proper that they should do so. of men abstaining from private practice. "" Tyrant custom"" is on the side of the Attorney-General and that of the Minister for Health, who has so ably assisted him to-day. But just as the custom of sending presents to judges in the past has broken down, so should we also break down the custom by which a man, who owes his pre-eminence in the legal profession to the fact that he is a public officer, holds himself out to receive private remuneration. It may be that we shall have to consider the question of remuneration-that we shall have to make the position of the Attorney General unique and pay him more than we pay ordinary Ministers. I do not think we should pay him very much more because I believe that the opportunity of rendering public service is part of the reward that a public man receives, and that his remuneration is not to be computed in mere pounds, shillings and pence. ber's time has expired. [12.40] -The Opposition, in bringing this matter before the House, has chosen George its own ground for debate* and has adopted as the chief basis of its argument the ethical question involved in this discussion. That is the only aspect of the case that has been put forward by members of the Opposition who have so far discussed it. the whole of his services. The honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) said that no rule of law had been broken by the Attorney-General, nor had any rule of practice been broken by him. It was, he said, a matter of allaying suspicion on the part of the people, as if any man in public life, no matter how exemplary his conduct might be, could hope to completely allay the suspicions of some people regarding almost every act that he performs.",27,Attorneys^General An D Private Practice Formal Motion For Adjournment

108,Mr John Lawson (Macquarie),"honourable member is quite fair. Having regard to his judicial position, the acts of the Attorney-General should always be beyond reasonable suspicion. as the honourable member for Batman has put it. From the point of view of the Opposition this is a question of ethic3, or, if it is not competent for the Attorneyto quote the honourable member for Batman, one of good taste. Following upon the remarks of the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley), who claimed that the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth ought not to engage in private practice, I would point out that honourable members opposite seem to have entirely overlooked the measure of protection which is given this Parliament, and the people, first of all, by laws passed by this and other Parliaments, and secondly by the almost inconceivably high standard of ethics, from the point of view of laymen, which is set by the legal profession, the medical profession, and even by the somewhat humbler profession to which I belong. As an example of the standard of ethics that is set by the medieal profession-ran d this is something that should be remembered by those who would judge men in the position of the Attorney-General in a different way altogether from that in which they would judge honourable members engaged in businessI would point out that it is a principle of the profession that if a member of it makes a scientific discovery then he shall not patent or capitalize for his own advantage that discovery, but shall make it available free of charge for the benefit of mankind. That is an example of the extraordinarily high standard of ethics which obtains in the medical profession, and what applies to that profession applies with equal truth and force to the profession of the law. The people are protected, first of all, by law. The honourable member for Batman says no law has been broken by the present Attorney-General( Mr General as I do, I would not urge that Menzies), nor has any rule of practice been departed from. I assume that he means, when he says that the Attorney-General has broken no rule of practice, ithat the ehhical standard set up by tbe bar council and by the most highly respected and most eminent members the of the legal profession has not been violated in any way whatever. I appeal to ""all honourable members who desire to do justice to a gentleman occupying the highest and most respected position in his profession, to bear carefully in mind this admission of the honourable member for Batman. I also put it to them that General to engage in private practice the same objection may be urged against other legal gentlemen who are private members in this Parliament. It has been argued that the appearance of the Attorney-General as counsel for an oil company might create suspicion iu the public mind that he was unconsciously biased, and, therefore, not likely to act in the best interests of the people. I remind honourable members that Parliament is the final arbiter and judge of the propriety of its Attorney-General's actions, and if it ia not proper for the holder of that oflice to engage in any form of private practice, then it is obviously not proper for any legal practitioner, who is a member of this House, to sit in judgment on the actions of the Attorney-General. That is the logical sequel to the views of the honourable member for Batman, and the honourable member for West Sydney. If one follows up this line of thought one arrives at this position-that however qualified any honourable member might be in the conduct of his profession or business, he would have no right to engage in any business at all. It seems to me, therefore, that legal members, particularly of this House, who criticize the attitude of the Attorney-General, are really sitting iD judgment on their own conduct. I say, emphatically, that even if the holder of this office is open to criticism, it is not on the ground that he may not be acting in the public interest, but that he may not be able to give enough of his time to the satisfactory discharge of his ministerial duties. Knowing the Attorneyobjection against him. Strangely enough, no honourable member opposite has raised this point in the discussion. Possibly, they are well aware that they would not be able to establish a case on such grounds. I urge honourable members to take a reasonable view of the situation. The criticism of the honourable member",28,Attorneys^General An D Private Practice Formal Motion For Adjournment

110,Mr John Lawson,"Let us take itfor Batman and the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Blackburn) is based on academic rather than practical grounds, and for this reason it fails. I commend the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney) for having brought this important matter before the House. In the public interest this issue should be settled once and for all. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) made a special appeal in defence of his ministerial colleague the Attorney-General( Mr Menzies). While he was speaking, an honourable member sitting behind me, interjected that the right honourable gentleman was putting up Aunt Saliys merely for the purpose of knocking them down again. He argued that, if the Attorney-General could not hold ministerial office simply because ho had accepted a retainer from the Shell Oil Company, other members of the legal profession, who had engaged in private practice, would similarly be debarred from membership of this Parliament. That, point is not involved in the motion. The facts are not as the right honourable gentleman stated them. If the Attorney General or any other member of the legal profession had, while still a private member, appeared on behalf of clients in private litigation, no one would question the propriety of his action. This is the issue which we are asked to consider: Is it right for the Attorney-General to act as counsel against the Crown in cases likely to affect the interests of the State? The honourable member for Melbourne has specially emphasized this phase of the Attorney-General's legal activities. Everyone knows that in nearly every country oil interests and national interests have been or are in conflict. Tbe arguments used by the right honourable member for North Sydney this morning were in marked conflict with those which he employed in 1913, when a motion for the adjournment of the House was moved to discuss the action of the then Attorney-General, Mr W. H . Irvine, now the Chief Justice of Victoria, in having accepted a retaining fee from the Marconi Company which was in litigation with the Commonwealth Government. The report of that debate is to be found in volume LXX . of Hansard and the excerpts from the speech of Mr Hughes are to be found on page 961. This is what the right honourable gentleman said on that occasionThe very fact that the Attorney-General handed over the matter to the Minister of External Affairs and refused to attend a Cabinet meeting when the matter was discussed are proofs as strong as HolyW r it that the motion which we are now submitting is amply warranted. The motion submitted on that occasion was on all fours with the one now before the House. The right honourable gentleman went on to speak of the rules of the bar and the personal and professional honour of members of the legal profession, sayingI t is no use referring us to the rules of the bar. This morning the right honourable gentleman spoke of the rules of the barWe must remember how the conception of public duty has evolved. It is not so very long ago since a man could be Attorney General and, at the same time accept a brief against the Crown. Such a practice was at one time f u l ly sanctioned hy the rules of the bar. But public opinnion has swept by the rules of the bar, and the bar lags panting after public opinion. That position seems to have been emphasized by this morning's discussionFrom time to time it brings up its antiquated procedure to the level of civilization, which always goes on ahead, therefore I say most emphatically that it is not for us to 'be concerned with the rules of the bar. We are concerned with rules of conduct governing public men in the execution of their public duties. We do not say for one instant that the rules of the bar are not in perfect accordance with honour and morality BO far as they arc designed to protect the interests of clients. They are. But that is not here to the point. Here is a case where there is a conflict of interests. The words of the right honourable member for North Sydney might very well be applied to this discussion. As is well known, the rules of the bar are laid down by the bar itself. By this I do not imply that they are not in conformity with our ideals of public morality. Al l I wish to convey is that, as they are laid down by the bar, we may take it that they are drawn in the interests of those who practise at the bar. office he relinquished the directorships of the companies in which he was interested.",29,Attorneys^General An D Private Practice Formal Motion For Adjournment

116,Mr Nairn,"That being so, I canhe might have done as a private practitioner. I would liken his position to that of a judge. Generally speaking, a judge is appointed from the ranks of barristers in active practice, some of whom have a large number of clients. Whatever briefs a man may hold when he is elevated to the bench are immediaiely handed over to another barrister. I have never heard it seriously argued that the ever-present likelihood of having to adjudicate in cases in which former clients might be parties, is a disqualification for a judgeship. It frequently occurs that a judge has to sit in judgment upon persons for whom he has acted as advocate at the bar. The ethics of the legal profession are sufficiently high to ensure dispassionate decisions by judges even in cases in which old clients are litigants. The adoption of the principle that a man must not accept a position on the bench if he is likely to be called upon to adjudicate in cases in which persons with whom he has formerly been associated are parties, would mean that no member of the legal profession could receive such an appointment. Nor could any lawyer be appointed to the office of Attorney<xeneral, because occasions must necessarily arise when decisions have to be given affecting the interests of former clients and friends. I am sure that not only members of the legal profession, but also honourable members who accept high ministerial positions, are quite competent to divorce themselves from former private associations and to discharge their functions honestly, quite irrespective of the fact that they may have had business dealings with individuals likely to be affected by their decisions.

I suggest either that the fee be reduced to, say, £2 or £3, or tnat, a provision be inserted in the act providing for a lower fee in cases of hardship. Officers of the Investigation Department whom I have consulted have expressed a willingness to give sympathetic consideration to a reduced fee in some cases, although they think that it might be unwise to make the regular fee so low as to open the door too widely to trouble. It would be well to vest in the officers concerned a discretionary power either to accept a reduced fee, or to permit payment of the fee by instalwere prements.

119,Mr Holloway (Melbourne Ports),"discussing their removal. There is considerable discontent at the slowness of the court or from Parliament to enforce it. court, not only in regard to the hearing of the cases which come before it, but also in regard to the procedure preliminary to hearing. On one occasion recently, the delays nearly led to direct action being taken, and I hope that the experience will not be repeated. another conciliation commissioner, while not costing a large amount, would avoid much of the delay which now occurs. I come now to the long standing difficulty associated with work on the waterfront. Those concerned in Victoria and South Australia have been waiting a long time for a satisfactory solution of the trouble. Probably the port of Melbourne provides the worse example in Australia. The ex-Attorney-General( Mr Latham) endeavoured, in his own way, to improve conditions on the Melbourne waterfront, by introducing a regulation, intended to be permanent, governing the engagement of labour there. The job has been only half done, and, as things are still in the experimental stage, the regulation cannot be said to have been either accepted or condemned. The real difliculty is the unfair discrimination still being shown in the selection of waterside labour generbuilding for the accommodation of waterally. In the past there might have been grounds for giving preference to velunteer or "" loyalist"" workers on the waterfront, but to-day those men are almost non-existent there, although the numbers of so-called "" loyalist"" workers have been maintained by the inclusion of men of all nationalities who cannot be said to be entitled to preference, because of anything that they did to assist the country in a time of difliculty. That is the cause of a lot of discontent. Another grievance modation, or lack of it, provided quired, and the engineer was called into for that section of the waterside workers the room in my presence and instructed at Port Melbourne who are not what are to proceed with the work. I suggest that described as volunteers. Some time ago the Attorney-General look into this we sought to settle the trouble between matter, and do what he can to have the the volunteer and the regular labourers trouble rectified. I trust that he will be by getting from Judge Beeby a declaraable to complete the work started by his tion of what constituted a volunteer predecessor who introduced the regulation. waterside worker. About a year ago he I also ask him to refresh his memory gave that decision, but, unfortunately, no regarding the decision given by Judge notice has ever been taken of it. The Beeby a little over a year ago as to who ship-owners will not recognize it, and no Mr Holloway. assistance has been forthcoming from the Apart from that, however, the conditions under which waterside labour is picked up is a disgrace to the State of Victoria, a blot on the seaport of Melbourne, and an offence to the sight of those people who pass through the port. The workers are subjected to almost brutal indignity. The The appointment of volunteer labourers are picked up in a suitable room, where provision is made for them to meet the employers, and where shelter and decent conditions are provided. The other workers, however, are picked up out in the open, where they have to stand ""in all kinds of weather without any shelter, and without proper means of being approached by the shipowners' representatives, who stand on empty tanks and select the men as the buyers of old selected slaves in the market. It has become such a scandal that I feel justified in directing the attention of the Attorney-General to it. No proper sanitary arrangements exist, and the position has become so bad that the municipality has called on the harbour authorities to put an end to it. About a year ago, I succeeded in getting the Chairman of the Harbour Trust, Mr Holden, who has since died, to agree to a proposal for the erection of a suitable side labourers. It was agreed to erect a building and equip it with telephones, rostrums, &c, together with a readingroom for the men, and the building was to have been opened at the same time as the new Centenary bridge. Something must have gone wrong with the scheme, however, because, although the bridge was opened a few weeks ago, the building has not yet been begun. I know that plans were prepared, because I saw them. I gave evidence regarding the dimensions of the building, and the is the accomrostrums and other accommodation remay be regarded as original volunteers, entitled to tbe preference promised by tbe Government and tbe ship-owners. join with the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway) in an appeal for sympathetic administration in so far as it affects trade unionists in good faith on the waterfront. I have no qualifications as representative to speak for them, but I have some knowledge of the position by reason of the fact that I administered the Transport Workers Act, and had a good deal to do with employment on the waterfront, while I was in office. Of course, wages and conditions are matters still within the purview of the court, and the Minister cannot interfere in functions that are clearly those of the court. There is something more than pathetic, however, in the long drawn out vendetta that has been waged against the genuine waterfront workers. For nearly ten years, we have heard of the volunteers who came to the rescue of the ship-owners in their time of trouble. I did not have a very high opinion of them when they were engaged, being, as they were, casual workers who came forward to reap some benefit at the expense of waterside workers and genuine and loyal unionists during a time of industrial trouble. the great distress of those men who had made their homes on the waterfront, had reared their families there, had helped to maintain the local shopkeepers, and are still entitled to be recognized, in view of the special knowledge they have of the work, as tbe bona fide workers in that industry. There is no doubt that these people have been harassed, and that there has been a prolonged endeavour to drive them off the waterfront. Most of the volunteers have disappeared now, and I think the present Minister would desire to assist in making conditions a little better and fairer for the genuine waterside workers, and I hope that he will succeed in doing so. I ask the Attorney-Genera] for an assurance in regard to the reporting branch of the Attorney-General's Department. When1 was administering the department a good deal of the work of the branch wa3 being done by outsiders, and there was a certain conflict between the claims of those who were regular members of the staff and others who considered that they had claims to this employment. I took the view at the time, and I think it was the official view also, that the claims of the staff should be supported, and that its members should be employed to the utmost. I do not know what its precise significance may be, but the appropriation this year represents a substantial decrease as compared with the expenditure on this branch in 1933-34. is increased from £6,526 to £7,657. The decrease in comparison with the expenditure in 1933-34 is explained by the fact that last year unforeseen abnormal expenditure was incurred under this heading. Minister Avill stand up for his own department, and that he will ensure that regular Commonwealth employees are, engaged before outsiders in the work for which this expenditure is proposed.

I am very interested in the Commonwealth Investigation Branch. As to one phase of it, I asked a question of the Attorney-General yesterday, and he replied that the matters about which I inquired are sub judice. I do not know the tribunal before which these matters are sub judice, but I accept the Minister's assurance, and therefore I can only discuss this item generally without special regard to any matter . claimed to be now before the courts.

126,Mr Brennan,"In any case, I askAttorney-GeneTal, but I certainly warn the chief officer that I propose to make as searching an inquiry as I can into certain reports which have been furnished to the Minister by the Investigation Branch. Judging by statements in the pTess, and also judicial dicta some of the reports made by this officer in regard to recent cases, have been very inaccurate and unreliable. Reports made to me by this officer in connection with one orable gentleman that I shall give them important matter, when I was Attorney General, were very inaccurate and unreliable. If they were not inaccurate because of incapacity on the part of the gentleman who made them, they were rendered so through partisanship and bias. I am very loath to cast any reflection on an officer of any department, especially one attached to a department with which I have had ministerial responsibility. But I am compelled to do this: When my first cause of complaint came under my notice, I said little about it, but at the time. I made a minute which suggested that we might reasonably hope for better things in the future. If I may judge by recent events, however, there was no ground for my hope. I suggest to this officer that he should not regard himself as a political emissary, or as one having personal views on communism and labourism, but that he should devote himself to a disinterested execution of the duties with which he is entrusted, and that he should obtain information, if he is asked to do so, and be careful that it is compiled with thoroughness and without bias. Unquestionably, I have noted much bias and much evidence of inaccuracy, and much less than due regard to what we would reasonably expect of an officer in his position. My present remarks may be taken as an indication of my intention to press this matter further on a suitable occasion, because honorable gentlemen on this side of the House feel that investigations by this department really amount to a kind of prosecution, and even persecution, on the part of senior officers against people who are thought to entertain political and social opinions that are not in harmony with those held by the chief officer. General) [2.43] -In the brief time at my disposal, I shall have to content myself with replying that the various matters that have been raised by honourable members will be duly considered. On two matters, however, I shall make particular observations. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway) indicated that it was the desire of organized LaBour to confer with me concerning the Arbitration Act, no doubt, with a view to suggesting amendments of that statute. I assure the honevery opportunity to do that. It is my desire to confer with representatives of employers' and employees' organizations at the earliest possible moment, in order to learn from them what might be called the contemporary view of the working of the act. Every facility will be provided for that"" to be done. The honourable member spoke to me last night about the state of affairs on the waterfront and I was surprised to hear what he had to say. I propose at once to communicate with the ship-owners organization and the harbour trust to see whether some means cannot be evolved promptly to remedy a state of affairs which, I agree, is deplorable. The matter relating to the Investigation Branch of my department, referred to by the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan), is one upon which I cannot say much. The honourable gentleman's experience of the department is greater than my own. I was surprised to hear what he said about the Chief Officer of that department. In justice to that gentleman I wish to observe that my own brief experience of his work is that he makes his investigation when directed to do so and, so far as I have been able to notice, without any of the defects alleged by the honourable member. As specific instances are to be brought under notice subsequently, we shall hear more of these allegations in due course. I agree that the duty of officers of the Investigation Branch is to conduct their investigations under the direction of the Government in a non-partisan spirit.

Recently the department has altered the system of collecting rents from occupiers of property owned by the Government. Formerly the rents were collected through the department by means of deductions from the wages of the occupiers at a rate determined by the amount of money earned. appointed private firms to collect tin rents. The tenants concerned fear that, this change may work to their detriment and lay them open to possible eviction. Information regarding the arrears of. rent has been furnished to the collectors and the occupiers of the properties feel that they may be called upon to make payments irrespective of whether they are in regular employment or not. It is felt, also, that the Government may have taken this course with the object of relieving itself of any responsibility for any action taken by the rent collectors that may lead to the eviction of tenants who, because they are only in intermittent work, cannot meet their payments. It is not suggested by these people that those who are able to meet their commitments should be relieved of the obligation to do so. People who can pay, should do so, and this is the opinion of the people who have brought this matter under my notice. Bui unfortunately, many of those concerned are quite unable <to make the payments that are required of them. The people desire that the former arrangements shall be reverted to, and that they shall not be left to the mercy of privaite rent collectors, with the possibility of eviction from their homes. I hope that the Minister will make a clear, definite statement on this point. I wish now to refer to the conditions governing the provision of food relief or work in lieu of food relief. I understand that the Government is able to purchase its supplies, under contract, at prices below those which apply to ordinary private purchasers. This, of course, is a satisfactory arrangement for the Government, and probably enables food relief to be provided at a lower cost than would otherwise be the case; but unfortunately people who are given work in lieu of food relief, and receive a cash payment for their work find that they are not able to purchase with the money they receive the same amount of food as the Government could provide for a similar sum. This is due to the fact that business people, generally speaking, charge more for goods bought over the counter in the ordinary way than for goods supplied to the Government under The Government has now contract. The result is that people who 1 are given work in lieu of food relief find that they do not receive sufficient to provide themselves and their families with adequate nourishment. Perhaps the Minister will agree that, in future, those working for food shall be able to obtain it, at the rates paid by the Government. Under the Workmen's Compensation Ordinance in operation in the Federal Capital Territory, a workman who has met with an accident during the course of his employment receives two-thirds of the wage he was receiving at the time he was injured; but, if the rate of wages should fall, the compensation is also reduced. Those concerned say that, as their commitments, particularly in respect of rent, remain at the same level, they would like the Government to make some remission of rent and other such liabilities while they are receiving a lower income. In connection with food relief, the Government should not take into consideration the payments made to sick or injured members of friendly societies. In moat cases the payments to members of such societies are used to defray the cost of medicinal and other necessaries, which would not be required by a person in normal health. The payment received by a father of a family from a friendly society is regarded .by the Government as income; but, as it is usually expended on medicine, it cannot be used for the purchase of .food and clothing. As friendly society benefits are based on contributions by members, the Government should discontinue the practice of treating payment's to sick and injured members as income, so that the home life of those so unfortunately situated might be improved.",35,Attorney Generai S Department

130,The Minister For The Interior ( Mr Pater,"These matters have been discussed by the branch of the Australian Labour party in the Federal Capital Territory, the members of which have asked me to represent their views to the Minister. I hope that their requests will receive hk favorable consideration. [2.59] -Some .time ago the Commonwealth Government commenced the construction of a Commonwealth building in ANZAC Square, Brisbane; but up to the present only the foundations have been completed. Had construction been expedited, work could have been produties of a more or less confidential vided for stonemasons, bricklayers, carnature. If the Minister makes inquiries penters, plumbers, and painters, and at the same time the payment of rent to owners of private buildings could have been obviated. A definite promise was made last year that the work would be proceeded with, and that the building would be well advanced by the end of the year. Although some improvement has been made in the Federal Members' Rooms at Brisbane, the accommodation available is totally inadequate. Some time ago we were in-formed that rooms would be allotted to federal members in the Commonwealth Bank building, but subsequently the ex-Minister for the Interior said that such rooms would be too expensive, and that accommodation would be available in the building that was being erected. At certain periods of the year, particularly during a recess, the rooms in square from AnzacSquare to QueenBrisbane are used extensively by federal members, who, however, find it impracticable with the present unsatisfactory accommodation to interview constituents or to carry out effectively the clerical work which devolves upon them. As. caused at present, I trust that the Government will arrange for the new building to be completed at the earliest possible date. During the past five or six months bane about that time, agreed that this reQueensland federal members who do most sumption of property by the City Council of their clerical work in the Brisbane would tend to expedite the erection of a rooms have had difficulty in securing the new building. Subsequently a statement services of a shorthand-typist to attend by Mr Brown was published in the press to their correspondence. At times there to the effect that the Government intended are ten federal members in Brisbane reto proceed with the erection of portion quiring clerical assistance. Until six or of the new structure from the Elizabetheight months ago we had the services of a street side; but that is a back street. Some permanent typist who, until she resigned, of the old buildings were to be demolished devoted the whole of her time to our work. When another typist was requisitioned, we were informed by the Deputy Director of Posts and Telegraphs, who is in control of the building, that as he had no authority over the federal members' rooms we should make our request to the Minister for the Interior or the Works Director. Representations were made, and a temporary typist was appointed. Previously the work had been given to a permanent typist. We claim that a temporary typist should not be engaged for into this matter he will find that we have been asking for this assistance for some time. For a number of years I have complained of the unsatisfactory condition of-the General Post Office in Brisbane, and I have urged the Government to erect a new building in keeping with the dignity of the city. Visitors to any city usually observe first the post office, and the town hall. Brisbane, I feel sure, has the most attractive town hall in the Commonwealth, but its post office is a disgrace to both the city and the Federal Government. The citizens had hoped that the erection of a new building would be begun two or three months ago. The City Council contemplated the provision of a street, facing the General Post Oflice. Several comments on the proposal appeared in the press. The Deputy-Director of Posts and Telegraphs, Mr Corbett, remarked that he was pleased the City Council had resumed a certain amount of considerable inconvenience is property and he believed that the extension of the square to Queen-street would give a lead to the Commonwealth authorities to go on with the erection of a new post office. The Director of Posts and Telegraphs, Mr Brown, who visited Bris-",36,Department Of The Interior
131,Mr George Lawson (Brisbane),"and replaced. The citizens of Brisbane urge that the Government should take prompt steps to erect a post office in keepthree or four questions about this lease, ing with the general architecture of the city. The present building is unsuitable for postal purposes, and many of the employees are compelled to work in mere hovels. I directed a question on this subject to the Minister representing the Postmaster-General( Mr Hunter), and asked whether plans and specifications had been drawn up for the erection of a new post office, but, so far, I have received no reply. I understand that the plan3 have been in the hands of the department for many years. The new building should be commenced in Queen-street rather than in Elizabeth-street. About a fortnight ago I referred to the plant at Cockatoo Island Dockyard, and, presumably, from the answer received, the Department of the Interior still has an interest in it, because it has sent an engineer to the island to note the state of preservation in which the plant has been kept. This dockyard, the capital value of which is about £2,000,000, was leased about two years ago to a private company, and this Parliament was asked nine months later to sanction the Government's action. The plea advanced by the Ministry on that occasion was that if private enterthat only the honourable member parprise took the dockyard over it would be free to tender for private contracts, a privilege not enjoyed under Governmentcontrol. It was urged that this action would increase employment. The Government has given a couple of large contracts to the company, without requiring it to tender for the work, and generous periods have been allowed in which to carry out the contracts. Instead of the company providing additional employment when a private job comes along, it takes its men off Government jobs, puts them on the private work and requires them to work overtime, whilst hundreds of unemployed men are available for such work. The Government has given this company contracts with specially privileged conditions, and the company does not give so much employment as could reasonably be expected. This Parliament is responsible for the ratification of the lease of the plant to private enterprise, and the obli[28] gation rests upon it to see that the terms of -the lease are observed. I have asked and they all relate to matters specifically set down in the contract. My questions concerned the amount of rent paid, whether the Government had an inspection of the plant made to ascertain its state of repair, the amount of work given to the lessees by the Government, and, further, how much had been granted to the lessees for the removal or alteration of plant since the lease was signed. All of these matters were definitely provided for in the contract, and the department should, have the fullest information upon them. But it took the Prime Minister a fortnight to answer a question which, one would imagine, could have been answered within 24 hours. In regard to the most important question of all, that of the state of repair of the plant, the reply was that "" the report can be made available to the honourable member foff perusal on application to the office of the Shipping Board, Customs House, Sydney. "" I notice that the typewritten reply originally contained the words "" any honourable member,"" but "" any "" has been struck out and the word "" the "" has been inserted in its place. We therefore gather that this report is to be regarded as more or less confidential, and ticularly interested may view it. The contract between the Government and the lessees has been approved by this Parliament, and every honourable member must be assumed to be interested in it and to be equally responsible for its observance. This dockyard, worth £2,000,000, has been leased for £1,000 a year for the first three years, a price less than that paid for a lease of a secondclass suburban hotel. One would imagine that every honourable member has equal interest in seeing that the terms of the contract are being carried out. A ll of tha matters raised in my questions are obligations forced upon the lessees, but they are equally obligations placed upon the Government. If these obligations are not carried out, provision is made in the lease for the rescission of the contract and the reversion of the dockyard to the Commonwealth. I protest against the delay that has taken place in supplying the replies to my questions and to the",37,Department Of The Interior
132,Mr Rosevear (Dally) [3.12],"alteration which restricts to me the right to peruse the report on the plant, when any honourable member who so desires should be able to view it. As this Parliament was a party to the contract, a copy of reports on its performance should be placed at the disposal of every honourable member without the necessity of making application to the Shipping Board in Sydney. Not only honourable members representing New South Wales constituencies, but all honourable members are interested in this contract. Some honourable members representing States other than New South Wales were equally as opposed to the contract as I was, and they are equally entitled to peruse any reports as to whether the contract is being carried out to the letter peruse the report. A ll honourable memand whether the necessary inspeqtions have been made in accordance with its terms. Honourable members discover from the meagre information imparted by the Prime Minister that this company has paid £1,000 in rent for the dockyard for twelve months. We also find that the Government, which is bound to place only £30,000 worth of work at the dockyard, has provided an additional £500,000 worth of work. amount of that money goes in wages. the Government in giving an additional £500,000 worth of work should have been sufficient for the company, but we find that in the first year of its occupancy of the dockyard the company took advantage of another section of the lease and asked for the expentender for undertakings which the diture of further sums of money for the removal and alteration of plant. The period of the lease is, I understand, twenty-one years, and, in view of the fact that the Government has guaranteed £30,000 worth of work annually and has been good enough to increase this amount during the past year to £530,000, the company should have waited at least some time before making this demand for the expenditure of further sums of money for alteration and removal of plant. Mr E. J. HARRISON -Will the honourable gentleman say what was the loss on the dockyard? point. I am concerned that plant worth £2,000,000 has been leased on terms which were a disgrace. I want to impress upon honourable members that steps should be taken to see that the lessees are carrying out their part of the contract. I have given figures showing the manner in which work has been thrown to the company by the Government, and my protest is that when I sought information regarding the performance of the contract I had to wait a fortnight for a reply which should have been given within 24 hours, and then I was politely told to approach some employee of the Shipping Board and ask him to be gracious enough to allow me to bers, whether they favoured or opposed the leasing of the dockyard, are interested in the contract, and are sufficiently conscious of their duty to the public to desire to see that the terms of the agreement are observed byothe lessees. The report is not confidential, and should be available' to honourable members without their having to make application for it to the department. The Minister interjected that the giving of this contract a large for the ""building of two sloops at a cost of £250,000 each would create more work. That is true. I am not objecting to the work going to this dockyard; it may be the only yard at which it can be carried out. But the plea of the Government was that additional work would be provided by reason of the fact that Cockatoo Island was taken over by private enterprise, and would be able to Government could not contract to carry out. The Government has given the lessees £530,000 worth of work within twelve months, and my complaint is that they are not carrying it out in such a svay that the greatest amount of work possible is distributed as the result of thisarrangement. When repair work to trading ships comes in the men employed on the building of the sloops are taken off to carry out those repairs. The company has been given up to December, 1935, to complete the sloops, and I urge that the Government should see that the company gives the repair jobs to men who are walking about the streets looking for",38,Department Of The Interior

135,Mr Boseveab,"That is beside the work, instead of handing it over to those who are, and should continue to be, engaged in the building of the sloops. That is not an unreasonable request in view of the fact that the island was handed over to private enterprise in order to create employment, and that the building of 'these vessels was entrusted to the lessees without calling for tenders. South Johnston was built some five years In return for all this, they are not providing tbe maximum amount of work that should be forthcoming for the unemployed. I wish to endorse the remarks made by tbe honourable member for Brisbane( Mr before the ex-Deputy Director of Posts George Lawson) in regard to the lack of facilities provided for the transaction of public business by federal members in Brisbane. I brought this matter before the House committee, and I was told that I did not use the federal members' room in Brisbane to any great extent. As a matter of fact, because of the lack of accommodation, I have to ask any deputation that desires to wait on me there to see me at my hotel. There is room in the Commonwealth Bank building that would be suitable for members, but apparently the rent asked for it is more than the department is prepared to pay. let, and I may say that it is expected to expend £68,000 this year on a Commonwealth building in Brisbane. Mr Or win, Federal Director of ""Works in Queensland, that it will take four years to complete that building -He is a personal friend of mine, and gave me that information when I spoke to him of the conditions under which federal members are expected to meet their constituents there. Some effort has been made to bring about an improvement, but the position is still most unsatisfactory. Every representative of Queensland will tell the House that he cannot take those who wish to interview him to the federal members' rooms at Brisbane, because there is absolutely no privacy. If a member wishes to interview an elector in the room, other members present have to walk out. What the Minister has said as to the provision of additional accommodation is correct, but the complaint by the honourable member for Brisbane is also quite justified. Coming to my own electorate, I have received a request for the building of a residence for the postmaster at South Johnston, where land is available. This should secure the favorable consideration of the department. When the post office at ago, the council made a cutting in front of it, and people walking down the steps from the post office are likely to fall over the embankment into the cutting because of the failure to provide a protective railing. I brought this matter and Telegraphs, but the answer of the department was that the responsibility to provide this protection had not been determined. It would probably cost £8 or £9 to erect a railing, and I know that the Director of Works in Queensland would-go on with the job, but that no money is available for it. Surely, an expenditure of £8 or £9 should not be begrudged when it would avoid the risk of broken limbs or loss of life. When I entered this House, residents of Innisfail could register there for enrolment. On the last supplementary roll for the Innisfail subdivision there were 1812 new names, and for the subdivision of Tully28 or 30 miles distant-43 1 new electors were enrolled. On the Innisfail subdivision rolls, there are 7,209 names, and on those for Tully, 2,227. To-day, those wishing to be enrolled for the subdivision of Innisfail have to send their enrolment cards to Townsville. The change has been made on the score of economy. Mr Irwin, when Chief Electoral Officer, told me that he was instructed to cut down expenses, and that in carrying out that instruction he had to close down the Innisfail office. That office should be reopened. Under the present system, residents of Innisfail must send their cards down to Townsville at least two or three days before the closing date in order to secure enrolment. Upon the receipt of these cards, the responsible officer has to make inquiries, and quite a number of people found themselves disfranchised at the last federal election, not because they had failed to make application, for enrolment, but because they had",39,Department Of The Interior

These may seem trivial matters to some honourable members, but they are important to the people of my constituency. I have endeavoured to have them rectified without bringing them before the House, but without success. That is why I mention them to-day. Commonwealth Bank building is being erected at Hobart, and I think that provision should be made in it for federal members' rooms. At the present time, we have placed at our disposal only half a room at the Customs House. When I was interviewing some of my electors recently, I had to seat them in a car outusing one room and dining at the same side because the office was occupied, and it was impossible to stand in the street as it was raining heavily. The federal members' rooms in Sydney and Melbourne are quite satisfactory, and the representatives of Tasmania merely ask that there shall be provided for them in Hobart sufficient accommodation to enable them to meet their constituents. There are eleven representatives of Tasmania in this Parliament, and they are entitled to the same consideration as the members of mainland States receive. We have no furniture and only half a room in which to receive constituents who desire to interview us, or to meet the conmagnificent sum of Is. 6d. a week; also venience of visiting members from other States. I hope that consideration will be given to the request, and that we shall be placed on the same footing as members representing the other States. direct the attention of the Minister to the unnecessary expenditure incurred in connection with the management of hotels in the Federal Capital Territory. Until recently there were two hotels under governmental control. Recently the licence for one, the Kurrajong, was withdrawn, so there is now only one government hotel catering for the general public. Some time ago, the manager of the Hotel Canberra, Mr Evans, was pushed out, and now tw® officers of the Commissariat Department (Messrs. Garrett and Bushby) are, apparently, policing the management of the hotel. No privately owned hotel could be carried on successThe time for enrolment fully under those conditions. These commissariat officers are, I believe, supplied with free motor transport. All this expense is quite unnecessary. If the present manager is incapable of discharging his duties, he should be removed and another man appointed in his stead, because the control of a hotel is a one-man job. However, I think the present manager is quite competent to manage without any interference. The management of the Hotel Wellington, now in the hands of a private licensee, is just as efficient as that of any other hotel in the Federal Capital Territory. During the visit of the Duke of Gloucester, visitors accommodated at the Hotel Kurrajong paid various rates. Two persons were table; yet one was charged £5 5s. a week, and the other £4 4s. Some of the guests, I understand, paid only £2 2s. a week. During the time when honourable member* were accommodated at that hotel, it was efficiently managed by Miss Southwell, without assistance from commissariat officers. Another matter which I should mention has to do with the treatment of some employees who worked part time only. Those who were unfortunate enough not to have homes in Canberra were charged board. One employee told me that after he had paid for his board and meals during his off days, he had the that some of the female employees had only 4d. a week for themselves after they had paid for their board and meals on their days off. Better treatment would be meted out to animals. If an employee using a horse and cart to remove refuse from the hotels were put off for a day or two, it would still be necessary to stable and feed the horse so that it might be available for work when required. Government employees should not be treated with less consideration. for the Interior) [3.38] -The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) mentioned the change made recently in the method of collecting certain rents",40,Department Of The Interior

While it is comparatively easy for the Government to collect rents for houses from its own employees, it is no part of the ordinary activities of a government department to collect house rents from people who are in private employment. It was therefore decided some time ago to utilize the services of reputable firms in Canberra to do this work. I assure the honourable gentleman that it is not intended to depart from the general practice of collecting current rents from government employees, and of endeavouring to make reasonable arrangements for the payment of arrears. The honourable membeT for Brisbane( Mr George Lawson) deplored the delay which he thinks has occurred in connection with the erection of Commonwealth offices in Brisbane. A contract has been let, and it is expected that the building will be completed in October, 1935. About £68,000 will be expended in the current financial year. It is hoped that when the building is completed Queensland members will have the reasonable accommodation to which they are entitled. The honourable gentleman also spoke of the need for the services of a permanent typist. I am not quite clear if by that he means a typist in continuous employment, or a permanent typist in the sense in which the word is used by the Public Service Board. Two temporary typists are continuously employed in the Federal Members Rooms in Melbourne. continuously employed there. can be done to meet any reasonable requirements of Queensland members in that direction.

It is well to remember tliat the Tariff Board was created to advise Parliament as well aa the Minister. It is not possible from ceedings before the Tariff Board, and therefore members should have the board's reports before being asked to vote on the items affected. Anti-dumping duties were imposed in 1921 or 1922, at which time the Tariff Board sat in private and did not take evidence upon oath. Proclamations under the anti-dumping law passed by this Parliament twelve years ago still operate, although most of the conditions which existed then have disappeared. I hope that the Minister will let us know whether it is intended to repeal the proclamations, so that, in the event of further trouble arising, an inquiry can be held before such provisions become operative.

The Tariff Board has recommended the reductions of duties in all directions, and I understand that several reports are still to be presented which will recommend the reduction of duties, not only on secondary products, but on primary products also. Not only will the tobacco industry, the banana industry, and the cotton and peanut industries of Queensland suffer, but those of other States will be affected also. dustry may be affected. important industry. When the honourable member for Barton( Mr Lane) was in Queensland, he travelled one day past an area of hundreds of acres under canary seed crop. He remarked to a farmer in whose company he was that it appeared locally produced. [Qwrwm, to be a very fine crop of wheat, and was astonished to learn that it was canary seed. He did not wish to reveal his ignorance any further, so he waited until he met a friend, and asked him whether the farmer was "" pulling his leg "", because he did not think that there were enough canaries in the world to eat all the seed which that crop would produce. He did not even know that the seed was not raised only for canaries. I should like the Minister, when replying, to state whether the Leader of the Country party has made representations to him regarding the need for increasing the duties on imported tobacco, and reducing the excise on Australian tobacco, enthusiasm also among the and whether he has made any representations regarding tlie Tariff Board report the inclusion in the Cabiwhich recommended a reduction on the duty on bananas. The honourable member is now discussing something which is not debatable on the Estimates. Is not the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan) committing a breach of The Ministry the Standing Orders by indulging in tedious repetition? of order. before nexlt Tuesday to make himself au fait with the report of the Tariff Board, dealing with the tobacco industry, and to ignore the report of the commission. I ask him to restore the duty on tobacco to the 1931 level, so as to make it possible for those who were, on the strength of the then existing duty, induced to engage in .this industry, to make a satisfactory living. to emphasize the desirability of the Minister for Trade and Customs keeping a strict eye on the tobacco duties.

162,Mr Lane (Barton) [4.12],"I desirethe manner in which tobacco was being manufactured. Much of it was being made up and sold in a green state, with the result that the public had turned against it. member must connect his remarks with the question before the Chair. ter for Trade and Customs should employ more inspectors in the tobacco-growing areas to ensure that a high-grade tobacco is produced. When I was in Bundaberg, I asked a tobacconist why he did not have Queensland-grown tobacco displayed for sale, and he replied that the public would not smoke it. I assume that to be due to the failure of the excise officers to keep a strict watch on the quality of Australian tobacco leaf. This tobacconist placed the facts very clearly before me. He said that, so long as tobacco was produced as it is to-day in those parts, the storekeepers will not be able to sell it ; for even the hoboes will not smoke it when it is given to them. Similar reports were made to me when I visited Mareeba, where I inspected various barns and grading-sheds. After the very careful examination I have made of the industry in those districts, I submit that the honourable member for Kennedy is not justified in asking for further concessions for it. My view is that what the industry really requires for its own benefit is stricter supervision. The inefficiency at present evident is due to the fact that growers apparently hold the opinion that tobacco can be grown as easily as cabbages, and that scientific knowledge is not essential to the production of the leaf. [Quorum formed.] I suggest that goods passing through the Customs Department could be handled more expeditiously than at present. .organization in this respect. a member of one of the chief importing firms in Sydney to inspect the customs office in Sydney in order that I might see for myself how goods which are regularly imported into this country by this firm are handled. This firm complained that, although the goods in question were similar to those which it has been importing for many years the officers of the department have not yet devised a scheme for scheduling such goods and giving them an expeditious clearance. The result is that merchants generally are put to much trouble in getting I shall do so. The Ministheir goods through the customs house. Such grievances as these need rectification. I suggest that a more businessr like system could be introduced by tbe appointment of a stockkeepera man of commercial experience, and accustomed to handling goods. The ordinary departmental clerk understands little or nothing of dealing with imports. One reputable firm which, for many years, has been importing the same class of locks for use on trunks, complains that every new consignment is subject to the same process of examination and handling as those imported previously. Considerable delay is caused by the red tape methods of the department. I understand that guarantees are not readily accepted by the department, even though offered by reputable firms. In one case a delay of three weeks occurred in the delivery of a certain line of goods. My attention was drawn to the matter and it was not until six weeks later, after I had taken it up with the department and the importers concerned, that the goods were finally released. , Trade and Customs) [4.22] -The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde) complained that officers of the department engaged on duties in outback districts are not given fair opportunities for promotion.

Previous governments may have done so, but this Government certainly has not.

The honourable gentleman also complained that certain dumping duties are obsolete. I in formed the honourable member a few days ago that all these duties are being revised. TheT a r if f Board is to investigate whether such duties are to be imposed or taken off. The complaint by the honourable member for Barton( Mr Lane) of delay in the handling of goods is unique. Thousands of entries go through the Trade and Customs Department in all the States, and very little complaint is made by the importers, and when complaints have been investigated we have usually found that the delay was due to the failure of the person concerned to supply a proper entry dealing w it h the goods.
