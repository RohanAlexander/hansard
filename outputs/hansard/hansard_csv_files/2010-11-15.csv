On 11 August this year the federal government made an election promise to contribute $2.1 billion-the largest financial commitment of the campaign-towards the construction of the Epping-Parramatta rail link. It took just 90 days for the ALP national secretary to label this election promise an election mistake. This admission may have shocked the National Press Club but the people of Bennelong were far from surprised. The Epping-Parramatta rail link has been promised by successive state and federal Labor governments for more than 12 years. This election promise was a cheap political stunt to win votes in a marginal seat. It is becoming increasingly clear that this was an empty promise that this government never had an intention of honouring. The former member for Bennelong, Maxine McKew, has noted this morning: There was too great a gap between promises and delivery. People want to know … that you will do what you say you will do. There is no doubt that we crashed through a credibility barrier … An infrastructure development like this needs detailed planning to get the construction right and to ensure that taxpayer money is spent as productively and efficiently as possible. Bennelong is part of the north-western region of Sydney, which is one of the fastest growing corridors in the nation, yet for too many years we have been subject to a litany of broken promises on the provision of crucial infrastructure services. As we wait, the roads become more clogged, commuters become more frustrated and the cost to business and the cost of living soar. Infrastructure has simply not kept pace. The Epping-Parramatta rail link is merely part 2 of the Chatswood-Parramatta rail link that was announced by the state Labor government in 1998. The other major transport development needed is the north-west rail link, which will provide essential rail infrastructure from Epping through to Rouse Hill, helping tens of thousands of people get off the roads. Building both the Epping-Parramatta rail link and the north-west rail link will directly help the people of Bennelong to reclaim our streets. The price of not doing these projects is simply too high. Inaction will lead to widespread gridlock, resulting ultimately in the demise of our great city of Sydney through strangulation. We must work and fight to ensure that this does not happen. Both the Epping-Parramatta rail link and the north-west rail link must be planned and built now. Corio Electorate: Geelong CBD During the past week in Geelong we have seen the pages of our local paper, the Geelong Advertiser, filled with debate about the future of Geelong’s central business district.

260,Mr Marles (Corio,"Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs) (10.33 am)march of major retailers towards the waterfront and the empty shops left in their wake is, of course, not new. But sustained and thoughtful public discussion about what should be done to revive our ailing retail heart is new. I welcome that discussion wholeheartedly and congratulate the Geelong Advertiser for its initiative and commitment. I have voiced my concerns about this issue on many occasions, including several times in speeches delivered in the House. I passionately believe that Geelong could take its place among Australia’s best known heritage cities if we focused on reviving those buildings that have seen better days. Our built heritage could be a major drawcard enticing not just shoppers but also tourists to Ryrie and Moorabool streets. Just a few months ago I spoke about the importance of Ryrie Street, which, through its built heritage, plots the evolution of our city. Geelong is not a boom city like Bendigo and Ballarat. We are a city that was settled early and grew strongly firstly through agriculture and then through industry. The buildings of Ryrie Street reflect that, spanning the decades from the mid-1800s onwards, representing not just one era but many eras. But the removal of verandas, unsightly signage and general neglect means most of us barely look twice at many of these historic gems. The discussion over the past week has highlighted a few key issues: the costs and location of parking, how we can broaden the city’s appeal by encouraging more people to live there and making the streets more pedestrian friendly. We have heard from cities like Newcastle that have faced this challenge in the past and have taken a creative approach and reinvented themselves in the process. But to find a solution that suits Geelong we need to articulate that problem and that will not happen until our civic leadership puts our CBD on their agenda. So today I encourage the City of Greater Geelong, the Committee for Geelong and G21 to each place the fate of Geelong’s city centre on their well-published list of regional priorities. We can talk all we like-and discussion is absolutely crucial-but until these leadership groups put the CBD onto their priority lists for negotiations with local, state and federal levels of government then we are not acting. I do not think that there is a person who lives in Geelong who would not like to see a revival of the city centre and I welcome the debate in the pages of the Geelong Advertiser and look forward to the ‘Addy’ keeping this debate alive for the long haul. Solomon Electorate: Save Eaton Campaign the Department of Defence destroying small business and education in the seat of Solomon? Are they happy now that the first of these businesses-the Winnellie newsagent-closes its doors at the end of the month? And will they be happy when the supermarket at the same location closes its doors, possibly before the end of the year? The House has heard me talk about this issue before. I am referring to the Save Eaton campaign and the RAAF base houses in Winnellie. Last week I took Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for the Defence Force and Defence Support, Senator Ian Macdonald, for a tour of the houses so that he could see for himself the ridiculous situation that has unfolded. We then had a meeting with the Save Eaton campaign committee, which was formed by concerned community members. The newsagent, Andrew Snodgrass, and the supermarket owner, Allan Morris, both sit on the committee. Also present were Michael Purcell, the chairman of the Ludmilla Primary School, Mark Wynn, the local service station owner and Toni Vine Bromley MAIN COMMITTEE",196,Constituency Statements
261,Mrs Griggs (Solomon) (10.36 Am),"I rise to ask a question for my electorate. Why isfrom the Northern Territory Shelter as well as the Northern Territory Shadow Minister for Defence Liaison, Ross Bohlin MLA. The issue is straightforward. The Department of Defence is relocating people out of Eaton and as a result over the next three to five years 400 houses will be either demolished or left vacant. Right now there are 125 houses sitting there vacant. I have written to all of the relevant government minister and not one has agreed to meet on the subject-including, would you believe, the Minister for Defence Personnel, the member for Lingiari and a fellow Territorian himself, the Hon. Warren Snowdon. I have, however, managed to get a meeting with two of the Independents of the six in this House and I am very grateful and thank them for that. I want these houses made available to Territorians, including Defence Force families, or to other community members or other organisations. Until that occurs, the Defence department is killing small business and will kill off the school that has for several decades had at least a 25 per cent Defence family enrolment. In fact, they built a footbridge across the Bagot Road so that Defence children could walk safely to the Ludmilla Primary School. The coalition policy is to excise this land and assist in solving the appalling housing crisis in the seat of Solomon. Let me quote to you a text in the Northern Territory News on Saturday, 13 November 2010 so you can understand the desperation of these people in my electorate seeking affordable housing in Solomon: ‘Wondering if anyone knows of any cheap units to rent. It is silly that rent is going up all the time.’ It is signed: ‘Homeless single mum.’ Taxpayers fund the Department of Defence and they are appalled at the waste that is continuing right before their very eyes. It is time to end the waste and make these houses available to Territorians.

On Saturday, 6 November, I had the pleasure of attending the 110th Murwillumbah Show with my family. This show is an iconic event for the area. It has been run by the Tweed River Agricultural Society since 1900. In fact, it is one of the oldest, continuous running agricultural shows in the country. One of the highlights of the show’s history was in 1977, when the official opening was performed by Prince Charles. The show is a highlight on the Murwillumbah social calendar, along with Speed on Tweed and the Tweed Valley Banana Festival. It really is a major part of Murwillumbah. Murwillumbah is a beautiful town located in the Tweed Valley on the North Coast of New South Wales. It has the stunning Mount Warning as its backdrop. As always, this year’s show had an overwhelming array of activities and was attended by many locals and visitors. The main ring was a hive of activity with a comprehensive program of equestrian events, including showjumping and dressage, and fantastic livestock and trade displays where many great local products such as sugar cane were displayed. Another very exciting area was the woodchop arena, which had a very well-contested event program again this year. There are always many people involved in that. In the main pavilion there were many displays. Local schools had a number of displays and there were great examples of local produce-fruit and vegies and some floral displays. A local, Merilyn Gilmore, has been showing her floral creations at the show for the last 20 years and she has been the overall champion for the past three years.

It really is a place where city and country come together to enjoy the very best our region has to offer. I would like to acknowledge many of the generous sponsors of the show. Entry to the show remains free due to the support of the Tweed Shire Council and many local business sponsors. Whilst there are many people who contribute to the show, I would like to acknowledge the president, Jenny Glasby, and the secretary, Liz Chauvier. The most memorable event at the show was the presentation of life membership to Jenny and Barry Glasby, two outstanding and inspirational people who have dedicated so much of their lives to making the show the great success that it is today. I would also like to acknowledge all of the committee members who put in a huge amount of work all year in making the show a great success. It is due to the dedication of people like Jenny and Barry that the Murwillumbah Show continues its great tradition and continues to be, without a doubt, the very best agricultural show in the country. Higgins Electorate: Economy Ms O’DWYER (Higgins) (10.42 am)-Even the greatest spin merchants from the New South Wales Labor Party cannot spin this: the latest MYEFO released by the Treasurer, Wayne Swan, last week confirmed what Treasury and the Reserve Bank have been saying for a long time-that this Greens-Labor coalition government has neglected to take the tough decisions to rein in spending and is now threatening the long-run growth of the economy. Wayne Swan claims that spending growth is being constrained at two per cent, but this is after real spending increased by a massive 17 per cent over two years. You would have to go back two Labor governments, to the Hawke government in the 1980s, before you would see anything like that. There are two ways that the government can bridge this gap: the responsible way, to reduce spending, or what it has chosen to do, which is to increase taxes. Almost half of the $83 billion that the government has claimed to represent savings is merely due to increases in taxes. This of course is the big con-that the new mining tax will save the government $7.4 billion and that increases in tobacco excise will save the government $4.98 billion. This is Labor’s idea of saving, not cutting waste and rolling back a stimulus package that is no longer required but continuing to spend at exorbitant levels and increasing taxes. Higher taxes on mining, cars, crude oil, ethanol, alcopops and employees’ shares are all being used to prop up the budget. The Reserve Bank has raised interest rates seven times in just over 12 months. According to the RBA governor’s own monetary statements, these increases are due in part to the continued reckless fiscal policy of this Labor-Greens government. Every interest rate rise directly hits the household budgets of Australian families, making it more difficult for families who are continuing to struggle with the cost of living. The Treasury have warned that the Australian economy is expected to grow above trend over the forecast horizon and, with an already tight labour market, reach capacity within the next year or two. Treasury have also said that the Australian economy is growing solidly as a self-sustaining, private sector recovery takes hold. If the economy is so close to capacity and if the private sector has taken over, why does the government continue to roll out its stimulus? Why does it persist with expensive, ineffective and unpopular programs such as the cash-for-clunkers scheme? The government needs to provide a buffer against uncertain times. It cannot simply hope for the best or simply bet on China and the growth of commodity prices forever. In the MAIN COMMITTEE medium-term outlook is for Australia’s terms of trade to decline.

I want to recognise the successful setting up and implementation of a 2007 election commitment in Braddon which now has one of only a few select Enterprise Connect centres in the nation. Enterprise Connect is an Australian government initiative, in the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, which offers comprehensive advice and support to eligible Australian smalland medium-sized enterprises to help them transform and reach their full potential. The program’s core service offering is a free comprehensive business review, followed by the opportunity to access up to $20,000-that is dollar for dollar funding-to assist in implementing the recommendations of the review. In Tasmania Enterprise Connect’s office is located in Burnie in my electorate, with three business advisers servicing the state. Enterprise Connect currently has 98 Tasmanian smallto medium-sized enterprises engaged in the program, predominantly from the manufacturing sectors, inclusive of engineering, textile, clothing and footwear, food processing and general manufacturing. Tasmanian Enterprise Connect clients rank highly nationally with regard to the number of companies going on to access the funding support to implement business improvement. To date $1,372,543 has been spent on a variety of projects and $661,000 of that funding has been contributed by Enterprise Connect. Projects range from the implementation of lean manufacturing, marketing and strategic planning, enterprise resource planning, financial strategy, succession planning and management, and leadership development et cetera. Enterprise Connect also has recently launched a continuous improvement program as part of its service offering. The program is called the Supplier Continuous Improvement Program and is based on a program well trialled in the aerospace sector in the United Kingdom. Enterprise Connect Tasmania has successfully got one of the first Australian projects up and running, with eight Tasmanian SMEs who are linked into important local supply chains. This group of companies recently participated in a visit to Thales Australia’s defence protected mobility vehicle operations in Bendigo with an opportunity to present their capabilities to the company. This is the first time Thales has had this kind of exposure to the Tasmanian manufacturing sector. Additionally, Enterprise Connect delivers a number of targeted support programs to address specific business and regional development needs. North-west and Northern Tasmania is one of 10 regions nationally to be part of Enterprise Connect’s innovative sections region. I would like to acknowledge the work of Keith Calvert, Sarah Jones, Deanne Kapene, Adam Morton, Jack Van Tatenhove and all those who make Enterprise Connect Tasmania work so successfully.

263,Mr Sidebottom (Braddon) (10.45 Am),"I rise to speak about something real and posiAgriculture cal in the press today but that has been a topic of conversation in regional Australia for some time-particularly in my electorate-and that is the issue of foreign ownership of agricultural land. I should say at the outset that a large part of the agricultural sector of Australia was pioneered by overseas investment. Indeed, some classic examples in my electorate would be the great work that Clyde Agricultural, a British owned company, has done and the presence that they still have, although they are in the process of selling in the western part of New South Wales. The other one would be Auscott, the American owned company that largely pioneered cotton growing in Australia. Indeed, the expertise that was brought into the country by Auscott and the mentoring that they did of agronomists and the technical expertise that that allowed certainly enabled the industry to grow far beyond their influence. We have a growing population in the world and a finite land resource. The need for food security across the world is becoming more and more prominent. I think that is what has led to an escalation of foreign ownership of agricultural land. With the Foreign Investment Review Board regulations requiring quite a large amount before it can undertake a review, a large part of agricultural land comes under the radar. We do need food security in this country. The other issue is the ownership of the food chain: processing and infrastructure. Indeed, many of the grain handling facilities and much of the supply chain is now in the hands of foreign companies. A classic example of that was with the deregulation of wheat and the removal of the single desk. It meant that wheat marketing, instead of being in the hands of growers, is now largely in the hands of overseas owned companies. I do not know that in the long term that will be to the benefit of wheat growers. There have been calls from Senator Xenophon for a register. It is easy to find out who owns what. The real issue is what we going to do about it. While in the past I have actually sold livestock to a Japanese owned feedlot and got benefit from that, I think we need to look to the long-term interests of this country. Will our children thank us for selling off the farm and their future food security? Adelaide Electorate: Ms Megan Payne Ms KATE ELLIS (Adelaide-Minister for Employment Participation and Childcare and Minister for the Status of Women) (10.52 am)-I rise today to congratulate a remarkable constituent from the electorate of Adelaide, Ms Megan Payne, who was one of the inaugural winners of the 2010 Prime Minister’s Australian Youth Forum Challenge. This challenge was a number of initiatives announced by our government to support action by young people for the priority areas identified in the first ever National Strategy for Young Australians. As a result of this there was a national competitive funding round. Ms Megan Payne was one of six young people awarded funding through the challenge to empower young people to be active changemakers within their own communities-for us to give the opportunity for young people themselves to change their own lives and to change the lives of those around them. Megan was awarded $15,000 for her project, which aims to support the engagement and inclusion of international students, migrants and new arrivals within our local community.

264,Mr Coulton (Parkes) (10.48 Am),"I rise to speak about a matter that has become topithing really refreshing at a time when so many choose to focus on that which divides us to see Megan putting her work into that which unites us and to making sure that there is an understanding, tolerance and a sense of community amongst all of those in our community from a range of different backgrounds. With this funding, this Saturday Megan will be hosting the Youth Migrant Support and Celebration Day, where international students and migrants will be provided with a series of information sessions about services and customs in Australia. This will take place during the day. At night there will be a multicultural event of traditional food and dance to celebrate the diverse community which we are lucky enough to call home in Adelaide. We know that too often international students arrive in Australia with very little information or knowledge about our customs and culture and that this can lead them to feel isolated and to have a negative experience within Australia. We also know from the recent review into international students that there is exploitation in the workforce, safety concerns and a lack of access to support services. It is fantastic to see Megan’s work in empowering communities. Not only will this project benefit the many international students and migrants who attend on the day but Megan and her group, Uniting New Immigrants in Australia, are working to ensure that the aims of this project are sustainable in Adelaide, looking to make partnerships with other organisations to support international arrivals well into the future. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Megan as a young person who is passionate about our community and wish her all the best for a fantastic event on Saturday. Gilmore Electorate: Ms Grace Kennedy individual in the community whose attitude to life and determination sets them apart from their peers. Through their approach, the strength of their personality and an ability to inspire others, they shine like a beacon in their community. I am sure other members of the House would share that sentiment, but, when it is a young teen struggling with a disability in the face of adversity, I am truly impressed. It was my good fortune to recently meet a 16-year-old girl from Vincentia, which sits on the shores of Jervis Bay. Grace Kennedy has spina bifida and paraplegia, and this has not slowed her down. In fact, I believe it has made her even more determined not to be beaten. She is a true competitor in every sense of the word. Grace is a successful competitive swimmer with excellent upper-body strength and a high achiever scholastically who demonstrates some natural sailing skills and a very can-do attitude. She has a desire to compete in sport on equal terms with able bodies. She is a member of Sailability Callala, a local sailing club, and has been invited to participate in the 303 doubles in Melbourne as a crew member of the club’s president, Malcolm Cameron. Malcolm identified her potential early and has undertaken to coach and mentor her in sailing. Grace’s parents are fully supportive, and I applaud Malcolm for his vision and his faith in Grace. Malcolm says he could see Grace competing at the 2011 nationals in a 2.3 single, and so can I. RecentlyI was honoured to be invited to Sailability Callala’s season open day, where Grace delivered a speech. I would like to share her words with the House today. She said: As a member of Sailability CallalaI would like to express my thanks to a number of organisations who have generously contributed to our club.

Without assistance we could not afford the boats and equipment that has made our club one of the best in country New South Wales. RecentlyI spent a couple of days in Sydney learning the ropes of our new SKUD. It looks fantastic and the design means it can be sailed by anyone. I also met Dan Fitzgibbon the previous owner this boat who is an Australian Paralympian which was a real thrill. Through Sailing, it was another chance to meet many people and make new friends. Through SailingI can enjoy a sport that may be a large part of my life. Grace stands as an inspiration to other teens, regardless of whether or not they are able bodied. She is a courageous young woman and deserves the full support of the community. Grace says that sailing makes her feel ‘free and equal’ and that she ‘loves being splashed’. I can only begin to imagine the intensity of the emotion behind those words, but slowly I am beginning to appreciate that many of the bounds that hold us back are of our own making. I take my hat off to Grace, and I am very proud of her. Bass Electorate: Building the Education Revolution Program the government has invested $16.2 billion in schools right across Australia for minor infrastructure and refurbishment projects, major new infrastructure in primary schools, and new science and language centres in secondary schools. In the past weeks I have had the very great pleasure of experiencing first hand the benefits these projects bring to schools and their local communities in my electorate of Bass. It has been my privilege to attend the opening of these facilities and to meet the students and community members who are benefiting from this fantastic program. The official openings of new multipurpose halls and classroom refurbishments at Ravenswood Heights Primary School and Ringarooma Primary School have been perfect examples of what Building the Education Revolution set out to achieve. These two projects employed 36 workers-the very essence of the economic stimulus plan-with funding of over $3 million producing first-class learning areas, administration and school amenities. It has been fantastic to see the principals, school staff, parents and tradespeople working together to deliver these important projects. I would like to recognise the hard work undertaken by the schools, the community and the Tasmanian Department of Education in delivering these important projects. Now that they are completed, teachers and students in these schools will be teaching and learning in the 21st century facilities that they so richly deserve.

The new halls and classrooms represent a great relationship between the federal government and local communities; a relationship that I will be striving to continue in the electorate of Bass. I congratulate the school communities involved and wish the schools and students all the best as they use their new 21st century facilities. der 193 the time for constituency statements has concluded. Asbestos Debate resumed, on motion by Mr Murphy: That this House: (1) notes that the Bernie Banton Foundation estimates that by 2020, some 40,000 Australians will have contracted asbestos related cancer; (2) recognises the role governments, the trade union movement and individuals, such as Bernie Banton, have played in raising awareness about the dangers of asbestos and in banning the sale and use of asbestos and asbestos products in Australia; (3) expresses concern that: (a) countries, such as Canada, continue to export asbestos to India and many other countries in South Asia; and (b) international efforts to list chrysotile asbestos under the Rotterdam Treaty, which requires importing countries to be warned of the risks associated with hazardous substances and products, have been blocked by countries, such as Canada; and (4) leads international efforts to ban the sale, mining and use of all forms of asbestos, such as chrysotile asbestos, throughout the world. ment. This motion is named in honour of the late Bernie Banton, the inspirational antiasbestos campaigner who lost his battle to mesothelioma almost three years ago today. Despite his terminal illness, he fought so that the health disaster caused by asbestos was exposed and stopped. He fought for the rights and safety of his co-workers and their families and for justice to bring those responsible to account. I had the great honour of knowing Bernie and I know his courageous widow Karen, who continues Bernie’s fight against the devastating effects of asbestos related disease. I have witnessed a courageous Australian who believed in doing what is right and fighting not only for himself but for everyone affected by asbestos. In this chamber we are all well aware of the David and Goliath style battle between James Hardie and victims of asbestos, including Bernie Banton. With the assistance of the unions, Bernie, Barry Robson, President of the Asbestos Disease Foundation of Australia, and other sufferers were successful in their fight for recognition, justice and compensation. Through their courage they helped raise awareness about the dangers of asbestos.

268,Mr Murphy (Reid) (11.01 Am),"I am very pleased to present this motion to the parliaawareness of asbestos and in banning the sale and use of asbestos and asbestos products in Australia. Although Australia has banned asbestos, the very alarming fact is that, despite the evidence of the very adverse and lasting health effects of asbestos, it is estimated that the world production of asbestos is still more than two million tonnes a year. That is why, today, I have moved this motion and, most importantly, that this House express its concern about countries such as Canada that continue to export asbestos to countries such as India and many other countries in South Asia. Further, we express our concerns that efforts to list chrysotile asbestos under the Rotterdam Treaty, which requires importing countries to be warned of the risks associated with hazardous substances and products, have been blocked by countries such as Canada. Armed with our experience of asbestos, Australia should lead the international efforts to ban the sale, mining and use of all forms of asbestos throughout the world. Many medical and scientific articles highlight the severe risks posed by asbestos and should serve as a haunting example to the rest of the world. As I have stated before in this place, it may only take one asbestos fibre to cause an asbestos related disease, decades after initial exposure. The more one is exposed to asbestos particles, the greater the risk of developing and asbestos related disease in the future. The prognosis for mesothelioma is chilling. The average life expectancy from diagnosis to death is 152 days and treatment options are very limited. The Bernie Banton Foundation estimates that by 2020 some 40,000 Australians will have contracted asbestos related cancer. Alarmingly, it has been reported that the national incidence rates for mesothelioma in Australia are the highest in the world. That is why I have worked with my community to raise awareness and improve the lives of those affected. In 2007 I joined Bernie Banton’s fight to get mesothelioma treatment, Alimta, listed under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. After a very successful campaign, which collected over a thousand signatures in my electorate alone, the former health minister approved Alimta under the PBS for all asbestos disease sufferers to help improve and prolong their lives. My community also supports the campaign for an international ban on the mining, sale and use of asbestos-also through a petition. The local petition received overwhelming support with more than 1,000 signatures collected. Many petitions were returned with notes and letters containing personal stories of lives affected by asbestos and noting the need to stop this from ever happening again to innocent people. The Bernie Banton Centre is located in the grounds of Concord Repatriation Hospital in my electorate of Reid. The federal government has provided significant funding for the establishment of the centre and I have the pleasure of knowing its Director, Professor Nico van Zandwijk. Important research is being conducted at the centre to discover treatments for asbestos related diseases and, one day, a cure. Despite the ban on asbestos in Australia there is still great concern about the continued threat asbestos poses to all Australians. In an interview with Heath Gilmore, of the Sydney Morning Herald, Professor van Zandwijk expressed his concern at the very real risk that Australians still face from environmental exposure to asbestos. Asbestos was historically a threat to those who had been exposed through their work; more recently, it has been a threat through the increase in the number of home renovations and demolitions being done without the necessary precautions. Professor van Zandwijk fears that future generations will have to deal with MAIN COMMITTEE asbestos related diseases contracted from environmental exposure, including from contaminated landfill material being unearthed. He said: We don’t know the level of potential exposure and we need to develop a greater understanding. It is a matter of increasing awareness and developing a register of where this is happening. We have a duty to ensure that we are vigilant at every level of government to safely dispose of asbestos and prevent new generations from falling victim to such a deadly disease. If the effects of asbestos in Australia are not compelling enough, let us have a look around the world. An article published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives in July this year states that an estimated 20,000 asbestos related lung cancers and 10,000 cases of mesothelioma occur annually across the populations of Western Europe, Scandinavia, North America, Japan and Australia. It is estimated that, in Britain alone, mesothelioma will claim 90,000 lives by 2050 and asbestos will account for more than half of all birth related cancer deaths. Although 52 countries have banned all forms of asbestos, many more developing nations still import and use this deadly product. There is strong evidence that all forms of asbestos cause asbestosis, malignant mesothelioma, lung cancer and laryngeal cancer and may even cause ovarian and gastrointestinal cancer. Further, for more than 20 years asbestos has been declared a human carcinogen by respected health organisations such as the World Health Organisation’s International Agency for Research on Cancer. Moreover, scientific communities overwhelmingly agree that there is no safe level of exposure to any form of asbestos and, therefore, no reason to exempt a type of asbestos from a worldwide ban. The most important factor, I believe, in the call for an international ban is the fact that the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives is preventable. Safer alternative materials and products have replaced asbestos, so there is no need to continue using this deadly material. However, many believe that the political and economic influence of the mining and manufacturing industry has prevented a worldwide ban. Surely, preventable loss of life must take precedence over economic gain and Australia must continue to speak out on the danger of asbestos to the lives of others around the world. We know all too well the serious cost to the environment, our health system and our community of not speaking out against such a catastrophe occurring in other less developed nations. Sadly, countries such as Russia, China, Brazil, Canada and Zimbabwe continue to produce large amounts of asbestos. Countries in Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America and Africa still use asbestos-including China, India, Thailand, Vietnam and the Ukraine-and will likely see a significant increase in the number of men, women and children affected by asbestos related diseases. This could be prevented if all forms of asbestos were banned worldwide. The Rotterdam convention is an international agreement to help regulate global trade in hazardous chemicals that are either banned or severely restricted due to their serious effects on humans and the environment. The convention was established to help protect countries-in particular, developing countries-from importing such hazardous chemicals without prior informed consent. Effectively, prior informed consent is legally binding to ensure that governments are aware of the health and environmental risks before they import materials regulated under the convention. Under the conference regulations a hazardous material can be listed only if there is unanimous agreement of the 131 nations which are parties to the convention. At the 2008 conference an attempt to list chrysotile, the most prevalent type of asbestos, was opposed. I note that more than 100 countries tried to list chrysotile on the Rotterdam convention list. HowMAIN COMMITTEE ever, not surprisingly, the few countries opposed to listing chrysotile are the same countries that still use asbestos. One former constituent, Mr Ralf Kluin, who has followed my anti-asbestos campaign, wrote to me and responded to my motion with the following: Vested capitalist/industrial interests, dealing in dangerous material, for nothing other than for blatant self interest, exposing unwitting people, those with only their labour to sell, dangerously employed, with little or no compensation and looking at an early death; the communities living and playing in the vicinities of these asbestos mines; and the production of product from this poisonous asbestos material, scientifically proven to kill; the owners must be shut down and wherever possible, prosecuted. We must challenge the countries and industries that support asbestos mining, production and use and call for an international ban, because that is what is right. We cannot allow a repeat of the reckless and irresponsible behaviour of companies like James Hardie here in Australia to be repeated around the world despite countless warnings. The World Trade Organisation called the so-called controlled use of asbestos a fallacy. The World Health Organisation stated that the only efficient way to eliminate asbestos disease is ‘to stop using all types of asbestos’. I stand here this morning with my parliamentary colleagues and thank them for their support as I continue my call in this place for Australia to lead international efforts to ban the sale, mining and use of all forms of asbestos, such as chrysotile, throughout the world. (Time expired) is probably important to look at the work that is occurring in Canada at the moment in addressing some of the issues in the export of asbestos to developing economies. That is the area that I will focus on this morning. In Quebec there are, I think, two small mines still exporting chrysotile to developing economies like India and parts of Africa. This is of great concern because a number of tactics have been used to try and bring that trade to an end and so far they have been unsuccessful. A motion like this draws our minds to what we are doing in this country. The Australian Labor Party’s position on uranium is not so dissimilar to the debate we are having today about asbestos: the great tension about whether we can mine something and export it overseas even though we choose to not use it domestically. While I think it is great to bring a euphemistic motion before this chamber, it is important to remember that, if you take just a slightly different look at another mineral, in many cases you will find that the very movers of this motion are doing exactly the same thing with a different element. That said, we can look at Canada and understand that some very powerful coalitions are forming to pressure that country to revise its position on the export ofMs HallMr Deputy Speaker, I seek to intervene and ask a question. give way? Ms Hall-My question to the member is: in relation to uranium and the argument that he is putting before the House, is he arguing that Australia should not export uranium?

271,Mr Laming,"Yes.speech. What we have is tension between the Prime Minister of Canada and the Premier of Quebec, who both find themselves tacitly supporting the continued export. The concern for many who are opposed to what is effectively the transfer of asbestos to developing economies-where the understanding, knowledge and regulation of the use of this product are fairly limited-is the responsibility a developed economy has to make sure that is done fairly and safely. The answer probably is, in current arrangements: very, very little. Some have attempted to use the Rotterdam treaty, which focuses on pesticides, as a way of preventing the use of a product that, they would argue, can be used safely only in an almost theoretical sense. While the figures diverge, the Canadian-government-sponsored Chrysotile Institute will say that it is 99.8 per cent safe to use asbestos under certain conditions. I think everyone in this chamber would know that those conditions do not exist around the world. The best figures we have about the number of deaths due to asbestos are, I think, even higher than those the member provided earlier. If you take all of the deaths in the developed world, it is in the order of 100,000 per year. We need to be balancing that morally against the economic impact for economies. Choosing Canada because it is a developed economy and the wealthiest of the asbestos exporters, let us consider the price that they would pay if they were to cease the export of asbestos. The answer is that there probably are 200 to 500 jobs in those mines. Some would argue that those mines are already economically barely above water. Many of them are still reliant on government sponsorship to survive. So this is a sector that is struggling. We also know that there is direct support from the Canadian government. There is a very financially favourable loan to expand a new mine. But we also know that the Canadian government has a link with the Chrysotile Institute, which they support to prepare newsletters like this. I found this of enormous interest. This is a 12-page document that promotes the safe use of asbestos. It even includes beautifully illustrated headers showing smiling children from developing economies, who are obviously delighted that asbestos is arriving on their shores. On further reading, what it is effectively saying is that asbestos can be safely and responsibly used, under controlled circumstances. It then goes into significant detail to convince the world that there is no longer ‘any exposure’ theory-that it is no longer the case that any form of exposure can lead to cancer. While I regard that as being an intellectually fascinating detail in this document, in a practical sense it is a complete waste of space, time and taxpayers’ money, if I could make that observation from the other side of the Pacific. The current Canadian government do not want to lose a couple of seats in Quebec. They do not want the backlash that could occur if there were to be some restrictions on the mining of asbestos. And, fundamentally, a developed economy does not really have any concern for how a product, once it leaves its shores, is used when it arrives in the market that has purchased it. This should be of enormous concern. It does sound a little bit like the tobacco industry, and, as I have said already, it sounds a little bit like the Australian’s Labor Party’s approach to uranium. Let us be very clear about this: there have been and there will be extreme statements on both sides. I will just allude to a few of these. Firstly, we are seeing, particularly in Canada, very few politicians prepared to speak out about this topic. We are only just starting to see MAIN COMMITTEE",207,Private Members Business
272,Mr Laming,"That is an excellent question which I will answer as I progress through thesome cracks here, with the NDP and some federal Liberals-and, in Canada, unions, outside Quebec-starting to support the words of the previous speaker. If you look a little closer at who graces the pages of these Canadian government funded newsletters, it is-yes, you guessed it-the union movement. Right at the top of it, you will be interested to read that the chrysotile asbestos labour unions from Quebec are on the front lines, fighting hard on this issue to continue the export of asbestos. I think it is just worth making sure that that is on the public record, because that is printed in a Canadian government funded newsletter from an institute which is itself run and owned by someone who previously owned an asbestos mine. So it does appear to get murkier. While I cannot pretend to fully understand the ins and outs of asbestos in Canada, it is also interesting to see some of the rhetoric that is suffused through these Canadian government sponsored newsletters. One example is: ‘We have been vigilant and perseverant in defending the rights of workers.’ That certainly evokes the language of the front lines of the left, doesn’t it? These are the guys who are defending the jobs of the people who dig this stuff up. There are 200 to 300 of them, and probably another 500 who are indirectly associated with asbestos export. They are the very people who you would potentially put out of work-but to save the lives of 100,000 people. It has to start somewhere, doesn’t it? If you bring a motion to this place, you need to realise that the case being made to continue the status quo is not always being made by powerful industry. It can sometimes be made by a labour union, and sometimes by a government that is defending its own economic interests. I just place that before the chamber: that newsletter, ‘for the safe and responsible use of chrysotile’. Of course, when they make their case, they leave the word ‘asbestos’ out, because that is a little bit distasteful these days, isn’t it? So instead, they use the chemical name to try and avoid any insensitivity. In short, every health organisation you have ever heard of will talk about the dangers of asbestos and say that more needs to be done, and what we have here is one developed economy that certainly does not appear to be doing enough. You can call it indifference but you can also call it a focus on a domestic economy. Parts of Quebec are probably not doing that well at the moment and those few hundred jobs, let us be honest, support families who would be extremely disadvantaged were they to be transitioned into other forms of the economy. So we have to be looking for solutions to that if we are to aspire to those noble aspirations that were mentioned in the previous speaker’s motion. I am not saying that any politician is an enthusiastic advocate of asbestos. Obviously they are not. But I think it is important to point out the tensions. The residence of the Canadian Prime Minister is currently having asbestos removed from it and the House of Commons in Canada in recent years has had the asbestos removed from it. So the argument is: can we really expect that it is completely fair to be exporting asbestos at exactly the same time? Both levels of government, Quebec and Canada itself, find themselves in a situation where it is only continued government support that keeps these mines up and running and they continue to export-and we hear of the dreadful morbidity. (Time expired) Ms OWENS (Parramatta) (11.21 am)-I am very pleased to support the member for Reid in asking the House to ensure that Australia takes a leading role in establishing a treaty to prevent the mining and export of asbestos worldwide. It is right that we do that because we in MAIN COMMITTEE this country have lived through the development of the asbestos industry and the plague that it has perpetrated on the families and the workers involved. Australia suffers one of the highest rates of incidence of mesothelioma in the world, with estimates of 13,000 cases by 2020 and a further 40,000 to 45,000 cases of asbestos related cancer. The dreadful statistics indicate that the rates of incidence of this awful disease are not expected to peak until 2017, even though asbestos manufacture and use as a new product in Australia ceased in 1983. Survival rates are extremely poor with only five per cent of patients alive five years after diagnosis. We as a country know the future of the workers and families in countries around the world where asbestos is now being used quite freely. While Australia and many other developed nations have banned the use of asbestos many developing countries, including India and other countries in South Asia, are still employing the deadly product and countries like Canada are allowing the sale of this deadly substance to developing nations-knowing full well the risk it poses. We are well and truly watching history repeat itself. Let me take India as an example. It is a place many ‘Parramattians’ literally consider a part of the family. It is a place, for Parramatta, where many brothers, sisters, mums and dads still live. It disturbs me and many other people in Parramatta to know that since 1960 India has used seven million tonnes of asbestos and its usage is only intensifying. Over the last 30 years India’s usage of asbestos has increased by more than 300 per cent. That this industry is allowed to flourish at a time when the occupational, environmental and domestic hazards of asbestos exposure are firmly established is quite scandalous. Dr Sanjay Chaturvedi said it well when he observed that historically the burden of industrial pollution reaches the developing world much faster than the fruits of industrial growth. In developed countries you cannot even give it away these days. There are laws that prevent society’s use of this poisonous substance. To absorb the fall in global demand, chrysotile asbestos-pushers have aggressively targeted consumers in countries with booming economies but developing health and regulatory frameworks. In India, asbestos producers have found a ready market for their goods and over the last decade India has overtaken all others as Canada’s most important chrysotile asbestos export destination. More than a quarter of Canada’s yearly asbestos exports are to India, raking in more than $50 million for Canadian exporters. Attempts to list chrysotile asbestos under the Rotterdam Treaty in 2006 failed. Listing it under the treaty would require importing countries to be warned of risks associated with hazardous substances. The failure to list this deadly substance leaves many citizens of developing countries importing the product at grave risk. I support the member for Reid in calling for further international efforts to have the mining and export of asbestos banned world wide. Western knowledge of the dangers of asbestos has been around for a long time. Pliny the Elder first noted many thousands of years ago that people who worked with asbestos displayed a sickness of the lungs, but the first death in modern times from asbestos exposure was recorded as early as 1899, which is nearly 40 years before James Hardie opened its plant at Camellia in my electorate. In 1900, a physician at London’s Charing Cross Hospital concluded that a 30-year-old man had died from an asbestos related disease. The French knew about the dangers of asbestos as early as 1906 and made recommendations that ventilation be increased in asbestos workplaces. In 1917 and 1918 several US studies showed that asbestos workers were dying unnaturally young. In 1916, just over 20 years before James Hardie opened its plant in Camellia, Presidential Life Insurance in the US MAIN COMMITTEE started refusing to give life insurance to anybody who worked in an asbestos related industry. Yet nearly 100 years later this product is being sold to developing countries, and over the next 50 to 70 years those countries will pay the price for using this material. I commend the member for Reid for bringing this motion to the House, and I support it fully. very important issue to the notice of the House. I have just got off the phone to Vicki Hamilton, the CEO of GARDS, the Gippsland Asbestos Related Disease Support group. Vicki herself lost both her father and her grandfather to asbestos related diseases, and she raised a number of issues. It says in one of her notes about one of the people she supports: Asbestos support groups are a very unique thing, not only do we have a common foe but the disease is incurable, so the people who come to our group find it difficult to go to other cancer support groups and sit with people who have breast cancer, because they have a hope of being cured, whereas those with an asbestos-related disease know there is no cure. in the Latrobe Valley, and eventually they started asking questions about the lack of services available. GARDS has spread asbestos awareness information throughout the area, supported families through support group meetings and free medical equipment to make life more bearable and kept those families connected with the information they need. GARDS has also advocated new drugs, conducted research and worked with the occupational health and safety regulations and awareness campaigns. Their lobbying brought a $21 million regional hospital to the Latrobe Valley in 2006. Up until then, 80 per cent of cancer patients at the Monash Medical Centre at Springvale in Melbourne were people commuting from the Latrobe Valley. According to Vicki Hamilton, the power station in the Latrobe Valley was warned of the dangers of asbestos by the United Kingdom in the late thirties, yet the problem had manifested itself beyond control or care-it was everywhere. According to Vicki, ‘Any house built up until the late 1980s will have asbestos in it, whether it is under the eaves or floor or in textured paints and tiles et cetera.’ Vicki says that although asbestos is ‘a really wonderful product, it’s a pity it kills you’. With no cure and with limited knowledge of asbestos related diseases, Vicki says: It doesn’t matter who you are, everyone will breathe into their lungs asbestos fibres, we will all breathe them in, they are in our environment, what triggers you to succumb to an asbestos disease nobody knows yet.’ There needs to be a lot more scientific research on that issue. A man walked into the Vicki’s office five years ago and said that, out of a group of 33 men who worked under the same conditions in the Latrobe Valley, he was the only one who was still alive and had no signs of an asbestos related disease. Elaine Callow was living the reality of the kind of devastation that the disease can wreak on people’s lives, and many others in the Latrobe Valley were suffering alongside her. People said to Elaine, ‘You poor thing.’ But Elaine said: ‘I don’t want that; I just want the word to be out there to stay away from it, keep away from this disease. It’s just hanging around, waiting to get the next person and there is nothing you can do about it.’ Vale to Elaine Callow. Elaine lost her battle with mesothelioma on 4 September 2010. Elaine was held in high esteem by the GARDS organisation and will be sadly missed. But she will not be forgotten. Her memory will live on in those who knew her well. She would want us to go on making a difference in the lives of others affected by this deadly carcinogen. She MAIN COMMITTEE",208,Private Members Business
273,Mr Broadbent (Mcmillan) (11.26 Am),"I thank the member for Reid for bringing thiswould want us to keep up the fight to rid Australia of this deadly material and to eventually eradicate it from our communities, where it is killing 3,000 people a year. We will miss you very much, Elaine; we enjoyed our visits with you in those last few months. Elaine was one of the GARDS treasures. Rest in peace, Elaine; your battle is now over-till we meet again, 1936 to 2010. In my closing remarks I want to say what Vicki said to me on the phone. She said we need a whole-of-government approach with every area of government activity looking closely at this matter, and we need housing audits so that, if you go to buy a house, there has actually been an asbestos audit on that house and you know before you buy that house exactly what the asbestos situation is. She said this problem is not going away. Professor Julian Peto, an English professor, predicted that Australia would not peak in 2020 but rather the peak might not be until 2050. Serious money needs to be thrown at this issue. They already have kits for removal of small areas of asbestos. Every one of us is guilty-I have been guilty in the past-of breaking up asbestos, throwing it in the trailer and taking it to the tip. In Vicki’s own words, a bit of money chucked their way to look after the families affected would not go astray. I say to the member for Reid and members of the government: if you would like to look closely at what this organisation is doing, it is on their website. I pay tribute not only to Vicki Hamilton but also to Brian Clegg, Dorothy Roberts, my old friend and political foe John Parker, secretary of the union down there, and members Marie Smith and Ann Clegg. I commend this motion to the House and acknowledge that this is an issue that needs to be addressed. and Settlement Services) (11.31 am)-It is predictable that I, along with the member for Reid and the member for Parramatta, would be involved in this debate on asbestos. As people would be aware, James Hardie’s main plant operation was at Camelia in Western Sydney. This touches us very directly. Coincidentally, this weekend I will be at a race meeting at Rosehill for the Asbestos Diseases Foundation. I know of many people who have died from this disease. Asbestosis was one of the contributing factors in my father’s death. Our area has been the location of much illegal dumping over the decades by James Hardie. I put on the record my commendation of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, journalist Matt Peacock, Bernie Banton and the others who have crusaded on this issue. I also express the hope that former management of James Hardie come clean at this late stage and reveal to the Australian public where this illegal dumping occurred in previous years. I commend the member for Reid for raising this issue. It is just another example of an international problem. When contraceptives are banned in the First World because they are unsafe, they are still marketed in developing countries. We constantly see stories about the illegal export of chemical waste to West Africa-fraudulent paperwork through the shipping corporations and mangy European companies dumping stuff that they are not allowed to dump in Europe. This is just another example of the problem. The hypocrisy of Canada is rampant. We have a situation where that country is prioritising the removal of asbestosis in its own schools. We have a situation where its use is banned in that nation. Yet, the provincial government of Quebec, I am led to believe, can provide a $58 million line of credit to ensure that mines go ahead and that they export the product to other countries which have less control over it, MAIN COMMITTEE",211,Gards Began In 1991 As An Afternoon Cup Of Tea To Support The Increasing Number Of Widows
274,Mr Laurie Ferguson (Werriwa,"Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairswhich have less knowledge, which have less infrastructure and which have weaker medical systems. Mention has been made of the Rotterdam convention of 1998, which seeks to promote cooperation between countries in the international trade of hazardous chemicals. Canada, once a reputable nation in environmental matters, has been in there with India, China and Kazakhstan in trying to ensure that measures are not taken on asbestos and that restrictions in this area are thwarted. Fifty-two countries have banned the mining of asbestos. That says something. First World nations have knowledge, which the member for Parramatta has just put forward, and we have had that knowledge for many decades. It is not debatable and it is not questionable-it is definite. Yet Canada is exporting this material. The ILO has joined with the Canadian Medical Association, the Canadian Labour Congress and the Canadian Cancer Society in condemning the action of the Canadian government in facilitating, supporting and promoting the continued export of asbestos for the dollar. India is an expanding economy but there has been promotion of this product by reputable media there. They say it is very safe despite the fact that it is internationally known to be otherwise. The situation is that India will find it very difficult to deal with this product. Internationally 107,000 people die from asbestos related lung cancer each year. The building needs of India mean that there will be very wide usage of it. India is also at the forefront in the dismantling of international vessels laden with asbestos. India not only imports asbestos for its building and construction industry but also has industries like this, which would not be allowed in the First World, where unskilled, illiterate Indian people are asked to dismantle these ships, thereby putting themselves in danger. I am not just speaking about asbestos. I noted earlier the danger from other products-25 per cent of the worldwide use of pesticide occurs in the developing world but 99 per cent of acute poisoning deaths appear in those same countries. They do not have the infrastructure; they do not have the means of tackling and combating these problems. I commend the member for Reid for raising what is a very fundamental health issue, which Australia should also be raising in international forums. for bringing forward this motion on the absolute need for action on asbestos-the exporting of asbestos and the need for further action across the world. It has certainly been the tragic experience of this country that no use of asbestos and no level of exposure to asbestos, in any form, is safe. When talking about chrysotile, the white asbestos; crocidolite, the blue asbestos; or amosite, the brown asbestos, you hear the argument: ‘What about the blue and the brown? That’s the really dangerous staff. The chrysotile, the white asbestos, can be used safely.’ We have seen comments like this made in the Thai media and I even noticed recently on IslamOnline.net someone making the case for Zimbabwe’s export of white asbestos: ‘This is the safe stuff; this is the pure asbestos.’ Ms Saffin-There is no safe asbestos. in the world. You might refer to something as white or pure and that tends to create the image in a lot of people’s minds that it is somehow better. Others might say that this white asbestos MAIN COMMITTEE",212,Gards Began In 1991 As An Afternoon Cup Of Tea To Support The Increasing Number Of Widows

276,Mr Simpkins,"That is exactly right. I note that there is never any form of safe asbestosbreaks down a bit better, but the harsh reality is that so many people-some 100,000 people around the world per year-die from exposure to blue and brown asbestos and also, most definitely, from exposure to white asbestos. There is no such thing as safe asbestos and it is certainly good that since 2004 Australia has taken many steps forward to deal with asbestos. Whilst we have members present here who have had personal experiences during the times of the worse excesses of James HardieI will also make mention of the actions of that company. I would like to say that the behaviour of that company has always been a matter of great disgrace. It would be good if they were fully held to account for their terrible behaviour in Australia’s past-for their mining, their dumping, their obfuscation and their covering-up. That is certainly a matter of great distaste for all in this country who are aware of it. Much of this motion relates to the exporting of asbestos from Canada. As I have said, Zimbabwe is also an exporter, as is Russia. As has been said by all other speakers, it comes down to when we ban things in the Western world. For example, Canada has banned the use of asbestos in its own country but somehow its industry still needs to go on so they are more than happy to export it to India. I wonder whether India itself could start making a little bit more effort and maybe talk about banning its own importation of asbestos to help protect its own people. Bangladesh is another country that suffers from the effects of asbestos because it still has a very dangerous ship-breaking industry, an activity which I think India is working towards banning. A lot of asbestos has been used in shipbuilding, and people in Bangladesh, particularly in Dhaka, are suffering greatly through the ship-breaking industry and exposure to asbestos. In the limited time. I have left, I certainly endorse the motion. Canada should stop this terrible export industry. Ms SAFFIN (Page) (11.41 am)-I rise to support the motion that the honourable member for Reid has brought before the House and I thank him for so doing. It is one of those issues that must unite us all. A lot of countries have banned asbestos, both mining and imports and exports, but there is still some way to go. The motion that the honourable member for Reid has put before the House talks about international efforts to list chrysotile asbestos under the Rotterdam Treaty. James Hardie had an asbestos mine in Baryulgil, which is in my seat of Page. I will talk a little bit about that and then I will talk about a town in Russia called Asbest that lives off the proceeds of asbestos mining. In the period from 1945 to the 1970s Australia was a big consumer of asbestos products. The mine in Baryulgil was operated by an almost entirely Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander workforce. James Hardie operated there without any regard at all for the workers. Many inquiries have been conducted, including the one in 1983-84 which concluded that James Hardie should have been aware of the dangers of asbestos long before Baryulgil opened and was under an obligation to protect the workforce. It also noted its own deliberations had been hindered by James Hardie’s refusal to provide medical records or to allow people to give evidence. I have friends who lived and worked at that mine in Baryulgil. One friend, who will not mind me mentioning her, Mrs Irene Harrington, used to wash her husband’s clothes sometimes 10 times a day, when he came out of the mine. The miners used to wear handkerchiefs and things around their faces. That was not very good protection from asbestos. It is one of those tragedies that we are still dealing with. The honourable member for Reid’s motion says: MAIN COMMITTEE … Bernie Banton Foundation estimates that by 2020, some 40,000 Australians will have contracted asbestos related cancer … I suggest that may be a conservative estimate. Other diseases and illnesses that are caused include asbestosis, asthma, chronic respiratory disease and bronchitis. I pay tribute to the journalist Matt Peacock for his related report which was first broadcast on the ABC program Broadband on 30 September 1977. Matt Peacock is still following this story today. He won a journalism award-as he should have done-for that particular report. Also, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission said: The history of the failure of responsible authorities to address this significant health risk to the Baryulgil community constitutes a … disregard for the human rights of the residents, including their right to equal protection of the law and equality and enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights, including public health. In the short time. I have left I will turn my attention to the town of Asbest, a town that is 1,750 kilometres from Moscow, which boasts a quarry and processing plant that produces one-quarter of the world’s chrysotile asbestos, which is commonly known as mineral flax. The quarry and processing plant employ 8,500 people. Asbest is a town of 71,000 residents, so you can see that it survives on what I call a ‘death industry’. How tragic that is for the poor people who have to live and work in that area. Asbest’s involvement in asbestos mining goes back to the 18th century. Marie Jego, from the Guardian Weekly, visited Asbest. She talked to a whole lot of workers and residents Sadly, some of them said the campaign against asbestos was a plot by Western countries to stop Russia from getting access to asbestos. But some local women said differently. (Time expired) motion. We in Australia have been well aware of the effects of asbestos on humans for a number of years. In large part, this has been brought to public knowledge through the work of the Bernie Banton Foundation. This foundation was founded by Bernie and Karen Banton to support and encourage sufferers of asbestos diseases and their carers and loved ones. The foundation estimates that by 2020 approximately 40,000 Australians will have contracted asbestos related cancer. In recent days a good friend of mine has been diagnosed. Foundations such as this, along with governments, the trade union movement and other individuals, have played a large role in raising awareness about the dangers of asbestos and in banning the sale and use of asbestos and asbestos related products in Australia. Asbestos is a naturally occurring mineral that was widely used between the 1940s and the late 1980s in Australia. It is valued for its durability, fire resistance and excellent insulating properties. Asbestos is extremely dangerous as its fibres are 50 to 200 times thinner than human hair and can float in the air for a long time. It is invisible to the naked eye and can be breathed into the lungs. In Australia, chrysotile asbestos was the most popular form of asbestos used in roofing materials, asbestos cement sheeting-also known as fibro-and pipes. Asbestos is a naturally occurring mineral that is a known carcinogenic. Chrysotile, amosite and crocidolite were all used in the asbestos cement industry for insulation and lagging. Although the use of these substances has been prohibited and there are removal programs in place, considerable amounts of the material remain in some work and residential environments. There have been some recent articles about asbestos materials in school buildings and MAIN COMMITTEE",213,Gards Began In 1991 As An Afternoon Cup Of Tea To Support The Increasing Number Of Widows
277,Mr Van Manen (Forde) (11.46 Am),"I thank the honourable member for Reid for hisroofs in Queensland. That situation is creating considerable issues for those particular communities. Asbestos can cause severe health problems if it is breathed in. Although most of the fibres are removed by the body’s natural defences, some fibres can remain in the lungs. Possible health effects of asbestos include: asbestosis; progressive and irreversible scarring of lung tissue, which impairs breathing; lung cancer; mesothelioma, which is a cancer of the lining around the lungs and abdomen; and benign pleural diseases, or non-cancerous diseases, that can affect the linings around the lungs and abdomen. Asbestos related illnesses can take up to 50 years to develop in some cases, and, although there are some treatments available, there are currently no known cures. In my electorate of Forde, I have become aware of some cases of asbestosis caused by the presence of asbestos in residential and industrial areas. As I said earlier, a good friend of mine was recently diagnosed with asbestosis. Since December 2003, the use of all forms of asbestos in Australia has been banned. Prohibitions have been placed on the manufacture, supply, storage, transport, sale, use and re-use, installation and replacement of asbestos-containing material. At the same time, the Commonwealth implemented a ban on the import and export of asbestos and asbestoscontaining materials. This ban does not apply to asbestos installed prior to December 2003. The battle over the categorisation of chrysotile asbestos as a hazardous chemical under the terms of the Rotterdam convention is ongoing, as countries such as Canada continue to export asbestos to India and other countries in South Asia. On two occasions, Ottawa blocked consensus at the Rotterdam convention to place chrysotile asbestos, a known toxin, on its list of dangerous products. The sale, mining and use of all forms of asbestos, including chrysotile asbestos, should be banned globally. by the honourable member for Reid. I thank the member for Reid for once again bringing this issue before the parliament. The battle for justice for victims of asbestos diseases is very important to me and I have been engaged in it for many years. Like many Australians, I have lost friends to the horrible disease mesothelioma, and I have family members who suffer from asbestos related diseases. This is in no small part because the suburbs in my electorate of Throsby have used products containing asbestos as basic building materials for many, many years. Asbestos garages and sheds were used as cricket stumps and tennis nets in the backyards of my childhood. It may be that I or some of my school friends will one day be beneficiaries of the great work of the people in this place and the campaign that I will talk about. In 2005 I had the great honour of going to work with the ACTU as part of the negotiating team on the James Hardie campaign, as it is well known. That team was led by the now member for Charlton, Mr Greg Combet, and the late Bernie Banton-a courageous man who is known to many in this place and whose battle has been taken on by his wife Karen. Campaigning for justice against James Hardie, a company that sought to abdicate both their responsibilities in relation to asbestos products and their social responsibilities, was a defining experience in my life. I take this opportunity to reply to some of the observations that were made earlier by the member for Bowman, who criticised some of the actions of unions in Canada in relation to the continued mining of asbestos in that country. In this country and around the world the union movement has not always got it right-at least not in the first instance-but I am absolutely certain that had it not been for the work of the trade union MAIN COMMITTEE",215,Gards Began In 1991 As An Afternoon Cup Of Tea To Support The Increasing Number Of Widows
278,Mr Stephen Jones (Throsby) (11.52 Am),"I rise today to support the motion movedmovement and the leadership shown by the ACTU and Unions New South Wales, working with the Asbestos Diseases Foundation of Australia and the New South Wales government, James Hardie would never have been brought to book. We set up a compensation fund, the Asbestos Diseases Research Foundation-which has now given birth to research work in the hospital at Concord in the electorate of the member for Reid-and reformed the claims process. Let us talk today about the important struggle that continues internationally. The terrible legacy of asbestos will live on in this country for many, many years to come as we deal with ways to eradicate it from our buildings, public and private. But we need to ensure that we do not visit that upon other nations in our region and around the world. As a nation that experienced rapid economic growth, especially during the boom years after the Second World War, we can understand the pressures that face developing nations, especially here in the AsiaPacific. The attraction of strong, cheap, durable and heat-resistant building materials cannot be denied. However, those products that contain asbestos carry a hideous cost, often a cost which is visited upon the people who can least afford it. So the actions of countries like Canada which continue to export asbestos and resist international efforts to list chrysotile asbestos under the Rotterdam Convention on prior informed consent is deplorable and should be strongly condemned in this place. As I said, they visit suffering and long-term health costs on the countries of our region and the people within those countries who are least able to deal with those health costs and the suffering that is likely to be visited on them over the long term. For these reasons I am proud to add my voice to this motion and urge all other members in this place to support it. Debate (on motion by Mr Neumann) adjourned. Organ Donation Debate resumed, on motion by Ms Brodtmann: That this House: (1) notes that: (a) organ donor rates are showing slow and sustained improvement in 2010; (b) more than 98 per cent of Australians agree that organ and tissue donation have the potential to save and improve lives, yet less than 60 per cent of Australians accept the invitation for their loved ones to become organ donors when asked; (c) there are more than 1,700 Australians on the transplant waiting list at any time; (d) many more Australians cannot get into waiting lists as they are too sick or unlikely to receive a life saving transplant because there are not enough donors; and (e) the Government has invested more than $150 million over four years to establish a coordinated approach to organ donation, enabling all jurisdictions to work cooperatively to support sustained improvements in organ donation in Australia; and (2) acknowledges: (a) the selfless act of the 228 donor families who have already donated organs in 2010 (to 30 September), which has saved or improved the lives of at least 683 Australians; (b) the work undertaken across jurisdictions led by the National Medical Director of the Australian Organ and Tissue Authority, State and Territory Medical Directors and clinical groups to develop nationally consistent protocols and clinical triggers; MAIN COMMITTEE (c) the support of community groups such as Gift of Life, Kidney Health Australia, Transplant Australia, the Organ Donation and Transplant Foundation of Western Australia and the David Hookes Foundation, which are integral in supporting the work of clinicians in improving organ donor rates; and (d) the importance of a steady and sustained improvement in organ donor rates to support Australia’s quest to become a world leader in organ and tissue donation and transplantation. Ms BRODTMANN (Canberra) (11.57 am)-Until recently, Australia’s organ donation rate languished near the bottom of the Western world’s league tables. Our annual rate stagnated at about 11 donors per million of population, or somewhere between 200 and 250 donors. By way of contrast, Spain has a donation rate of about 34 donors per million and is a world leader, the United States is at 21 donors per million, and the UK is at 15 donors per million. Our record in Australia was in spite of Australia being a world leader in transplantation surgery, with a record of stunning surgical outcomes and success. But, thanks to the reforms introduced by the Labor government in 2008, our performance in this area is starting to improve. This calendar year we have seen Australia’s first major improvement in organ donor rates in over 20 years, an improvement clearly linked to our reforms and our significant financial commitment to improving the lives of Australians. In 2008 the Labor government announced a reform package worth more than $150 million to improve staff and resources for hospitals across the country. Prior, there was significant variation in organ donation management between jurisdictions. As a result of the reforms introduced by Labor, the states and territories have come together to provide a nationally consistent program. There are more than 1,700 people on Australia’s waiting lists for transplants. Many more cannot get onto that list because they are either too sick or are unlikely to receive the transplant before death. The effect on them and their families is devastating and is the reason I rise on this issue today. Thanks to the Labor government, we have started on the long road to improvement. We now need to grow and sustain that improvement. As a volunteer with Gift of LifeI met many donor families, recipients and people awaiting a transplant who all want to improve Australia’s low organ donor rates. From my conversations with those people I also learned that you are more likely to need a transplant than to be an organ donor. Let me tell you about Marjorie Taylor, who is the mother of the ACT’s first organ donor. Her daughter, Annette, died more than 30 years ago, in the very early days of this process. Fortunately, she had discussed organ donation with her mum before she died. In those days, it was a struggle to be an organ donor because systems just were not in place. It was thanks to the tenacity that is unique to a mother that meant that Annette’s wishes were respected and the lives of other Australians were saved. Thankfully, the struggle that Marjorie faced is now a distant memory. Systems are now in place and the focus is on ensuring that the wishes of our families are fulfilled. The Labor government has introduced a range of reforms across every level of the health sector and also in the area of public awareness. It has established the Australian Organ and Tissue Authority to oversee the reform program. Its work is supported by a council of clinicians and community leaders. The DonateLife Network established by the authority in each jurisdiction is implementing the reform agenda. The national medical director, together with MAIN COMMITTEE the state and territory medical directors, is leading the change management required at every level of the health system for sustained improvements in organ donation. The reform program introduced through these multilevels of government and the health system is focused on two areas. The first is improving the capability and capacity of the health system to support an increase in organ and tissue donation-our greatest wish. Additional staff have now been appointed in intensive care units and emergency departments to ensure that all potential organ donors are identified. Most importantly, staff are also being trained to have the confidence to ask families for permission-which is very difficult to do-for their deceased loved ones to donate their organs. Just having gone through this process, with my mother-in-law recently dying, it is very difficult at that highly emotional time to seek permission, and these people are being trained to have the confidence to do that. In addition, new protocols have been developed to ensure that Australia is at the leading edge of organ retrieval. So, now, donation after cardiac death is a process across jurisdictions. The second key reform relates to one of my passions and my former profession, which is increasing community awareness. We know that around 80 per cent of Australians support organ donation. However, at the time of request, less than 60 per cent accept that invitation. By contrast, in Spain there is an acceptance rate of about 80 per cent. The recent ‘OK’ campaign aimed to alert Australians to the importance of organ donation. That campaign focused on discovering the facts about organ donation, deciding what to do and discussing the decision with loved ones. This last step is the most critical because organ and tissue donation only occurs with the agreement of the next of kin. Advertising was run through the electronic, social and print media and the results speak for themselves, although I believe that further campaigns will be needed to sustain improvements in the rate of organ donation. At the end of October this year, Australia had already exceeded the total number of organ donations achieved in 2009. This is a great outcome and suggests that we may reach 300 multi-organ donors by the end of the year. By ‘multi-organ donors’ I mean solid organs such as the heart, lungs, kidneys and liver. Tissue donation is just as important and includes corneas, heart valves and skin. One of the success stories in corneal transplantation is Felix Blumer, a resident of the ACT. Felix was about 14 when he started to go blind, which was overwhelming for both him and his family. He managed to receive a corneal graft and has now finished school and working hard for a living. The generosity of 258 organ donor families this year has resulted in 784 life-saving transplants, which equates to nearly 14 donors per million population. Record donations were achieved in May and October. In the ACT alone, we have already had nine multi-organ donors, equalling our best year. It is also heartening to see improvements in other jurisdictions that have traditionally not done so well in this area. We have seen improvements in New South Wales, Tasmania and the Northern Territory. These results mimic what has been happening in the UK and Spain where, once reform was introduced, organ donation rates went up, so we are following that trend. As someone who has worked in the volunteer area of this sector, I want to pay tribute to all the people who support organ donation. Many individuals and groups give their time and freely speak at community, academic and corporate events. They tell the story of what it is like to commit to organ donation, what it is like to be waiting for a transplant and what it is like to give organs to other families when someone dies. One of those groups includes Gift of Life, which until very recently was led by the formidable Anne Cahill Lambert, who is here MAIN COMMITTEE today and is herself awaiting a lung transplant. I also welcome David O’Leary, who is also in Gift of Life. Gift of Life has organised national and local events to raise awareness and to encourage people to discover, decide and discuss. Another group is Transplant Australia, which recently hosted the Transplant Games in Canberra. The games had recipients and their close supporters coming from all over Australia to celebrate the gradual improvements in the sector. I also want to acknowledge the Organ Donation and Transplant Foundation of Western Australia who are also working tirelessly to support organ donation. I would also like to acknowledge the work of Robyn Hookes and the David Hookes Foundation who have not only garnered support for organ donation and improved awareness about it but also garnered support from the cricketing community. We could not have made these improvements without the contribution of community partners. We also would not have been able to do it without the clinical leadership of the national medical director and the state and territory medical directors. The input of community leaders from the council through to the foot soldiers on the ground is valued and is playing a significant role in realising attitudinal change and raising awareness in the community. Last Friday marked the 10th anniversary of the Australian Organ Donor Register, auspiced by Medicare. Over 5.7 million Australians have recorded their intentions on the register. It is important that every Australian on the register confirms their intentions in discussions with their loved ones so that they can be respected at the time of death. We know there is more work to do for Australia to be a world leader in organ and tissue donation rates. The Labor government’s reforms have underpinned the improvements of recent years, but further work is needed to enable all jurisdictions to develop and demonstrate world’s best practice. We need all of the brightest brains working on this: clinicians, the community and governments. We have arguably seen the best improvements in those jurisdictions when the community is embedded as partners with clinicians. I want to tell you about a family in my electorate-Kit Crooke and Fiona West-whose three-year-old boy, Felix, is incredibly ill. He has not yet been listed for a liver transplant but he will need one soon. I would like to look that family in the eye very soon and tell them that he will get his transplant when he needs it. We do not want anyone, let alone a three-year old, lingering at death’s door with uncertainty while we hunt for a donor liver. I urge all members to consider what is happening in their own electorates on organ and tissue donation and to raise awareness. I personally record my appreciation to the clinicians and communities involved in supporting the steady improvement. I am proud of what we have achieved to date, but there is still more work to do. I would really like to be in the position where I can look Kit and Fiona in the eye and tell them that Felix is going to be okay. I encourage everyone to discuss this issue today. (Time expired) her motion and acknowledge the guests in the gallery. Canberra for drawing the parliament’s attention to organ donation. It is an issue very close to my own heart. Just three weeks ago I wrote a column for one of my local newspapers urging people to become donors, so I value the opportunity to raise the issue here today in this parliament. For anyone listening to or reading this debate, I would like them to take away two key messages: firstly, that Australia’s organ donation rate is not high enough and we need to MAIN COMMITTEE",216,Gards Began In 1991 As An Afternoon Cup Of Tea To Support The Increasing Number Of Widows

280,Mr Baldwin (Paterson) (12.07 Pm),"I would like to start by thanking the member fordo more; secondly, that it is absolutely vital you talk to your family and friends about becoming a donor. Organ and tissue donors save lives. One person’s organ can save up to 10 people, most of whom are extremely sick and have endured very long waiting lists. As the member for Canberra has already noted, there are approximately 1,700 Australians on waiting lists at any time. They range from children to the elderly. Sadly, despite the number of people waiting, we have one of the lowest organ donation rates in the developed world. Most families do not even know their loved ones’ wishes. In 2005 the former coalition government established the Organ Donor Register so that people could make their intentions known by registering their consent or objection. Doctors can now access that information 24 hours a day. What is vital to note is that registering your intention is not legally binding. That means that, when you die, your next of kin still has the final decision on whether or not your organs can be taken. Therefore it is imperative to discuss your decision with your family and friends. Even better, discuss it, register online and then remind your loved ones about it every couple of years. Donating organs is a chance to give the gift of life, and not just to one person. For example, last year alone 247 donors gave 799 Australians a new chance in life. Seven hundred and ninety-nine lives is an amazing figure, and I cannot possibly describe what an amazing gift those people and their families receive. However, we need to do better because we still have people dying on waiting lists. In the Hunter we are fortunate to have had donors at both John Hunter Hospital and Newcastle Mater Hospital. Figures from the Australian and New Zealand Organ Donation Registry show that at the John Hunter Hospital there have been 158 donors in the past two decades between 1989 and 2009. At the Mater there have been two in the same period. In 2006 alone, the John Hunter had eight multiple organ donors, the highest for any hospital in New South Wales. The success of John Hunter Hospital is due in part to its involvement in the national organ donation collaboration. Twenty-one other Australian hospitals also take part in order to increase donation rates by improving their systems and best practice, and providing families with information and support. I believe that providing accurate information to people is absolutely crucial and it is something that I want to focus on. Sadly, there are a number of misconceptions about organ donation which I have heard in my years as a local member. I do believe that these contribute to our modest donor rate. I would like to try to dispel some of those misconceptions. First is the idea that a doctor will not work to save your life if you are a donor. Doctors work every day to save lives. Doctors will do everything in their power to save your life. According to our government’s Donate Life website, doctors are extremely unlikely even to know whether you are on the donor registry before you have been declared legally dead. Second is the notion that the body will be disfigured from the collection of organs. According to the Donate Life website, surgeons only take what is needed, with the minimum number of incisions, and they will repair those incisions. Prostheses can also be used if bones are taken. Third is the misconception that only people who make bad lifestyle choices need new organs. Those on transplant waiting lists include those who have inherited a genetic condition, MAIN COMMITTEE many of whom are just children-those with cystic fibrosis or congenital heart defects or who have suffered from a severe infection. There are also approximately 9,000 Australians now on kidney dialysis. I vividly recall picking up the Newcastle Herald earlier this year and reading the story of one donor recipient from the Hunter region, Jesse Hirst. I would like to recount that article by Gabriel Wingate-Pearse here today because I think it shows what an amazing gift organ donation is. I quote: Jesse Hirst calls it his “best Christmas present ever”, a double lung transplant on Christmas Day that has given the Charlestown 16-year-old a new chance of life. Jesse, who needed new lungs in his battle against cystic fibrosis, said he hugged his father when he woke early on December 25 after three hours in surgery. “I told him it was the best day of my life,” Jesse said. The article goes on: Jesse’s father Simon Hirst said his family was very grateful for his son’s chance at a better life. “In the initial stages, when they first talked about putting Jesse on the organ donor list, we felt like we were actually waiting for someone else’s brother, or sister, or relative to pass away so that our son can live,” Mr Hirst said. “We were looking for a happy Christmas where someone else was going to have their worse Christmas. But then you think their family would get at least some relief from the fact that someone benefited.” Mr Hirst said he had always been a potential organ donor. “Some people really wrestle with that thought but … it’s the best thing you can do,” he said. Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease that affects various organs, but particularly the lungs, by clogging them with thick, sticky mucus. Jesse, who had his first operation when he was eight hours old, was told weeks ago that his last hope was a lung transplant. He was put on a ventilator and transferred from John Hunter Hospital to St Vincent’s by helicopter. Jesse said that as the days passed he began worrying that a transplant would never happen. “After a few days I got a bit scared, because you start thinking, ‘I am not leaving until lungs come and I could be here for months’,” he said. His spirits lifted when a nurse told him he had been through the same thing. “He actually had [cystic fibrosis] just like me and he’d had a transplant 11 years ago,” Jesse said. “That made me feel really good, like if he can get to 11 years, I could get 20.” But the teenager admitted he felt so ill in the lead-up to the surgery, “I really thought I was going to die”. Then, at 3pm on Christmas Eve, a surgeon took Jesse’s mother Jackie aside and told her a set of lungs was on its way. That story really touched my heart and it is just one of hundreds. Sadly, however, not all of these stories have a happy ending. That is what we need to fix. We need more happy endings. I call on the parliament to consider the importance of organ donation in its future decisions. I also call on everyone to sit down and talk to their families about organ and tissue donation. Last, but certainly not least, I would like to say a sincere and heartfelt thank you to the families and friends of every single organ donor. I am so sorry for your loss and I am also MAIN COMMITTEE grateful that you found it in yourself to give the ultimate gift to someone else. I hope that your gift of life sets an example that millions of Australians will follow. I often think about my younger brother Bill. He is a type 2 diabetic and his kidneys have gone. How different his life would have been if he had been able to receive a kidney transplant years ago. The kidney disease that comes about with diabetes has led to further complications where he has now had both of his legs amputated and his eyesight is going, but he still retains his sense of humour. There are people who just want to live and who would rely on a generous gift, a generous donation, to enable them to live. Instead of being hooked up to a dialysis machine for around five hours every second day, Bill could have had a quality of life which would have made a substantial difference in the ability to work and to be out there in the community doing what he enjoyed doing. SoI say to all Australians: please think about becoming an organ donor and let your loved ones know of your intentions. AgainI congratulate the member for Canberra for bringing this motion before the House today. ing this matter to our attention. Organ donation truly is giving the gift of life and yet it is a gift that most people do not know how to give. According to a comprehensive survey undertaken last year by the Australian Organ and Tissue Donation and Transplantation Authority, one-third of Australians do not know that family consent is needed for organs to be donated when somebody dies. That is why I want to take the opportunity to encourage everybodyparticularly those people in my electorate of Fowler-not only to sign up for the organ donor register but also to talk to their relatives and loved ones about what their wishes are. Thankfully, 93 per cent of people surveyed by the authority said that they would uphold the donation wishes of their loved ones. So long as people make it clear that they want to give the gift of life through organ donation, we should see a significant rise in our current donation rates. One family who had these discussions was that of Debbie Roberts and her daughter Rebecca. In 2002 Rebecca tragically died at the age of 20. Before her death, Rebecca-a forthright young woman-spoke up and made her intentions about organ donation clear to her mother. Thankfully her mother, Debbie, the CEO of Youth Solutions, respected her daughter’s wishes. As a result of Rebecca’s donations four people were given the gift of life-two received kidneys and another two received her corneas. Debbie has graciously shared with me correspondence that she has received from those four recipients of Rebecca’s organs. It is very touching correspondence. The letters show just how people’s lives have been so profoundly affected and enriched and how life has been given through Rebecca’s selfless decision to donate her organs should she die. We owe Rebecca and many like her an enormous debt of gratitude for their decisions to donate organs. Only two years ago I had the privilege to speak on the legislation which led to the establishment of the Australian Organ and Tissue Donation and Transplantation Authority. I am happy to note that since the authority came into operation in 2009 there has been a steady increase in the number of donations in Australia. In fact, in 2009-10 there were 279 donations, the highest annual donation rate in a decade. That figure is to be celebrated, but it is also important to note that we have a heck of a long way to go. As we speak here today there are more than 1,000 people on organ donation waiting lists. Those people are living with the knowledge that a donor may not be found for them in time. At the same time we have a lot of MAIN COMMITTEE",220,Gards Began In 1991 As An Afternoon Cup Of Tea To Support The Increasing Number Of Widows
281,Mr Hayes (Fowler) (12.17 Pm),"I too congratulate the member for Canberra for bringpeople who are suitable donors dying without having registered their intention to donate. They never had the discussions with their loved ones or families. On average, every deceased organ donor in Australia may contribute to between three and 10 transplants. Currently we have 11 in every one million people who have registered as organ donors. Simply imagine the number of people’s lives that could be saved if we had more people brave enough and with enough foresight to have that discussion with their loved ones as to their intention to provide the gift of life for their fellow man. I proudly carry with me a card which identifies me as a registered Australian organ donor. I encourage all Australians to do the same. It is a critical first step in being able to give somebody what can only be seen as the greatest gift that one human can give to another-that is, the gift of life. Ms GAMBARO (Brisbane) (12.22 pm)-It gives me great pleasure to speak to the motion of the member for Canberra, which draws attention of the House to the rates, successes, challenges and other issues regarding the number of organ donations in Australia. I am sure that members of this place, like me, have supported many worthwhile causes in their collective times as MPs. As a busy local member I see the tireless efforts of so many who work to improve the lives of Australians. My shadow portfolio responsibilities also bring me in contact with those who support countless millions of those in need overseas. There is perhaps no greater cause-indeed, no higher and more selfless act to improve the lives of fellow Australians-than to become an organ donor. We are an innovative country, with medical services and knowledge second to none. Australians are well educated. Our standard of living is high. We value the traditions of mateship, kindness, compassion and a fair go. So how can it be that in a country as great as ours we only had 247 organ donors in 2009, while over 5.7 million Australians are registered to donate? The member for Canberra earlier spoke about the organ donation rates in Spain and the great success in the United States. I have been a registered organ donor for several years as have been my family members. I have discussed my wishes with my family members and my husband, and we have come together with an agreed decision. This is perhaps the most important and critical factor for organ donation to go ahead, and it is where we must focus all of our efforts. As mentioned in the motion, more than 98 per cent of Australians agree that organ and tissue donation have the potential to save and improve lives, yet less than 60 per cent of Australians accept this invitation from their loved ones and become organ donors when asked. So despite the $150 million investment figure announced by Prime Minister Rudd in July 2008, we need to go some way. Despite the great efforts and work of the Gift of Life Australia, Kidney Health Australia, Transplant Australia, the Organ Donation and Transplant Foundation of Western Australia and the David Hookes Foundation in the lives of many Australians, and the work of many clinicians in improving organ donor rates, we still have some way to go. Those issues stem from communication problems with hospitals and very sensitive aspects that come up, particularly at that critical point. I was really pleased and honoured in 2007 to be asked to be an organ donor ambassador for AMA Queensland, and I did a considerable amount of work in improving the profile of organ donation in our community. A particular area that I want to focus on today touches the lives of many in my suburbs, and that is chronic kidney disease. One in nine Australians over 25 years of age has one clinical sign of existing chronic kidney disease, such as reduced kidney funcMAIN COMMITTEE tion, or evidence of kidney damage. A total of 10,341 people were receiving dialysis treatment at the end of 2009. Unfortunately, in 2008, only six per cent of people on dialysis received a transplant-an increase of five per cent on 2007 and six per cent on 2006. Sadly, the average waiting time for a transplant is about four years, and waits of up to seven years are not uncommon. These are remarkable figures, particularly when you look at the survival rate. Ninety-eight per cent of recipients are alive at one year and 88 per cent are alive at five years. They bear great testament to the remarkable achievement of our medical institutes and treating specialists across Brisbane and Australia. We have incredible success rates in Australia. Giving life after death is always going to be a very sensitive and emotional process for the donor’s family, their friends and medical professions. Education and coordination are keys to success, and it is very important that families get behind these incredible donation efforts. The other day as I was preparing to speak, I saw a quote that perfectly crystallised how modern Brisbane and indeed modern Australia should approach organ donation. Social commentator Maya Angelou said: I’ve learned that you shouldn’t go through life with catcher’s mitts on both hands. You need to be able to throw something back. Australians need to throw something back, with the knowledge that their precious gift will be so valued. ber’s motion on organ donation and would like to thank the member for Canberra for bringing this important issue to the attention of the House. I am sure that all of us in this House, of all political persuasions, have the same wish, and that is the wish for the life-sustaining and lifeenhancing gift through organ donation to increase to meet the ever present need that is required. Many, many thousands of lives could be renewed through the practice of organ donation and transplant, relieving the pain and suffering of those directly concerned and improving their place in the world, in the community and in our health and hospital system. About two years ago we spoke in this place on a government bill, the Australian Organ and Tissue Donation and Transplantation Authority Bill 2008. That was a little over two years ago, and we spoke of the 30,000 Australians who had benefited from organ transplants over that time. But we also spoke of the long standing shortage of donors and the number of organs for transplant stagnating at around 200 donors per annum, contributing approximately three times that number of organs to those who needed them most-200 people contributing some 600 to 700 transplants per year. The motion that we are debating here today mentions 228 donations having been made this year to date. This and the contributions of previous years are clearly a long way short of meeting the needs of the approximately 1,800 people who are awaiting an organ transplant at any one time. Australia has not historically contributed towards successful transplants at anything like the rate of people within other developed countries, but we are improving. Earlier, we heard the member for Brisbane talk about Spain and that 35 Spanish people per million are registered donors compared with 10 Australians per million. Australians are increasing our registrations but we can clearly do so much more. TodayI hope that this motion will encourage more Australians to put their names on the register as donors. MAIN COMMITTEE",223,Gards Began In 1991 As An Afternoon Cup Of Tea To Support The Increasing Number Of Widows
282,Mr Georganas (Hindmarsh) (12.27 Pm),"I too rise in support of the private memIt is interesting to note that the highest concentration of Australian organ donors in 2006, live and deceased combined, were in the age bracket of 15 to 24. There were 105 donors in this group, compared with 59 between the ages of 25 and 34; 50 between the ages of 35 and 44; 77 between the ages of 45 and 54; and 45 between the ages of 55 and 64. Beyond these ages, the number of donors decreased substantially. In that one year there were 202 deceased donors, yet 360 donors in total-a substantial number, as a proportion, of living donors. Over the 12 months from January 2006, Medicare Australia consent and intent registrations rose from 5.57 million to 5.66 million. That is an increase of some 90,000-odd people, or 1.6 per cent of potential donors. We can do much more, and much more is needed. It is the good and the right thing to do. To this end, we introduced and passed the Australian Organ and Tissue Donation and Transplantation Authority Bill 2008 back in 2008. Our world’s best practice reform package on organ and tissue donations for transplantation commenced last year, funded to the tune of $136.4 million over four years. Drawing from both international and Australian experience and tailored to fit with the Australian context, the reform package consists of the following: a coordinated, consistent approach spearheaded by the national organ donation authority and a network of nationally coordinated organ procurement organisations to facilitate the donation process; new funding for medical specialist positions and other clinical positions in public and private hospitals around Australia dedicated to organ and tissue donation; a new funding stream for Australia’s public and private hospitals to cover the additional staffing and infrastructure costs associated with it; an enhanced national education and training program for health professionals involved with organ donation; and an ongoing, nationally coordinated, community awareness and education program, which is ever so important to get the message out to get people registered. (Time expired) tion and placing our names as Australian citizens on the register. It is also right that we debate this twice in two sitting weeks. So if anyone thinks they have heard this before-dead right, they have, and it is worth speaking about on more than one occasion when it is as important as life and death decisions. I guess the great moral unease that many of us have is that 98 per cent of us would take an organ, just like that, but only 25 per cent of us are prepared to donate one. As I contemplate those figures, I look at how other economies promote organ donation and realise they are facing very similar challenges. So maybe I will use the short time available to me to look at what is happening in nations like New Zealand, Canada, the US and even Vietnam to raise organ donation rates. The figures are well known to all of us. Only 20 per cent of Australians can recall specifically having had a discussion about organ donation, 40 per cent can say they do not actually know the positions of their own relatives as to whether they would donate an organ or not and only about 60 per cent of Australians at the moment would-when at that crunch pointdecide to allow the organs of their relatives to be donated. I call it the 20-40-60 rule. We can do better, but we should never believe it is a simple matter to run a public awareness campaign and have those figures go up. It is much harder than it looks. SoI commend the work of the Organ Donation Register in Australia in putting out a very simple message: you can donate from the age of 18, and from the age of 16 you can indicate your interest to do so. It is not about medical research and it is not about looking at biomediMAIN COMMITTEE",225,Gards Began In 1991 As An Afternoon Cup Of Tea To Support The Increasing Number Of Widows
283,Mr Laming (Bowman) (12.32 Pm),"It is right to talk up the importance of organ donacal products and their development. This is about making a life-changing decision, because one person can change the lives of 10 or more people. At the moment, while 25 per cent of Australians are on the register in our nation, that is relatively low when we compare it to the levels in other countries. Whether or not you have ticked a box on your drivers licence, you have to make sure that you have made it really clear not just to one relative but to as many as you can, and to your close friends, that you wish to be a donor. And the Medicare card number is an important way of finding individuals as their information about donating and their consent to do so can follow them via a Medicare number, and that has significant advantages over not providing one. These are important messages to provide. If we look across the Tasman, New Zealand have particular challenges with a large Maori population and, to reconcile the traditional concepts of mind and body with the more Western notion of donating organs, they have responded in an innovative way with radio shows referred to as ‘Te Ahi Kaa’. They are doing that exceptionally well. Those TV shows went to air only two or three weeks ago. There are inspirational stories in this seven-show series that are basically raising the issues but also making the populace aware of the massive benefits that can accrue from this one, single but timely decision often made by relatives who have not had that specific conversation. The UK have the Heart to Heart campaign, which encourages people to have dinners with colleagues, friends, family or fellow students to talk about the idea of donating. The UK, like Australia, have a large and well-funded transplant week and their organ donation percentages are slightly higher than ours. The UK also have the My Life, My Gift campaign, in which radio, cinema, libraries as well as health outlets are used to promote the idea of donating. The UK have a very detailed portfolio of things that you can do to increase organ donation rates. Some of the innovative ideas would not at first have come to your mind, such as being a mystery shopper and walking into health establishments and asking: ‘Where are the donation consent forms? They should be here.’ Another idea is for people to go to an empty office or unlet piece of real estate-of course the UK has plenty more of that than we do-and say: ‘Why can’t we put up posters inside those glass windows to publicise organ donation?’ The UK have lots of innovative ideas. They even provide a logo that you can drop onto anything that is being printed and disseminated about organ donation. In Canada, the Organ Donation and Transplant Association are also doing great work by reaching out to around five million households and distributing nearly two million organ donor cards. They have a particular focus on teens. Their ‘Teens4 Transplants’ contest encourages young people to talk to their families about organ donation. This is another great idea that we could take on. The USA have OrganDonor.gov-obviously doing work on an even grander scale. Even a nation such as Vietnam, a single party state, finds a way of involving its 7.6 million members of the Communist Youth Union to be pure of heart and mind and to step forward on Blood Sunday and give blood. They do that in large numbers. As a developing economy, they are finding ways to do that very successfully. Countries around the world are applying different solutions to the same problem. Australia can learn from some of these great ideas, and I commend the work of everyone working in organ donation. Ms PARKE (Fremantle) (12.37 pm)-I commend the member for Canberra for her motion on organ donation, and I support it wholeheartedly. I have spoken about this issue several times in this place. Indeed, it was the subject of my very first notice of motion, in February MAIN COMMITTEE 2008 and, like a number of my colleagues, I continue to regard it as a matter of great importance. The health problems that require organ transplant are often life threatening, and the gap that exists between the availability of organ and tissue material and those whose health problems can only be solved by transplant of such material is far too high. No great leap of discovery or innovation in medical science is required to make real progress in this area-we simply need to increase the number of people who are prepared to donate organs upon their death and we need to improve the clinical infrastructure and administrative coordination that will support a lift in transplant rates. The health benefits that follow a successful transplant are obvious; and the social and health benefits are similarly profound. Australia is a country that is rightly proud of its leading record in a number of areas, but that is not to say that there are not areas in which Australia underperforms and, unfortunately, we must acknowledge that organ donation is one of those areas. Of course, as the member for Canberra rightly notes, this Labor government has already made significant strides in this area. In the first year of government, we established the national Organ and Tissue Donation and Transplantation Authority with the mandate and resources needed to begin delivering on the recommendations contained in the February 2008 report by the National Clinical Taskforce on Organ and Tissue Donation. The relevant bill, passed in 2008, provided new funding of $136 million over four years as part of a total package costing $151 million. As with a number of Labor government initiatives, the purpose here was to create a nationally consistent approach so that better health outcomes for individuals could be provided through more efficiently coordinated clinical service frameworks. The Australian Organ and Tissue Donation Authority has made good progress in that time, and I would like to mention two aspects of their work. The first is the national protocol for donation after cardiac death, which was adopted in July 2010 and provides the first clear and consistent protocol for this aspect of clinical practice. As members would be aware, donation after brain death is at the more straightforward end of the clinical spectrum, as a person whose brain function has ceased can nevertheless continue to have circulatory and respiratory function, which means that the transplant of their tissue or organs can occur in a relatively calm and considered manner. Donation upon cardiac death presents a very different clinical challenge, and with that goes challenges in terms of patient and family communication, and in dealing with certain ethical concerns. This new national protocol represents a clear advance as a document that consolidates the work and analysis already done in this area, and sets out a step-by-step procedural framework for donation upon cardiac death. I congratulate Dr Gerry O’Callaghan, the chair of the Donation after Cardiac Death Working Party and the national medical director of the authority itself. The second initiative of the authority that I would like to mention is one that I have a special regard for as it was pioneered by Dr Paolo Ferrari in his work at Fremantle Hospital. As part of its early work, the organ authority has now established a nationwide live kidney donor program, the Australian paired Kidney eXchange or AKX, which cross-matches compatible donors across family pairs so that a willing but incompatible family donor of one person needing a transplant can be matched with a similarly willing but incompatible donor-recipient pair to facilitate two compatible live kidney transplants. This innovation is the perfect examMAIN COMMITTEE ple of how creative thinking and coordination can help solve a serious health problem. Approximately 30 per cent of potential donors cannot fulfil their wish to donate because they are incompatible with the family member they would like to assist. The AKX program will hopefully help to cross-match a large proportion of those people, thereby allowing them to assist their relative by a matched exchange of kidneys. Finally, I would like to again emphasise how important it is that donation rates are lifted through programs which encourage and facilitate the registration of Australians as organ donors. On that point I welcome the move by the Western Australian government to commission a report on the creation of an opt-out-or possibly a single opt-in-approach to organ donation, rather than the double opt-in system that currently applies. It would surprise some people to know that currently a person who has chosen to be a donor can only have their organs or tissues donated if their family consents after their death. Full and informed consent is important but a double opt-in approach is, in my opinion, setting the bar too high and it is an approach that does not respect the individual’s decision, which is intended to be an act of generosity reflecting true altruism. This is an important motion and a critical health issue in Australia. Once again, I congratulate the member for Canberra and all the speakers to this motion. berra and further to the member for Fremantle for giving a Western Australian perspective on this. I would also like to thank the member for Canberra for bringing this matter to the attention of the House. It was good of the member for Fremantle to mention the state government’s plan to do an inquiry and also the draft but she failed to mention that it is actually the Liberal state government, so I thought I would let that be known. She gave accolades to the Labor Party federally, so I thought I would give the state Liberal government a plug as well. Members may recall the last time. I spoke about organ donation in this place I was in the process of organising a community walk for organ donation awareness around the picturesque Tomato Lake in my electorate of Swan. I organised the event to tie in with Organ Donation Awareness Week. I am pleased to report the event was a success with a good number of people turning up on the day for the walk. The number of people attending reflected the fact that organ donation had been at the forefront of news in Western Australia during the preceding weeks. A Perth woman and drug addict Claire Murray had sparked debate in the community over her bid for a second liver transplant. This was controversial because Claire had continued to use drugs after receiving her first liver transplant. Her serious condition meant that she needed an urgent transplant to survive. The community was divided, with some arguing that Claire did not deserve another chance, given the shortage of organs in Australia, with others contending that it would be wrong to condemn a young girl to death. On the day of the walk around the lake, some of the organ recipients who attended had mixed views on how this young lady’s position should be treated but most of them saw the organs they had received as a gift and as something to be treasured and valued from the people they had received them from. Claire’s distressed father was courageous enough to speak to the public on talkback radio about his family’s experience. The Western Australian state government responded to Claire’s situation by offering a $258,000 interest-free loan for Claire and the family to travel to SingaMAIN COMMITTEE",226,Gards Began In 1991 As An Afternoon Cup Of Tea To Support The Increasing Number Of Widows
284,Mr Irons (Swan) (12.42 Pm),"I rise to support the motion from the member for Canpore for a live liver transplant. The family took up this offer, but Claire Murray, sadly, did not survive the surgery. While this sad tale highlighted some tough ethical questions about organ donation, I think it is fair to say that the issue would have not been so contentious had there not been such a shortage of organ donors in Western Australia. On4 January 2010, there were still 1,770 people on the national organ donation list, many of them in a life threatening condition. In 2008, only one-third of the demand for solid organ transplants was able to be met. Western Australia has the lowest rate of donation in the country, so organ donors are desperately needed. That is why so many people took note when last month the Liberal state government of Western Australia commissioned the WA health department to start drawing up proposals for the introduction of an opt-out organ donation system. Opt-out systems automatically assume adult donor consent unless there is advice to the contrary. The alternative is an opt-in system, a version of which all Australians are currently subject to. As members would be aware, opt-out systems have been used in many countries across the world to solve the problem of low rates of organ donors. In fact, 24 European Union countries use some form of opt-out system. Western Australia’s Minister for Health, Dr Kim Hames, said that legislation would be drafted once a model had been agreed upon, and I, like many others, will be interested to have a look at it when it comes up. Until the legislation is passed, I advise people who wish to be organ donors to register through the Medicare system or through the online organ donor register. I also encourage potential donors to discuss their wishes with their family. Almost half of organ donations do not proceed because the donors do not have this important conversation-but I, for one, have had this conversation with my son. Once again I congratulate the member for Canberra for bringing this matter to the attention of the House. As the Deputy Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing, I always take a keen interest in issues such as this, and I am open to working with the member for Canberra on this issue in the future. As I have a little bit of time left, I will mention Simone McMahon, who herself is waiting for a transplant and is the Executive Director of the Organ Donation and Transplant Foundation of WA. Simone held an event recently to name stars after organ donors in Western Australia, and that was a great way to highlight the efforts and commitments of people who have made organ donations. Again, I congratulate the member for Canberra for bringing this issue to the attention of the House. Ms BURKE (Chisholm) (12.47 pm)-I again thank both the member for Canberra for bringing this motion before the House and all the speakers on the motion. We need to put the matter into context. The reality is that less than one per cent of deaths occurs in such a way that the donation of the deceased’s organs is possible, and currently across Australia an average of only 50 per cent of families consent to the donation of the organs of deceased loved ones. That is why this debate is so important-less than one per cent of deaths permit the donation of organs and only 50 per cent of organ donations from those who have consented to be organ donators proceed. We need to have discussions with our families. Many of the statistics have already been cited, but I am going to restate them so that my speech is complete: One organ and tissue donation can save the lives of up to 10 people and significantly improve the lives of dozens more. Australia has a world class reputation for successful transplant outcomes. MAIN COMMITTEE Australia also has one of the lowest donation rates in the developed world. 98 % of Australians agree that organ and tissue donation has the potential to save and improve lives. 40% of Australians do not know the donation wishes of their loved ones. Less than 1 in 5 Australians (only 17%) have had a memorable discussion with their loved ones about their donation wishes. The most important thing that helps a family’s decision is their knowing the wishes of their loved one. Australia’s family consent rate is low with just 58% of families giving consent for organ and tissue donation to proceed. Around 1700 people are on Australian organ transplant waiting lists at any one time. On average, people on the transplant list must wait between 6 months and 4 years. Many of those people, of course, die while on the list. Some further statistics are: In 2009, less than half of the demand for organs was able to be met. In 2009, 247 organ donors gave 799 Australians a new chance in life. So the actual donation rate is good-247 donors resulted in 799 Australians having a new chance in life. In 2009, the Australian population had 11.3 donors per million people. In 2008 the Australian population had 12 donors per million; Spain had 34, the US 24, Estonia 23, Italy 21 and the United Kingdom 15. As many speakers have said, Australia needs to lift its rate. Australia has one of the highest retrieval rates per donor (3.4 organs per donor in 2008). The reality is that when a person dies it is not just one organ that can be harvested and then utilised. Australia’s rate of cornea donation puts it in the top five countries for corneal donation rates. In 2008, 1096 people donated their corneas. As a result, 1696 people had their sight restored. Each year, 3000-4000 skin, heart and musculoskeletal tissues are transplanted. So it is not just major organs that can make a huge and defining difference to an individual’s life. Being married to a MICA paramedic, I know it is often a fairly sobering thought at the end of the day’s work, having kept a person alive to get them to hospital so that organs can be harvested, that somebody will say no. It is a fairly confronting issue. My husband took a friend of ours out with him in the ambulance one night. I do not think he has ever been the same again. They worked tirelessly on a 33-year-old who was brain dead so that her organs could be donated. My husband will never find out if they were, as that is not appropriate, but it is a sobering thought that they might have worked all night to get somebody to hospital so that their organs could be used and then somebody turned around and said no. Last year I went through a harrowing time with my father at the Alfred Hospital in intensive care for 10 weeks, 10 weeks that probably he should not have spent in intensive care. I had to have with doctors numerous conversations that I did not wish to have. One was when I had to fly home on a Wednesday night to discuss whether we would turn off his breathing apparatus. At the end of the harrowing experience my father did die, not that his organs would have been of use to anyone-I must put that on the record-but he had donated his body to Melbourne university to be used for students. This caused untold grief in my house because MAIN COMMITTEE we were not going to have a body at the funeral. My argument was it was my father’s wish; he had conveyed it to me in no uncertain terms and we were going to do it. It saved us a small fortune too into the bargain, I can say. It was a very funny conversation with the undertaker because it was finally revealed that, yes, he had signed it over, but we respected his wishes. The easy thing in that family conversation was that I knew what my father’s wishes were and so I could say to my numerous brothers and sisters and to my uncles and aunts and my mother, ‘That is what he wanted to do.’ Have that discussion now before it is too late. Ms O’DWYER (Higgins) (12.52 pm)-I rise in support of increased awareness of organ donation, specifically to support an improvement in the organ donation numbers in Australia, and I congratulate the member for Canberra for bringing this to the House’s attention. I am very fortunate that I have not been in the personal situation where I have been impacted by the critical nature of organ donation. But my husband and I are two of the 5,622,362 people in Australia who are part of the Australian donor register. The reason we have both made the decision to be part of that register is we understand the significant impact that an organ donor can have on the lives of others. To repeat some of the statistics already given, one organ donor can save the lives of, or dramatically improve the lives of, up to 10 people. We know that as at 30 November 2009 there were about 1,770 people waiting on a list for organ transplants, transplants for things like a kidney, a heart, a liver, a lung, a pancreas or an intestine. We know that we can have a significant impact, through these incredible transplants, on the lives of those people who are currently suffering from chronic illness because Australia has been at the forefront of technological advancement regarding organ and tissue donation. In fact, in the early 1940s Australia was the nation that began corneal transplants, in Sydney and in Melbourne. In 1965 Australia had the first successful living kidney transplant, and in the mid-1980s right through until the late 1980s we had some breakthroughs with the first successful heart transplant, Australia’s first successful kidney transplant from a deceased donor along with some great innovations in the early 2000s with the first single segment liver transplant on a baby. We can very rightly be proud of the medical advancement in this particular area. But what concerns me today is the fact that we do not have the requisite number of people on the organ donor list for the number of people who are waiting for transplants. When you consider these statistics in Australia compared to those in the rest of the world, it is quite telling. The number of people who donate in Australia per million is in stark contrast to the rest of the world. That figure is tripled in Spain, per million people, more than doubled in the USA and doubled in France. Clearly, there is more work to be done here. The reason there is more work to be done is that it is a very difficult issue. Organ donation is a very emotional issue and the most critical aspect in all of this is to understand the wishes of loved ones when it comes to the point where a decision can be made. The coalition has got an incredibly proud record trying to bridge the gap between the number of people who require transplants and the number of people who are able to offer their organs on the register. In 2006 we spent $28 billion trying to boost organ donation and trying to close that gap. As I have said, there is still much more work to be done. While 96 per cent of Australians are supportive of organ donations, only 54 per cent of people who suffer brain death become donors because in 46 per cent of cases the family refuses consent. This is why it is so critically important that people tell their family members of their wish to become a doMAIN COMMITTEE nor. According to the International Registry of Organ Donation and Transplantation, Australia is currently ranked 17th in the world, but we do need to consider how we can become even more innovative in trying to get people to register their wishes early on. Certainly, we have done that work when it comes to people applying for their licences. I think we can perhaps also come to consider whether there might be other critical points in people’s lives where they might also consider making their wishes known. I would like to again congratulate the member for Canberra for bringing this to the attention of the House. It is an issue that has support among the coalition, the Labor Party and the Greens. I commend this motion to the House. expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Iran: Human Rights Debate resumed, on motion by Mr Neumann: That this House: (1) notes with deep concern the ongoing human rights violations in Iran, including the: (a) use of the death penalty, especially the use of stoning as a method of execution; (b) violations of the rights of women; (c) repeated violations of due process of law; (d) use of violence, intimidation and arbitrary arrest to suppress peaceful opposition activity and the impact this has on the ability of Iranians to exercise their freedom of expression, association and assembly; (e) reported arbitrary arrest and detention, and torture of opposition protestors; (f) discrimination against and failure to protect the rights of minorities, including the Baha’i, Sufi, Baluch, and Kurdish communities; and (g) trial and reported sentencing of seven Baha’i leaders-Fariba Kamalabadi, Jamaloddin Khanjani, Afif Naeimi, Saeid Rezaie, Mahvash Sabet, Behrouz Tavakkoli, and Vahid Tizfahm-for insulting religious sanctities and propaganda against the Islamic Republic; and (2) calls upon the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to: (a) ensure that the rights of all individuals are fully protected, without discrimination, and that it fulfils its obligations to its own citizens as set out in the Iranian constitution; (b) abide by its international human rights obligations, including the rights to freedom of religion or belief as set out in Article 18 of the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights; and (c) ensure that all trials, including the case of the seven Baha’i leaders, are fair and transparent and conducted in accordance with Iran’s international obligations. concern that the Baha’i community in Ipswich and the Somerset region in the federal electorate of Blair have concerning the ongoing human rights violations in Iran, particularly the use of the death penalty and the use of stoning as a method of execution; the violations of the rights of women; repeated violations of due process of law; the use of violence, intimidation and arbitrary arrest to suppress peaceful opposition activity and the impact this has on the ability of Iranian people to exercise their freedom of expression, association and assembly, civil liberties which we in Australia take for granted; the reported arbitrary arrest, detention MAIN COMMITTEE",229,Gards Began In 1991 As An Afternoon Cup Of Tea To Support The Increasing Number Of Widows

286,Mr Neumann (Blair) (12.58 Pm),"I move this motion concerning the deep and ongoingand torture of opposition protestors; discrimination that has been reported, and which is allegedly rife, against minorities, including the Baha’i, Sufi, Baluch, and Kurdish communities in the country; and the trial of what are known as the Baha’i seven. This motion calls upon the Islamic Republic of Iran to ensure that the rights of all individuals are fully protected, without discrimination, and that it fulfils its obligations to its own citizens as set out in the Iranian Constitution, and to abide by its international human rights obligations, including the rights to freedom of religion or belief as set out in article 18 of the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights, and also the rights of people to believe what they want and to exercise those beliefs and practice them peacefully in accordance with human rights and dignity. This motion deals with ensuring that all trials, including the case of the seven Baha’i leaders, are fair and transparent and conducted in accordance with Iran’s international obligations. This is a position that the Australian parliament has taken previously. On 15 February 2010 the United Nations Human Rights Council held a universal periodic review on Iran, with governments and human rights groups from around the world describing in detail the degree to which Iran has failed to live up to its international obligations with respect to civil and political rights but also with respect to those rights concerning people’s beliefs and religion. The Australian government, in its recommendations to the UN, made it very clear that Australia wanted to ensure that the trial of the seven Baha’i leaders is fair and transparent. On 25 May 2009 the Australian parliament called on Iran to release without delay the seven Baha’i leaders imprisoned in Tehran. The Baha’i faith is a peaceful faith that was founded over 150 years ago. It says the purpose of life is to know and love God. It is one of the fastest-growing religions in the world with more than five million followers in over 100,000 localities across the world. The unity of all people is a powerful force in the Baha’i faith. It believes in an integrated and peaceful world community. It emphasises the respect and diversity of people and the idea that, by meditation and prayer, a person can get close to God and get close to knowing himself or herself. It believes in one human race which has custodianship of the planet that God has given to us. I am a Christian by religious persuasion, tradition and faith but I respect the faith and practices of the Baha’i community in my electorate and elsewhere. President Obama recently visited our northern neighbour Indonesia. In a very moving speech at the University of Indonesia he spoke of his childhood memories of growing up in Indonesia, of feeling welcome there and of the religious and cultural tolerance and understanding that he experienced there. He spoke of his recent visit to a mosque which he remembered being built when he was child-a mosque which symbolised independence and was designed by a Christian architect for the Muslim community of Indonesia. A couple of years ago when I had the privilege of being on a parliamentary delegation to JakartaI discovered that on Christmas Day the mosque allowed parishioners of the Catholic Church to park their cars in the car park of the mosque. President Obama made the point that Indonesia was a very productive and cooperative country with respect to religion and beliefs and the widespread practices of many people. ‘Unity in diversity’ is, of course, the Indonesian motto. Sadly, that practice of our northern neighbour Indonesia, the largest Muslim country in the world, is not adhered to in Iran. I speak of the plight of the followers of the Baha’i faith living in Iran, who are really suffering from persecution, and the seven Baha’i leaders: Fariba KaMAIN COMMITTEE malabadi, a married developmental psychologist and mother of three; Jamaloddin Khanjani, a married businessman with four children and six grandchildren; Afif Naemimi, a married businessman with two grown sons; Saeid Rezaie, a married agriculture engineer with three children, two of whom were arrested while working on a project to help the underprivileged; Mahvash Sabet, a married teacher and school principal with two grown children; Behrouz Tavakkoli, a married social worker and businessman with two children; and Vahid Tizfahm, a married optometrist with one child. On8 August 2010 the Baha’i community in Australia received reports that these Baha’i leaders in Iran had received sentences of 20 years. On 15 September this year the lawyers of the seven Baha’i leaders were verbally informed that their sentences had been reduced to 10 years. This follows decades of intense harassment by the Iranian regime-careers destroyed, businesses confiscated and lives made more difficult on many levels. These people had attempted to exercise productive lives and carry out their beliefs peacefully. They were arrested in 2008 and held in detention in the notorious Evin prison. They were subjected to intense interrogation. One was held in solitary confinement for five months and another for months. They were denied access to legal representation for over a year and then were given only one hour to consult. The charges are draconian, egregious and outrageous. There were allegations that they had engaged in espionage for the benefit of foreigners, spread anti-government propaganda, collaborated with Israel and spread corruption on earth. There were a whole host of ridiculous charges against these people. The Iranian regime has continually obstructed access to legal representation for the Baha’i Seven and moved them to locations away from support and families. Their lawyers have themselves experienced harassment to the point where one of them has been forced to remain outside of Iran for an extended period. I congratulate the Gillard Labor government for expressing its concern for this grave injustice. I add my strongest condemnation of the Iranian regime for the detention and sentencing of the Baha’i Seven in this really draconian and repressive way. I congratulate the local Baha’i community in Ipswich, particularly Jessica Jackson, who has met me on several occasions to advocate for the Baha’i Seven, and Rahmat Mehdizadeh, who has also met me regarding this matter on numerous occasions. I congratulate them on their strong advocacy on behalf of the very small community of about 60 members in Ipswich. We all live in a free country here in Australia. We speak about democratic institutions, civil liberties and human rights, but there are 50 Baha’i in prison in various locations in Iran. All are in jail for their religion. Some have been held for more than 13 months in so-called temporary detention. Around 250 Baha’i still have open cases at various stages of the Iranian judicial process. Additionally, there is discrimination against other minority groups, such as the Kurdish community and the Sufi community inside Iran. This continues and there are too numerous cases to outline. We have called upon the Republic of Iran to ensure that the rights of all individuals are fully protected without discrimination; fulfil its obligations to its citizens under the constitution-which makes reference to civil liberties and freedom of religion; abide by its international obligations, including the rights of freedom of religion or belief as set out in article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; and ensure that all trials, including the trials of the Baha’i Seven, are fair and transparent. President Obama recently said: MAIN COMMITTEE We can choose to be defined by our differences, and give in to a future of suspicion and mistrust. Or we can choose to do the hard work of forging common ground, and commit ourselves to the steady pursuit of progress. I commend the motion to the House. lend both my personal and our collective support to this motion by the member for Blair in relation to human rights abuses and the condemnation of human rights abuses in Iran. It is a strength of the Australian parliament that there is generally a unanimous view in relation to the protection of human rights around the world. We must not be immune from selfexamination-I believe that is absolutely the case-but, as we look around the world, nor should we be afraid of drawing to light breaches of the UN charter, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Those are three foundation documents which define rights and which, to my mind, represent a common human conception rather than a paradigm imposed by one country at one stage of development, as has been argued from time to time. Let me start from the principle of belief in the notion of universal human rights. There may be marginal differences, but the fundamental elements of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are common, consistent and abiding. They are, first and foremost: the right to life, the right to freedom, the right to association, the right to freedom of belief, the right to freedom of worship and, perhaps above all else, the right to elect a government which will be democratically elected and democratically put in place as the paramount guarantor of all other rights. Where there is no such government, then it is incumbent upon the members of the international community to do all that they can to protect, highlight and seek justice in cases where there is no internal democratic mechanism or where the elements of that democratic structure are broken. I wanted to set down that structure and theory, because I believe it is critical as to our justification for pointing out human rights abuses in other countries. There is in my view a sense of common humanity and a truth to the notion that there are universal human rights. It is inconceivable to me that simply because somebody comes from another country or culture they have waived their right to freedom of religion, to freedom of expression, to freedom of association and, above all else, to protection of their lives against arbitrary loss. These are fundamental issues. I want to put this secondly into the context of my own experience. Along the way my teaching and part of my work was in the international human rights sphere, and there are two experiences which stand out for me above all else. I lead all of this as a path to discussing the issue of human rights in Iran and the specific motion. I worked for the Centre for Human Rights in Geneva, in particular I was an intern with the UN special representative for human rights abuses in the former Yugoslavia in 1993. That role as an intern lead me to compile reports of atrocities coming out of the former Yugoslavia. This was at a time when there was some light being shed on the issue, but much was still hidden. We did not know of the full horrors of Srebrenica. We did not know of all of the atrocities that were occurring in Bosnia. Part of my job was to seek and compile information while based in Geneva, which was coming from different field agencies be they from arms of the United Nations, the work of the media which was incredibly important in the former MAIN COMMITTEE",233,Gards Began In 1991 As An Afternoon Cup Of Tea To Support The Increasing Number Of Widows
287,Mr Hunt (Flinders) (1.08 Pm),"On behalf of the opposition, it gives me great pleasure toYugoslavia or from different rights groups and non-government organisations. The stories were compelling, and I remember to this day the stories of families being locked away in houses and the houses being incinerated from the outside. Similarly, I spent time travelling with Medecins Sans Frontieres in Rwanda in the period not long after the atrocities there and branching out from Kigali and visiting Goma across the border into Zaire. As many people did, I also discovered stories which were compelling and profound and they carry with me the beliefs which are fundamental and which help form the policy that Australia took under the leadership of Alexander Downer to support the creation of an international war crimes tribunal. I believe it was fundamental. This brings me to the challenge in Iran today, which must be seen in those consequences. Iran has made some progress in some areas, but let it be absolutely clear: Iran is not a democracy. The recent elections were largely fraudulent. They were not carried out in a free and fair manner, and they were not acceptable either to the international community or, more importantly, to the people of Iran who demonstrated on the streets their concern, their commitment and their grievance. Beyond that, there are powerful individual cases which flow naturally from the fact that the bulwarks of individual protection are not in place. Firstly, I want to raise the case of Sakineh Ashtiani, who, on the latest advice I have from Amnesty International, is 43 and a mother of two from the north-west of Iran. She spent a number of years in prison always with the expectation that her life was to be cut short on the basis of a case which is clearly of very dubious origin-firstly, a charge of murder, which was subsequently reduced and which remains highly contentious. There is also an extremely highly contended case of alleged adultery. This case is problematic on at least three grounds. Firstly, although states choose capital punishment, I will remain resolutely opposed throughout my working life and I have no doubt until my dying day to capital punishment wherever and under whatever circumstances, no matter how heinous the crime. I may have no sympathy for the individual but I cannot countenance or support that punishment. Secondly, we have here the notion of a fair trial, and the judicial reasoning for the conviction was not on the basis of evidence adduced but on the basis that the judge believed that there was ‘knowledge of the judge adduced from assessing the character and the demeanour of the individual’, not on the basis of any known evidence before the court. It is in effect a blanket judicial discretion to introduce arbitrary capital punishment. So in my view not only is there a flaw with capital punishment, and that remains the case whether it is in the United States, Indonesia, China or wherever else it may be, but in this case there is no protection against arbitrary decisions of a system which clearly has the most limited of judicial protections that one would wish to see. Thirdly, the form of punishment here includes the potential for stoning. Of all of the different forms of capital punishment, stoning must surely be in the modern age the most unacceptable, the most egregious, because of the pain, because of the agony, because of the inhumanity and because it incites the lowest and most base of human emotions within the community. I believe that this case is unjust of and in itself but it is an exemplar of a system which allows women to be treated as chattels, of a system which has destroyed the rule of law in many cases, of a system which introduces an arbitrary notion and of a system which, above all else, flows from the lack of democratic structure. It is not to be justified on the basis of a religious notion. Every country, every society has the capacity for religious differences and cultural MAIN COMMITTEE differences but no society can use those differences to take away the basics of individual liberty, of an individual right to a fair trial, of an individual right to be protected against arbitrary imprisonment and, above all else, the effective extrajudicial killing which will result from the manifest injustice in this case. Sakineh Ashtiani’s case is an exemplar of a system which is broken, a system which must be changed, and along with other countries we will continue to work to see a genuine universal system of human rights. Ms OWENS (Parramatta) (1.18 pm)-I rise to support the motion advanced by the member for Blair. The persecution of ethnic and religious minorities in Iran has been the subject of international attention and condemnation for several decades. Unfortunately over those decades little progress has been made, and many members of this House have noted, I believe correctly, that the human rights situation in Iran seems to be worsening. I have a quite strong and reasonably large Iranian community in my electorate of Parramatta. I have every community in Parramatta, including the Iranian one, and I have come to know my Iranian community as some of the most gentle, well-educated and I use the word civilised people you can imagine. In fact, even when I am doorknocking, before a person tells me their background is Iran there is something about these people, the way they have been educated, the way they have been raised, that just sets them as Iranian. It is quite remarkable. I say to them quite often that it is beyond belief that a country that can produce the people that I know as Iranians can also produce the kind of regime which has brutalised them for so long. I know that they share that view and they wish some day to be able to return to the Iran that they remember. I absolutely share that wish with them. Among my IraniansI have a very strong Baha’i community, who well and truly keep me informed about what is happening in Iran and have asked me specifically to speak on this issue on their behalf. They have visited me in the last month to raise their concerns for the seven Baha’i leaders: Mrs Fariba Karmalabadi, Mr Jamaloddin Khanjani, Mr Afif Naeimi, Mr Saeid Rezaie, Mrs Mahvash Sabet, Mr Behrouz Tavakkoli and Mr Vahid Tizfahm, all of whom are detained in Tehran. They have spent more than two years in temporary detention. The seven former leaders of the community were known as ‘friends of Iran’ and were sentenced to 20 years imprisonment on 9 August. The Baha’i faith was founded more than 150 years ago in Iran, so it has been around for 1½ centuries there. The Islamic Republic of Iran was established in 1979, so it is relatively new. Members of the Baha’i community had been living peacefully in Iran prior to the formation of the Islamic Republic, but since then the Baha’i community have been harassed and persecuted. Many Baha’i are now living in other parts of the world, including in Australia. I have been very fortunate to know them. The strongest Baha’i community groups of Parramatta, Holroyd and Blacktown, in and around my electorate, have been calling for the fair and humane treatment of the Baha’i in Iran since their arrival in Australia. Six of the seven Baha’i leaders have been in custody since May 2008, when they were arrested in a raid of police forces on their homes. The seventh one, Mrs Mahvash Sabet, was arrested in March 2008 in Mashhad. It should be mentioned that the Raja’i prison in Mashhad has frequently been criticised by human rights advocates for its unsanitary environment, lack of medical services, crowded prison cells and unfair treatment of inmates by guards. Before MAIN COMMITTEE this, but after the recent execution of the five political prisoners in Iran, some political prisoners and journalists were transferred from Evin prison to Raja’i prison in Karaj. When I talk about human rights violations, there is no real way to describe the kinds of things I am talking about. I have received descriptions from some of my Iranian community of the conditions of family members after spending time in these places. No language that we use in this parliament will ever be able to convey the horror that some of these people experience at the hands of this regime. The first trial of the seven prisoners was held on 12 January this year, and it was there that they first heard the charges that were being levelled against them. The charges included propaganda activities against the Islamic order, espionage, the establishment of an illegal administration, sending documents outside the country, cooperation with Israel, acting against the security of the country and the corruption of the earth. All seven of the prisoners have strenuously denied the charges. The Baha’i leaders arrested nearly two years ago had their second court appearance in August. It was closed to family members. At that trial they were found guilty and sentenced to 20 years in jail. I call on the Iranian government to abide by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and to act in a fair and transparent humane way towards the seven Baha’i leaders. (Time expired) politics, I have no hesitation in supporting the motion by the member for Blair. Iran has become something of an international pariah because of the confrontational attitude of President Ahmadinejad. The inflammatory rhetoric from Iran’s leadership with regard to nuclear development is particularly damaging to the stability of the Middle East. The international impact of Iran’s belligerence is yet to be completely realised, but for many individuals in Iran the effects of the president’s domestic policies are all too real. The violations of human rights in Iran are deeply concerning. The Iranian government refuses to recognise international human rights standards and continues to ignore calls from around the world to engage with the international community about human rights. Of particular concern is Iran’s continued use of the death penalty-in particular, the use of stoning. I am deeply concerned about Iran’s state sanctioned abuse of women and the refusal to implement the basic principles of natural justice. Iran also continues to imprison and persecute those who expose and publicise human rights abuses. My primary purpose in speaking to this motion today is to give voice to a small group of my constituents who are deeply concerned about the imprisonment of seven Baha’i leaders in Iran. The Baha’i community in Coffs Harbour has been active in publicising the plight of these leaders, and I want to ensure that my constituents have their concerns heard in this place. The Baha’i leaders were charged with a range of offences, including spreading antigovernment propaganda, collaboration with Israel and spreading corruption on earth. Information from within Iran indicates that the seven were sentenced to 20 years imprisonment, which has been reduced to 10 years following international outcry. The accused were tried without appropriate access to legal representation, and the lawyers who did attempt to provide assistance have themselves suffered persecution and harassment.

The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Sitting suspended from 1.26 pm to 4.00 pm BILL 2010 Second Reading Debate resumed from 20 October, on motion by Mr Garrett: That this bill be now read a second time. Ms LEY (Farrer) (4.00 pm)-I rise to speak on the Higher Education Support Amendment (FEE-HELP Loan Fee) Bill 2010 which seeks to increase the amount of FEE-HELP debt for fee-paying undergraduate students from 20 per cent to 25 per cent of the FEE-HELP loan. As this bill is virtually identical to the Higher Education Support Amendment (FEE-HELP Loan Fee) Bill 2010 fee that was considered by the 42nd Parliament, I will only speak briefly on this today. The Higher Education Support Act 2003, part 3.3.3, administers the FEE-HELP scheme, which allows domestic students enrolled in a course to access assistance of up to $80,000 to pay for fees, or $100,000 for courses in veterinary science, dentistry and medicine. The estimated financial impact for this bill provides for a commencement date of 1 January 2011. The adjustment to the cost of the measure for this commencement date is $7 million fiscal balance over the period 2010-11 to 2013-14. FEE-HELP currently extends to undergraduate and postgraduate studies at private higher education providers in the vocational and education training sector, including TAFE, for diplomas and advanced diplomas and to some students doing postgraduate studies at university. All types of HELP schemes are subsidised by the government as students do not pay a commercial rate of interest on the loan and there is no interest paid on the debt, though it is subject to indexation. There is a significant cost to the Commonwealth as some student debt is never repaid due to death of the debtor; relocation overseas; or the income threshold, which triggers repayment by the debtor, never being reached. To partly recover that subsidy, the government currently adds 20 per cent to the value of the FEE-HELP loan. The loan fee is designed to compensate the Commonwealth for the lending amounts that are in most instances higher than those loaned to Commonwealth supported students and therefore in many instances can take longer to repay. The review into higher education chaired by Professor Bradley recommended an increase in the FEE-HELP loan fee from 20 per cent to 25 per cent, which was based on modelling done by Professor Bruce Chapman, the architect of the HECS scheme. I note that this measure and the modelling by Bruce Chapman has attracted concern from the sector about the appropriateness of increasing the loan fee to 25 per cent, given that the loan fee for OS-HELP and VET FEE-HELP students is 20 per cent. The anomalies between the different HELP schemes have been noted by the coalition and we have advocated for a thorough review of all MAIN COMMITTEE",239,Gards Began In 1991 As An Afternoon Cup Of Tea To Support The Increasing Number Of Widows
289,The Deputy Speaker (Ms K Livermore),"Order! The time allotted for this debateof the schemes to iron out any inconsistencies. Nevertheless, it is indisputable that there is a need for the Commonwealth to recover more of the subsidised cost and reduce the pressure on the taxpayer. For this reason we will not oppose this legislation. I thank the Main Committee. Amendment (FEE-HELP Loan Fee) Bill 2010. Higher education is absolutely integral to the Gillard government’s vision for A Stronger, Fairer Australia. It drives economic development, productivity and high-skill jobs. I am pleased to have a number of important higher education institutions in my electorate, including the University of Queensland Ipswich campus, the University of Southern Queensland, as well as Bremer TAFE. Prior to the last redistribution, I had the University of Queensland Gatton campus in my electorate. Higher education is important in my seat. It is a driver of employment. It is particularly important in view of the answer that the federal Minister for Health and Ageing gave in federal parliament not less than a couple of hours ago when she talked about what the University of Queensland is doing with the superclinic at the Ipswich campus. That particular campus sees doctors, nurses and physicians’ assistants trained, educated, qualified and operating in the Ipswich and West Moreton region. It is a particularly important campus. This legislation increases the amount of FEE-HELP loan fee for units of study undertaken as part of the undergraduate courses. It is following up the recommendations of the review of Australian higher education, the Bradley review. This bill seeks to increase the amount of FEE-HELP debt from 120 per cent to 125 per cent of the loan amount for units of study undertaken as part of an undergraduate course of study. The increased loan fee will apply to FEE-HELP debts incurred on or after 1 January 2011. The Bradley review recommended this legislative change to reflect a greater cost to government because governments effectively subsidise higher education. Many people do not ever pay back the debt owed to the government, sometimes because they pass away and sometimes because their income has never quite reached that height. This will not act as a disincentive to people going to higher education institutions, particularly universities. The criticisms in relation to this are misplaced when I look at the some of things that have been said about this particular bill. The increased loan fee will not significantly affect students at public universities in my electorate, at USQ or at UQ Ipswich campus. The USQ campus is at Springfield. The government has prohibited fee-paying undergraduate places and introduced a demand driven funding scheme, which means that from 2012 the Gillard government will fund a Commonwealth supported place for every student accepted into an eligible course of study at a public university, including USQ at Springfield and UQ at Ipswich. Whether it is universities or TAFE courses and TAFE institutions, these things make a big difference in the lives of working-class boys and girls and young men and young women in my electorate. And while I am on my feet I want to particularly pay tribute to the Bremer TAFE, which is an important tertiary institution in my electorate. I particularly thank the assistance given to me by the acting institute director, Michael Thomas, and facilities manager, Brad Fisher. RecentlyI had the pleasure of representing the minister, Senator Chris Evans, in relation to opening the Better TAFE Facilities recognition ceremony for the $2 million we put into the Bremer TAFE. This $2 million has made a big difference to my constituents in the electorate of Blair, particularly in terms of what they have done. They have made a massive difference to campus. I will be speaking about that later, in a speech either today or tomorrow. MAIN COMMITTEE",240,Higher Education Support Amendment Fee Help Loan Fee
290,Mr Neumann (Blair) (4.04 Pm),"I am happy to support the Higher Education SupportThat is just a way in which the Gillard government is making a difference in the lives of people in my electorate, contributing valuable investment to make a difference to the kinds of facilities that are available, particularly in the trades, particularly in computers and graphic design, particularly in metal fabrication, and also in the upgrading of equipment and workstations. These things make a huge difference in the lives of people, and not just the administration. Providing air-conditioning to learning spaces in institutions is a practical way which makes a difference in the lives of people who attend those institutions. This legislation will not prohibit young people or mature-age students attending university. It is in line with the recommendations. Since 1989, undergraduate students have been required to pay a contribution towards the cost of their courses under what was then known as the Higher Education Contribution Scheme. This is the way we have done things for quite some time, but we need to make sure the system is viable. We need to make sure that investments in great institutions in my electorate, such as USQ at Springfield, UQ at Ipswich and Bremer TAFE at Bundamba, can continue and this sector can be viable for the electors of Blair. Ms KATE ELLIS (Adelaide-Minister for Employment Participation and Childcare and Minister for the Status of Women) (4.09 pm)-I thank the member for Blair as well as the other members who have spoken in this debate on the impacts that this government’s changes to education, particularly higher education, are having on their constituents in their communities and on the substantial benefits the changes are bringing. In representing Minister Garrett, in summing up this debate, I also thank all of those members from both sides who spoke on the Higher Education Support Amendment (FEE-HELP Loan Fee) Bill 2010. The bill amends the Higher Education Support Act 2003 to implement the government’s decision to increase the loan fee from 20 per cent to 25 per cent for FEE-HELP for fee-paying undergraduate students. An increase in the loan fee applying to FEE-HELP debts incurred from 1 January 2011 will enable the government to recover more of the taxpayer-subsidised cost of providing FEE-HELP loans, giving effect to the recommendation that was part of the Bradley Review of Australian Higher Education. Even with a five per cent increase in the loan fee, the conditions of the government’s FEE-HELP scheme continue to provide an extremely favourable income-contingent loan for students. Contrasting with commercial loan schemes, FEE-HELP loans are not means-tested, do not require security, are interest free, are indexed only to maintain real value and have income contingent repayment arrangements. Students do not have to start repaying their HELP loan until their income reaches the minimum repayment threshold of $44,912. If students do not repay their loan, the government meets that cost. The majority of students will not be affected by the change which will impact only on undergraduate students who choose to use FEE-HELP for their tuition fees in a fee-paying place. With all of that in mind, I urge members to support the bill. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. Afghanistan Debate resumed from 28 October, on motion by Mr Stephen Smith: That the House take note of the document. from where I left off. At the time. I was making the point that our engagement in Afghanistan MAIN COMMITTEE",241,Higher Education Support Amendment Fee Help Loan Fee
291,Mr Zappia (Makin) (4.12 Pm),"In continuing my remarks on this matter, I will pick upis often linked to the attack on the Twin Towers and the Bali bombings. I was specifically making the point that I knew Angela Golotta, who was killed in the Bali bombings. I know her family, and I know the trauma that the death caused her family. I also knew Andrew Knox, a young Australian who was killed in the Twin Towers attack. Andrew and I were political colleagues and friends and worked on campaigns on a number of occasions in the Makin electorate, which I represent today. In referring to both of them, I know and understand full well the strong links and passions that some members have in respect of our engagement in Afghanistan and both of those attacks. It is also my understanding that more Australians have now been killed in terrorist attacks on the West than those from any other Western country other than the United States. So, quite rightly, our engagement in Afghanistan is as much about protecting Australia’s people and interests as it is about supporting the US. Today Afghanistan is one of the most impoverished nations in the world. According to the Australian Council for International Development, Afghanistan ranks second last at No. 181 of 182 countries on the UN’s Human Development Index. It is the most food insecure country on the planet. Less than 30 per cent of its people have access to safe drinking water and more than 90 per cent do not have access to proper sanitation. The average life expectancy for an Afghan woman is 44 years. Every 29 minutes, a woman dies during childbirth. Maternal mortality rates are estimated to be the third highest in the world at 1,600 per 100,000 live births. Literacy rates, at 26 per cent of the total population, are the fourth lowest in the world. One in four children die before the age of five. The human and financial toll caused by three decades of fighting and destruction is immeasurable. If the same efforts had gone into addressing the level of disadvantage as have gone into the engagement in Afghanistan, the country may well be much different today than it is, and it may well not be as vulnerable as it is today. The Afghanistan war began as a war on terrorism; however, I believe that that is no longer the focus of our presence there. So why are we still there? We are still there because we were party to overthrowing the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, and we cannot leave until an alternative, stable government is in place. To do otherwise would leave the people of Afghanistan at the mercy of those who would quite likely not treat them well. We are there because, having disrupted al-Qaeda operations there, we must ensure that a future Afghanistan government does not again provide a cover for terrorist training or a refuge for terrorists. These are valid reasons for Australia’s continued presence in Afghanistan. I am deeply concerned, however, that there is no end to the war in sight and that our ADF members could be in Afghanistan until 2014 or possibly for the rest of this decade. I am also concerned that reports about progress made are countered by other reports which describe a worsening situation. What is now needed is international aid and a continuation of the training, mentoring and equipping of the Afghan army and police so that they can build their own capability. The Taliban is not al-Qaeda and, according to several respected commentators, engaging the Taliban in constructive discussions may prove more successful in bringing an end to the war than continuing the military action against them. The member for Werriwa clearly articulated this in his contribution to this debate. Peter Leahy’s options of diplomacy, economic, military and soft power should all be part of Australia’s strategy in our future engagement in Afghanistan. MAIN COMMITTEE In summary, our engagement in the Afghanistan war is not about human rights or liberating the Afghan people. If it were, we should be in many other countries as well. Nor is it about being a compliant partner of our allies, particularly the USA. This is as much our problem and our war as it is that of our allies. Securing the safety of the Australian people is no longer simply a matter of securing our own borders. This war was about attacking a terrorist organisation which presented a threat to all of the Western world, including Australia. That makes it a just cause. It is about Australia sharing responsibility on a matter of mutual international interest with our allies, and that makes it a just cause. I do not want to see any more ADF lives lost, nor do I want to see any more civilian lives lost because of the acts of terrorists. I will finish with this remark. Last ThursdayI attended the Remembrance Day service in my electorate. I was approached by the mother of an ADF member who is serving in Afghanistan. The mother was in tears when she asked me to strongly argue the case that Australia should withdraw from Afghanistan. She was in tears because every time her phone rings or there is a knock on the door, she is concerned that it is the phone call or the knock that tells her about her son. I understand exactly what she was saying to me. I may not understand how she feels, but I understand the point she was making to me. AndI do understand that there would be so many other mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters in exactly the same situation. That is why I would like to see an end to this war sooner rather than later. Makin and also those made by other speakers on this subject. I rise to speak on Australia’s involvement in the war in Afghanistan. For me, this is an excellent opportunity not only to reflect on and review Australia’s role in the war but also to ponder what is in the hearts and minds of Australians. BeforeI start, I would like to state that I have a deep respect and admiration for Australian soldiers past and present. With Remembrance Day just last week, this is an opportune time to discuss this issue-keeping in the forefront of all our debates the memories of those who have passed-and to try to put into perspective the current situation and the future of those currently serving for Australia overseas. To those soldiers-some 1,550 of you-currently deployed, as well as to the many more who have been to Afghanistan and theatres around the world, and also, sadly, to all Australian troops who have lost their lives, and to those who have been seriously wounded: we must recognise that you have paid the price that many of us in this place talk about but have never experienced. While we are here today talking about the war, Australian men and women are living the war. They are at the coalface. There are a number of reasons why this debate is timely. The politics surrounding the war in Afghanistan have changed. There are new elements reshaping the war debate, including a high number of Australian casualties, particularly this year; operational concerns from the troops, in particular with regard to leaked emails; three soldiers facing charges; national weariness of the nine-year war effort; and a lack of understanding as to why Australian troops are in Afghanistan. This debate is not as simple as being prowar or antiwar, as some would want to believe. Our involvement is woven into the complexities of Afghanistan and into an ongoing commitment that has exceeded all expectations. If we are having a debate on whether or not Australian troops should be withdrawn from Afghanistan, we are really articulating a concern at the long nine years of Australia’s involvement and our generational commitment to the USMAIN COMMITTEE",242,Ministerial Statements
292,Mr Irons (Swan) (4.20 Pm),"I acknowledge the contribution made by the member forAustralia alliance. Are we prepared, as the Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, said, to be involved in Afghanistan for the next decade at least? The commitment is the issue that needs to be addressed. We should remember the reasons for deploying troops to Afghanistan were born after 9-11. It was the start of our commitment to the war on terror, and that commitment had Australia-wide support-even from the Greens. Senator Bob Brown, in a speech in September 2001 in the other place, described 9-11 as an ‘awesome tragedy’ and a ‘heinous terrorist attack’ on the United States. Australia’s deployment was viewed as necessary to combat further potential terrorist attacks. We have now been committed to Afghanistan for nine long years, and some Australian people are becoming increasingly uncomfortable. It appears we have no tangible outcomes and no end in sight. The confusion speaks to the heart of why our young men and women are still in Afghanistan. This is another reason why this debate is so important. The Australian people want reassurance that we are there fighting a just fight. Australians only need to ask the troops who serve in Afghanistan for that reassurance. I have been privileged to speak to some of the fine young men and women of Australia who have served our nation in Afghanistan, and they believe they are there for the right reasons. Australians believe the primary motivation for our troops continuing their deployment in Afghanistan is to ensure that it does not again become a training ground for terrorists. The threat of terrorism continues to be a real threat for all Australians. Nearly 100 Australians have been killed in terrorist attacks over the past 10 years which have been planned and executed from terrorist safe havens within the mountains of Afghanistan. Australians have, unfortunately, been victims of a number of targeted terrorist attacks, including Bali in 2002, the Australian embassy in Jakarta in 2009, the London train and bus bombings in 2007, Bali again in 2005, and the Marriott and Ritz-Carlton hotels in Jakarta in 2009. I was recently reminded about the Bali bombings and the effect they had on all Australians and their families and friends when I attended the Bali bombing dawn memorial service in Kings Park on 12 October. I was joined by my colleague the member for Curtin, the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, Julie Bishop, in a moving ceremony that was attended by many people in Perth. Some were survivors and others were friends or family of the victims of these terrorist attacks. The memory of those Australians who died and those who survived these attacks will never be forgotten by these people, and all Australians should never forget them. These Australians remain a stark reminder to us all about the reality of terrorism. If we are to continue the war against terrorists then we need to continue to ensure that there are no safe havens for them in countries like Afghanistan. We must remain vigilant to safeguard all Australians, and no more Australians should lose their lives because Afghanistan has served as a safe haven for terrorists to train. Are we in Afghanistan to honour our alliance with the US? For some Australians the idea of Australia being in Afghanistan purely to keep the Americans on side does not sit well. Australians need to be reminded, however, that we have a responsibility to join with the US and its partners under the sanction of the UN to continue to achieve the mission in Afghanistan, and the mission clearly has not yet been achieved. The US has also supported us not so long ago with occupations of East Timor and the Solomon Islands in 2003. Our alliance with MAIN COMMITTEE America cannot be the primary and only reason for staying; however, it forms part of a broader strategy. So why are we in Afghanistan? There are a large number of reasonable explanations, including to uphold ANZUS; for Australia’s self-defence; to capture Osama bin Laden; to dismantle the Taliban; a commitment to be part of the war on terror; to help avert further terrorist attacks in places like Bali; for human rights, in particular liberating Afghan women; and to set up a democracy or training the Afghan National Army-all of which are just reasons to be there. However, we have seen the government change the focus on our involvement in Afghanistan over the past two years, which the member for Makin mentioned during his speech. What started as an anti-terrorist focus has now become the mentoring and training of Afghan soldiers to ultimately take responsibility for upholding the safety and security of their people. Since the change of government in Australia in 2007 and the US in 2008, the mission in Afghanistan has changed, with the central focus now geared towards ensuring that Afghans take over responsibility for their own security. We must support the stabilisation of the Afghan state through the combination of civil, police and military training for local Afghans to enable them to achieve self-determination within a reasonable period of time. In 2009, President Obama announced a revised strategy for Afghanistan that saw more troops committed and the long-term goal being a transition over to the Afghan government. Part of the new counterinsurgency strategy includes the COIN doctrine as laid out by General DavidH Petraeus. It aims to bolster economic growth, stability and Afghan goodwill toward their government with a strategy with a range of various components, including to hire Afghans first; buy Afghan products and build Afghan capacity; use contracting to hire Afghan workers and Afghan owned companies; and to consult and involve local leaders, develop new partnerships and contracts with a broader range of Afghan companies which will help break monopolies and weaken patronage networks that help breed resentment. Progress in a counterinsurgency is gradual and achieved by degrees, village by village. It is a slow process, but there is no other way to achieve the goal. The success of Afghanistan can only be measured in the small wins that are happening day by day taking us closer to a secure Afghanistan. One of Australia’s operational objectives was to train the Afghan forces to the point where they can take responsibility for the Oruzgan province. That has not been achieved and is likely to take some years before that objective is achieved; however, the 4th Afghan Brigade are being trained and mentored to take control of Oruzgan so they can help build a secure place where the locals can live without fear of reprisals from the Taliban and other criminal elements. So are the Australian troops making a difference? The answer is yes. Our troops are doing their job in difficult and dangerous circumstances. The terrain is inhospitable, the weather and the dust overbearing, and the insurgents are unrelenting. Despite this, our forces are fighting the good fight. Progress is slow but is being made. Not only military progress but trust has developed between our forces and the Afghan forces, forging a productive partnership. The Australian Defence Force are involved in a number of projects across Afghanistan, including Oruzgan Province and Kandahar. They are engaged in operations, including those involved in reconstruction, mentoring, security, accommodation, infrastructure and countering the effects of improvised explosive devices. Australia is leading the way in training and promoting the development of the Afghan people in determining their own destiny. Despite variMAIN COMMITTEE ous media reports on the war, with various experts saying it is unwinnable, it should be understood that the success of this conflict will not be achieved through military means alone. Success will also be measured by ensuring that the local population is protected and separated from the insurgents. Now we come to the question that lies at the heart of the debate: when is the right time for Australia to withdraw troops? When can our troops come home? Looking at the withdrawal of other international forces: in August the Netherlands withdrew most of its 1,950 troops from Oruzgan; the Canadians are expected to commence withdrawing their 2,830-strong troop commitment as of next year; Poland’s 2,600 troops will leave Afghanistan in 2012; indications are that the British will commence the withdrawal of their 10,000 troops in 2014 and 2015; the US have said that they will commence standing down troops in July next year; and, as to the remaining 90,000 troops, it is unclear when they will leave. The question is very difficult to answer. My colleague the member for Curtin has urged the government to not set a specific timeline for the withdrawal of Australian troops so that the Taliban do not use it to their advantage. I agree with the member for Curtin that we need to be very careful about how and when to start withdrawing our troops. We need to ensure that our exit does not leave the country to implode. The best exit plan for Australian and international forces is to finish the job we have started. For Australia this means completing the task of training the 4th Brigade and ensuring that the central government is capable of containing and defeating the insurgency. To leave before that goal is achieved would hardly be the actions of a friend. It was recently reported that America’s plan to start withdrawing troops from July 2011 had given a morale boost to the Taliban, who believe they can wait out the NATO forces. Our forces should only withdraw when Afghan forces are ready and able to take over. It would be irresponsible to do otherwise. Afghanistan over the past nine years has been a dynamic problem, with the challenge of keeping up with the constantly changing conditions on the ground. Counterinsurgency campaigns are rollercoasters with advances and setbacks, which brings us to the fact that Australian troops have lost their lives in Afghanistan. This is a high price. This is the most heart breaking aspect of war and nothing can come close to the loss felt by devastated loved ones left to carry on. I hope that families can take some comfort in knowing that in the heart of every Aussie soldier is a dedication and commitment to ensure Australians are safer across the world because of the job they are doing. We are all forever grateful. We must also not forget the lost lives of our allies and the Afghan people. This war has not been easily fought. All sides have been hurt. There is no hiding from the reality. We are part of an international mission in Afghanistan and we should not walk away from our responsibilities. Australia has a moral obligation to fulfil its part. We need to finish the task. Our country was built on hard work and finishing a job properly. Those values are still important for us as a nation today. Mature governments do not cut and run ahead of their senior allies. From the start, Australia’s commitment was mandated by the UN and the invoking of the ANZUS Treaty. Many vocal minorities quote international agreements for issues that they say we must support, but they conveniently forget our treaty commitments when they are about an issue such as Afghanistan. BeforeI close, I would like to mention that last week I saw a show that mentioned Captain Noel Chavasse who was in the Royal British Army Medical Corps during World War I. He MAIN COMMITTEE died on 4 August 1917 after suffering a gaping abdominal wound. His gravestone is engraved with two Victoria Crosses-that is unique in itself-but the inscription on his gravestone is what I want to bring to the attention of the House. It reads: Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. In recognising the spirit of the inscription of Captain Chavasse’s gravestone, this applies to all our brave Australians in Afghanistan and to every Australian who has fought for their country. Whether or not they believe in the reasons for being there, they must never have their commitment undervalued by those back home who did not make the decision to send them to war or by those who have never faced an enemy or had to make the decision to put their lives on the line for their country. In closing, I support Australia’s continuing deployment to Afghanistan because the job is clearly not finished. To leave the job half finished would be an insult to all those Australians who have given their lives or who have been wounded during duty, believing they were making a difference and ultimately making the world a safer place for all Australians. Ms RISHWORTH (Kingston) (4.34 pm)-I welcome this opportunity to speak on the statement by the Prime Minister on Afghanistan. The decision to go to war should be the hardest decision that any government should have to make. This decision to put our men and women in harm’s way is one that I believe that this government has not taken-and should never take-lightly. Our mission in Afghanistan is both dangerous and difficult. Australia has paid a high price. We should never forget that 21 Australians have lost their lives serving Australia in Afghanistan. I cannot imagine the anguish and despair of losing a loved one in combat and I would like to put on the record my profound sympathy for those families and loved ones who have. But, in spite of this mission being both dangerous and difficult, I do support the government’s commitment in Afghanistan and believe it is an important commitment that must be maintained. In this age of global terrorism, our work in Afghanistan is necessary. If terrorists harboured by the Taliban were allowed to regroup in Afghanistan, the security of Australians both at home and abroad would be in jeopardy. September 11 2001 was a stark reminder of the realities of terrorism. The more recent attacks in Jakarta and Bali serve as a grim reminder that terrorism is not confined to the Middle East, the Americas or Europe. Australia’s commitment to the mission in Afghanistan is dedicated to minimising the threat of terrorism, rectifying human rights abuses in Afghanistan and ensuring the development of a stable and secure Afghanistan. Inaction and withdrawal by coalition troops will arguably lead to a power vacuum which would be filled by non-state actors, extremists and radicals, further hampering the Afghan people’s efforts to establish themselves as a viable nation-state. Recently the UN Security Council unanimously renewed the International Security Assistance Force’s mandate in Afghanistan. The UN has affirmed its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and national unity of Afghanistan. This is an important point. The mission in Afghanistan is not a unilateral decision of any one country but a multilateral commitment made by the international community with 47 countries acting under this mandate. MAIN COMMITTEE This debate on the Prime Minister’s statement has been extremely comprehensive. Many previous speakers have outlined in detail the objectives and details of our mission in Afghanistan. Therefore I am not going to repeat what many of my colleagues have already placed on the record. But I do want to comment on the importance of providing support to our troops and their families. There is no denying that the recent past has been an exceptionally tough period for our troops in Afghanistan. On a daily basis they face dangerous conditions. The threat of improvised explosive devices is ever present. Afghanistan is a place where any rock or tin can may be one of these explosive devices and where enemy combatants do not wear uniforms. Our troops face a dangerous environment, a compromising terrain and an arid climate with scorching days and cold nights. Our troops are exposed to constant turmoil and threat: 156 Australians have been physically wounded in the war in Afghanistan, which has left them with the physical scars of war. But there are also the scars that we cannot see. History has shown us that the psychological toll of combat can also be debilitating. Both physical and psychological wounds can have a long-lasting impact. For many of our troops in Afghanistan this is not their first deployment. Many have been on multiple deployments not just in Afghanistan in recent years but also to East Timor and Iraq. Many of our troops in Afghanistan have been exposed to near misses and witnessed their mates injured or even killed. It does not matter how resilient, capable or trained our soldiers are; these conditions will take their toll. For some it may result in mental health issues, including post-traumatic stress disorder. Post-traumatic stress disorder is believed to develop as the result of a human brain not completely processing a traumatic event. The results of this are debilitating and include invasive memories, hypervigilance, nightmares, loss of concentration, guilt and irritability. Therefore, post-traumatic stress disorder is an inevitable side effect of war that some of our troops may suffer from. As a government and as a society, we must ensure that our troops who serve our country get the support they need when they need it. We must ensure that there are no barriers for our defence personnel in obtaining mental health treatment. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2004 found that stigma associated with seeking treatment for mental health disorders was a significant barrier to American soldiers and marines returning from Afghanistan and Iraq accessing treatment. In fact the study reported that service personnel who were most in need of treatment for mental health issues did not access services because of the stigma associated with receiving care. Since then there have been a variety of studies confirming that stigma continues to be a barrier to military personnel seeking treatment for mental health issues. This is concerning because accessing help for conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder and other mental health issues should not be viewed by service personnel or anyone else as embarrassing or a weakness. We know that addressing mental health issues can significantly improve the lives of those affected. Studies have also shown that addressing mental health issues can increase retention of personnel in the defence forces. As a government and a community we need to ensure that everything is being done to support those service personnel who are affected by mental health issues and work to reduce any stigma that may exist about accessing help, both within our defence forces and in our wider society. We must not make the mistake that we did when previous war veterans returned home. Many have told me they were provided with little recognition of and support for their physical and mental health difficulties. The Vietnam War saw many soldiers return to Australia with no MAIN COMMITTEE real support. They were expected to come back and just get on with life. Many were not offered support, understanding or the opportunity to talk about their experiences. For some, this led to lifelong issues that have been debilitating and have severely impacted their quality of life for decades. For many it took years to get help for some of the issues they were experiencing. Therefore providing prevention and early intervention services for our personnel is critical. I am pleased that the Gillard government has taken the area of mental health in our armed forces seriously. Upon election in 2007 the government initiated a review of mental health care in the Australian Defence Force and transition to non-military life. The government accepted the majority of recommendations in this report. I have been advised by Minister Snowdon’s office that the Department of Defence department is now implementing these recommendations, with the enhancement of the ADF mental health workforce being the main priority. It is not only service personnel who are affected by deployment to Afghanistan and other war zones. It is the families as well whom we should not forget when our service personnel are deployed. My brother is an Air Force pilot and has served in both Afghanistan and Iraq, and I have seen the anxiety and stress that those deployments have had on my family, especially my mother. The anxiety and stress that family members suffer is real. For some families the worse-case scenario they fear does indeed occur and they lose a loved one. We need to make sure that families in this worse-case scenario get all the support they deserve. Ensuring that families are prepared for their loved ones to be deployed has been found to be a very important factor in improving the family’s resilience. Ensuring there is support for soldiers and their families upon their return is also critical. Some of our Defence Force personnel may have difficulty readjusting to their lives in Australia after returning from deployment, and it is important that once again the appropriate support is available for them and, importantly, their families as well. Our mission in Afghanistan is a difficult and dangerous one. It is a mission that I believe we should not abandon. If coalition forces were to withdraw there could be serious consequences for global security. Our troops in Afghanistan are doing a professional job on the ground but, as I have said, it is dangerous. It is important that while we continue our work in Afghanistan we do not forget that this mission could have a significant impact on our personnel on the ground and their families. We must support them. on Afghanistan. It seems that every Australian has an opinion on whether our troops should remain in Afghanistan or whether they should be withdrawn, and I think that debate is quite good and proper. We are all asking ourselves ceaseless questions like: should we stay in Afghanistan or should we walk away; are we making headway or is it a lost cause; and have we matched our military might with social and economic reconstruction? I might say by way of an aside that the lessons of previous conflicts should have told us that we need to put a lot more into social and economic reconstruction. Of course, if we abandon our course prematurely, we are simply surrendering Afghanistan to authoritarian governments or to warlords or, even worse, to terrorist organisations that would possibly run the country, as they have in the past-organisations which will invariably carry out attacks on foreign soil or allow the training of people who will carry out attacks on MAIN COMMITTEE",244,Ministerial Statements
293,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (4.44 Pm),"I too welcome the opportunity to speak in this debateforeign soil. The fact that so many terrorists and would be terrorists have admitted to training in Afghanistan demonstrates the depth of the problem. Those of us who have seen Australians killed in Bali or in the London underground bombings should be in no doubt of the capacity of these terrorists-and that is saying nothing, of course, about other occasions and near misses at Australian and American embassies and the dreadful events on the Spanish railways. They are other examples of training that occurred in that country. It is important that all views are aired and it is important to support the men and women who are carrying out their duties in what must be the most hellish of circumstances. It is absolutely pivotal to this debate that we understand the broader implications of Australia’s involvement in Afghanistan. We must take into account Afghanistan’s history, its current situation and its likely future. We must consider international alliances and security matters, Australia’s role in Afghanistan up to this point, the welfare of our troops, the wishes of Australians and the deeply held sentiment of people that we must finish the job in Afghanistan as a fitting tribute to the 21 Australian soldiers who have been killed to date. Bearing in mind the parliament’s bipartisan commitment to remain militarily engaged in Afghanistan, it is timely to re-examine our role in reshaping that country-and, of course, that goes beyond the military. For hundreds of years Afghanistan has experienced conflict and strife-strife that we as a nation have never known but strife that has gone on there for literally hundreds of years. History tells us that whenever a foreign power has tried to exert influence over Afghanistan, that particular country has come off second best. You can trace that back to colonial Britain or, more recently, to Russia. They are just two of many examples of countries that have tried to use their influence in Afghanistan. So we must be cautious in our endeavours. I believe we must stay the course in Afghanistan but we must also have a roadmap and benchmarks for our eventual withdrawal from that country. For the sake of our troops, their families, their friends and all Australians, we need to know when that job is done and not just stay on in some endless continuum. As developed nations forge closer ties and become more and more engaged with the internet and so on-in other words, as we become a more global community-it is ironic that the gap between Afghanistan and the rest of the world widens. It is a nation which faces enormous challenges, and not just in the political sense. Geographically, Afghanistan has some of the most hostile terrain on earth and its people struggle for basic subsistence. Almost 44 per cent of the population in Afghanistan is aged under 14. Corruption is rife and public infrastructure, as we all know, is diabolical. Unemployment runs at 35 per cent and roughly the same percentage of Afghans live below the poverty line. And per capita, Afghanistan’s GDP is only $1,000. It is also the world’s largest producer of opium-an illegal crop. Throw into that mix constant armed conflict and terrorism and you have about as grim a situation as you can imagine. Clearly, there is a hell of long way to go before peace and prosperity will be created in Afghanistan. So the goals must be military, political and social if we are to achieve genuine results in Afghanistan. Our troops are there to make a difference, and I believe they are doing just that. Our nineyear presence in Afghanistan is only second in Australian memory to our engagement in the war in Vietnam. On that point, I want to come to another aspect of our engagement in Afghanistan, and that is support for our troops. I hope that I am not being unduly critical but I MAIN COMMITTEE am not convinced that it is all that it should be. I want to take you back to Vietnam and, in particular, to the Battle of Long Tan to make a point about the importance of support capability for our troops in the field. While I accept that Australia’s role in Afghanistan is quite different from its role in Vietnam, and also the environment in Afghanistan-the desert and hostile terrain that I was talking about before-is quite different from that of Vietnam, the need for support for our troops in Afghanistan is as paramount as it was in Vietnam. In the Battle of Long Tan, 105 Australian troops, with some support from RAAF helicopters and a contingent of APCs, took on an estimated contingent of 2,500 North Vietnamese regulars and Viet Cong. The odds of 105 to 2,500 are just enormous. Even though those odds were overwhelming, the Australians prevailed. But what was seminal to that battle-and I have heard it from people who actually served there, even the commanding officer in the field, the commander of D Company of 6RAR, Major Harry Smith, now Lieutenant Colonel Harry Smith, who was decorated for his exceptional leadership and bravery on that day-was the strategic nature of New Zealand, Australian and American artillery units who provided a carpet of fire into the rubber plantation where the battle was occurring. Harry Smith makes no secret of the crucial nature of the artillery fire and of the helicopters which brought in ammunition at the height of the battle. Imagine his situation: he was right at the front of the firefight, with his New Zealand artillery officer beside him. They were both lying face down in a puddle of muddy, swampy water, trying to raise their heads just enough to keep them out of the line of fire to call down a withering barrage of artillery from the three units that were literally metres in front of them. He says that that was the turning point for them. The only way that they could have won that battle was with the support of the RAAF helicopters and that barrage of fire. It was scary, it was frightening but it was crucial and decisive. In fact-and I just say this by way of an aside-it is said that, if they had not won the battle on that day, the Australian base at Nui Dat would probably have been attacked by those 2,000-plus North Vietnamese troops. Contrast that with the situation in Afghanistan where the Dutch helicopters stayed at 5,000 metres above our troops at Deh Rawood, out of the firefight but broadly in support of the troops. This is not a criticism of the Dutch helicopters-they had to make the call on that day-but, rather, a call for an integrated Australian capacity where the Australian commanders in the field can make those decisions and call on Australian backup. I was disappointed by the criticisms made of the shadow defence minister, Senator Johnston, when he called for better Australian support. Honourable members would know that there have been too many delays in military procurement in this country. I am not criticising the current government or the previous government; I am just talking in broad terms. There have been too many delays, too many changes and too many cost blow-outs of all sorts in defence procurement. When I hear of troops wanting to buy different shoes or not being happy with their flak jackets and the like, it gives me a sense of unease. Our people have to have the best support, whether it is in their personal equipment or in having other forms of backup. General Jim Molan said we should have tanks in Afghanistan. We need to take notice of people who have been in these sorts of situations and can make a judgement. If a soldier says something to me about his equipment or his backup, I am more likely to listen to him than to a Defence spokesman. In the remaining few minutes I would like to back up my colleague the member for Kingston and say how important it is to have support for the families. Just last week we had a MAIN COMMITTEE friend around for dinner-and you do not realise the impact of this until someone close to you is in this situation. Her daughter’s husband, her son-in-law, was killed in Afghanistan just a few months back. Of course, once the funeral is held and the tributes are paid and the troops return to the field, there is a lonely widow and two children. The lonely widow is so wracked with grief that she suffers from clinical depression and has to go to hospital. When you see that at close quarters you call for another form of support, as the previous speaker didsupport for the families-and no support is too much. My colleague also made a very good point about support for returning troops. Again, I spend a lot of time in my electorate with Vietnam veterans, for whom I have a great affection. We ran a health program for them. I cannot remember its name-through the YMcA. I remember that, when I went to the graduation of these ex-servicemen who had been through this health course and this physical exercise, two of them told me that they were on the verge of suicide at the time they took that course. So, in closing, in talking about support and in examining what we do on the ground in Afghanistan, we should also remember the families that have been left behind and the troops who suffer psychological damage from these conflicts. member for Kingston for raising the very important issue of post traumatic stress disorder. We have seen the ramifications of that for veterans in all wars-of course, in World WarI they called it shell shock. There should be no shame in reaching out and admitting that you have a problem and seeking treatment, and we have to be much better this time round at offering that treatment. This is an incredibly important debate for the parliament to have because it involves the welfare of Australians and the safeguarding of our national interest. It is an important debate for the parliament to discuss and think about the great challenge of our age, which is the dangerous combination of transnational terrorism and failed, lawless and chaotic states. I support our mission in Afghanistan and I support our ADF personnel, our federal police and our civilian aid agencies who are undertaking that mission. Having seen ADF personnel at work in the field in Afghanistan as part of the parliamentary exchange program and having met many of them in my electorate of Wakefield at RAAF Base Edinburgh, I have seen the professionalism, maturity and decency that they bring to a dangerous and hostile environment in Afghanistan. Our thoughts in this debate are with the families of those who have made the greatest sacrifice, with the wounded and with all those who serve our nation. This conflict does serve as a reminder of the generations of Australian servicemen who have made many sacrifices big and small to protect our liberty and more often than not the liberties of people from many distant places around the globe. We must remember that those sacrifices do not stop with one generation; they echo down the generations and they define our nation as a beacon of liberty, justice, mateship and democracy. The history of Afghanistan should weigh heavily on this debate because Afghanistan has been fought over the centuries in what was described in the 18th century as the great game. Prior to the first British-Afghan war, Mountstuart Elphinstone, the former Governor of Bombay, wrote to a friend: If you send 27,000 men up the Bolan pass to Candahar (as we hear is intended), and can feed them, I have no doubt you will take Candahar and Caubul and set up Soojah; but for maintaining him in a poor, MAIN COMMITTEE",250,Ministerial Statements
294,Mr Champion (Wakefield) (4.59 Pm),"I congratulate the member for Hinkler and thecold, strong and remote country, among a turbulent people like the Afghans, I own it seems to be to be hopeless. The British found Afghanistan an easy place to invade and a very hard place to hold. I have one of the Rats of Tobruk in my electorate. When I went round to see him prior to ANZAC Day he showed me his medals. One of those medals was from Dunkirk, which he had neglected to mention. When I asked him how he came to be in the British Army he said he had actually joined up in the thirties and spent some time on the Khyber Pass. He is 90-odd now and it just goes to show you that some things do not change. The Soviet Union also discovered this reality about Afghanistan. Despite their brutality, unrestrained use of force and conventional military advantage, they could not bring peace, order or stable government to Afghanistan. In the process of the invasion the Soviet Union destroyed Afghanistan’s agricultural economic base-which was fairly sophisticated-fractured its tribal society, exacerbated ethnic and tribal tensions, killed over a million Afghans, internally displaced two million more and then forced a further 5.5 million to flee abroad. That legacy is especially confronting when you consider that from 1880 to 1973 Afghanistan was largely stable and peaceful, and ruled through a combination of strong local governance and benign royalty. In fact, it was even possible to travel through Afghanistan-as many people did in the 1960s, following the hippie trail-with relative degrees of security. The sudden withdrawal of Soviet forces, while celebrated locally and internationally, opened the door for an even more brutal period of civil war amongst warlords, with foreign interference, the Taliban and ultimately with the nation becoming a client state of al-Qaeda. Advocates of the sudden withdrawal of UN sanctioned NATO forces should consider that historical lesson. Those who imagine that Afghanistan can somehow be made good through sudden withdrawal, foreign aid and wishful thinking must face up to the murderous chaos that would ensue if NATO forces withdrew suddenly. It should not be our desire, and it is not our desire, to permanently occupy Afghanistan but we can only withdraw when a relative degree of peace and stable governance is achieved. The real question that should be debated is how to bring peace to Afghanistan. In my opinion there are four pillars on which that peace may be based. The first is that we must embark on wellresearched and intelligence orientated intensive counterinsurgency operations. Insurgencies are in essence violent competition for the state and, to be overcome, they must be met with careful and selective use of military force, with civilian aid and with good governance. These operations are being undertaken now, and that includes the training of the Afghan National Army-a direct part of the Australian mission in Afghanistan. The second thing we must do in Afghanistan is disaggregate the threats. There is a tendency in this debate to roll a whole lot of people up in a bundle and call them all our enemy. I think we need to disaggregate those threats and understand the bewilderingly complex nature of Afghan tribal society and the difference in the threats we face and have a different strategy for dealing with each of them. It seems to me there are three main threats in Afghanistan. The first threat is that the Pashtun tribes may turn against us and wage a permanent insurgency. If that occurs, all will be lost. These tribes must be understood, and we must take into account the complex nature of their society, be mindful of their interests, be respectful of the code of Pashtunwali, which has reigned there for centuries, and resist the impossible task of imposing Western values on their communities. In short, we must make these tribes our allies, not our MAIN COMMITTEE enemies, because Afghanistan cannot be peaceful or stable if Pashtun society is disrespected or ignored. We must seek an honourable engagement built on respect in order to create the conditions for peace, and marginalise those who would truly damage our national interests and international order. The second of these threats is the Taliban, whose ranks range from thieves and thugs to religious zealots, and that group must be isolated and marginalised and forced into peaceful conduct through counterinsurgency campaigns. Force is necessary to provide unrelenting pressure on our part on the Taliban. The third enemy, the final threat, is of course the most dangerous and the real reason we are in Afghanistan-al-Qaeda and groups like them who subscribe to Takfiri transnational terrorism and who have declared war on all civilised societies and all the world’s major religions, Islam included. I use the term ‘Takfiri’ deliberately, and for the benefit of the HouseI will provide a definition of the term. David Kilcullen, who is a counterinsurgency expert, uses his description because he thinks it is much more accurate than terms like ‘Islamic extremist’. In his book Counter Insurgency he describes the term as follows: The doctrine of Takfiri disobeys the Qur’anic injunction against compulsion in religion and instead holds that Muslims whose beliefs differ from the Takfiri are infidels who must be killed. Takfirism is a heresy within Islam; it was outlawed in the 2005 Amman Message, an initiative of King Abdullah II of Jordan, which brought together more than 500 ulemas, Islamic scholars and Muslim political leaders from the organisation of the Islamic Conference of the Arab League in an unprecedented consensus agreement, a ‘unanimous’ agreement by Muslims everywhere as represented by their acknowledged most senior religious and political leaders. Al-Qaeda is Takfiri and its members are universally so described by other Muslims who they routinely terrorise. Dr Kilcullen continues in his book: I prefer it to the terms ‘jihad’, ‘jihadist’, ‘jihadi’ or ‘mujahadeen’ … which cede to the enemy the sacred status that they crave … It should be understood that these Takfiri transnational terrorist groups threaten the Muslim world as well as our own. We must resist the notion that there is a clash of civilisations or religions and expose al-Qaeda for what they are-murderous heretics. We must isolate al-Qaeda from the Muslim world in order to destroy it, and we must seek allies in the Muslim world in order to do this. There is a great deal of overlap in the threats. Nothing is simple in Afghanistan, but we must disaggregate the threats as far as possible and have a different strategy to deal with each of them. Peace and stability can only occur if we understand the nature of the threat we face and concentrate on the true nature of our ultimate enemy-al-Qaeda and groups like them. The third pillar to bringing peace and stability in Afghanistan is that there should be some movement away from the highly centralised government there. As I said before, previous periods of stability were characterised by highly decentralised governments. I believe that only by devolving democratic power back to the provinces and the valleys can we avoid civil war and eliminate national kleptocracy. A devolution of power is essential to bringing peace to Afghanistan. The fourth and final pillar to seeking a stable and peaceful Afghanistan is to end the great game which has been played by a range of foreign powers who have sought to fight proxy wars with each other within Afghanistan’s borders. We must seek broad international and reMAIN COMMITTEE gional agreements that end the overt and covert support for warlords and extremists-and, basically, a different era in the great game must begin. We must foster regional security in exchange for an end to the money, aid and resources that have fuelled the civil war and the insurgency in Afghanistan. Safe havens can only be eliminated through diplomacy, and we should give no quarter to those who spread violence, terror and disorder around the world, because no state, religion or community is safe from that violence, terror and disorder. It seems to me that diplomacy is an essential tool for ensuring peace and stability. Afghanistan once was peaceful and it can be stable and peaceful again. In the end, only Afghans can decide this, but they need our assistance and the world’s assistance. There are plenty of nations that have overcome barbarism and civil war, but in Afghanistan this can only occur with the help of the rest of the world and the goodwill of its neighbours. It is natural to have doubts, ask questions and seek knowledge, but we must not fool ourselves about the nature of the threat of al-Qaeda. It is as evil and unrelenting as any tyranny; it is as ambitious as any tyranny. Like fascism and communism before it, Takfiri terrorism is a political ideology of absolutes that cannot be reasoned with. We should remember the words of Sir Winston Churchill in 1938: Before we cast away this hope, this cause and this plan, which I do not at all disguise has an element of risk, let those who wish to reject it ponder well and earnestly upon what will happen to us if, when all else has been thrown to the wolves, we are left to face our fate alone. Our mission in Afghanistan is a reluctant duty-a duty we commit to knowing the terrible sacrifices that will be made in our national interests, in the interests of international stability and security and to protect the liberties, however small, of others. very important motion regarding Australia’s involvement in Afghanistan. It is an opportunity to join with so many other members of the House and restate my commitment to our important engagement in Afghanistan. I have had the opportunity to hear a great many of the contributions that have been made in the House and in this Main Committee, including those of the last hour or so. I think that those contributions, by members from both sides of politics, showed the strength of our commitment, and the thought that went into them demonstrated a thorough grasp of the very difficult issues and challenges. We of course reflect on the sacrifice of those 21 Australians. We reflect on those who have been injured in Afghanistan. We reflect on the pain of the families who have lost loved ones. And we think of those serving there today doing very important work not just on behalf of Australia but on behalf of the values of freedom that are the values of our country and other countries throughout the world. The Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition outlined in great detail some weeks ago the important issues at stake. I will not at this stage of the debate cover each and every one of them. But, in reflecting on this statement just a few days after Remembrance Day, all of us who have spoken in this debate have made the following point about the terrible events of 11 September 2001, nine years and a couple of months ago. When those events occurred, the world community had a choice: to do something or to do nothing. The Taliban and alQaeda, which had wrought so much damage, in bringing in a new form and reign of terror had signalled that their ultimate aim was to carry out more September 11s, perhaps in different MAIN COMMITTEE",253,Ministerial Statements
295,Mr Anthony Smith (Casey) (5.13 Pm),"I welcome the opportunity to speak on thisforms. Their ultimate aim was nothing short of the destruction of the values and the freedoms we hold so dear. At that point in time, our country and other countries made a commitment. A lot has been said in the public arena and in the debate on this statement about the difficulty of engagement in Afghanistan. The previous speaker very eloquently ran through some of the history, and most of us are very familiar with the history and difficulty of engagement in Afghanistan. The point I would like to make is that at the time that we, the United States and the other allied countries commenced the engagement, no-one stated otherwise-there was no voice saying that the engagement would be short or easy. Everyone knew the history and the difficulty, but also the importance, of the task. In fact, I took the trouble to look back on some of the contributions that the then Prime Minister, the then Leader of the Opposition and other senior frontbenchers on both sides made back in 2001 and 2002, and each side of politics made that point. It is natural to compare the length and difficulty of this commitment with that of conventional wars that have occurred in the last century. The Leader of the Opposition pointed out that, World War II lasting six years, the length of the engagement has now been, obviously, 1½ times that of World War II. But it was known that that would be the case, and the fact that it was known and recognised went to the strength of the commitment and the purpose and necessity of the action. In his recent book, Tony Blair makes this point very eloquently. I was reading this recently. He says that the goal was not simply to remove the Taliban but to replace them with a democracy to rebuild the country. This was not just a matter of idealism; it was also about understanding why Afghanistan had become a failed state, why it had become a breeding ground for terror and why it had descended into this horrible cruel mix of anarchy and despotism. Like it or not, from then on we were in the business of nation building. I mention that because there is another world leader, a critical one at the time, who recognised exactly what was at stake. For those who think we should not be engaged in Afghanistan, the absolute point they need to confront is this: what is the alternative? The member for Kingston, the previous speaker on the other side, made this point. Some have said we should replace military action just with aid, as if aid can somehow be delivered in a country which would surely and quickly descend to the sort of place it was 9½ years ago. Those people need to state how they think this terrible scourge of terrorism can be dealt with. In our hearts what we know is that September 11 was a beginning, in one sense, of what al-Qaeda wants to wreak on a much larger scale. In fact, if we look back, things had begun before September 11-a long time before. Think back to the first bombing of the World Trade Centre. I mentioned earlier our natural inclination to measure conflicts in periods of time that we have been conditioned to understand, through the history that has been taught to us and through conflicts that have occurred during our own lifetime. The great difference, as has been pointed out, is that we were then engaged with one nation; the conflict at hand is not a conflict between nations with borders, it is not a conflict about the sorts of things we have seen in previous conflicts, and it is going to be at so many levels a long battle. By that I do not just mean the physical military action in Afghanistan. The very freedoms that we cherish are at stake. To have confronted the reality of September 11 and done nothing was never an option. Similarly, to know what the consequences are of premature withdrawal means that there is no option. Our Australian troops are doing good work. It is a long and difficult process and MAIN COMMITTEE at the end of it we want to see a better Afghanistan and, importantly, we want to see those roots of terrorism stamped out so that not just Australians but people around the world have this threat removed. Ms VAMVAKINOU (Calwell) (5.25 pm)-It is a pleasure to be participating in this very important debate on Australia’s commitment to the war in Afghanistan. It is a debate that is taking place in the ninth year of our involvement, and I think we can say that it is a war that Australians generally appear to have concerns about and may no longer support. Public support for the war has changed over the course of the last nine years and I do believe that a great number of Australians now are not supportive of Australian military involvement in Afghanistan. It is on behalf of those people, many of whom are my constituents, that I wish to make my contribution here today. We have heard a lot about Afghanistan from many speakers, and many great contributions have been made. Afghanistan finds itself at the epicentre of a global paradigm which speaks constantly to us all of national security, of Islamist terrorism and of the war on terror. This is a somewhat narrow perspective and it has dramatic human consequences. These consequences very much include the loss of Australian and Afghan lives and the mass displacement of people seeking refuge. Ironically, in my own electorate some 150 young unaccompanied Afghani minors are currently being accommodated in the Melbourne immigration transit accommodation centre in Broadmeadows. So the reality of displacement is very much in my own electorate and in our neighbourhood. It is clear for us all to see and to try to understand. The prognosis for resolution in relation to the war in Afghanistan has been assessed. It is often referred to as protracted and is often also considered to be a military success, but from time to time it appears to be described as outright hopeless. As I said, most Australians, including many of my constituents, are asking very pertinent questions. They ask me often and they have certainly been asking me over the course of the last nine years. The obvious question is: what is the war in Afghanistan all about? They want to know where it is leading and what the cost is of our continued involvement-not only to Australia but to the people of Afghanistan, to the region and to the US and all of our allies. In her speech to the House, the Prime Minister did answer some of these questions. She pointed in particular to two very vital national interests that drive Australian involvement in Afghanistan. The first is to make sure that Afghanistan does not continue to be a haven for terrorists. The second, most emphatically, is that we are there to stand firmly by our alliance commitments to the United States. The Prime Minister also went on to make it clear that we would not abandon Afghanistan and that we will be engaged throughout this decade at least. I know that that has resonated with a lot of the public, particularly with a lot of people in my electorate. So the war appears to be a long way from being over and, despite little progress, it also appears that we intend to stay the course-that is another phrase that is very often used and linked to what we are doing in Afghanistan: ‘We intend to stay the course.’ A lot of people do not fully understand what that course is. In 2003 I said in this chamber regarding the Howard government’s decision to commit Australia to war in Iraq: I am a representative who cares about the reason our country went to war. MAIN COMMITTEE I also recall addressing an antiwar rally in Melbourne where over a quarter of a million Melburnians marched against the war in Iraq. The rally in Melbourne was part of a weekend of mass international protests which saw tens of millions of people out on the streets in over 600 cities and towns across the world. At that time, the war in Afghanistan was seen as different. The attacks on the twin towers on September 11 did cast a very violent narrative, and the almost immediate association of Osama bin Laden with these horrific acts catapulted Afghanistan to the forefront of a new and dangerous threat, a threat the world and we here in Australia were not familiar with. It was easier to support Australian involvement in Afghanistan because there was a strong and obvious correlation between the killings on September 11 and the man who has come to personify the face of Islamist terrorism. Iraq was a different proposition. There were questions about regime change, missing weapons of mass destruction and shifting geopolitical balances. Our involvement in Afghanistan seemed to have a nobler cause, especially so in light of the Bali bombings that so horrified our country and killed so many innocent Australians-young people who were just going about their business while on holidays. I think this debate therefore gives us the opportunity to take stock-and many members have done that in the course of their contribution-and to examine what has become of our Afghanistan mission: what progress have we made? What have we achieved? Have the original objectives in going to war been met? In short, I think they have not been met: bin Laden has not been captured; al-Qaeda has not been eradicated but has, rather, been pushed into Pakistan, relocated but not defeated; stability and peace have not come to the people of Afghanistan or the region; and the allied troops are no closer today to resolving this theatre of war than they were nine years ago. The renowned American journalist of Watergate fame, Bob Woodward, in his recent book Obama’s Wars, describes Afghanistan as a war bogged down with slow progress, almost no capacity to build a new nation and little or no prospect of victory. Indeed, the commander of US and NATO forces in Afghanistan, General David Petraeus, made this concerning assessment: … I don’t think you win this war; I think you keep fighting. It’s a little bit like Iraq… This is the kind of fight we’re in for the rest of our lives and probably our kids’ lives. Concurring with this assessment of the military situation on the ground, Australia’s Brigadier Mark Smethurst, one of our top combat soldiers, said that our troops are overwhelmed and unable to defeat the Taliban. This prognosis is devastating, I think, and does not offer much hope for progress. It is therefore only logical that, given those cited assessments, we carefully and truthfully re-examine our commitment to this war-a commitment that places the lives of Australian soldiers and Afghani civilians at risk and a commitment on which we have failed to make decisive and definitive progress. This quagmire is neither new nor unique. Putting aside renditions of George Santayana’s altered phrase that ‘those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it’, we have been down this road before. I want to reflect on the words of Arthur Calwell, who stood against another infamous war that was both protracted and unwinnable, a war waged on the pretext of national security, the need to stop the spread of communism-those of you who MAIN COMMITTEE have studied this war will recall the so-called domino theory and the yellow and red ‘perils’and our commitment to the US alliance. I am referring of course to the Vietnam War. In May of 1965, Arthur Calwell, leader of the Australian Labor Party, long before Australian popular opinion morphed into a groundswell of antiwar protestation, stated: Our men will be fighting the largely indigenous Viet Cong in their own home territory. They will be fighting in the midst of a largely indifferent, if not resentful, and frightened population. They will be fighting at the request of, and in support, and, presumably, under the direction of an unstable, inefficient, partially corrupt military regime which lacks even the semblance of being, or becoming, democratically based. A debate similar to this one took place in this country at that time. Our government’s commitment was espoused with the catch cry ‘All the way with LBJ’. It would, however, take Australian governments another decade to realise that Arthur Calwell’s assessment was indeed correct and that, perhaps, LBJ’s way was the wrong way. I think Calwell’s words ring true today, as they did over 45 years ago. Afghanistan and Iraq have become the 21st century’s Vietnam for both the US and for us here in Australia. I do not intend, in expressing my views, to disrespect or devalue the sacrifices and the courage of our young Australians serving in Afghanistan. Rather, my objection to the war and our involvement goes to its purpose, the prospects of the mission itself and our ethical responsibility to those we send to fight in our name. I was here when the member for Makin made mention of the approaches-indeed, the pleas-that he has received from the mother of an Australian soldier, a mother who wants the member for Makin to support our soldiers being brought back home. We need to be conscious of that anxiety and concern here in Australia. As we mourn the death of our fallen soldiers, we have to also reflect on the countless deaths of Afghani men, women and children who through no fault of their own have become the casualties and victims of a war they have no say in. Given the course, the prospects and the cost of our engagement, I believe it is now time for Australia to withdraw its troops, or to disengage from its military involvement in Afghanistan. The objective is to end terrorism by removing al-Qaeda and, sadly but clearly, together with our American allies, we have not achieved that objective. It is now clear that we cannot meet these objectives through a continuation of war. It is my view that peace talks working towards a political settlement should commence almost immediately amongst the Afghani parties, and that includes the Taliban, mediated and facilitated by the United Nations. If this entails power-sharing with the Taliban, such a proposition should not be viewed as fanciful and intractable, but it should be seen as the way forward. I want to refer to comments made by Professor Amin Saikal, who is the director of the ANU Centre for Arab and Islamic Studies. He recently wrote, and it is very important because he is right: The problem of Afghanistan is not that the US and its NATO and non-NATO allies have not deployed enough forces and firepower. They have. … … … The problem of Afghanistan is largely political, economic and regional. The corrupt, dysfunctional and nepotistic nature of the government of President Hamid Karzai is well documented. MAIN COMMITTEE Professor Saikal is correct in his assessment. We cannot resolve this issue by staying only on a military course. Dialogue and negotiation for political solutions are now the only viable option. And, again, as Professor Saikal notes: It is now absolutely imperative for the UN Secretary-General to convene a regional conference with all five permanent members of the UN Security Council to establish such an agreement. We will need to come to the realisation that we cannot choose who the Afghan people put forward to make peace. We must discard the idea that, if the Taliban were not there, it would be easier to manage Afghanistan’s transition into a peaceful and stable state. After nearly a decade of being consumed by the monologue of war on terror, it is time that we commenced a dialogue on the politics of withdrawal: how to peacefully and effectively disengage our military forces from Iraq and Afghanistan. As Australia we should-indeed, it constitutes our moral imperative-continue our commitment to the Afghani people through our technical and even our international aid programs. By calling for an end to the military engagement, we are not abandoning the people of Afghanistan. Instead, by supporting a peace process through dialogue towards a political settlement rather than a military solution, I believe we are providing the only real hope for peace, stability and prosperity for the people of Afghanistan, for the region, for us here in Australia and for all of the international parties involved in this conflict. Ms GAMBARO (Brisbane) (5.38 pm)-Australia’s contribution to the war on terror is absolute: the need to restore sovereignty to the people in Afghanistan, to promote universal values of liberty and democracy, and to ensure the security of Australia and our allies is paramount. There is a simple fact that those who do not support our troops in Afghanistan do not understand-that is, the war on terror is real, it is happening now and, if we do not take a stand, it will continue to haunt the world for generations to come. Let us not forget the same totalitarian Islamist movement we are fighting in Afghanistan was responsible for the deaths of 3,000 people in New York on 11 September 2001, 202 people in the Bali bombings in 2002, 191 people in Madrid in 2004 and 56 people in London in July 2005. It is sad to say, but the list goes on and on. I say ‘people’, because it is not only the victims who have been affected; it is also their partners, their parents, their brothers, their sisters, their friends and their extended families-and, in some cases, children have had to deal with the loss of a loved one from the atrocity that is a terrorist attack. I am full of pride to share the site of the Enoggera Barracks with the member for Ryan, Jane Prentice. Of the 1,550 troops that Australia has committed to Afghanistan, I am honoured to announce that the 6RAR Battalion is a significant contributor to the war effort. To the men and women of the 6RAR Battalion who are over in Afghanistan, who are about to go or who have been: as a nation we are privileged to have such fine representatives of a great nation furthering freedom and liberty across the world. The Mentoring Task Force is led by the 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, most of whom call Brisbane home. Involved in the Mentoring Task Force are several Brisbane based units, including the 2nd Combat Engineer Regiment, the 1st Field Regiment and of course the 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment. Australia’s military contribution to the International Security Assistance Force includes around 1,550 Australian Defence Force personnel, who are deployed within Afghanistan. Of these, 1,241 are deployed in Oruzgan province and around 300 in Kabul, Kandahar and elsewhere in Afghanistan. I am proud that Brigadier McLachlan MAIN COMMITTEE at the Enoggera Barracks and the 6RAR are doing their best in leading the mentoring of the Afghan National Army and Afghan National Police. As an international community we need to promote the same freedom and democracy that we celebrate here in Australia. In the case of Afghanistan, we need to promote modernisation at the expense of extremism. We need to develop an environment where societies celebrate diversity through tolerance for everyone with the exception of the intolerant. This simply cannot be accepted in Afghanistan and anywhere in the Middle East or throughout the world with the Taliban and al-Qaeda active and recruiting people to their unjust and immoral cause. We simply cannot miss the opportunity to stand for liberty and freedom simply because the journey is a long and tough one. As a nation we simply cannot allow the threat of terrorism to fester and the oppression of Islamic fundamentalism to continue indefinitely. The recent AUSMIN talks are a sign that Australia is here for the long haul and that we will only withdraw when certain conditions are met and not on any given time frame. I was glad to see that the US Secretary of State and US Secretary of Defence, in Hillary Clinton and Robert Gates, share the same view as we have here in Australia. CanI also add that President Obama has recently recommitted to staying the course in Afghanistan. These recent comments by our American allies are an important reaffirmation of the US-Australia alliance by both countries. The Taliban treatment of women and ethnic minorities is one of the worse, if not the worse, examples of Islamic fundamentalism the world has ever seen. There are positive signs appearing since the ISAF invasion in 2001. Under Taliban rule, Afghan women and girls were not educated beyond the age of eight and were not permitted to work. As a consequence of this, many of the teachers, being women, have now been forced to leave their jobs and the schools have been shut down. Women were not allowed to go to the doctor without a male relative, resulting in many illnesses that women face going unreported and without medical treatment. In the Taliban-run Afghanistan, women were regularly beaten. They were stoned, flogged to death and had their limbs cut off. But it does not stop there. At the peak of this tyrannical Taliban rule, windows in houses were blackened on the off-chance that someone saw a woman inside. This sort of behaviour would certainly not be accepted in Australia. We would not tolerate this type of behaviour if it were committed by any country in our region. So there is no reason why we should accept it in Afghanistan. We can look at three important development indicators that prove my statements. The literacy rate for men is 49 per cent and for women it is 18 per cent. School attendance in Afghanistan for boys is 66 per cent, yet for girls it is 40 per cent. The differences are appalling. I am a Liberal because I believe in four fundamental freedoms: the freedom of the individual, the freedom of choice, the freedom to pursue excellence and the freedom to seek reward for effort. Under a totalitarian Islamic rule, none of these freedoms is achieved. This is another and just reason as to why we as a nation have committed troops to Afghanistan. In the defence of liberty we cannot allow these atrocities to continue or, at the worse, spread around the world in the form of sharia law, home-grown terrorism and transnational terrorist bodiesfor all of which Afghanistan and the Taliban are fundamental and ideological nuclei. To those people who wish to withdraw Australia’s military commitment to Afghanistan, I would like to make one important point and that is of the Spanish experience. In 2004 Spain was attacked by a terror cell associated with al-Qaeda. After that unfortunate and heinous incident, spurred by fundamental Islam, the government of Spain changed and the Spanish govMAIN COMMITTEE ernment started contemplating a withdrawal from the Middle East. But this did not change the fact that al-Qaeda was actively trying to continue to kill innocent, mainly Christian, civilians through terrorist bombings not only in Spain but throughout Europe. Australia’s role in Afghanistan is equal in importance to our other counterterrorism efforts in the region. We are currently involved in policing, training and enforcement with Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. Australia also engages with regional partners on intelligence sharing and gathering, through ASIO, ASIS and the AFP, and Australia is a major contributor to rebuilding efforts through AusAID. Let us not forget what terrorist groups are capable of. We must not allow a recurrence of the Bali terror attacks in Indonesia in 2002 when 202 people, including 88 Australians, were killed, or the Jimbaran Beach attacks in Bali in 2005 when 26 were killed, four of those being Australians, or the 2009 Marriott bombings in Indonesia, where seven were killed, including three more Australians, by fundamentalists that were linked to the Taliban. If as a nation we are serious about stopping these events, we must continue to support our military efforts. If we are willing to commit police and intelligence officers, why would we be unwilling to follow it though with troops on the ground in Afghanistan, which is the breeding ground and, more importantly, the training ground for international terrorism? Since 2001, Australia has committed nearly $750 million in development and reconstruction assistance to Afghanistan. As of the last budget and this financial year, the annual AusAID budget for Afghanistan is around $106 million, which is delivered in line with the development priorities of the Afghanistan government’s Afghanistan National Development Strategy and through the World Bank’s Afghanistan Reconstruction Fund. Australian aid is being used to support agriculture and rural development, the promotion of good governance, the protection of vulnerable populations and for the improvement of efficiency and spread of basic service delivery to the Afghani people. While the coalition supports these contributions, we need to ensure that they are done with absolute financial integrity through all recipients and to ensure that the maximum amount can get to the people in need and not be used to perpetuate needless bureaucracies, which is so often the case with aid funding. The idea that Australian troops or the ISAF engagement as a whole is making the Afghanistan situation worse is simply fanciful and utter rubbish. An article in the Australian recently showed a snippet of the attitudes of the Afghani people in Oruzgan province, where the majority of the Australian troops were based. They gave unqualified support for the Australian efforts in the region. The article began by saying that Afghans in Oruzgan province had painted a bleak picture if the Australian military contingent were to pull out and not be replaced. Most agreed that schools would close, people would retreat to their homes and major security gains made in the past few years would evaporate. The locals are supporting our efforts to train their police force and the locals are enjoying the new-found liberty and security that our Aussie soldiers are able to afford the Afghan people. If we leave Afghanistan now, the situation will simply go back to where it was before we started. The girls schools will close, women will once again have no more rights, democracy will be dead and the community at large will be scared to leave their homes because of the sheer brutality of the Taliban. Australia’s deployment in Afghanistan needs our 100 per cent support. We owe it to the Afghans, who are relying on our support for their own security; we owe it to the international community in the support of liberty and security and the spread of MAIN COMMITTEE democracy; and we owe it to all the Australians who have died in terrorist attacks at the hands of the Taliban, al-Qaeda and its networks. Most importantly, we owe it to the 21 diggers who lost their lives-three of whom were from the Brisbane area-and their families to finish what we are now so close to achieving. At a moving ceremony at ANZAC Place in Brisbane on Remembrance Day, the RSL Queensland President Doug Formby acknowledged their great service to our great country. To those families in the Brisbane electorate who did lose loved ones, you have made the ultimate sacrifice and we are eternally grateful for your sacrifice. Your husbands, sons, brothers and fathers will not be forgotten. Change and Energy Efficiency) (5.51 pm)-I commend those before me who have made a thoughtful and considered contribution to what is a complex and difficult debate. I welcome this debate. Any engagement that puts the lives of Australian troops at risk deserves to be discussed openly and responsibly in this place. My focus today will be on military justice, but I will say this about Australia’s role in Afghanistan: we cannot let Afghanistan once again become a safe haven for terrorists who want to perpetrate attacks on Australia or our allies. We all remember the September 11 attacks on New York, Washington and the Pentagon which brought the world’s attention to al-Qaeda’s activities in Afghanistan. We all remember the 202 people who were killed, including 88 Australians, in the Bali bombing of 2002. We all remember the coordinated suicide bombings on London’s transport system on 7 July 2005. Each of these has been linked to al-Qaeda and activities in Afghanistan and each of these caused mass fatalities, including the loss of Australian lives. The decision by the former Prime Minister John Howard to assist the United States and our allies to fight the Taliban in Afghanistan following the September 11 attacks was the right one. Unlike the war in Iraq, the decision to send Australian troops to fight in Afghanistan was bipartisan and done with a mandate from the United Nations Security Council. Ours is a challenging and difficult mission in Afghanistan: protect the civilian population, train and equip the Afghan national security forces and improve governance and socioeconomic development in an emerging democracy. We intervened in Afghanistan, and remain there, because it is important to defend ourselves and our values. In World War II we stood and fought beside our allies to defend the values of freedom, respect for the law, fairness and democracy. The defence of these values is why we went to war in Afghanistan nine years ago and our commitment to these values is why we are still there today. These values are worth fighting for both abroad and at home. To recognise that we are fighting to defend these values is to recognise that we must also uphold these values. There is an onus on us, as a nation which has repeatedly stood up and fought for fairness, equality and the rule of law, to enhance respect for these values in our own country and respect for our people. That leads me to the recent public discussion over the military justice system and the charges laid against three Australian soldiers while serving in Afghanistan. I do not know if these three men, one of whom is facing a charge of manslaughter, are guilty or not. IfI did have an opinion it would be inappropriate for me to make comments that might tend to influence the outcome of proceedings against these soldiers. It is the same situation for the Leader of the Opposition. But that did not stop him from shouting from the rooftops his disapproval of the military justice process, trying to score cheap political points by accusing this government of letting down the troops by allowing the MAIN COMMITTEE",256,Ministerial Statements
296,Mr Dreyfus (Isaacs,"Cabinet Secretary and Parliamentary Secretary for Climateprocess of military justice to take its course. Just as it is completely inappropriate for any member of this place to prejudice a criminal or civil trial by commenting on it publicly, it is inappropriate to go on Sydney radio and make the suggestion that by being put to trial these three soldiers are being-and I quote the words of the Leader of the Opposition-‘thrown to the wolves’. The current system of military prosecution was set up under the Howard government. Its independence is paramount. The process must be free from political interference and it must focus entirely on the law and on the facts of the case, just like any other legal process in this country. That is crucial to confidence in the system and fairness for our men and women in uniform. Yet the independent Director of Military Prosecutions, Brigadier Lyn McDade, has been under personal attack from some areas of the media, with derogatory references to her gender and her 23 years of service to military justice. How did the opposition leader respond to these attacks on Brigadier McDade, who was appointed, I would remind the House, by the Howard government? The opposition leader responded by staying silent when a talk show host referred to the brigadier’s ‘so-called’ independence. The opposition leader responded by creating a presumption that all soldiers have done the right thing. The opposition leader responded by falsely suggesting that the government had failed to assist in the defence of these soldiers-in short, he responded by involving himself in what should be an independent and apolitical process. This kind of rhetoric from the opposition leader is irresponsible and is yet another example of why he is unfit to be this nation’s Prime Minister. The old adage that war is hell is true. It is ugly and dangerous, and I have the utmost respect for anyone who is willing to serve Australia in a war zone. But there are rules of engagement in war, and it is vital that the Australian defence forces conduct their activity within those rules. It is that insistence on compliance with the rules of engagement and that insistence on proper conduct even in the fog of war which differentiates us from our enemies. It is also worth pointing out that the rules of engagement for Australian troops in Afghanistan are consistent with the rules of engagement that the US forces are bound by. For Senator Johnston, the opposition defence spokesman, to say that he is disappointed that charges have been laid in this case and that this case going to trial is ‘counterproductive to our national interest’ smacks simply of political opportunism, especially when just two years ago Senator Johnston said in committee about Australia’s military justice system: These statutory officers have to be completely independent … But now Senator Johnston is willing to compromise the independence of our military justice system by publicly commenting on whether a case should be going to trial or not. This of course is not the first time that Senator Johnston has gone off on an irresponsible tangent when it comes to Afghanistan. A few months ago, he publicly said that Australian troops were poorly equipped and that more troops were needed. This stance was inconsistent with the expert military advice from the Chief of the Defence Force and senior officers of the ADF, and it was quickly recanted once the opposition leader went to Afghanistan and spoke to our troops on the ground. We have an opposition leader and an opposition defence spokesman who seem determined to make unhelpful and irresponsible comments about a case which they have no particular responsibility for and no particular knowledge of-a case which is going through an independent process that was set up when the opposition leader was sitting at the cabinet table MAIN COMMITTEE and, indeed, is being presided over by a senior officer who was appointed by the former government. Neil James, the Executive Director of the Australian Defence Association, says that the fair trial these commandos deserve could be prejudiced by comments being made in the public domain. He understands that no-one in a position of influence-politicians, senior military officers or talkback radio hosts-should interfere in that independent process. One would hope that the opposition leader, of all people, understands why. To have a strong and credible military, you need a strong, credible and independent military justice system. We are fortunate to have both in Australia. I conclude by paying tribute to the 21 brave Australian men who have given their lives on duty in Afghanistan. Their loss looms large in the hearts and minds of their families and friends, and indeed of all of us, and is a constant reminder to Australians of the ultimate sacrifice they have made to defend our freedom and our way of life. flects a huge change in our world view. With the possible exception of the Russian invasion of 1979, for most Australians Afghanistan fell into the category of those faraway lands about which we knew little and cared perhaps even less. When the Russians departed, effectively defeated nine years later, the country sank back into obscurity-an obscurity broken only by occasional cries of outrage at the activities of the fundamentalist Taliban regime. Even then there were those both within and outside Afghanistan who argued that, whatever their faults, the Taliban were providing some measure of stability in what had become a ruined and lawless country. However, any tolerance of the Taliban and any measure of obscurity vanished with the tragic and barbaric events of 9-11. Afghanistan was revealed as the source of an evil-plotted and enacted on a scale that we had not seen before-that changed our perception of national security and national interest. It questioned our commitment to defending fundamental values and challenged us to act on our beliefs and help turn an impoverished and divided country into a stable, democratic nation. BeforeI turn to those issues, I will say that it is above all the sacrifice made by our fellow Australians that has brought Afghanistan to the forefront of our national consciousness. Twenty-one Australians have been killed in action and 155 have been wounded. I wish to pay tribute to them all, but in particular I mention Sergeant Matthew Locke from my electorate of Cowper. Sergeant Locke from Bellingen joined the Army in 1991 and was posted to the 5th/7th Battalion, the Royal Australian Regiment, after he completed his training. In November 1997, he completed the Special Air Service selection course and eventually joined the 3rd SAS Squadron. He had a distinguished career, including service in East Timor and Iraq, and was awarded the Medal for Gallantry while serving in Afghanistan in 2006 for his actions when his patrol came under sustained attack from anti-coalition forces. I quote from the citation: The courageous and gallant actions of Sergeant Locke were instrumental in regaining the initiative from the Anti-Coalition Militia and allowing the successful exfiltration of the patrol on foot prior to first light the next day. Sergeant Locke’s actions of gallantry whilst under enemy fire in extremely hazardous circumstances, displayed courage of the highest order and is in keeping with the finest traditions of Special Operations Command-Australia, the Australian Army and the Australian Defence Force. MAIN COMMITTEE",264,Ministerial Statements
297,Mr Hartsuyker (Cowper) (6.00 Pm),"The fact that we are holding this debate reHe was fatally wounded in October 2007 by small-arms fire while on patrol in Oruzgan province in an operation to clear Taliban from an area around Tarin Kowt, where many Australian troops are based. I was privileged to be able to attend his memorial service in Bellingen. Throughout this debate we should remember that, when we talk about national security, national reconstruction, defending democracy, denying terrorists a safe haven, and many other abstract concepts, this is what it comes down to: a brave and committed soldier putting his life at risk in a foreign land, a memorial service in a small country town and a grieving family. Matthew Locke was just one of the 21 servicemen who have died. There is much in the history of Afghanistan of which we should take note in an attempt to avoid previous mistakes, but we should also look into our own history and ensure that it is not just the dead we honour but the 155 wounded as well. We require a longer and more difficult commitment, but that is the very least we can do. Everything we say during this debate should be seen in the light of what we are asking our service men and women to do and in the light of the sacrifice that they may have to make. This is no academic exercise divorced from reality and dignified by the use of words like strategy, geopolitics and democratisation; for our service men and women on the ground in Afghanistan it is a reality, and it can be nasty, brutish and fatal. I mentioned the history of Afghanistan in the context of our avoiding previous mistakesbut, to be more precise, its recent history is instructive. It has been invaded three times not for the resources it has but for where it is. In the 19th century, the British saw the country as a back door to British India through which the Russians would march if allowed. In 1839 the British dispatched a force of 21,000 men which succeeded in controlling enough of the country to install their own man on the throne in Kabul. The British withdrew the bulk of their force, leaving an occupying army of some 8,000 soldiers who were soon after allowed to bring their families to join them. Resentment grew against the propped-up puppet government and the presence of foreign troops and their families, and a revolt broke out in 1841, leading to what the British thought was a negotiated retreat and safe conduct for the soldiers and their dependents. The retreat started in 1842, and in the depths of the Afghan winter the British were systematically slaughtered as they struggled through the snow. Only one man, Dr William Brydon, made it back to British territory. In 1878 the British tried to send a diplomatic mission to Kabul in response to a similar move by the Russians. They were turned back at the Khyber Pass-through which many of the coalition forces’ supplies travel today-and their response was to summon an invasion force of some 40,000 soldiers, nearly twice the size of the previous expedition. Once again the British succeeded in gaining control of most of the country, and they established a British presence in Kabul. All was well until September 1879, when all of the members of the British mission were killed in a rebellion. The rebellion was put down, but this time the British, learning from their mistakes, withdrew while they still had control and retained only two passes and oversight of Afghanistan’s foreign policy for their pains. In a twist of history, it was again geopolitical concerns that led to the Russian invasion in 1979, ostensibly at the request of the then communist government in Kabul. The Russian forces rapidly became bogged down in a vicious guerrilla war in which they controlled only MAIN COMMITTEE the main towns and connecting roads, and they eventually completed a withdrawal in February 1989. Around 15,000 Soviet soldiers and KGB operatives lost their lives; estimates of the Afghan dead range from 100,000 to two million people. Five million people fled to neighbouring countries and two million were displaced within the country. In the 1980s, half the refugees in the world were from Afghanistan. In the midst of all this misery Afghanistan became one of the most heavily land-mined nations on earth. Thousands of its citizens were crippled or killed, and any attempt to restore subsistence farming to previous levels was seriously limited. So what did we learn? That the Afghans have no love of foreign forces on their soil, whatever their reasons for being there; that the country is extremely difficult to control and supply; that the three major invasions could be regarded ultimately as failures; that inevitably the country’s professional classes would have been among the first people to leave; that we are dealing with a country in which tribal and family loyalties are far more relevant than dealings with any form of regional or national administration; and that we are dealing with a country that was shattered and brutalised even before the military actions of 2001. A report on ABC Radio National noted recently that in Oruzgan province, where most of our forces are based in their training in rebuilding roles, the illiteracy rate is 95 per cent. How do you rebuild a police force, a health service and an education system when only one person in 20 can read and write? How can you rebuild on this scale while fighting a guerrilla war? The scale of the task is tremendous, and it is good at this juncture to remind ourselves why we are there. To my mind, arguing the case for our presence in Afghanistan is the easiest part of the whole debate. We are there because 111 Australians lost their lives in terrorist attacks linked in some way to the freedom that terrorists enjoyed in Afghanistan. It is not that we are seeking revenge, but we want those responsible brought to justice and to deny another opportunity to those who would harm us. We are there because we have a treaty obligation to other countries, notably the United States, and because we as a country meet our obligations. We are there because it is simply the right thing to try to rescue and restore a failed, broken state and provide the Afghans with the things that we take for granted: adequate food, water, shelter, health services, education and freedom from fear. I refer to the government’s national security statement, which aims to establish freedom from attack or threat of attack. The premise behind the action in Afghanistan supported by the United Nations resolution was that the Taliban regime allowed al-Qaeda to operate in the country and to use it as a training base. Most security analysts believe that al-Qaeda has been seriously weakened by the denial of its base and the fact that its leaders have been forced into hiding, probably in tribal areas of Pakistan. On the other hand, it is obvious that the support for the ideology of al-Qaeda remains strong and widespread, and if a weak or fundamentalist regime were in charge in Kabul there would be little doubt that the movement would quickly re-establish itself. Would it be a threat to Australia? Of course. Australians were killed in New York. Australians were killed in Bali and an Australian was killed in Mumbai. Slaughter aside, a resurgent al-Qaeda or its successor would have a measurable effect on international travel, commerce, communications, merely by its presence, let alone by any attacks it was to mount. There is no way that Australian citizens or Australia’s interests would remain untouched. As I said, we also have treaty obligations. In the case of ANZUS, one which we must honour, failure to do so would be morally reprehensible, would damage Australia’s standing and, MAIN COMMITTEE crucially, would send a signal to our enemies that we are not united. One of the principles of our national security is to support the UN in its efforts to promote rules based international order. This is an important reason for staying the course in Afghanistan. This continuing conflict is not just about preventing loss of life; it is about values. It is about Australians standing up and saying that mass murder is evil and must be prevented. It is about standing up for tolerance, free speech and basic human rights, not least in Afghanistan itself. Put simply: to be part of an international presence in Afghanistan is the morally right thing to do; putting aside all strategic and political considerations, it is the right thing to do. Of course doing the right thing is not always easy. We are trying to build a nation that had little to start with and has lost what it had. Many Afghans have fled. Many of those who remain have been brutalised by violence, poverty and insecurity. There is no civic structure as we know it. Our efforts in nation building will be undermined until the Taliban and other forces are finally defeated or, more likely, persuaded to become part of the process. That may seem far-fetched, but one only has to look at Northern Ireland to see where such a process can lead and the benefits that it can bring. I note the Prime Minister’s statement that we will be in Afghanistan for at least a decade. I believe that this is a realistic assessment and that we should stiffen our resolve, support our troops in any way we can and get the job done. Only when the Afghan people as a whole feel they have something to lose, only when they feel they have an investment in their own country, will we have solved the problems of Afghanistan. Prime Minister’s statement in the House on Afghanistan. We as Australians know that the vast majority of us do not and would never support terrorism. We would never subscribe to the notion that there is somehow justification for taking people’s lives for a particular cause or belief. Making a statement or a point by killing and maiming is simply abhorrent and totally unacceptable. On the other hand, many Australians do not like the idea of going to war whatever the justification, and in a sense this is what this whole debate is about. We know the threat of terrorism in this country is very real. Only recently more plots to cause widespread death, injury, damage and public chaos in Australia have been uncovered by our intelligence and security agencies. Without any major events having occurred in Australia, it is sometimes difficult for us to imagine the scenario of a terrorist attack, but it only takes us a little reading through the details of plots that have been so far uncovered to realise how close we have already come to witnessing nightmarish scenes unfolding on our own soil. It is clear that, among many Australians, there is difficulty accepting that Australia’s presence in Afghanistan is actually making a difference. There are doubts about our role in fighting terrorism on foreign soil. There are questions about whether, indeed, the point of us being there is to help stop terrorists. I have no doubt that Australia’s military presence in Afghanistan is making a difference and is helping to weaken the network of terrorists that use that country as a base. We will never forget September 11 and the more than 3,000 people who died in the alQaeda attacks on the World Trade Centre. And it did not end on September 11. Since 2001, some 100 Australians have been killed in attacks by extremists overseas. Amongst those, 88 Australians were killed in Bali in the first bombing there and four in the second in 2005, and MAIN COMMITTEE",266,Ministerial Statements
298,Mr Craig Thomson (Dobell) (6.13 Pm),"It is an honour to speak in response to theour embassy has been bombed in Jakarta. In each of these cases, the terrorist groups involved had links to Afghanistan. Australia went to Afghanistan to make sure it never again would be a safe haven for alQaeda. We went with our friends and allies, as part of the international community. We went with the support of the United Nations. As a result of our efforts in this war, al-Qaeda’s core leadership has been dealt a severe blow. Some have been killed, others captured, many have been forced into hiding and all have been forced onto the defensive. But al-Qaeda remains a resilient and persistent network. Our successes against it in Afghanistan are only part of our effort against terrorism. We are working to counter the rise of affiliated groups in new areas such as Somalia and Yemen, and the violent extremist terrorist groups in Pakistan. I wanted to know what people in my electorate thought about Afghanistan, to prepare myself for this debate, and what they thought about Australia’s involvement in the conflict. To this end, we did some phone surveys of members in my constituency. We also went to shopping centres and I used Facebook to ask people their views on Australia’s involvement in Afghanistan. The response was mixed. Many do not agree with our troops being there. Some believe that, initially, Australia did the right thing by becoming involved but that the time to withdraw is now. Others think we should remain in Afghanistan until our objectives are achieved. We asked when or in what circumstances the respondents believed it was legitimate for Australia to be involved in international conflicts. Geoff said: ‘All the time.’ Deborah said we should be involved unless it involved harm to Australians. ‘If our country is threatened,’ was the reply that Christine gave. And James said that he believed that commitments to defence agreements must be upheld. Others in our survey were a bit more blunt. Ralph thought we should not, as he put it, ‘blindly’ support an ally and that we should be involved only when our national security was directly at stake. Warren and Deborah said we should be involved only if it affected Australia directly, and Rex said, ‘Not at all.’ We also asked the constituents what they thought about the Afghanistan conflict generally. A significant number of them said they believed that international intervention there had achieved little or nothing. Some thought there would never be peace in Afghanistan. Others thought Australia had done enough and should leave the Afghan people to resolve the conflict themselves. Judith told me that she thought Australia’s involvement in Afghanistan was probably justified initially but that the United Nations should do more to end the conflict. Mervyn believed we were only there because the United States was. Robert, himself an ex-serviceman, said the Afghanistan situation was ‘very sad’ but we should bring our troops home. I also asked, as I said, my friends on Facebook-of which there were many-what their responses were to our involvement in Afghanistan. Julie thought there would always be fighting over there and that nothing would change no matter what the allied forces did. Cale’s view was that Australia should have had a bigger task force to scrutinise the situation in Afghanistan and check out why we would go to war there in the first place. He also said: ‘We can’t pull out without the system we put in place collapsing. But if we stay there all we are doing is spreading a growing dislike of the Western world.’ He went on to say: ‘If we are to stay there over the next 10 years, make it constructive: build schools, put in water pumps-that kind of thing. But, most of all, try to understand the people. If you win over their hearts this whole mission might not be a waste of time.’ MAIN COMMITTEE Teresa wanted to relay the simple message that she was grateful for the diggers’ service in Afghanistan. Teresa said she had many American friends who were serving, including one now attending officer training school in the United States, and more than likely will serve another tour there. ‘It is dangerous work and I am very grateful,’ were Teresa’s words. As we can see, the Afghan conflict is in the minds of most Australians. There are many and varying views about why we should or should not be in Afghanistan. It is fair to say that there is widespread feeling in my electorate on the Central Coast that Australia’s involvement should at least be fully reviewed-and that is what this debate, in some ways, is about. This is understandable, given the length of time and the cost of the international military presence. The allied forces have been in Afghanistan a long time-nine years. But we have to remember that if the insurgency in Afghanistan were to succeed, helped significantly by a withdrawal of the international community, then Afghanistan could, once again, become a safe haven for terrorists. We must always think about al-Qaeda’s ability to recruit, indoctrinate, train, plan, finance and conspire to kill. They and their partners are very good at all of those things. We cannot afford to drop our guard when it comes to this very fearful and ruthless organisation. I have very little doubt that withdrawal of the allied presence in Afghanistan would present the opportunity for resurgence in al-Qaeda’s influence, and the propaganda victory for terrorists worldwide would be enormous. Our troops have a clear goal and so do our partners in the international community: to deny terrorist networks a safe haven in Afghanistan. Let us have a quick look at what has been achieved so far. Removing the Taliban government in 2001 and pursuing al-Qaeda in the years since has made a crucial difference in preventing terrorist attacks. From 2001 to mid2006, US and coalition forces and Afghani troops fought relatively low levels of insurgent violence. The international force in Afghanistan was focused on a stabilisation mission and there were no Australian units deployed in Afghanistan between December 2002 and September 2005. Through this period, few would now argue, US and international attention turned heavily to Iraq. Australia’s substantial military involvement in Afghanistan resumed when the Special Forces Task Force was redeployed there for 12 months from September 2005 in support of international efforts to target key insurgents. Violence increased further in mid-2006, particularly in the east and the south. Due to significant intimidation and the absence of effective governance in many rural areas, some Afghanis turned to the Taliban at this time. The mission moved to a counterinsurgency focus. Australia’s contribution increased from October 2008 as we took a growing role in training and mentoring in the southern Afghanistan province of Oruzgan. However, the international counterinsurgency mission was not adequately resourced until 2009. In December 2009 President Obama announced a revised strategy for Afghanistan and a surge of 30,000 US troops. NATO has contributed more; so has Australia. Australia has two vital national interests in Afghanistan: (1) to make sure that Afghanistan never again becomes a safe haven for terrorists, a place where attacks on us and our allies begin, and (2) to stand firmly by our alliance commitment to the United States, formally invoked following the attacks on New York and Washington in 2001. The overarching goal of the new strategy is to enable transition-that is, to prepare the government of Afghanistan to MAIN COMMITTEE take lead responsibility for its own security-but our vital national interests in preventing Afghanistan being a safe haven for terrorists who attack us and in supporting our allies do not end with transition. Our aim is that the new international strategy sees a functioning Afghan state become able to assume responsibility for preventing the country from being a safe haven for terrorists. Australia’s key role in that mission-training and mentoring the 4th brigade of the Afghan National Army in Oruzgan-is expected to take two to four years, and President Karzai has said the Afghan government expects the transition process to be complete by the end of 2014. This means the Afghan government will take lead responsibility for security. The international community will remain engaged in Afghanistan beyond 2014, and Australia will remain engaged. There will still be a need for Australians in a supporting role. There will still be a role for training and other defence cooperation. The civilian-led aid and development effort will continue. And we will continue to promote Afghan-led reintegration of former insurgents who are willing to lay down their arms, turn their backs on terrorism and accept the Afghan constitution. Australia’s involvement in Afghanistan does make a difference. The government support the new international strategy and we have supported the surge. Australia has increased its troop contribution to Afghanistan by around 40 per cent in the past 18 months. We now have around 1,550 military personnel deployed in Afghanistan. Our military force is complemented by around 50 Australian civilians. Earlier this year we took over leadership of the Provincial Reconstruction Team in Oruzgan to spearhead our civilian efforts and increased our civilian commitment to Afghanistan by 50 per cent. In fact since 2001 we have committed over $740 million in development assistance to Afghanistan. The new international strategy is in place. The elements of the surge to support the strategy are now reaching full strength. Afghanistan is a war ravaged country that faces immense development challenges. While the challenges are huge, there are many tentative signs of progress to date. The Afghan National Security Forces are being mentored and trained. The Afghan National Army is becoming increasingly capable and is supporting coalition operations more effectively. Nearly 85 per cent of the army is now fully partnered with ISAF forces for operations in the field. Afghan forces are now in the lead in Kabul. The ability of the Afghan government to provide services to its people is being built. In primary education, enrolments have increased from one million in 2001 to approximately six million today, and some two million of these enrolments are girls-there were none in 2001. In basic health services, infant mortality decreased by 22 per cent between 2002 and 2008 and immunisation rates for children are now in the 70 to 90 per cent range. In vital economic infrastructure, almost 10,000 kilometres of road has been rehabilitated and 10 million Afghans now have access to telecommunications compared to only 20,000 in 2001. Australia will do everything in its power to ensure Afghanistan is never again a safe haven for terrorists. Like my constituents, I think many of us have mixed views about the war in Afghanistan, but what we can say is that, once we made that decision to go there, we could not simply abandon Afghanistan midway through the process. To do so would simply provide alQaeda and other terrorists with a propaganda victory. It would mean turning our back on the MAIN COMMITTEE work that we have done as part of the international community in trying to make a difference in Afghanistan. Of course, we cannot speak about Afghanistan without turning our thoughts to the professional soldiers of the Australian Defence Force and their families, who have made such a commitment over these years. They are proud people. These soldiers offered their lives to make sure that this mission was successful. They embraced wartime sacrifice as their highest duty and in return they look to us for wisdom and guidance. Our highest duty is to make wise decisions about this war and ensure that the mission we set ourselves-to make Afghanistan an unsafe haven for terrorism-continues so that Afghanistan can be part of the international community. These are issues that we need to continue to work on. Our commitment to Afghanistan will not be over quickly. Our commitment to Afghanistan will continue to attract mixed views in the electorate and invoke some controversy. One of the great things about this discussion that we are having is that it enables MPs like me to talk directly to their electorates about their views and to better inform the electorate regarding the motives around why we are there. More importantly, it enables us to help our constituents understand the complexities of what we are doing there, the time line of our presence in Afghanistan and the nature of the mission. It has been an honour to participate in this debate today on Australia’s involvement in Afghanistan. This is a very important debate for all Australians and I am very glad that I have been able to take part in it. That further proceedings be conducted in the House. Question agreed to. Second Reading Debate resumed. National Broadband Network Financial Transparency Bill 2010 because it is an example of why this parliament actually exists-that is, to make sure that legislation and decisions brought forward by this or any government are properly scrutinised and are considered to be the best possible option and solution for the Australian public at the time and, of course, will continue to serve into the future. After all, this bill proposes to appropriate Australian taxpayers’ money. It is not the government’s money; taxpayers’ money would fund the National Broadband Network as proposed by the government. The coalition, business and industry are not sure if this NBN proposal fits that description. We are not sure if this project is the best option for the Australian public or, for that matter, the Telstra shareholders, who are yet to decide whether they will support the divestment of a whole lot of their infrastructure for a figure of some $11 billion. They are not sure and we are not sure because we as a parliament have not been privy to the financial data associated with the NBN. The NBN has not been subject to proper scrutiny. We see articles every other day in the newspaper that are critical of the process-and rightly so. It has not been subject to any costMAIN COMMITTEE",269,Ministerial Statements
299,Mr Tudge (Aston) (6.28 Pm),I move:,273,National Broadband Network Financial Transparency Bill 2010
300,Mr Bruce Scott (Maranoa) (6.28 Pm),"I welcome the opportunity to speak on thebenefit analysis. Any government project of this magnitude-even 50 per cent of this magnitude-should be subject to a cost-benefit analysis, as it is in the case of road infrastructure. It has not even been referred to this government’s own agency Infrastructure Australia for consideration. We have to ask why. This is the largest single infrastructure investment in Australia’s history and it deserves better scrutiny. It deserves to be referred to Infrastructure Australia. It also deserves to be referred to the Productivity Commission for their analysis, as this bill suggests. This government does not have a good track record when it comes to rolling out big spending projects. We only have to look at the roof insulation debate and the BER school halls scheme to see that. That is why we as an opposition are concerned about this $43 billion that is to be spent on a nation-building project that has not been submitted to a cost-benefit analysis. That is why this bill has been introduced by the coalition. We are requesting that the NBN Co., which is obviously responsible for the NBN project, release a highly detailed 10-year business plan. That would be a good start. We are also calling on the NBN project to be referred to the Productivity Commission for a cost-benefit analysis. That is what the Australian taxpayers deserve at the very least. It is their money. We need to have an assurance that it is being well spent and not wasted. An important inclusion in our proposed Productivity Commission inquiry would be an analysis of the current availability of broadband across Australia and consideration of the most cost-effective and speedy options by which fast broadband services can be made available to all Australians, particularly those in rural and remote parts of Australia. This would certainly be welcomed by my constituents of Maranoa, especially those in the far west of my electorate. Many of the shire councils in far western Queensland are working hard to increase their annual tourism market numbers and they have great initiatives and ideas to encourage more domestic and international visitors to their unique outback towns. But to do this they need the necessary infrastructure. If this NBN is truly nation building then the NBN Co. should be focusing on these areas where the market fails. Yet what we have heard from this government is that they are building from the cities to the outback and, as we understand it, the outback may one day get a satellite service. If they want to undertake nation-building projects, they should go to where the market fails with taxpayers’ money and build from the outback to the coast. I can assure you that that would have the support of many of my constituents. A cost-benefit analysis from the Productivity Commission would be a sensible move by this government. This bill is not about delaying the rollout of the NBN; it is already being rolled out in many parts of Australia. I must say that I have already had grave concerns about the process. Earlier this year in my electorate of Maranoa we had a number of landholders from Dalby contact my office to inform me that Nextgen, the company contracted to roll out the NBN optic fibre cable are trespassing across people’s private property. They are running beside a public highway and they are running alongside the railway line-another public land corridor-but, no, they have to go through private property. Why? Because it is easier and does not require the same sort of(Time expired) Ms HALL (Shortland) (6.34 pm)-At the commencement of my contribution to this debate on the National Broadband Network Financial Transparency Bill 2010 I must say I am really surprised that the member for Maranoa cannot see the benefit of the NBN to his elecMAIN COMMITTEE torate, because I believe that his constituency and those people that are living outside big cities are the ones that have the greatest potential to benefit from the NBN. I understand that the member for Wentworth lives in inner Sydney. That is a very nice area where you can access all the services and infrastructure you need. But in areas like the area I represent and like most of the members in this parliament represent, we struggle to get access to that vital infrastructure. Do you know what I think this legislation is? It is legislation to delay, to put barriers in front of the national broadband network, NBN, being introduced. It is a tactic. We all know that the Leader of the Opposition gave the member for Wentworth the brief of demolishing and destroying the NBN. He is doing it in a very subtle way; he is trying to prevent it actually becoming operational. The member for Wentworth should be ashamed of himself. The people of Australia can actually see through what he is doing here. I can assure the House that my constituents in Shortland are well aware of the benefit that the NBN will have for them. They do not believe that establishing a joint select committee to oversee the rollout of the NBN will benefit them. They do not see that will allow them to be able to access broadband, let alone fast-speed broadband, any quicker. They just see this as members living in a very nice area of inner Sydney putting barriers in front of their being able to access what they believe is their right. They do not believe that the Productivity Commission doing a costbenefit analysis will do anything to help them get fast-speed broadband any quicker. No, they recognise it for what it is. They recognise that requiring a Productivity Commission costbenefit analysis and the publication of a 10-year business plan for the NBN Co. is just a delaying tactic that is designed to prevent them from accessing fast-speed broadband. On this side of the House we know that the nations that embrace fast-speed broadband are the nations that will succeed. It has already been shown how far behind Australia is in relation to broadband: 17th out of 31 countries on national broadband penetration; the fifth most expensive among 30 developed countries on broadband prices; 50th in terms of broadband speeds; equal last on deployment of optic fibre broadband; and 29th out of 50 countries on an average connection speed at 2.6 megabytes per second. On this side of the House we do not support that. We support fast-speed broadband for everyone. We recognise its worth to businesses. We know that businesses such as in the area I represent on the Central Coast and near Lake Macquarie need this to be competitive. It means that residents living on the Central Coast will no longer need to travel to Sydney; they will be able to work from their home. It is bringing their work to where they live. The member for Wentworth should be condemned for trying to frustrate the government in its efforts to roll out fast-speed broadband to all Australians. This is good legislation that will be good for Australia and good for the people I represent in this parliament. died around under this Labor government: a couple of billion for the home insulation scheme; a few more billion for the school halls program-it sounds a bit like the whistle effect from The Hollow Men. The Australian people can perhaps be forgiven for having become desensitised to what are significant amounts of taxpayer money. The government’s NBN proposal amounts to the biggest spend of taxpayer funds for its infrastructure in the history of the Commonwealth of Australia. That is why it is remarkable that this idea has not been subjected to a cost-benefit analysis or properly considered by Infrastructure Australia. In September 2009 the Treasury Secretary, Ken Henry, stated: MAIN COMMITTEE",273,National Broadband Network Financial Transparency Bill 2010
301,Mr Irons (Swan) (6.39 Pm),"Australians have become used to big numbers being banGovernment spending that does not pass an appropriately defined cost-benefit test necessarily detracts from Australia’s well-being. Mr Henry is right. This spending deserves scrutiny. I therefore rise today to support the National Broadband Network Financial Transparency Bill 2010 which will provide this scrutiny. In supporting this bill I recognise the member for Wentworth and applaud his efforts in bringing this legislation before the House today. If passed, this bill will lead to two major outcomes. First, it will require the publication of a 10-year business case for the NBN. Secondly, it will refer the NBN to the Productivity Commission for a thorough consideration. Both are required to provide scrutiny of this major expenditure project. To date the government has relied upon the advice of the McKinsey-KPMG implementation study which, its own authors were keen to point out, was not a cost-benefit analysis. Incidentally, $25 million was spent on this implementation study. As a consequence the government has been unable to justify the economic benefits of establishing such a large monopoly-a monopoly which would possibly be in breach of this country’s competition legislation. Recently, NBN Co. CEO, Mark Quigley, would not reveal the cost of the rollout of the NBN in Tasmania. Maybe there are a couple of members from Tasmania who would be able to enlighten us, but why all this secrecy? The Australian people-or should I say the Australian taxpayers-deserve to know whether this is the most effective way of delivering high speed broadband to them. Without the scrutiny called for in this bill, they would not be provided with this information. It is not just the coalition that is seeking the passage of this bill and asking for this scrutiny; some of the most respected business leaders in the country have added their weight to the argument. Only today, a group of CEOs have written to the crossbenchers to urge them to support this bill. In their letter they state: The NBN proposal now differs significantly from the proposal that was contemplated in the implementation study (which already found that the proposal in its then form was unlikely ever to generate a commercial rate of return). No serious analysis has been done of the changed cost implementations of these differences. Fundamental features of the project remain unresolved. The voices of concern have not been confined to our shores. The recent OECD report pointedly observes that no cost-benefit analysis has been undertaken and then specifically goes on to suggest that the Productivity Commission is an ideal organisation to conduct a cost-benefit analysis. So if the cost-benefit analysis is sensible, prudent and supported, why is this government so reluctant to provide one? The excuses by the Minister for Broadband, Communication and the Digital Economy of delays and costs simply do not stack up. The rollout is already progressing and will continue to progress, no doubt, whilst the Productivity Commission undertakes this proposed cost-benefit analysis that would also comfortably fit within the commission’s budget. This bill has interest for my electorate of Swan given the Labor Party’s pre-election commitment to roll out the NBN in the suburb of Victoria Park as one of the second-release sites. Why they did not choose Belmont, I do not know. Victoria Park was probably higher on their agenda to win the seat of Swan. The Labor Party announced along with the Labor candidatewith much fanfare-that the construction of Victoria Park would be at the beginning of the second quarter of 2011. Yet of course there was no proof that they could deliver and no indication of whether it would be an opt-in or an opt-out system. Will my constituents face additional charges? We do not know because there is no adequate business plan. Notwithstanding MAIN COMMITTEE this, after such fanfare during the campaign, the people of Victoria Park will be expecting the government to deliver on this commitment. I very much doubt that the constituents of Victoria Park will see anything other than just another broken promise, as the focus is now on regional areas. I support this proposed bill. It is basic economic sense to conduct a cost-benefit analysis. There is overwhelming pressure on the government from the business community for this cost-benefit analysis to be undertaken. The NBN Co. also needs to produce a 10-year business case. The budget deficit stands at $41 billion. For the sake of Australia and the Australian taxpayer we must make sure this spending is justified. As Dirkson’s famous quote goes: ‘A billion here, a billion there, pretty soon it all adds up to real money.’ Financial Transparency Bill 2010 and the proposal to have a joint select committee to oversee the rollout of the NBN. The bill also includes a proposal for the Productivity Commission to undertake a cost-benefit analysis of the National Broadband Network and to publish a business plan. AlthoughI believe that the member for Wentworth has good intentions-or I hope he does-to try and make this a transparent process and that he thinks it will not have any impact whatsoever on the rollout of the National Broadband Network, it is a little late for him to start arguing for a cost-benefit analysis at this stage. Endless analyses, studies and arguments have suggested that this should happen and that we should be getting on with it. We did not do a cost-benefit analysis when we put in railways in Australia, we did not do a cost-benefit analysis of all the roads around the country, we certainly did not do one when the copper went into the ground, we did not do it when we got the post office service going and we did not do it when the telegraph wire was run up the middle of the country. Those were the technologies of the time; this is the technology that we need now. This is the technology which will drive Australia forward and allow us to be competitive in the world, which we have not been up to now. We have been left behind. Those on the other side had 12 years to do this when they were in government. They used the argument, ‘Competition’s going to do it,’ but we just kept copper and bits of other stuff. Other people were going to make money out of pay TV. Basically that was the argument they made. In my electorate, people are very angry about having to use a dial-up service, which drops out frequently. There does not seem to be any understanding on the other side of dial-up or the number of people who have contacted members about it. Ever since I have been a member of the House, for 17 or 18 years, people have been really angry about it. With pair gain they have certainly gained, by taking a bit of copper off somebody. Some of the regional towns in my electorate, especially the outlying areas, have real problems keeping up. Many people who communicate and work at home have come to my region, the great electorate of Lyons, and wanted to live in its great valleys. But, since they have not been able to connect to the rest of the world, we have lost them. They are people who could make a very good contribution to the electorate through employing people and playing a role in the local community. Losing those people has been one of the sad consequences of not having fast broadband-let alone the constituents that do live in my electorate not having the opportunity to access fast broadband. With a broadband connection, we could have e-health in my small towns. A 90-year-old could go to the local health clinic, put a wire or something on her chest and plug it into a MAIN COMMITTEE",275,National Broadband Network Financial Transparency Bill 2010
302,Mr Adams (Lyons) (6.44 Pm),"I wish to speak against the National Broadband Networksocket, and her vital health information would go to a nurse. That nurse could look at that information and say, ‘You’re okay today; I’ll see you tomorrow.’ E-health saves money and improves delivery of health services. There are many positive things that could come out of this network. One school told me that it takes them five hours to download a documentary-five hours! With a broadband connection, it would happen with a click of the finger. They could talk to schoolchildren in other parts of the world. They would have the free flow of information which we all talk about. Small businesses are another group who would benefit from having a fast broadband connection. I cannot believe that the National Party, of all parties, are opposed to this. They cannot see the pluses of this for regional Australia-a failure again by the National Party to get a grip on, or have an understanding of, broadband. Maybe they are ignorant. I certainly do not support this legislation. I believe that we have to make this happen. We have to get on with it and deliver the National Broadband Network. We are behind the eight ball; we need to be in front of it. cial Transparency Bill 2010 is twofold: the first is to require the publication of a 10-year business case for NBN Co. and the second is to refer the NBN project to the Productivity Commission for a thorough cost-benefit analysis. I find it astounding that we actually have to put a bill to the parliament to pressure the government to do this. Doing a business case and undertaking a cost-benefit analysis should be a basic requirement for any serious government infrastructure investment. In this case we are not just talking about a small investment. We are not talking about a couple of thousand dollars or even a couple of million dollars; we are talking about the largest public investment in Australia’s history-a $43 billion project. That is $5,000 per household, and all of it, of course, on borrowed money. Surely such a massive outlay deserves scrutiny. Surely it deserves a rigorous cost-benefit analysis. The government has repeatedly justified the enormous cost of the NBN project on the basis of its large contribution to the economy. We have just heard that here. Yet they have provided neither any tangible evidence nor any concrete examples to support that claim. Most of the applications and uses for the NBN that actually add to economic productivity are available over today’s ADSL2+ broadband speeds. The McKinsey-KPMG implementation study did not offer the financial analysis necessary for such a large-scale project. It did not attempt a cost-benefit analysis or consider any other alternatives. Over $25 million was spent on that study, but the government did not require it to answer the most important question: is a $43 billion fibre-to-the-home network the most costeffective way of achieving universal access to affordable broadband in Australia? It is not just the opposition that is calling for a cost-benefit analysis and the assumptions underpinning the business case to be revealed. Many other respected commentators are also doing this. For example, the ANZ chairman said: The lack of a business case and full publicity of that business case is throwing a lot of doubt in people’s minds about the level of expenditure. The chairman of Wesfarmers said: I am not convinced and feel it needs a cost-benefit analysis. I just don’t know if an NBN will rank in priority. MAIN COMMITTEE",277,National Broadband Network Financial Transparency Bill 2010
303,Mr Tudge (Aston) (6.49 Pm),"The purpose of the National Broadband Network FinanEven the Treasury Secretary, Dr Ken Henry, said that government spending that does not pass an appropriately defined cost-benefit test ‘necessarily detracts from Australia’s well-being’. Surely they should be listening to at least Dr Ken Henry in this regard, and I am not sure why they are not. Why is the government resisting common sense, good financial practice and what is being called for by so many people? Senator Conroy has stated many reasons. He says it will be too costly, but it will not cost any additional government outlay if it is done by the Productivity Commission. He says it will take too long, but an analysis would take probably only six months and could be done in parallel with the existing operations. Finally he says that it cannot be done because it would just be too hard to do. Yes, it would be a difficult analysis, but it can be sensibly done, as the Productivity Commission itself has indicated. The bottom line is that Minister Conroy has made every excuse that proponents put forward when they do not want their project subjected to scrutiny. This project is too large and too far reaching to avoid scrutiny. It needs the full scrutiny of the Productivity Commission. It needs a full, 10-year business case to be made publicly available. I commend the bill to the parliament. Transparency Bill 2010 that is being put forward. I want to start by demonstrating problems that are being experienced in Chifley directly by small businesses. I was at the Woodcroft Lakes Festival in late September and I was approached by a franchise partner of a Gloria Jean’s outlet that works out of Woodcroft. He has been attempting to get a service that is available to him in his other outlets where he uses web technology to install cameras to monitor workflows and customer flows. From a security perspective he is able to access the operation of web cameras in their cafes. He tried to do the same thing in Woodcroft and was told, ‘Currently we are unable to activate the ADSL connection on your number as we have been advised by Telstra that the transmission loss on your nominated phone line is too high. This situation occurs when Telstra detects the possibility of a loss of data when the service is installed or the chosen location of your ADSL connection is too far from the exchange.’ This problem relates to Woodcroft’s distance in Western Sydney from the Blacktown exchange. In Woodcroft people are basically reliant on RIM technology to get access to ADSL. That technology is overwhelmed by the number of customers present. People have to wait for customers to leave to get access. I get constant complaints from people who are unable to access ADSL from Woodcroft. This is not new. I also raised this same problem in 2004 in relation to Glenwood and I was told by both Telstra and the former government that there was no problem, though consumers were screaming. Customers were saying that there was definitely a problem and they could not get access. This problem did not arise overnight; it has built up over time. At its heart, this problem reflects a regulatory stalemate that has existed for years. Once Telstra was sold off by the coalition, Telstra’s priority was about keeping shareholders happy by giving them great returns. Whenever Telstra considered investment in its network, it had to consider its return to shareholders and ultimately what it would be able to secure via its prices. Telstra has always experienced its own battles with the ACCC, who had reservations about consumer impacts, concerns about Telstra levering off its market power and other concerns about lack of access to the network by its competitors. What did we have? We had a stand-off where the customer lost out. The problem is that when the coalition were in government they MAIN COMMITTEE",278,National Broadband Network Financial Transparency Bill 2010
304,Mr Husic (Chifley) (6.54 Pm),"I oppose the National Broadband Network Financialtried numerous times to fix it and were unable to. Customers lost out then, and now the coalition are offering further delay. Consumers were not able to get access to a strong network during the coalition’s period in office and they are being frustrated yet again by the coalition delaying things. I have to say I give the coalition points for being consistent. They have been unable to solve the problem themselves. They delayed getting an answer for people and now they are attempting to delay the government with the introduction of a variety of measures to frustrate the implementation and the rollout of the NBN. We never saw a cost-benefit analysis when they proposed the Adelaide-Darwin railway, the privatisation of Telstra in the first place, Malcolm Turnbull’s $10 billion water plan or the OPEL regional broadband plan. We never saw a cost-benefit analysis then, but that is what they are suggesting now. The other thing that gets me is that they are offering a sub-par alternative in regard to the technology, offering HFC access or wireless at best for people who are trying to get access to broadband. They are proposing a sub-par option. With the rollout of the NBN, we will be able to get access to modern technology-especially in Chifley if the rollout goes ahead. Instead, we see an elitist option from the coalition. If you are in the inner city, you have access to broadband at the moment-that is fine. But if you do not have access to it, the best you will get out of the coalition is a wireless option that is substandard and reflects yet again their disregard for infrastructure rollout in Western Sydney. This bill is nothing short of a delay and a frustration for people in suburban areas to get access to modern technology. This bill should be opposed. parency Bill 2010 is a bill that we should not even need to debate, because it is a matter that one would have thought would be standard practice in any democracy, a simple matter of transparency in decision making and integrity of government-nothing more and nothing less. In October 2008 the now deposed Prime Minister made a speech about transparency in decision making. Ironically, the speech was named ‘Bringing transparency to nation building’. Mr Rudd announced guidelines about how his government would make key decisions on approving and financing infrastructure projects. He raved about the guidelines, saying it was critically important that decisions must be based on ‘objective analysis and evidence’. He insisted that there must be a serious cost-benefit analysis and warned that guidelines are not much use if they are not implemented. People actually took the Prime Minister of the day at his word when he made those promises, but we all know what has happened since. The Secretary of Treasury, Dr Ken Henry, summed up the importance of transparency when he said: Any major infrastructure project must be subject to a rigorous cost benefit analysis and if it does not pass a rigorous cost benefit analysis then it necessarily detracts from Australia’s well-being. … … … That is, when taxpayer funds are not put to their best use, Australia’s well-being is not as high as it otherwise could be. So here we have the government’s key economic adviser spelling out in no uncertain terms that any major infrastructure project must be subject to a cost-benefit analysis. Given that the NBN is by far the single largest commitment of taxpayers’ dollars to an infrastructure project in Australian history, you would think that it would be an obvious candidate for this sort of MAIN COMMITTEE",279,National Broadband Network Financial Transparency Bill 2010
305,Mrs Mirabella (Indi) (6.59 Pm),"The National Broadband Network Financial Transscrutiny. In September this year, upon forming government with Independent assistance, the Prime Minister said: So let’s draw back the curtains and let the sun shine in, let our Parliament be more open than it was before. … … … We will be held to higher standards of transparency and reform and it’s in that spirit I approach the task of forming a government. What a load of codswallop! The Prime Minister again is all words and no substance-the grandstanding, the words and the sunshine. Well, the clouds have been blocking that sunlight for a very long time as far as this Prime Minister is concerned. The National Broadband Network Financial Transparency Bill 2010, would ensure that all these grand principles as espoused, but not adhered to, would actually be part of government decision making. It would assure Australian taxpayers that the government is spending their money appropriately. That is a very simple demand, and it is what my constituents and industry groups across Australia tell me they want-just some basic accountability to give faith back to them in the political process and decision making. But the Labor Party are afraid of scrutiny. Those opposite do not like to be questioned and they do not like to be challenged. They certainly do not like to admit mistakes. But, if they did actually admit mistakes, they would show the courage of leadership that has been so sorely lacking. Deep down, every member of the government knows that a cost-benefit analysis would expose the NBN for what it is-a giant, monopolistic white elephant that will plunge generations of Australians into enormous debt. In order to illustrate this, it is worth noting that, as we speak, Labor are desperately trying to pass legislation that would exempt the NBN from the scrutiny of the ACCC. So not only do they refuse to conduct a cost-benefit analysis; they also want to hide the NBN from the independent competition watchdog. What do we know about the NBN so far? We know it is the most expensive piece of infrastructure in Australia’s history. We know it will create a giant government-owned monopoly. We know it will destroy competition. And we know Treasury’s red book advice to the incoming government said that the NBN ‘carries significant risks, including financial risks for the public balance sheet and risk around competition and efficiency’. If those opposite want to dispute these facts, they can do so by supporting this bill and proving to the Australian people whether the numbers stack up. But, as I said, Labor know the numbers do not stack up. They know Labor’s plan is fatally flawed and they know that they will not be the ones who will have to fix up the mess. the member for Wentworth on a similar matter, I think I said that any time somebody puts a proposal together which has the words ‘costs’, ‘benefits’ and ‘analysis’ in the one sentence, it has a seductive sheen of credibility, but when you peel back the proposal you realise that the National Broadband Network Financial Transparency Bill 2010, like the motion that preceded it, is a sham. We know it is a sham, because the proponents are deaf, dumb and blind when it comes to both the benefits and any analysis of our proposal to build a national broadband network. MAIN COMMITTEE",280,National Broadband Network Financial Transparency Bill 2010
306,Mr Stephen Jones (Throsby) (7.04 Pm),"When I last spoke on a motion moved byThis private member’s bill on the financial transparency of the NBN has no credibility because the member for Wentworth’s mission, like the mission of his leader, is to wreck and demolish the National Broadband Network. If he cannot wreck it outright, then his only other option is to wreck it by delaying it and wreck it through scare tactics. We know it is a sham, because it comes from the same party who roundly criticised the government throughout the course of the last election for not getting out there and rolling the broadband network out quickly enough. They criticised us in Tasmania. They criticised it in the electorate adjoining my own. In fact, I remember full well the member for Gilmore complaining that the government had not rolled the network out speedily enough so that people could access it. The very same member has come to this place and said, ‘Hold on, we should delay things and go through a cost-benefit analysis.’ What the member for Wentworth does not accept is that you cannot simply transfer the principles that apply to private sector investment practice to the role of the Australian government. That does not mean that the analogies do not sometimes apply, but where they do not apply is when you have an instance of market failure. The only reason that the government has had to come forward with its nation-building project, the National Broadband Network, is that, after 19 failed broadband plans and about 20 years of deregulation in the telecommunications industry, we have had a huge and tragic instance of market failure. Throughout that time, Australians have patiently endured the market domination of Telstra, which did not deliver real competition to telecommunications. Now we have a plan that is financially viable and will deliver real competition in the telecommunications industry, real competition for consumers, and, sadly, this success is what the coalition and members opposite fear most. They fear the success of the National Broadband Network. They do not want it to be rolled out, they do not want it to be rolled out on time, they do not want it to succeed, they do not want it to work and they do not want consumers to have the benefits that it would deliver to them. The coalition knows that, if the NBN is a success, they will have zero credibility left when it comes to the economy and the critical infrastructure that is needed to ensure that we have a modern economy fit for the 21st century. The NBN is critical infrastructure. It will connect our rural and regional centres back to our main cities and to the markets of the world, with world-class broadband services. The costs of this project have been public for quite some time. They have been debated through two elections. There is no need for further sunshine or transparency on the costs, because we have been quite up-front about the costs of this project. When it comes to the benefits, we know that Infrastructure Australia has said that the benefits of this project are hard to overestimate. We know that business supports it, because business can see that this is critical infrastructure for the future of our nation. We know that voters, in no fewer than two elections, have voted with their feet in support of the National Broadband Network. We know that consumers are lining up to gain access to the network. So the message quite simply to those opposite-to the member for Wentworth, who has been given the impossible task of defending this bill-is: get out of the way and let progress have its way. Transparency Bill 2010 is simply a bill that seeks to give the parliament confidence in the unprecedented investment that is the National Broadband Network. As my colleagues have already made clear, the National Broadband Network represents the biggest investment of taxpayers’ funds into an infrastructure asset this nation has ever seen. Indeed the National MAIN COMMITTEE",281,National Broadband Network Financial Transparency Bill 2010
307,Mr Matheson (Macarthur) (7.09 Pm),"The National Broadband Network FinancialBroadband Network represents a per capita expenditure for broadband infrastructure that is 100 times higher than the US has forecast for their own version of the NBN. It would seem reasonable, if not even sensible, or, dare I say it, financially responsible, for an infrastructure investment of any significant cost to the taxpayer to undergo a thorough cost-benefit analysis process. Indeed the government agrees on this point, having created Infrastructure Australia to do just this-but apparently the government does not want to be held to account to even their own standards. They have refused to allow Infrastructure Australia to look into the National Broadband Network. It is almost unfathomable that an infrastructure investment of this size has commenced without the parliament being privy to the basic financial data of the project. The National Broadband Network Financial Transparency Bill 2010 will ensure that the rollout and operation of a National Broadband Network process is transparent and that taxpayers’ money is used wisely and efficiently. The bill requires the NBN Co. to produce and publish a detailed 10-year business case, including key financial and operational indicators. This is nothing out of the ordinary. One would expect this document to have been produced before the plan was rolled out. It astounds me that one has not yet been made. In addition to this standard financial data, this bill calls the NBN Co. to report on expected numbers of premises passed by the NBN, provide estimated residential and business subscribers and projected average retail and wholesale revenues per user and to advise on the internal rates of return on invested capital. The second part of the National Broadband Network Financial Transparency Bill 2010 refers the National Broadband Network project to the Productivity Commission to prepare and publish a cost-benefit analysis. This analysis will include a study of current broadband services across Australia, consider different options by which particular broadband speeds could be made available to regional and remote areas, examine the economy-wide benefits likely to flow from enhanced broadband services around Australia and give a full and transparent costing of the pros of the NBN project, including all financial and economic projections underpinning the estimates. The analysis will also examine reasonable commercial rates of return and cashflows for the NBN Co. and give consideration of what the likely realisable value of the NBN Co. would be if it were to be privatised after five years as current legislation assumes. Other aspects to be examined are the design, construction and operating arrangements for the proposed NBN project so direct and indirect outcomes from its construction and operation can be identified and evaluated, and provide analysis of the effects of a proposed NBN on the competition for Australian fixed-line broadband. The Productivity Commission will provide independent and expert analysis of this project. The government has previously stated that it will release much of the financial information highlighted by this bill in the near future; however, as my colleague the Hon. Malcolm Turnbull has stated, creating a statutory requirement for transparency will give parliament much greater confidence in the delivery of this information. The National Broadband Network Financial Transparency Bill 2010 will not disrupt the rollout and implementation of the National Broadband Network project. This bill simply places a requirement on the NBN Co. to produce a business case for the next 10 years. This bill does not ask for anything beyond what the ordinary taxpayer would expect would be carMAIN COMMITTEE ried out for such a massive investment of taxpayers’ funds. This bill will provide the parliament the long-awaited transparency it expects of such an infrastructure project. The coalition has taken a common-sense approach to the NBN rollout. I urge members to support this bill. sensible and reasonable. I just wonder if it is sensible or reasonable to have had 18 failed broadband plans over 12 years of government. Was that sensible? Was that reasonable? Did that serve any of our electors? I would say no and I can tell you that people in my electorate in Craigmore cannot get broadband apart from wireless and only creeping up the hill. These people who live in metropolitan Adelaide cannot get ADSL, and the people in Burton where I live cannot get ADSL because of pair gains provided by a vertically integrated privatised monopoly called Telstra. We have the worse broadband infrastructure in the whole country in Adelaide. I wonder if that is sensible or reasonable. Equally, I wonder whether it is sensible or reasonable for Australia to be ranked 17th out of 31 developed countries for broadband penetration, to be the fifth most expensive of the 31 developed countries on broadband prices, to be the 50th in broadband speeds, to be equal last in deployment of fibre-optic broadband and to be 29th out of 50 on average connection speed. That is the legacy of the Liberal Party. That is the legacy of John Howard. That is the legacy of supposedly being sensible and reasonable. We know what sensible and reasonable means. It means delay and inaction, to wreck the National Broadband Network. You would have to wonder why, because it is a drag on productivity and a drag on jobs. It is a drag on infrastructure. Labor believes in jobs, productivity and infrastructure. We are the party of the future. We do not have any sensible approach from the Liberal Party or any sensible engagement or acknowledgement of the record. We have delay, inaction and excuses. We are assured that this will not have any effect on the implementation of broadband-there are all these ‘sensible and reasonable’ statements-but we know that the consequence of delay is that Australia loses out, particularly people in my electorate in places like Craigmore, Hillbank, Burton and up the track in Liberal voting areas like Clare, Freeling and Riverton. That is why these places are turning against the Liberal Party. I cannot believe it when the Liberal Party constantly says, ‘We’re going to wreck the National Broadband Network.’ I was so impressed when Liberal Senator Alan Ferguson put out a pamphlet through my whole electorate saying, ‘Tony Abbott’s going to wreck the broadband network.’ So do you know what I did? In my next pamphlet, I quoted Senator Alan Ferguson-in a leaflet to you. going to the future. I am stunned by the Liberal Party. They lost in 2007 and they lost this election over the issue of the National Broadband Network. They lose elections over this issue because they are determined to keep Australia in the Dark Ages. They are determined to keep my electorate in the Dark Ages. They are determined to keep people in Burton, in Craigmore and in Hillbank, in Clare, Riverton and Kapunda in the Dark Ages, denying them educational opportunities, denying them small business opportunities, denying them healthcare opportunities. Why? Because they want to play the same game with the National Broadband Network as they do with every other government program: not good policy; just pure partisan politicking.

They would condemn Australia to another generation of living in the Dark Ages. Steam-powered dial-up-that is the way the Liberal Party want to lead us. Labor believes in jobs, infrastructure and productivity. That is what we have provided to the Australian community. That is why we are not in recession. That is why we are not in the Dark Ages and that is why we are going to deliver the National Broadband Network. to show what the alternate government of this country believes in. Contrary to Julia Gillard’s latest slogan, we are not wreckers. Let us get it on the record. IfI hear Julia Gillard say once more that we are wreckers, I will think that she has the rightful claim to be the Prime Minister renowned only for slogans and nothing else. On this side, we stand for holding the government to account, not as the opposition but as the alternative government of this country. We in the coalition have an alternative plan on broadband, a better plan on broadband. This is not about standing in the way of Labor’s policies; it is about standing in the way of bad policy. Let us make the point clear from the start. This is the largest expenditure of taxpayers’ funds on an infrastructure project in our nation’s history-that is, the taxes of mums and dads, of families in Australia going on the largest infrastructure project in our nation’s history. And we will not forget where $2 billion of the total spend came from. That was money set aside by the Howard government to improve telecommunications in rural and regional Australia. It was put in a trust with the interest to be distributed to improve mobile and broadband services in the country. That money has not been spent in the last three years and, sadly, rural and regional Australia are worse off because of it. What this country needs is an assurance that what this government has done and is going to do is not going to hurt us further into the future. That is why we in the coalition believe that a 10-year business case is what is needed, not the 10-week political case that has so far been provided by this sad attempt of a government. We propose a cost-benefit analysis by the Productivity Commission, not a political rhetorical analysis by the ALP. We on this side of the chamber know that the Australian people would not invest their hard-earned money on a venture without true returns and without having a study which would give us some idea of whether we will go any way towards achieving those true returns. This is the reason why it is so ludicrous that the Labor Party continues to insist that it knows what it is doing with our money-and it is our money, not the government’s. Taxpayers work too hard every day of the year to be short-changed by a government that simply does not care whether it is making a good spend, so long as it is making a big spend. We hear the government tell us that we should judge them by what they have done. What they have done is deliver policy on the run-from school halls to insulation. We do judge you for what you have done but we are committed to not seeing this kind of disregard for taxpayers happening again. What we propose is that the government be asked the difficult questions about what they are doing. The government say they intend to release a majority of the information provided for in our bill sometime in the future. When? Why won’t you tell us when? If the government believe so strongly in the value of expenditure, why are we having this debate? Surely a government that believes in its policy would be happy to open it up to scrutiny. Instead, what we have is the largest taxpayer funded government infrastructure spend in our nation’s history being hidden from the budget bottom line.

We stand for transparency in government. We stand for, and welcome, reasoned debate on this issue. We cannot understand what you are hiding from, why you will not let the Productivity Commission decide whether what you are doing is in our interest or not. We stand for holding the government to account, not as the opposition but as the alternative government of this country. and Settlement Services) (7.23 pm)-As the member for Wentworth has acknowledged, there are many ways to skin a cat-and what we are seeing in this process by the opposition is essentially an attempt, through a supposed inquiry by the Productivity Commission, to delay action. We all know the mandate the member for Wentworth was given by the Leader of the Opposition-that is, to destroy the concept of the NBN. His mission was not to promote it, to help it or to facilitate it; it was to destroy it. When we look at why this is being put forward, this supposed need for an inquiry, this grave concern for the taxpayers’ interests, we need to recognise that what is really behind this is yet another delaying mechanism. Were a Productivity Commission inquiry to occur, there is no guarantee from the member for Wentworth that its recommendations would be supported. So we really know what this is all about. But there has been a lot confusion in the parallel debate that has been occurring in the House. There, I heard the member for Bradfield extolling Optus, his former employer. He was promoting his book, I must admit. He must feel that Lazarus Rising and Faceless Man are not much competition in the lead-up to Christmas, because he was certainly promoting his own published works in the House. His whole lament was around the question of how Optus had been mistreated, how evil Telstra was and how that had led to such a difficult telecommunications structure in this country. He was soon followed by the member for Moncrieff, who spent his contribution lamenting the way in which Telstra shareholders’ interests might be undermined. He seemed to be very concerned with Telstra and its interest. So there are quite a few pipers calling tunes on that side of the House. What we see here is a manifest effort by the opposition to delay action on this front. They seek to delay action in the context of a situation in which this country is 17th out of 31 developed countries on broadband penetration. They seek delay in a nation where no Australian city is in the top 100 of urban concentrations for average internet connection speed. They seek to hamper change where Australia ranks only 23rd out of 50 countries on the percentage of connections of more than five megabits per second. We have a situation where their legacy is not very impressive. The legacy of what they managed to accomplish is not something that one would go to the rooftops about. Yet they seek again, by the contrivance of a supposedly necessary inquiry, to delay very necessary, overdue action to rectify a manifest problem. It is not only the Labor Party saying this is a very urgent need. Also the United Nations has recently commented: Broadband is the next tipping point, the next truly transformational technology. It can generate jobs, drive growth and productivity and underpin long-term economic competitiveness. Admittedly we are the most urbanised nation on this earth, but we still have significant numbers of people whose very existence and future is around the question of distance education. We have very obvious gains to be made in regard to their situation. We have very obvious MAIN COMMITTEE",285,National Broadband Network Financial Transparency Bill 2010

We have a situation where much can be accomplished in the context of failure. In Tasmania we can already see the beginnings of some success in delivery. A number of concentrated areas down there where there have been manifest problems over many years in gaining access are now having delivery of services, and the next string of Tasmanian areas is coming onstream. As I said earlier, we know that Access Economics can identify that Australia could save between $1.4 billion and $1.9 billion a year if 10 per cent of the work force tele-worked half the time. We know that the OECD, as well as Access Economics, sees a need for urgent action. It has commented that the effective use of high-speed broadband can provide significant improvements in productivity and efficiency across a number of sectors such as energy, heath, education and transport. It is time that the opposition got out of the way on this matter. Action is overdue. There is no need for procrastination and politically motivated delays on an important national enterprise. Transparency Bill 2010 requires the government to publish a business case for the NBN and to refer that project to the Productivity Commission to produce a cost-benefit analysis. Labor’s broadband policy is poorly thought out and hardly planned. The government spent $25 million trying to justify its position in a 546-page McKinsey and KPMG implementation study, which I think works out at $46,000 a page, without evaluating the objectives or doing an objective cost-benefit analysis. It is re-establishing a gigantic monopoly that is so anticompetitive that the proposed telecommunications legislation explicitly exempts it from the provisions of the Trade Practices Act. When you talk to the telecommunications industry around Australia, they cannot believe it is happening. They may not be saying so in public but they cannot believe that this proposal can go ahead. Let me tell you for rural and regional Australia there is not much going for it. My electorate of Calare admittedly is smaller compared to what I have been used to. It is 30,000 square kilometres, it has eight local government areas, but in shires like Oberon there will be no funds to improve mobile coverage, which is probably inhibiting the current and future strategic growth of the shire more than anything. And while NBN may provide better speeds within the town of Oberon itself, it will not improve broadband communication in the areas within the local government area, and that is true of almost every one of the local government areas within the electorate of Calare. Let us remember they are not even pretending this is going to help eight per cent, it is only a 92 per cent target we are talking about here. Instead of wasting money updating sitting services where competition and natural growth are working, the money should be spent in rural and regional Australia-and I do not mean $43 billion-which needs reliable access to broadband so that it can also benefit from the technology improvements. And while it is probably the only technology to which nobody has a clue as to how far it can go, it has a long way to go. As members of this House, we have a responsibility to use taxpayers’ money in the most cost-effective way, and that brings me back to this bill. I know that Labor want to run away from this bill as fast as possible. Why? Because they have to come up with a business case.

If it was, they would not be objecting to it in the way they are. The government claims it is because the coalition will never support this project that they are not undertaking a cost-benefit analysis. I think we all know, and I can certainly assure you the communications industry knows, the reason they do not want to do a cost-benefit analysis. It just does not or will not stack up. The bill requires the government to publish a business case for the NBN, the biggest infrastructure project in Australia’s history. The reason it is so big is that it is going to deal with every major city which is already going there as fast as it can. Why? Because private enterprise has every reason to take it there. It proposes a sensible approach that underpins good governance. I strongly support this bill, as I think any Australian who pays his tax should. If you say $43 billion quickly it might not sound like much, but to me it does no matter how fast you say it. This is a huge thing to throw taxpayers’ money into at a time when only a fool thinks we are going to end up in surplus in 2013. I think the Treasurer was even talking earlier than that the other day. We will believe that when we see it. Rural and regional Australia are not being well served here; nor are the taxpayers of Australia. I support this bill. other side, including the member for Wentworth’s speech, are all about delay. They know everything about delay. They did nothing for 13 years when they were in government, they did nothing while they were in opposition except put up a pathetic plan-I think it was either No. 19 or No. 20-and they were that confident of it they sacked the architect, stuck him on the backbench and said, ‘Thanks very much for nothing’. That is how much confidence they had in it. We listened to the member for Goldstein trying to um and ah his way through trying to explain what their policy was, and we had the Leader of the Opposition say to Tony Jones or Kerry O’Brien-one of those perceptive interviewers-‘Don’t take me on a tech survey, I don’t know anything about it.’ Now we have his shadow opposition spokesperson on telecommunications with the absolute mission statement to destroy the NBN coming up with another delay tactic. What a joke! Isn’t it interesting that he is that keen on accountability, saying ‘We must have a Productivity Commission investigation. We must have the parliament poring over this for the future of Australia. We must have every man and his dog poring over this to make us feel confident that the investment is needed.’ We know it is really all about delay. If he was that keen on accountability, he might have had the Productivity Commission do a cost-benefit analysis of the Adelaide-Darwin railway. We might remember that one. Ms Saffin-We do. remember that cost-benefit analysis by the Productivity Commission that did not happen as well. What about the member for Wentworth himself? If he is going to be a hypocrite, he should at least have some runs on the board. What about his $10 billion water plan? I do not remember the Productivity Commission’s cost-benefit analysis of that. Do you remember the OPEL regional broadband plan? I think that was plan No. 16, 17 or something like that. I do not remember the Productivity Commission undertaking a cost-benefit analysis of that.

I have already spoken several times on this in the parliament-even today. We have the industry saying we need the NBN. Statistics tell us we need the NBN. Australia has a pathetic performance record of delivery-or lack thereof-of high speed broadband. We had the member speaking before me bleating on about the lack of services in regional and rural Australia and telling us that we have to leave it up to the free market because competition and the free market will provide those services. What a load of rubbish! They have not produced it to this point and will not produce it on their own plans. The NBN will provide those services to rural and regional Australia. If Tasmania is any example, that is why they voted Labor. That is why so many of the Independents supported Labor. Indeed, it is the specific reason they voted Labor. That is why anyone who knows anything about it-including Telstra-agrees, unless they are part of the old conservative commentariat. I am talking about the good old Australian newspaper and News Limited. I am talking about the scaremongering and fearmongering that we are all doomed, that every school in Australia is a complete waste of money with the BER and that everybody has had tacky old insulation set up. What absolute rubbish! Thousands of Australians have had safe insulation installed. Thousands of schools and students throughout Australia have benefited from fantastic BER projects and they know it. I do not hear those on the other side screaming out about these schools except one or two wonky ones. But, of course, what do you expect from the other side? The NBN is what Australia needs. The NBN is what Australia wants and the NBN is what Australia should get. Move aside. Forget the delay. (Time expired) the trifecta of reasons as to why we ought to have a cost-benefit analysis of the National Broadband Network. The insulation scheme is a fantastic reason why we should think, pause and carefully consider the impact of government decisions before we take them. The Building the Education Revolution scheme and the absolute rush to get projects out and handed to the New South Wales government meant that, in my electorate of Mitchell, we had two libraries built for a school of 90 pupils at the cost of $900,000. That could have been prevented by a cost-benefit analysis, by rationally examining how we were going to deliver those services. The cost of the National Broadband Network represents the single biggest expenditure of any project in Australian history, so the member for Braddon has really raised the trifecta about why we are here today. If it were the case that, as those on the government side are consistently stating this place, the member for Wentworth’s objective was to delay or even to destroy the National Broadband Network, why would he be urging the government to do a costbenefit analysis to consider the benefits versus the costs of implementing this program responsibly? If that were the case, the member for Wentworth would not be suggesting a deal which said, ‘Let’s pause and reflect, from a serious perspective such as that of the Productivity Commission, on how this could work, how it could be delivered and how we could best provide this broadband service to Australians.’ The experience of the member for Wentworth in business and investing leads him to understand that we need to spend taxpayers’ money wisely.

316,Mr Hawke (Mitchell) (7.38 Pm),"I want to thank the member for Braddon for raisingfor that investment, because otherwise we will end up with a government program just like the insulation scheme or the BER where money is needlessly wasted and time and effort is spent delivering services that could have been delivered in a much better way.’ We have heard from our rural members here today that rural areas will not get the services they need even with an expenditure of $43 billion-the member for Calare is exactly right. Why are we doing that? I come from an inner-city electorate, and there is pair gain in my electorate. I heard the member for Wakefield talking about pair gain, and of course that needs improving. Yet many inner-city areas are well serviced-there are people who do not need 100 megabits per second-while there are rural and regional areas that definitely need those services, and I endorse the remarks of those who say, ‘Why would we spend $43 billion and not service those areas of Australia where it is very difficult to provide these services in the free market?’ There is a large role for the market in the provision of broadband and telecommunications. In fact, the truth is exactly the opposite of the experience of the member for Braddon that telecommunications in this country have been progressing in a fashion that has allowed people to better afford goods and services from telecommunications companies over time. It is not the case that the market is failing so badly that we need a massive government monopoly through an injection of money of $43 billion, a sum beyond the wildest dreams of any single investor or other provider of services in this country’s history. That is not just my view; we have heard in question time about the views of the OECD, but we have not heard about the fact that the OECD has this week criticised the NBN monopoly and called for a rigorous analysis of this $43 billion. Why wouldn’t they? The sum of $43 billion is a lot of money in anybody’s language, and it is very unusual for the OECD to call for such an analysis of a domestic policy. The Alliance for Affordable Broadband, the AAB-which represents a cross-section of the telecommunications industry and includes in its membership infrastructure based carriers, fibre, wireless and carriage service providers, all of whom have things to gain and lose through the National Broadband Network-has written an open letter today begging the government to consider the cost-benefit of the NBN. The AAB’s members say that they can provide services in a reasonable and cost-effective way to much of Australia. In addition, the Mayor of Brisbane, Campbell Newman, has proposed an innovative scheme that has been tried in other major cities around the world. So there are plenty of options here; there are plenty of reasons to pause and consider. The member for Wentworth’s objective in suggesting we do so is not to destroy the NBN. If a cost-benefit analysis would destroy the National Broadband Network, perhaps we ought not to be proceeding with the NBN. Perhaps the government ought to pause and think about that. Doing a cost-benefit analysis is a worthy task. The Productivity Commission can do a thorough cost-benefit analysis, and taxpayers can get the peace of mind that they deserve. Ms SAFFIN (Page) (7.43 pm)-When we came to government three years ago, we inherited a situation where the statistics showed that Australia had fallen behind other developed countries on broadband, and that was just not acceptable. Australia was ranked 17 out of 31 developed countries on broadband penetration. Its broadband prices were the fifth most expensive out of 30 developed countries and it ranked 50th on broadband speeds, which is pretty MAIN COMMITTEE slow. Australia ranked equal last on deployment of optic fibre broadband and, at 2.6 megabits per second, 29th out of countries on average connection speed. That really is an unacceptable situation. The government set out to change that so that, right across this country, Australians would have proper access to broadband or an equivalent. The NBN is the solution. It is a major infrastructure program. When I listen to members opposite talking, what astounds me is that there is no appreciation of the government’s role in the provision of public infrastructure. If we look at every piece of public infrastructure that has been provided in Australia under coalition governments, it has not been a lot. They say that this infrastructure requires a business case and so on, but if we followed the coalition’s suggestions it just would not happen. It is the role of government to provide public infrastructure. Some of those costs have to be borne; otherwise we do not progress as a nation. It just astounds me-it is another excuse for delay. What does the NBN mean for jobs? The NBN will support 25,000 jobs every year on average over the life of the eight-year project, peaking at about 37,000 jobs. That is not insignificant; that is huge. The Australian Local Government Association estimated in its 2007-08 State of the regions report that $3.2 billion and 33,000 jobs were lost to Australian businesses in 12 months due to inadequate broadband infrastructure. The NBN will fix this. The many benefits of the high-speed broadband to be delivered by the NBN will be felt particularly in small business. In my electorate, Page, there are over 11,000 registered small businesses-and they are the ones that we know of; there are more. They are the backbone of our local economy. High-speed broadband is one of the big items that they need, from the smallest small business to larger small businesses. The NBN is critical for small business. It is also critical for future healthcare delivery, the education of our young and education generally, and our ability to work cleaner, smarter and faster. In health, there will be remote diagnosis over high-definition videoconferencing. I have been lucky to be involved in that sort of communication-it works really well. It needs to become the norm, not seen as something that is a bit exotic. Particularly in health, it is just the way that we will communicate in real time in the future. Students living in regional areas will not have to move to the cities to get specialist education. They still may want to-that is fine-but they will be able to receive their education via access to two-way interactive, high-definition, real-time videoconferencing from where they are. In a range of other areas, people will be able to telework from home. The coalition are seeking to further delay something they were not able to deliver. They had 12 years, but they were not able to deliver anything. There were attempts, stops and starts and failed policies, but they hardly delivered anything, particularly in regional areas. It has to be a national program to make sure that we are plugged into broadband that can access the internet at speeds that are as fast as possible. Otherwise Australia will not progress but will be held behind. This whole nonsense of the National Broadband Network Financial Transparency Bill 2010 and a select committee is just another case of delay. Network Financial Transparency Bill 2010, introduced by the Hon. Malcolm Turnbull. I support this bill because the residents of my electorate of Bonner support access to fast, affordable broadband. Availability of and access to broadband services is arguably one of the most contentious and frustrating issues for the residents of Bonner. Many residents-especially those who live in the suburbs of Mackenzie, Wakerley, Gumdale, Ransome, and parts of MAIN COMMITTEE",289,National Broadband Network Financial Transparency Bill 2010
317,Mr Vasta (Bonner) (7.49 Pm),"I rise to speak in support of the National BroadbandWynnum-Manly and Carindale-do not have access to any broadband, let alone faster broadband. The majority of those households do not care about the politics of the situation; all they want is to be able to access the internet reliably, quickly and, most importantly, at a reasonable and competitive price. What they do not want is to wait for up to eight years for technology and service that may be well out of date and, at the same time, is likely to contribute significantly to Australia’s debt burden. That is why I support this bill, which requires the publication of a 10-year business case for the NBN and, even more importantly, refers the NBN project to the Productivity Commission for a thorough cost-benefit analysis. As others on this side of the chamber have noted, this is not a delaying tactic or an attempt to hold back the NBN. It is simply an attempt to establish the facts and allow an impartial body to assess whether or not this investment-the largest investment of taxpayers’ funds in infrastructure in our history-is a good idea. I know that there is growing pressure amongst the business community for the government to undertake a thorough cost-benefit analysis of the NBN project. But, closer to home, my constituents constantly remind me that every dollar that this government spends belongs to the taxpayers of Australia. The coalition is beholden to the community to act as responsible guardians for every cent of taxpayers’ money, given that the government has repeatedly refused to undertake a cost-benefit analysis of this NBN project. This government has even refused to refer the NBN to its own, newly-created, specialist infrastructure agency, Infrastructure Australia. The organisation created by this Labor government, and tasked with developing a blueprint for modernising the nation’s transport, water, energy and communications infrastructure, has been refused the ability to scrutinise the biggest infrastructure investment in our nation’s history. The Productivity Commission is strictly non-partisan, and is the best possible organisation to ask what the implications of this project are going to be. It is staffed by experts who understand economics but also understand the importance of factoring in non-financial costs and benefits, such as spillovers from and the social consequences of various policy choices. It is astonishing to the coalition and, particularly, to the residents of Bonner that a government is proposing to spend so much money with so little consideration or analysis-particularly when this is against the backdrop of the waste and inefficiency that has been the hallmark of other Labor projects like the home insulation debacle, the green loans scheme, and the Building the Education Revolution school halls fiasco. An encouraging example of a broadband project that has undertaken a cost-benefit analysis can be found in my home town of Brisbane, where the Lord Mayor of Brisbane and the Brisbane City Council are working with international technology firm is Asia-Pacific to facilitate the rollout of a fibre-optic network that has the potential to deliver broadband faster and more effectively than the NBN. I am looking forward to working with the lord mayor to ensure that this exciting alternative proposal is given the full support that it deserves. Nevertheless, this government’s NBN is going to be an eight-year, $43-billion project. Surely it deserves a rigorous cost-benefit analysis. It would be morally reprehensible and beyond financial recklessness for this parliament not to pass legislation for this government to allow the Productivity Commission-an independent and expert source of advice on economic and regulatory issues-to make an assessment of this investment. The public deserves MAIN COMMITTEE to know that their money has been well spent. Our economy cannot afford another BER debacle. band Network Financial Transparency Bill 2010. The detail of this bill is what I would suggest the honourable member for Wentworth should have put in his private member’s motion, to establish the joint select committee on the very same topic. It calls for the delay of the National Broadband Network to, amongst other things, develop a 10-year business plan-and to what end? The member for Wentworth’s list of objectives includes the opposition’s obsession: a consideration of the different options by which broadband services of particular speeds could be made available to all Australians. The opposition is not set on any telecommunications infrastructure. Quite the opposite: the opposition’s purpose is to do anything they can to kill the project. They are seeking to bury it in a study which will consume all clarity and also the intention of the private member’s motion. I recently read some newspaper articles reporting on a motion of this House that referred a substantial communications matter to a committee for investigation-somewhat similar to what the member for Wentworth is attempting to do with this bill and his private member’s motion. The newspaper was an issue of the Argus, from Melbourne, of Saturday, 20 November 1920. To find anything comparable to what the member for Wentworth is doing, we need to look back into the depths of history, over half a century ago. The motion called on the Public Works Committee to enquire into the erection of trunk lines between Sydney and Melbourne and, through another motion, between Sydney and Brisbane. In the debate of these motions, as reported, the then Postmaster-General, the Honourable Mr Wise, is said to have been: … surprised to learn that there was not a trunk line already in existence between Brisbane and Sydney, and that one extended only from Brisbane to Wallangarra, on the border between Queensland and New South Wales. This was not the only communications matter to have been referred by motion to the committee for investigation. In 1931, the Joint Standing Committee on Public Works reported on the establishment of telephone communication between mainland Victoria and Tasmania. In 1929, the same committee had reported on the radical proposal of the establishment of telephone communication between Perth and the eastern states. It may come as no surprise that this report recommended the establishment of telephone communication between Perth and the eastern states even though it would cost the Australian taxpayer back then the grand sum of £69,800, and this was at the start of the Great Depression. It was estimated to give rise to only 50 calls per day. I thank the Brisbane Courier Mail for the report of Friday, 30 August 1929. While these investigations were supported and the reports were favourable, I can only imagine what the results would have been if the current member for Wentworth had pursued his current tactics back in 1929 and in 1931 when those inquiries were taking place. One can only imagine where we would be if the Public Works Committee had come back, after years of delay, saying what the member has been saying today. If they had said that connecting Perth was too expensive and not justifiable, given apparent demand for the service, or if they had concluded that telephone technology was changing too fast for them to invest prematurely, right there and then, one can just imagine the member for Wentworth objecting and MAIN COMMITTEE",291,National Broadband Network Financial Transparency Bill 2010

We can just imagine the member for Wentworth saying, ‘Perth can wait for the telephone. The Great Depression makes contact with WA simply a waste of money.’ I can just imagine him as saying: ‘Now is not the time. Demand is only 50 calls per day. The profit is not sufficient. The business case has not been made.’ One can only imagine where we would be now if the member for Wentworth was able to do then what he is attempting to do now. We all have access to the parliament’s modern system of governance and accountability of government business entities. It has served several governments and multiple parliaments well for many years, just as it continues to do today. Matters concerning government business entities are questioned through debates on annual reports, auditors reports and budget estimates. In addition, the Senate holds its own studies and conducts its own analysis. They have done several on the NBN already. There is nothing new to see. The motivation for this bill and the private member’s motion can only be seen as totally obstructionist. The tactic is exploratory delay(Time expired) Dr JENSEN (Tangney) (7.59 pm)-The NBN is the single largest infrastructure investment in our nation’s history, yet this government refuses to do a cost-benefit analysis and will not publish any business case. No Australian government has ever been allowed to invest so much money with so little scrutiny or accountability. Given Julia Gillard’s record of rolling out government programs, she should not be allowed to do so now. Senator Conroy claims that the ACCC has carried out an analysis of the NBN and that is enough to argue the government’s case. But this was not a cost-benefit analysis and it has not considered alternative solutions. Coalition colleagues and government and crossbench members must support Mr Turnbull’s private member’s bill to hold to account Australia’s biggest ever infrastructure project. The shadow minister for communications and broadband has introduced his National Broadband Network Financial Transparency Bill 2010 to ensure the NBN faces rigorous scrutiny. This bill includes a requirement for the production and publication of a detailed 10-year business plan, including key financial and operational indicators.

Without any taxpayer funding, the greenfield fibre operators of Australia have already connected over 300,000 homes and businesses with advanced telephony, broadband and other services. The greenfield fibre operators have invited NBN Co. to discuss how it intends to operate as a fibre-to-the-premises, open-access network provider whilst complying with laws protecting fair competition in the market.

319,Dr Jensen,"Is the NBN the most cost-effective way of providing all Australians withThe federal government has given their answer loud and clear, with telecommunications legislation reintroduced into parliament which exempts NBN Co. from the provisions of the Trade Practices Act. As well, Telstra will be contractually obligated not to compete with NBN Co. This includes not providing telephone or broadband services across its HFC pay television cables, an existing network that passes almost 30 per cent of the nation’s households and is capable of delivering 100 megabits. NBN Co. has been nothing but incompetent in its design and deployment. Overengineering is costing the taxpayer billions. Despite statements to the contrary, there are three fibres to every home. The cost to physically install, terminate and manage this fibre is hugely expensive, as NBN Co. is laying four individual 100 millimetre conduits from the exchange to the fibre distribution housing. This is hundreds of kilometres of excess fibre installed for possible use down the track and four times the amount of conduit required. The optical network terminal will be located inside each premises. At a recent luncheon it was realised that, for NBN Co. to achieve smart grid applications, this terminal must be outside the premises to get connection. Installation of the NBN will not be free to the home, either. It is estimated conservatively that it will cost between $2,000 and $3,000 for contractors to install conduit and fibre to the home, and this cost will fall to the consumer. This will require using approved contractors. The coalition understands in an information age access to enhanced broadband services is vital to improve the provision of health, education, social inclusion and economic developments around Australia. The coalition is all for advanced technology and new technology, but the casemix must be part fibre, part wireless, part whatever new technologies emerge. We are proponents of a fiscal network that can be adapted and upgraded as technologies improve. Using fibre as a solution for all Australian households, inner city, regional and rural, does not provide the most economic and efficient solution to the problem. Funding a project without a business plan and cost analysis is poor business practice and an irresponsible allocation of taxpayer funds. (Time expired) named National Broadband Network Financial Transparency Bill 2010. I do so in full realisation that in my three years as a member of parliament this is the first bill I have ever spoken against. I am also a little disappointed that the member for Wentworth has used this place for a political point-scoring exercise rather than for true cooperative governance. Other members have used the improved private members opportunities to bring about constructive reformslike the member for Dennison’s , achieved through the Evidence Amendment (Journalists’ Privilege) Bill 2010, a bill that I proudly supported. However, unfortunately, this bill is more of a political muckraker. Nevertheless, you have got to feel for the member for Wentworth-normally a constructive, cooperative, progressive and technologically savvy member of this House, but that was before he took on the job of opposition spokesperson for communications, aka the NBN wrecker. He claims this bill is not about delay, but we all remember the commission he was given by the opposition leader, the member for Warringah: ‘Go forth, Malcolm, and destroy the NBN.’ Like a thief in the night, the member for Wentworth comes with his wrecking ball, this bill, to destroy and kill the National Broadband Network. MAIN COMMITTEE",294,National Broadband Network Financial Transparency Bill 2010
320,Mr Perrett (Moreton) (8.16 Pm),"I rise to voice my opposition to the OrwellianWe have a Leader of the Opposition, a self-confessed technophobe, who, when he hears about a broadband approaching, looks to the heavens and reaches for his raincoat. At the moment there are people at home downloading TV shows and movies, but the member for Warringah goes home to his video machine to watch Weekend at Bernie’s-and it is on a beta video recorder; not even a VHS. No-one expects politicians to be experts at everything, even though some of us probably claim to be from time to time. Not you, of course, Deputy Speaker Vamvakinou, although I know that you are an expert at many things. But you do not need to understand the technology to understand how important high-speed broadband is for bringing the bush closer to essential services, for increasing productivity, for the economy, for new global business opportunities, for e-health-and the list goes on. You do not need to be Bill Gates or a tech-head to understand how important this infrastructure is to Australia’s future; you just need to be a good listener. If the member for Wentworth and the Leader of the Opposition would listen, they would understand how valuable this national broadband network is now and into the future. They would appreciate the revolution that high-speed broadband will bring to households, that it will bring to businesses, that it will bring to schools and hospitals-whether the hospital is in Brisbane or Barcaldine or anywhere in the bush in between. There is no escaping the fact that this is a major, once-in-a-generation infrastructure build. There is no escaping the fact that there is a significant cost involved in delivering this kind of infrastructure, but it is well worth it. There are, of course, significant costs involved because, apart from our east coast, Australia is a very sparsely populated continent. In fact, Australia as a nation is ranked 233 on the population density scale. That is alongside countries like the Western Sahara and Greenland. But the tyranny of distance did not stop us from delivering road and rail. They were big challenges from two centuries ago. Similarly, when it comes to broadband we have distance in front of us but we can overcome it. It has not stopped Australians from delivering phone lines and neither should it stop us from delivering a world-class, high-speed broadband network. If anything, Australia’s remoteness compels us to build the National Broadband Network. That is where we will increase productivity. When we look at the changeover in productivity from when the Rudd government came to power, we are looking at productivity of zero. Anyone who understands economics knows that that is no way to build the jobs of the future. zero. I am therefore compelled to oppose this bill.

I urge those opposite to get on board with this fantastic once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. work Financial Transparency Bill 2010. Let me start by making it clear that this is not about one vision versus nothing; it is about a choice between two different visions facing Australia. The first is the monopolisation and return to a state owned enterprise using the same structure that was the old Telecom Australia. It is extraordinary that in the 21st century we are having put before Australia-as the OECD pointed out only in the last 24 hours-the return to a grand telecommunications state-owned monopoly. The alternative view is about technology which moves with time. It is about making sure that we are not adopting a single frozen, static form of technology. We know that we have seen an erosion in fixed-line services throughout Australia in the last 18 months, in the last 36 months, in the last five years, and that the pace of that change is gathering exponentially-and what does this mean? It means that the technology of the future is wireless and our vision is, amongst other things, of the world’s best wireless network. So we have two visions in play here: firstly, the return to a state owned monopoly, which is an extraordinary thing in a Western democracy in the 21st century; and, secondly, a competitive regime such as has been taken on board in Malaysia, for example. We aim to provide incentives to ensure that we have the world’s best wireless technology, which fits with the very fact that every day the proportion of fixed lines in Australian homes and Australian businesses is beginning to collapse. History is already beginning to bypass that which is being proposed by the government at this moment. So that is the set of visions. This bill in particular is about truth and transparency, and there are two fundamental elements to it. Firstly, there is the notion that we must have a genuine business case. I know about the work of McKinsey. I am from McKinsey, and their work is good work but the constraints they were given in the scoping study were: how would you make something like this work? They were not asked to determine what would be the best model. They were not even asked to determine whether this model could work; they were only given the constraints: what assumptions would you have to make in order for the NBN to function? The assumptions they made were heroic in relation to, firstly, the take-up rate; secondly, the charge-out rate; thirdly, the ongoing costs; and, fourthly, the costs in relation to capital structure. So it is absolutely clear that in terms of truthfulness we must know the genuine business case and be able to compare it with an alternative use of the same amount of capital. We must also be in a position to put this before the Productivity Commission in order to do just as the government has done today-that is, to ensure that we look at the most efficient way to deliver abatement of greenhouse gases within Australia. That is the principal of ensuring there is truthfulness. And we know, having met just this day with the CEO of the National Electrical and Communications Association, that the likely cost to homeowners will be anywhere between $2,000 and $3,000, or even up to $4,000, for wiring because when the box stops at the door that is not it; the home still has to be wired. In order to maintain parity of speed, it will cost between $2,000 and $3,000, and even $4,000, per home. This brings me to the last issue. I have lived through the Home Insulation Program and the Green Loans program, and now we have the unfolding cash-for-clunkers program-witness the waste of those programs on a monumental scale. What we are beginning to witness here is MAIN COMMITTEE",296,National Broadband Network Financial Transparency Bill 2010
325,Mr Hunt (Flinders) (8.21 Pm),"I am delighted to address the National Broadband Netthe unfolding of a level of waste which will have an additional zero on the level of cost. This will freeze Australia’s telecommunications in a static format at a time when the world is moving to wireless. It is a structure that is frozen. It is a structure that has not been adopted in any other equivalent way. I know that in the United States they are moving increasingly to a wireless and satellite based network. That is the way of the future. There is no competition here in the technology or the provider. This bill is a start down the path to both those. nancial Transparency Bill 2010 and like the member for Moreton, who has already spoken in this debate, this is the first bill I have ever spoken against in this House. This private member’s bill presented by the member for Wentworth is nothing more than a politically motivated attempt to undermine the quantum leap in Australia’s communication network that is the National Broadband Network. This private member’s bill seeks the publication of a 10-year business case for the NBN and referral of the NBN project to the Productivity Commission for a cost-benefit analysis. The NBN has a clear plan to deliver broadband to 93 per cent of homes through fibre and seven per cent through other methods such as satellite. A business case for the rollout of the NBN has already been made and verified. McKinseyKPMG were employed to conduct a thorough, independent cost-benefit analysis of the NBN. As the member for Flinders very recently said in this place, ‘Their work is good work’. The $25 million report, the National Broadband Network implementation study, reached its conclusion that the National Broadband Network can be delivered within the cost envelope proposed by the government. The report covers 11 chapters, looking into such issues as technology, the rollout time lines, competition, markets and funding. McKinsey-KPMG consulted with a range of experts and held extensive industry and stakeholder consultation to conduct this comprehensive analysis. Why do we need another cost-benefit analysis? The NBN has delivered extensive plans and will continue to update the community on the plans for the rollout of the NBN. NBN Co. is a Commonwealth company and bears a statutory requirement to submit financial reports, directors reports and auditors reports on its operations. NBN Co. is obliged to prepare a corporate plan, at least annually, for the responsible minister and that plan must cover a minimum period of three years. Matters covered by the plan include assumptions about the business environment in which it operates, its investment and financing, strategies for managing financial risk, financial targets and projections from the company. The existing obligations on NBN Co. in terms of developing plans and reporting progress are extensive, and the bill presented by the member for Wentworth will only duplicate the extensive work completed and the future obligations on the NBN. The member for Wentworth has indicated he will present a further private member’s bill to create a joint select committee drawn from both houses to oversee the rollout of the NBN. This will effectively duplicate the work already undertaken by the Senate Select Committee on the National Broadband Network. It was back on 25 June 2008 that the Senate established the Select Committee on the National Broadband Network. This select committee has provided four interim reports to the Senate: on 2 December 2008, 12 May 2009, 26 November 2009 and 18 May 2010. Each report involved extensive consultation with stakeholders and the community. MAIN COMMITTEE",297,National Broadband Network Financial Transparency Bill 2010
326,Mr Symon (Deakin) (8.26 Pm),"I speak against the National Broadband Network FiSo what is it that the member for Wentworth is trying to delay? The NBN, as I have said, will connect 93 per cent of all Australian premises with fibre-based services, with another seven per cent connected with next generation wireless and satellite technologies with speeds of up to 100 megabits per second. Recent tests held between April and September 2010 show the average home broadband connection in Australia clocked a speed of up to 4.2 megabits per second. For many households though, especially in the outer suburbs, it is way below this figure, very much dependent on how far away you are from your local exchange. The NBN speed over fibre will be almost 20 times the current speed. The implications of that for home, business and study needs are quite remarkable. Recently there has been a lot of talk of economic reform. The NBN will deliver the massive boost that we need now and in the future to enable small-scale businesses to compete nationally and internationally. This private member’s bill, moved by the member for Wentworth, again highlights a short-sighted obsession with attacking the valuable economic reforms that the Labor government is delivering. The Liberal Party’s opposition to the NBN flies in the face of widespread support for this quantum leap in Australia’s communications network, and I urge the House to reject this private member’s bill. Financial Transparency Bill 2010, which will require the government to prepare and publish a business case and a cost benefit analysis of the proposed National Broadband Network. The bill will allow for the application of some long overdue rigour and analysis of the assumptions behind the biggest-ever single project expenditure in the nation’s history. It is simply staggering that the government and the minister would be prepared to spend up to $43 billion of taxpayer funds without considering options or trying to quantify the benefits to the community. The bill comes with impeccable timing, with information from the OECD advising the government to abandon the National Broadband Network government monopoly, because it locks out competition to fibre, and to put the NBN through a rigorous cost-benefit analysis, along with all big infrastructure projects. The OECD concerns echo the coalition’s: value for money, appropriateness of the system, the locking out of competitors and competing technologies, what a reasonable rate of return would be on capital and linked inextricably with the likely value of the network once it is established. I am particularly concerned about how my constituency in regional Australia will be affected. While the government now says it will focus on regional Australia, an examination of the detail of the proposed rollout shows the patchiness of the planned coverage with many towns and communities set to miss out on the fibre-optic network. AndI would point out that a town like Streaky Bay, with a population in excess of 1,500, is not designated to join to the fibre. It is worth recapping how we arrived at this place. You may recall a time in 2007 when Australia had a telco, Telstra, which was ready to roll out a new high-speed service to urban Australia at the company’s cost. The coalition government had committed to a wireless network to deliver speeds of 12 megabytes with the taxpayer paying just $958 million. The contracts were signed and OPEL was to match that. The Labor Party was not happy with this deal and promised to build a 12 megabytes fibre-to-the node network to 98 per cent of Australians. In the end that deal collapsed. After 18 torturous months, they then proclaimed-without even blushing-that failure as an outstanding success and committed the government to a $43 billion fibre-to-the-house network for 90 per cent of Australians. Had they learnt anything? Had MAIN COMMITTEE",298,National Broadband Network Financial Transparency Bill 2010

It is worth remembering there are no more potential customers for the $43 billion project than the $10 billion model, and industry could not make the sums stack up on that. So here we are today with the government so committed to its rhetoric, so embarrassed by its failure to deliver on a wide range of policy areas, that it is determined to push ahead with a project that may yet be the biggest waste of public funds ever-even overshadowing the abysmal BER school halls project. When the government spends money it does not spend its own money; it is spending taxpayers’ money and it is morally bound to make sure the money is being well spent-that the mechanics, building workers, shop assistants and nurses who pay tax are getting value for money and the services they need. The problem with this network is that we simply do not know that, and that is because the government has not been prepared to take due diligence on this project. If we are to spend $43 billion, either that network will need to supply an adequate return on capital or we will need to accept the investment as taxpayer write-off. We have no real idea what the pricing structure for access is likely to be but we can be sure that the more expensive the service, the lower the take-up-and the lower the take-up the higher the price will be for the service. In effect, this process is self-defeating and it is inevitable. The other alternative I mentioned is simply for the taxpayer to write off the investment. The government has said that sometime after the NBN’s establishment it intends to sell off the network to a private operator. The question then will be: what will it be worth? It can only be worth what someone is prepared to pay and they will only pay an amount determined by the earnings. We cannot responsibly build this network without taking true regard for its worth and benefit. The government should immediately commission a cost-benefit analysis and I fully endorse this bill. Ms BRODTMANN (Canberra) (8.36 pm)-I rise tonight in support of the National Broadband Network and to defend it from those who seek to destroy it. The NBN is a significant investment in the future infrastructure and technological needs of this nation. The Gillard government is committed to investing in the latest technologies so that all Australians can fully participate in the information revolution. To contrast with this, those opposite take pot shots at the NBN and feign concern about transparency and adequate process. They do this because they know they have no viable alternative. It is far easier for them to attack the NBN than to create an alternative vision that the Leader of the Opposition-by his own admission-does not understand. My electorate of Canberra embraces the NBN. The people of my electorate understand its potential and I am already fielding questions from them about how and when it will be rolled out in Canberra and what it is going to look like. The impact that this will have on people’s lives is well understood in my electorate. The people of my electorate understand the significance that the NBN will have in improving the delivery of health outcomes. In particular, I would like to draw attention to the efforts of HealthCube, which was founded by two Canberra doctors who believed IT services could be used to improve the outcome of patients in aged care. This service is already on the cutting edge of what can be done with technology. Just imagine what could be done if they had access to the NBN. MAIN COMMITTEE The people of my electorate also understand the impact that the NBN would have on education in schools, where students would be able to gain information quickly to collaborate with other schools and students not just down the hall but also around the world. Seniors in my electorate also understand the significance of the NBN. During the election campaign and since then I have been pleasantly surprised by the number of older Australians who have approached me and commended the government on the NBN. They speak to me about the potential of the NBN to connect them to their communities and to their families, their grandchildren and their great-grandchildren, to allow them to gain information and engage with the world in spite of their age and mobility. They speak to me about the ability of the NBN to link them to health care and to provide them with better health outcomes. These are just some of the innovations and opportunities provided by the NBN, but there are many more. The NBN is not just important for the things that we can think of now; it is important for all the innovations and new ideas we have not thought of yet that will become a reality in the decades to come with just a little bit of imagination. Who would have thought the internet would turn into the powerhouse it is now? I remember that in India 15 years ago there was one service provider and 120 connections. Now look at what has happened. You can do your retail therapy on it. You can Facebook on it. You can do everything. Who would have thought that 15 years ago? Who would have thought when the telephone was introduced to Australia in the 19th century that we would have a global economy dependent on that little bit of copper wire? The NBN is as much about the next 50 years as it is about the next five. The Gillard government is positioning Australia for the next wave of innovation in technology and communication. My electorate understands this. The people of Canberra understand this. Sadly, the opposition does not. While those opposite might like to say this debate is about transparency, it is in reality about one side having a positive vision for the future and one side trying to destroy that vision. The NBN has been reviewed by McKinsey and Co. and KPMG. They both endorsed it. They found that it would transform the lives of Australians, that it is achievable and viable and that it would provide a good return on investment. This is an exciting opportunity and development for this country, and I am proud to be part of the government that has developed this vision. I am proud to be able to go back to my electorate of Canberra and talk about the positive change the NBN will bring to all sorts of people across the electorate. I am proud to be able to speak about the advances in the delivery of education and health care and the new jobs that will be made possible by the NBN-including jobs that we cannot even think of at the moment. I have no doubt that these advances will stand up to the test of history. Then what will those opposite be able to say? How will history judge them? The NBN is too important a project to get bogged down in the standard partisan politics. I accept there is a place for appropriate parliamentary scrutiny and oversight. However, that is not what this bill is for. This bill seeks to use legitimate parliamentary processes for illegitimate means. The National Broadband Network Financial Transparency Bill 2010 is about the member for Wentworth carrying out the mandate given to him by the Leader of the Opposition to destroy the NBN. The Australian people deserve better than that. The people of Canberra deserve better than that. I urge the committee to support the NBN and to reject this bill. MAIN COMMITTEE ment to the National Broadband Network Financial Transparency Bill 2010. I have a great deal of respect for the new member for Canberra, but how can she say that this is all about Tony Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition, trying to destroy the bill? Why would a study by the Productivity Commission destroy the bill, unless it is flawed? Let’s have a quick look at the history of this bill. Before the election before last, Labor promised us a telecommunications system for the whole of this country for $4.7 billion. That was reasonable, I suppose, in the circumstances. We were offering a scheme at $2 billion. When they got into power, it suddenly became $43 billion. How can you get a cost that multiplies nine times and not be a bit suspicious about its integrity? If any reasonable person wanted to have a house built and the builder said, ‘Look, it’s going to cost you nine times that,’ they would say, ‘Jeez, I want to have a look at the figures.’ That is the first thing they would ask for. Compare that with what we offered: first, OPEL. If OPEL had gone ahead back then, 90 per cent of Australia would now have 12 megabits of wireless coverage. It might not be the flashest, the biggest or the longest network, but how many people in Australia at that stage were getting more than three, two or one megabits, or half a megabit? The answer is 12 per cent. In the interregnum between the last election and when the government was formed, five telecommunications companies told the Independents they could do it for $3 billion-not $43 billion but $3 billion. When you have variations of that magnitude, isn’t testing the right thing to do? Does the government want the system tested? Oh, no-it cannot be submitted to the government’s own Infrastructure Australia, which they lauded as begin the great testing model for all the big, national projects! Is there a bigger national project than this? ‘Oh, no, we can’t subject it to that.’ In the government’s bill, we find that the Public Works Committee is specifically precluded from examining it. Why would the government cut out Infrastructure Australia and their own Public Works Committee unless they had something to hide, something that was really wrong with this thing? With what the government has offered, we will get about 93 per cent coverage. There is no mention of the other seven per cent, the people out in the bush. When will we get there? In eight years-assuming it stays on target and the costs do not blow out. Lots of people think the cost will not stop at $43 billion. Some estimate it might get to $60 billion. WhatI like about the Turnbull bill is that in clause 5 of the bill you can see some of the things he wants to look at. One of the interesting things is in paragraph (b) to look at different options for broadband services at particular speeds across Australia. Would you not think that was fundamental? And then in paragraph (f) a consideration of what the likely realisable value of the NBN would be if you sell it. The test of whether $43 billion is the right figure is when someone like the Productivity Commission, expert in this field, is able to tell you whether or not you can get $43 billion or better when you want to sell it in five years time. Why would you not want to have that information? Then in paragraph (g) an examination of the design, construction and operating arrangements of the project. I remember them stringing the cables for pay TV and half Australia was up in arms about it. Now we are going to string the fibreoptic cable from telegraph pole to telegraph pole in hot weather, in cyclones, in storms-how long is that fibre-optic cable going to last? That is something else that could be examined unMAIN COMMITTEE",299,National Broadband Network Financial Transparency Bill 2010
328,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (8.41 Pm),"I am just gobsmacked at the attitude of the governder this Productivity Commission inquiry. The government has been caught out. This scheme that the government is putting up is a fraud. The examination bill should be considered. Ms SMYTH (La Trobe) (8.46 pm)-I stand to speak against the National Broadband Network Financial Transparency Bill 2010, presented by the member for Wentworth. I am pleased to be able to speak in any debate on the National Broadband Network but it is terribly disappointing to be here this evening speaking on a bill which is quite clearly designed to delay the rollout of the NBN and to delay the consequent benefits that will come with an NBN being rolled out into our community. It is once again a delaying and obfuscatory tactic. It is quite at odds with the expectations of ordinary Australians, and certainly Australians with whom I have spoken in my electorate, both during the federal election campaign and since then, who are increasingly frustrated that the NBN will not be progressing as quickly as they had hoped, assuming that the opposition’s tactics displayed this evening remain. During the election campaign La Trobe residents raised with me reliable, affordable internet access as being a core issue in our area. Those residents are very much aware of the significance of the NBN, in terms of both their children’s educational opportunities and the possibilities for business through efficiency and employment opportunities. Increasingly, they are becoming aware of the prospects for better healthcare delivery and the prospects for saving time, energy and considerable resources in what might otherwise be fairly lengthy travel to their employment or their businesses. The NBN will allow La Trobe businesses to service effectively their local, interstate and international clients. Residents, and importantly local government representatives in my electorate, are very keenly aware of the need to try to minimise travel time and to minimise traffic congestion each day on major arterials. The NBN would enable more of those residents to tele-work from home and would enable improved workplace flexibility. It is also likely to mean that some of those living in more remote parts of La Trobe-bearing in mind that my electorate spans much of the eastern and south-eastern fringe of Melbourne-will be able to seek job opportunities and stay in their local communities without the need for extensive travel. I am thinking particularly of areas in my electorate such as Upper Beaconsfield, Cockatoo, Emerald, Menzies Creek, Officer and Pakenham on the outer reaches of my electorate who stand to benefit from the availability of optic fibre and substantially faster internet speeds. The frustration of people in those particular suburbs is raised with me quite regularly in relation to the existing standard of their internet services. It is particularly significant that in La Trobe the NBN could enable health services to provide residents in remote locations with specialist advice without those residents needing to travel long distances. I am particularly thinking of elderly residents and those who are transport limited on the outer fringes of my electorate. The other thing that I know local residents in my electorate are keenly aware of is the prospect of jobs associated with the rollout of the NBN. We have had the Building the Education Revolution once again maligned in the debate this evening in comments from the other sideand I am sure that those who have commented negatively on the Building the Education Revolution also malign the jobs that were created by it. Similarly, in relation to the NBN, we know that its construction is expected to support on average 25,000 jobs each year over the life of the project. Of course, the opposition have not really been effective advocates for job opportunities in my electorate and in other electorates around the country. They still cannot MAIN COMMITTEE appreciate the value of our nation-building stimulus package in creating and supporting local jobs at a time of financial crisis, so I suppose I should not anticipate that they are going to change their tack this evening. They might be more inclined to at least acknowledge the views of the Australian Local Government Association, which estimated in 2008 that around $3.2 billion and 33,000 jobs had been lost to Australian businesses during a 12-month period due to inadequate broadband infrastructure-but, then again, perhaps even that will not convince them. As so many of us have regularly observed, the opposition are simply intent on wrecking and delaying meaningful reform-and this is yet another example of that. Broadband Network Financial Transparency Bill 2010. With any major project, it is important to understand the need to maintain a sound theoretical approach. Costs, benefits, safety and quality must be paramount, especially in the case of introducing a new technology. It is reasonable for Australians to expect that this occurs not only with the NBN but with all major projects. Listening to the speakers on this bill from the government side, it is not clear that the government understands what this bill is about. The government speakers have focused on the need for high-speed internet and its broad accessibility and adoption. The opposition do not disagree, but we on this side of the chamber know that a successful implementation of any major project depends on thorough analysis. The National Broadband Network Financial Transparency Bill 2010 will require the publication of a 10-year business plan for the NBN and refer the NBN project to the Productivity Commission for a thorough cost-benefit analysis. This is the largest investment of taxpayers’ dollars in our history. We must ensure that taxpayers receive value for money; to simply guess that they will be receiving good value without the figures in front of us is irresponsible and a dereliction of our duty as their representatives. The largest investment that most private investors make is the family home. As individuals we would quite rightly be critical of someone making such an investment without due diligence, and we would be unsurprised and perhaps unsympathetic if things did not work out as they expected. We must hold ourselves to the same standard as individuals themselves would, or should, with their own hard earned funds. Taxpayers’ funds are not to be experimented with; expenditure on their behalf is not to be rushed. The NBN is the single largest infrastructure investment in Australia’s history. This extraordinary outlay has been justified on the basis of its contribution to our economic future. But where is the evidence of this future economic contribution? The government has repeatedly justified the enormous cost on the basis of the project’s claimed contribution to our economic growth-and does so without real evidence, without examples and without the analysis behind them to back up its claims. The government cannot point to its own success in the small rollout in Tasmania as an example. If the Tasmanian experience is a microcosm of a nationwide rollout then it is hard to argue that further investigation is not required. This project is full of unanswered questions. It is not clear how the project will be commercially viable and the costs for the consumer are unclear. We have seen this government’s fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants style of governance many times before. Their failed projects, which were much less extravagant than the NBN, failed partly because they were designed with haste, without due diligence and without proper consultation. The Green Loans scheme has left individual’s dreams in tatters, with their faith in MAIN COMMITTEE",302,National Broadband Network Financial Transparency Bill 2010
329,Mrs Andrews (Mcpherson) (8.51 Pm),"I rise to speak in support of the Nationalthis government irreparably damaged and no tangible evidence of improvement to our environment. The school halls that had to be built right now, whether the schools really wanted them or not, suffered from cost blow-out after cost blow-out. Worst of all was the roof insulation scheme, which resulted in true tragedy for several Australian families. It seems ludicrous that the government would make the case that cost is one of the prohibitive factors in delivering a proper investigation into the NBN. We are looking at a $43 billion project here. Surely the government would acknowledge that, in a project of this size, there is the potential for costs to blow out. When a cost blow-out of as little as one per cent places a half billion dollar impost on the Australian taxpayer, there is no excuse for lack of proper planning and research. A figure of one per cent of the estimated outlay for the NBN resembles a figure not unlike that committed to the expansion of the Pacific Motorway in my electorate of McPherson, firstly by the Howard government and then matched by the then opposition. The economic impact of these funds was quantifiable-and easily so. It meant doubling the capacity of the M1 in the south of the electorate right through to the New South Wales border. It would have meant faster and therefore less costly transport as semi-trailers entered Queensland. The impact on the lifestyle of residents may not be as easily quantifiable but it is easily identified, especially by those who sit daily in slow-moving traffic. This is but one example of the opportunity cost of the outlay on a project such as this. The government must justify the opportunity cost of the NBN-not only the already outlayed expenditure but also the possible differential from the budgeted figure. No project of this size should ever occur without oversight. We owe the Australian taxpayer the greatest care with their dollars and I urge the House to support this bill. about our future. It is about understanding the great opportunities and the benefits for all areas of the economy as well as for personal and social development. The debate on the NBN and the National Broadband Network Financial Transparency Bill 2010 is about a contrast of thinking. As I said in my speech on the address-in-reply, mankind is divided between the party of conservatism and the party of innovation and between the past and the future. The NBN is further evidence of this. It is a contrast between believing that a high speed broadband network is crucial for a prosperous future, as the Labor Party does, or that communicating using two Milo tins joined by a piece of string is good enough, which is what the opposition believes. The German government, led by the conservative CDU Party of Chancellor Angela Merkel-the sister party to the opposition-stated last year that high-speed broadband networks that enabled the rapid exchange of information and knowledge are crucial for economic growth. Angela Merkel was right. The coalition, in opposing the NBN, are plainly wrong. They claim they want transparency and scrutiny, but at every step they have blocked and delayed reforms that will benefit all Australians. Let us recognise the opposition’s stunts for what they really are: they are causing delay for millions of Australians in getting a fairer deal on broadband and telecommunications services. During election doorknocking in South Morang in my electorate, almost every single person I spoke to raised with me the issues they were having getting access to fast, reliable high-speed broadband. I recall Mr Joe Cilmi, a resident of South Morang. He runs a small business at home dealing with education. Mr Cilmi faces exorbitant prices using a substandard wireless MAIN COMMITTEE",304,National Broadband Network Financial Transparency Bill 2010
330,Mr Mitchell (Mcewen) (8.56 Pm),"The issue of the National Broadband Network isconnection while trying to run his business and feed his family. The NBN rollout to South Morang is a huge win for this growing suburb. It will also open up the competitive landscape to retailer service providers that have not been able to extend their broadband services to our area. Let us remember that South Morang is only 26 kilometres from Melbourne’s CBD. Many sectors of the community, including local government, are already making decisions based on NBN’s future. In my own electorate, the City of Whittlesea is using its planning powers to encourage developers and telecommunication carriers to build a fibre-optic network in new estates. The council should be commended for its progressive thinking and planning, because it just does not make sense to build new homes that use all the latest approaches to save energy, technology and water and not be fibre-optic ready. There are so many other important benefits to the NBN program. For example, it will allow better emergency service and disaster relief systems to be developed and put in place. In my bushfire-prone electorate, this may help save lives if disaster strikes. The government must be commended for its forward-thinking innovation and its understanding of how high speed broadband will be crucial for social and community development in rural and remote Australia as well as for our long-term economic thinking. I stand proud in support of the NBN. I note it is of great benefit to the people of McEwen and other regional Australians across the country. has expired.

333,Mr Wyatt (Hasluck) (9.00 Pm),"I rise to speak on small businesses within Hasluck. Thehas been achieved through both their vision and their plan. They have injected over $1.22 billion into the community and created over 7,500 jobs. Contrast this positivity to the handbrake that Labor is pulling on our economy. There are real impacts on small businesses in the electorate of Hasluck from Labor’s failed policies. When I was doorknocking and meeting with smallto medium-business owners, this was a common theme. They spoke of the uncertainty in planning for expansion against the economic constraints that they were facing in respect of government borrowings being $100 million a day, thereby reducing their capacity to draw down on loans to expand their businesses. One business in Hasluck told me that, once the mineral resource rent tax was announced, his company’s worth plummeted from a turnover of $25 million to under $7 million. In making some tough decisions, he has had to lay off staff and reduce the remaining staff to part-time positions. This means people have been laid off and families’ futures are hanging in the balance, particularly with mortgages, costs for education and daily living requirements. Additionally, a carbon tax will hurt local businesses even further. These are real people employing real families. They are not numbers taken from a focus group. It gets worse under Labor. A carbon tax would mean that pensioners in Hasluck, many of them veterans and people who have paid taxes all their lives, will face rises in electricity bills and the flow-on costs that would come from that for all manufactured items and other goods and services. Another example of Labor’s ill-advised policies is GP superclinics. These impact on viable practices that already exist within the region. These practices were built up by dedicated general practitioners over a number of years and the capital infrastructure was developed by them-no-one subsidised them. They were not gifted a government building. These practices have a number of elements that in essence are the making of a GP superclinic. What is disappointing is that they were not considered in the mix during the establishment of the Midland GP superclinic and, to that end, they now face competition from a government sponsored GP superclinic practice that impacts on their many years of hard work building up a client base that they have served very effectively and efficiently over a period of two or three decades. Their approach to engaging with their clientele is premised on family centred and individual focus practice but also providing an opportunity for high-quality care. Why should established decades-old practices be placed at risk of financial ruin if proposed government funded GP superclinics open in direct competition to them? Why not negotiate for expanded services that meet the proposed requirements for a GP superclinic? That would be in a very different context that allows private enterprise and their hard work and good will to be harnessed to be part of a new direction. Why is Labor so keen on reinventing the wheel at a cost of millions and to the detriment of taxpayers and to business owners? GPs and practice managers in Hasluck have told me and Dr Andrew Southcott, who visited recently, that they are best placed to take care of their patients and not corporate GP superclinics looking at profits as opposed to the primary care that they provide. The facilities are already there. The patients already go to that practice. All they need is a comparatively minor injection of cash to add to their infrastructure and the range of services they provide. Instead, millions upon millions will be given to anticompetitive businesses to the detriment of established practices. This type of government intervention only hurts GPs. Why should they spend their own money to build a practice MAIN COMMITTEE in an area with the threat of Labor dropping a government backed competitor across the road? This is just another example of the failure of Labor’s economic policies. Hasluck has many small to medium businesses that support the minerals and energy sector, and they play a crucial role in contributing to the WA and Australian economy. They also provide employment opportunities, training and skills development for apprentices. This key role is supported by the community within Hasluck. Adverse policies will kill off the goose that helps to lay the golden eggs that establishes a strong and vibrant economy in this country. These are not just words; they are real people with real lives paying very real taxes to a government that makes policy on a whim and treats their money with reckless abandon. Small businesses within Hasluck provide the supporting infrastructure to the mining sector and contribute to the development of significant projects within Western Australia. On the announcement of the mining tax these companies felt the reverberations of that proposed decision. Small business provides the backbone to the Australian economy. There are also new businesses in Hasluck that look at new opportunities and develop technology that supports the mining sector. In that expansion they are also looking at partnerships and collaborative arrangements with overseas companies who also want to be involved in the economic boom and growth of Western Australia’s economy. Many of the negotiations that they undertake are premised on two things: one is growing a business so that they are effective and can contribute, but secondly there is also a social dividend that they want to give back to the communities they serve and in which they provide resources and services. Government decisions can impact with negative flow-on effects that undermine the growth of businesses. Hasluck has a number of small businesses. It has GP practices and has families who premised their undertakings in an economy in which policy is consistent and supportive of what they wish to develop as part of their future. It is to this end that I would certainly ask that the Labor government consider the flow-on impacts to small businesses, because it is they who feel the immediate impact. I do not think that we, at a time of global economic change, can afford to have our businesses being affected by decisions that are sometimes taken at the whim of a government. I strongly support and will work closely with the small businesses of Hasluck to ensure that they get access to the right level of advice, the resources required and the opportunity to expand so as to contribute to the community in which they work but more importantly to continue to support the economic growth of both Western Australia and Australia within a global economy. Page Electorate: Australian Broadcasting Corporation Page Electorate: Telstra Page Electorate: Clarence River Advertising Food Additives Media Violence Coal Seam Gas Projects Ms SAFFIN (Page) (9.10 pm)-I have a whole range of grievances that I want to raise tonight. There are so many that I am not sure where to start. Some are local and some are international. First of all, I am aggrieved that Rural Reporter has been taken off the ABC radio in MAIN COMMITTEE Lismore. I have a long letter explaining how the area is still going to be covered from Port Macquarie et cetera, but I am not sure that that can happen in practice, and that aggrieves me because a lot of rural people-not just farmers but particularly farmers-rely on that. Having a dedicated Rural Reporter program every morning is something that we have had for a long, long time. So that is one of the things that aggrieve me. I am also aggrieved-and I have spoken about it in this place before-that Telstra is axing 108 jobs out of its Grafton business call centre, one of the best call centres. They say the jobs are going to Melbourne and to Brisbane. You can imagine how aggrieved I feel, as a rural resident, about that going to the big city. I am not even sure they are going there. That is an ongoing issue. I am also aggrieved about all the people who want to get their hands on the Clarence River. You might have heard that there is a lot of debate about the Murray-Darling Basin. To be sure there is a lot of work to be done there, but people have waxed and waned for years about wanting to divert the Clarence, take it overland and do all sorts of things to get water out of it. I have spoken before but it does not go away. People keep talking about it here. What we say in the Clarence Valley is: not a drop. It was the Daily Examiner that coined that phrase. There are stickers everywhere: not a drop. I note in today’s Daily Examiner that the Clarence Valley Council meeting last night again registered their strong opposition to plans to divert water from the Clarence River catchment. The mayor, Councillor Richie Williamson, said: The result of any crazy scheme to divert the Clarence would be that instead of having one river system that is on its knees environmentally, socially and economically (the Murray-Darling) you would instead have two systems in a similar state. It is one of those options that I know will go before the parliament, but it is just really silly to be looking at that system. Another issue in my local area-and particularly with families and mothers-is junk food and, pertinently, junk food advertising aimed at our children. There is a bombardment of advertising for junk food. Wouldn’t it be lovely to see a bombardment of advertising for really healthy food, the foods that we need every day? Instead it is just junk food ad after junk food ad after junk food ad-lots of as. It is everywhere you go. I know it has received lots of coverage in the media and in various newspapers and on TV as well. One of the things that I always find amusing is that the advertising companies always say they have research that shows that it really does not have a great impact on the take-up of children buying it or their parents buying it for them. Why do they do it? Why do they spend millions on advertising that does not work? That is just absolute nonsense-nonsensical. It does not make sense. We know that we are all influenced by the power of the media and particularly advertising. You know that when you have heard a song and it stays in your head all day. That happens to all of us-you cannot stop singing or thinking the last line you heard. That happens with our children as well. You have mums and dads and families trying to promote healthy eating and make sure that the kids eat those foods, yet they have to contend with this absolute bombardment, because that is all that they have. Sticking with what happens with children-our kids-there is the issue not only of the junk food but also of the poisons and colourings that are put in food. We have seen recently that Food Standards Australia New Zealand, FSANZ, along with its American counterpart, the Food and Drug Administration, are looking at the findings of some research that was conMAIN COMMITTEE ducted by the Centre for Science in the Public Interest. That is a US body that recommended common colours be banned. Think of all the foods. I am sure you go to the supermarket to do your shopping, Mr Deputy Speaker, and when you are there I know that you would see all of those foods and all of those wonderful bright colours. When you walk past a doughnut-not that I like doughnuts-you can look at all that bright colouring. A lot of us spend time in airports and we see lots of doughnuts with pink, green and yellow colouring. We know that for some children those colours really affect their behaviour. That is known. There is documentation about that. How can this stuff be good for you? I am not telling adults what they should or should not eat but in terms of our kids it really is a problem. There is always the research, and this particular research is also saying that there may be a link to cancer. I say that with some degree of hesitation, because we read headlines in the paper telling us that nearly everything we do, eat or look at can be linked to some ill health or cancer. But the principle here has to be the precautionary principle-we are talking about our kids’ health. If in doubt, we have to make sure that we do everything we possibly can to keep them safe. I am not saying that we should bring them up just on carrots and celery alone, but they need a healthy diet. Something else that aggrieves me and, I know, a lot of parents, and it is something that is a matter of great debate in the community, is the violence in lyrics and games, and coming through phones, subjecting children to lots of violence. Again, I read research from people who have done studies on it and they talk about the impact that it can have on children’s cognition when they are exposed to that on a regular basis. Given that our children do watch a lot of television and do have a lot of games and access to phones-we live in a sort of technoconnected world-there is even more of that bombardment coming through. We cannot ban everything but we really have to debate these issues more and look for solutions. The people who make these things have to be more responsible, as advertisers do. Everybody is saying that we have to legislate everything-and yes, there is a place for legislation; that is absolutely clear-but there has to be some responsibility put back on others who make these things and make money out of them. Another issue that has come up in my electorate is the issue of coal seam gas. I know that is erupting all over Australia and it is hard to work out what is fact and what is fiction in the debate, but there are certainly issues raised around the issue of fracking. Fracking is not a new thing; it is a rather old process but there is clearlyway? children. Is there an intention by you to take that up with Minister Roxon so that the Australian Health Ministers Council can look at a direction with respect to the issues you raise? either taken up or do take up, but it is on the agenda as well. It is a serious issue. this chamber is supposed to be more spontaneous and I think this is a good procedure. MAIN COMMITTEE",306,Grievance Debate

The Right Start nities across Australia who are working tirelessly to effect change for the better in the lives of others. The Right Start is one such group of people I am proud to say are living and working to effect positive change for young families who face the joys and challenges of having children born with Down syndrome. The Right Start was established in 2009 as a support group for parents who had given birth to children with Down and enables mothers and fathers to share in the highs and lows of raising a young child with Down. This organisation is small and, although it has its beginnings as a support group run by mothers of children with Down, for mothers of children with Down, this marvellous group of women, refuse to accept that more cannot be done. I will give you a small illustration of what these women have achieved so far. Mrs Glenda Graban, the founder and voice of The Right Start in the Wollondilly and Macarthur region, came to the office of the former member for Macarthur, the honourable Pat Farmer MP, in early 2009 to discuss a technical issue she was having with a government department at that time. She just so happened to mention to the staff that she had just given birth to a little boy, Jake, who she discovered had been born with Down syndrome. Jake was a blessing and that he had Down syndrome made absolutely no difference to the love she and her husband felt for him. It just meant that they would have to make some adjustments to their lives that they had not expected to make. She told the staff that several weeks after she had come home from the hospital she received a letter from the New South Wales Department of Health. The letter contained a certificate that stated that Jake had been placed on the birth defects register to acknowledge that he had Down syndrome. She showed the staff the document and said that she felt very strongly that this sort of letter from the government did not seem right and she could only imagine what effect the receipt of such a document would have on a young family who were struggling to cope with the discovery that their child had Down syndrome or any other form of disability, such as cerebral palsy. The staff advised her to make representations to the New South Wales health minister and that if she was unsuccessful in that she should rally community support through the media, as the New South Wales Labor government had up to that point not made any moves to change the insensitive wording of such an important document. As Glenda has said, the term ‘defect’ is something that you refer to if something is wrong with your car, not a child who is born with a condition that is out of their control. So Glenda had to pursue her fight through the media to change this document. As an aside, it is disappointing to note that in this modern political landscape an ordinary citizen has to go to the extreme of having to generate her own media campaign because bureaucrats in government departments lack the common decency and sensitivity to right a wrong. Thankfully, her media campaign was successful, and in New South Wales parents will no longer have the government deem their children as defective. Instead, parents will be informed that their child MAIN COMMITTEE",310,Grievance Debate

341,Mr Schultz (Hume) (9.20 Pm),"There are a tremendous number of people in commuhas been placed on what is now called the congenital conditions register and they have Mrs Glenda Graban to thank for that. I think the whole House would agree that this was a victory for common sense and decency, but Glenda’s experience of giving birth to a child with Down syndrome shaped her call to action with other mothers in the Wollondilly-Macarthur region. Their shared experiences are as one and tell a story of a system in New South Wales where there is a lack of early intervention support dedicated to children with Down syndrome. It is a system that provides minimal, if any, support to new parents who may be struggling with the notion of having a child with Down syndrome. It is a system that fails to adequately inform families of children with Down syndrome about programs and assistance that is available to them, aside from their local paediatrician or general practitioner. The recognition that there was a dire need in communities such as the WollondillyMacarthur region for a service for families with Down syndrome is what led Glenda Graban and other just as dedicated mothers to form the organisation The Right Start. I have had had several meetings with The Right Start-one of which was with the then shadow minister for child care and women, the member for Murray-and the current member for Macarthur in which The Right Start has outlined its future plans to expand the purview of the group to incorporate government recognised and approved early intervention programs for children with Down syndrome in conjunction with establishing a centre to operate these programs from. Thus far, through the tireless work of the men and women involved in The Right Start, the organisation has managed to raise just on $25,000 in their own right and are pleased to announce the staff from Coles grocery stores in the region have matched that effort by raising an equivalent $25,000, bringing the total fundraising effort in one year to $50,000, with the aim of reaching $150,000 for the purchase of a house to establish a centre by March 2011. Considering The Right Start has only been up and running for just over 12 months, it is a tremendous effort and all involved ought to be congratulated for their efforts. However, more can be done, and I believe that more can certainly be done from a federal government perspective, to assist these brave women in any way we can. According to the New South Wales Department of Health, 53 of the 171 children born with Down syndrome in 2008-09, or nearly one third, lived in the south-west Wollondilly-Macarthur region. If there is ever to be a centre for families who have children with Down syndrome, it should be in the region I and the member for Macarthur represent. I have alerted the Minister for Families, Housing and Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, the Hon. Jenny Macklin MP, to the work of this outstanding organisation and have commended to her the benefits of directing federal government funding towards making the centre The Right Start wishes to establish a pilot program. These discussions will hopefully continue, and I wish to acknowledge the minister’s open-mindedness to this proposal thus far. It is encouraging to see that the federal government made a commitment to early intervention for children with disabilities in the A Better Start in Life for Children with Disability commitment that directs funding of up to $12,000 up to their sixth birthday to children who have conditions such as blindness, fragile X syndrome and Down syndrome. This commitment from the Labor government at the election was for this money to be spent on early intervention programs such as the one that The Right Start is proposing. MAIN COMMITTEE I am significantly impressed with the efforts that The Right Start have made themselves to establish their own centre for over 30 per cent of the families in New South Wales who have children with Down syndrome. Glenda Graban and her team of dedicated individuals and families have recognised there is a gap in support for families with children with Down syndrome and have made tremendous strides to ensure this gap is closed. Their work ought to be encouraged and rewarded by government, which has the capacity to provide that support. I look forward to continuing my representations along with the member for Macarthur to have The Right Start given the support and the funds necessary to have its programs and centre established with government assistance as either a pilot program or as a program recognised for funding under the federal government’s A Better Start for Children with Disability program. Either way, Glenda Graban has certainly shown what can be achieved when recognising that a wrong should be righted, and her commitment should be a healthy reminder to all Australians of the need to assist our own. Braddon Electorate: Hospitals don. This is always an issue in my electorate, as it is in many other members’ electorates, but I want to focus in particular on hospitals and, even more particularly, on the lack of cancer services in my region. My region has some of the poorest health indices not only in Tasmania but also, unfortunately, in Australia-comparable in some instances to the Northern Territory. Generally, the issue of health is associated with hospitals. There is a decided relationship between being crook and going to the outpatients or the emergency ward of our hospitals. You may well remember that, in the 2007 election, an iconic, if you like, election issue was made out of the former Prime Minister John Howard coming to the electorate of Braddon and announcing that the federal government, the Howard government at that stage, would take over the Mersey hospital-with all the implications that that had. Ironically, I suppose, that was a precursor to what the Rudd government looked at, and the Gillard government is now looking at, as part of the health and hospitals reform. Unfortunately the issue in 2007 was essentially, and forgive me for saying this, a political ploy-a stunt-to help the coalition retain the seat of Braddon. I understand that in politics all things are possible. I thought, however, that the idea was not good health policy. However, that is what happened and the Tasmanian state government acceded to that political demand and, for one dollar, sold the Mersey hospital to the Commonwealth. There was no planning associated with it-plenty of rhetoric but no planning-and the then Minister for Health and Ageing, Tony Abbott, knew nothing about the region and was against it but, like a good political party acolyte, set to work to try and make it happen. There was some talk of $45 million per year-not that we knew many of the figuresassociated with the Commonwealth takeover. Whatever the case may have been, the Rudd opposition-soon to become the Rudd government-acceded to the Tasmanian government’s wish and to the Commonwealth government’s wish and honoured the agreement. In government, we set about to implement Commonwealth ownership of the Mersey Community Hospital. We have committed $180 million over three years to that hospital. It was nothing like the $45 million that was originally talked about. In time and through a very cooperative approach, finally with the state government rather than with a private provider, the Mersey Community Hospital has been integrated into the MAIN COMMITTEE",311,Grievance Debate
342,Mr Sidebottom (Braddon) (9.29 Pm),"TonightI want to talk about health in BradTasmanian health plan and most especially into the North West Area Health Service for health and well-being in my region. I am really pleased that we have been able to achieve that. So from straight out political stuntsmanship there has been a good outcome. The Mersey Community Hospital has grown and evolved. The suspicions-which I cannot relate now, but they have a long history-between Mersey Community Hospital and the North West Regional Hospital, formerly Burnie Regional Hospital, have melted away and there is tremendous cooperation between the two. The Mersey Community Hospital is now playing a really important and significant role in the provision of good and safe health services for the north-west coast of Tassie. I congratulate everyone who has played a part in making this happen. The Mersey Community Hospital has now gone on to develop a terrific reputation for the surgery it does. It provides an HDU, which has been relocated, through a funding arrangement and in partnership with the state government, to provide very good high-dependency-unit services and I congratulate them. Endoscopy also is a specialist area of the Mersey Community Hospital-and indeed statewide. So that has been a good story but full of a lot of political angst. The other area that has been full of political angst has been the provision of cancer services. In 2007, Kevin Rudd as opposition leader came to Braddon and committed $7.7 million to the provision of a linear accelerator to the north of Tasmania with a preference to the north-west. Unfortunately the north-west was not able or capable of providing those services without a lot more investment both from the state and the Commonwealth. That linear accelerator went to the north of Tasmania and it was viewed as a broken promise, particularly on my part, and I can understand a lot of the community angst associated with it. More recently, the federal government committed about $5.4 million along with the state government to provide a regional cancer centre for the North West Regional Hospital, and I congratulate them for that. It was intended to try and provide a range of chemotherapy chairs, service provision and a million dollars, also by the Commonwealth, for an MRI machine. We also committed $3 million to the provision of new residential care units at the North West Regional Hospital in Burnie. During the last election campaign, Tony Abbott arrived and promised $7 million for a linear accelerator. As I mentioned earlier, it is not possible to provide a linear accelerator for $7 million without the bunker and the physical infrastructure that goes with it. The Liberals also then made a promise to provide it by 2013, which beggars belief and reaches the height of cynicism in terms of politicising health. The federal government, through Minister Roxon and particularly through Prime Minister Gillard, made a further commitment of $16.5 million to provide a linear accelerator and a bunker and associated services to bring about comprehensive cancer services to the north-west. So that was on top of what was essentially $16.5 million from the state and federal governments prior to this to provide a north-west cancer centre and the provision of comprehensive radiation services when it is safe to provide these services. An expert committee has been appointed to advise on the provision of these services. I look forward, along with the people of the north-west coast, to the provision of more comprehensive services. I congratulate everyone for the integrated health services that we have been able to bring about because of the north-west health area plan. I also thank the federal Labor government for the $10 million towards the Tasmanian patient transport scheme MAIN COMMITTEE along with other important investments in health in my region. I hope we can continue to work together to bring about safe and reliable services into the future. remind the member for Braddon of standing order 64, which provides that he ought not to refer to other honourable members by their personal names; they should be referred to by their electorate or title. Gippsland Lakes Landcare several issues of concern to the people of Gippsland in relation to both the federal election and the current state election that we are faced with in Victoria. The first issue I wish to raise relates to the future management of Gippsland Lakes and the catchment of the lakes system. Under the current arrangements, the Victorian state government has primary responsibility for the Gippsland Lakes. The Gippsland Lakes Taskforce was, I believe, established in 2002. At that time, the Victorian state government allocated in the order of $3.2 million per year to assist in practical environmental projects to enhance the environment of the Gippsland Lakes and to reduce the amount of nutrients entering the system. The CSIRO had undertaken an audit of the Gippsland Lakes and its catchment areas and had found that the system was in dire need of funding support to reduce the amount of nutrients that leave the agricultural land but also which run off our streets and towns and enter the waterways and then go down through the lake system. The target was set to reduce the amount of nutrients by 40 per cent by 2020. To its credit, the state government allocated $3.2 million per year over a four-year period to target that type of work. It is fair to say that the landholders, particularly in the Macalister Irrigation District, and our farmers in the dairy sector made an enormous effort with that seed funding provided by the state government and then used their own capital to invest in whole-of-farm plans to find ways to reduce the amount of fertiliser, for example, that was leaving their properties and entering our waterways. Over that period of four years, a lot of great work was done by our landholders leveraging off the amount of money that they had been provided by the federal government. From 2006 to 2009 the state government reduced that amount of funding to $6 million, or $2 million per year, and then in 2009 the recurrent funding was ceased altogether. This was from a state Labor government that claims to care about the future of the Gippsland Lakes and its catchment areas. There is no recurrent funding in the current Brumby Labor state government budget for the Gippsland Lakes Taskforce. It is a disgrace, and the people of Gippsland know when they are being short-changed. The federal government has in the past also made commitments to the Gippsland Lakes. Under the previous coalition government, there was money allocated through the Natural Heritage Trust and under the previous Rudd government there was $3 million allocated over a period of three years. That funding has been exhausted as well. So we are faced with the situation where the Gippsland Lakes and its catchment areas have no recurrent funding on offer from either the federal Labor government or the state Labor government. These are wetlands, lakes and rivers which are recognised internationally. The wetlands of the Gippsland Lakes MAIN COMMITTEE",313,Grievance Debate

As I referred to earlier, we are in the middle of a state election campaign in Victoria. To me, the future health and the management of the Gippsland Lakes system are critical issues facing the people of Gippsland. The state Labor government has made no policy commitments whatsoever in relation to the Gippsland Lakes. I am very mindful of the fact that we are going to go to the election in about 10 days time, and the people of Gippsland will have no idea what this Brumby Labor government is prepared to do in terms of practical environmental works to protect and enhance the Gippsland Lakes system. To their credit, the state Liberal and National candidates have met with local community groups, environmental organisations and the agencies involved in delivering services in Gippsland, and I believe they will be making a positive announcement in the days ahead. I cannot pre-empt that announcement but I am well aware of the fact that they have been meeting with different agencies and community groups with a view to making an announcement to provide some recurrent funding for the Gippsland Lakes system. SoI am very hopeful that that will happen in the days ahead. It will give the people in the state seat of Gippsland East, the people in the state seat of Gippsland South and the people in the state seat of Morwell a clear choice between the Liberal and National candidates and a Labor Party which talks a lot about the environment but delivers precious little in terms of direct action on the ground. This is the same Labor Party that comes in here and lectures us day after day about the great moral challenge of climate change and indulges in propaganda advertising campaigns on climate change but in the same budget cuts the funding for Landcare by $11 million over the forward estimates. I refer to Landcare quite deliberately, because it is another area that I grieve for in this House. We have in Australia 100,000 volunteers from different Landcare organisations. I think there are about 4,000 different Landcare organisations across Australia. Last year we celebrated the 20th anniversary of Landcare. There probably is not another environmental organisation in Australia that has contributed more in terms of direct and practical environmental action than Landcare. If you happen to get a chance to look at the brochures or the newsletters sent out by members opposite, you will see plenty of photos of them with their local Landcare groups, planting trees and joining in that sort of activity. But when it comes to actually providing the funding to support Landcare into the future the government goes missing in action again. Eleven million dollars was cut from the budget this year for Landcare-$11 million which could have been used to hire the facilitators, who then leverage their good work and work with the volunteers to deliver that practical action on the ground. I condemn the Labor government for its failure to invest in the future of Landcare and deliver those valuable projects in regional communities. It is the people who live in those rural communities-the landholders, the farmers-who are prepared to give up their time and do that direct action in terms of planting trees, erosion control, eliminating pest weeds and doing their best to reduce the impact of feral animals on our national landscape. On a more positive note, in the time. I have left to me I would like to refer to a recent community action day that I organised in my community with the support of the Nationals candiMAIN COMMITTEE date for Gippsland East, a gentleman by the name of Tim Bull. Tim and I organised a clean-up day on the Gippsland Lakes because we wanted to prove to the government that the people of Gippsland are so interested in the future health of this system that they are prepared to give up their time to clean up after other people who neglect their responsibilities and leave rubbish lying around. We had about 50 people join us in this clean-up activity. While you would say that having 50 people who are prepared to turn up and help clean up rubbish was a success, the fact that we were able to find so much rubbish in such a short time along the foreshore at Lakes Entrance and at Metung and Paynesville was quite disheartening. Of greatest concern to me was the state of our riverbanks-we went to the Tambo River and the Mitchell River. A local volunteer and I walked along a 200or 300-metre section of riverbank and we filled six 30-kilo bags with beer bottles, nappies, newspapers, plastic cans and assorted debris that had been left behind by, I assume, recreational anglers. I believe that the vast majority of recreational anglers using our waterways and our river systems do so in a responsible manner, but when you can find that much rubbish lying around in one small section of riverbank I am greatly worried about what we would find if we went along all the popular riverbanks throughout Australia and started picking up the rubbish that has been left behind. My concern is that our riverbanks in many parts of our community are being treated like tips. If the results from that small section of riverbank are repeated in other parts of our community it would be fair to say that we have an enormous task ahead of us. We have a problem in Victoria in that the responsible agencies have taken away a lot of the rubbish bins from most of the riverbanks. It is a deliberate public policy, the view being that, if you take the rubbish in, you should take it out yourself. That might work well for the responsible people in our community, but there are some irresponsible elements who will just throw the rubbish up on the bank-and it seems to me that, once you get a little bit of rubbish there, you will accumulate more. It is nothing to go along to a tree and find 20 or 30 empty stubbies sitting there or a pile of plastic bags in the one place. It seems to me that, once people see a bit of rubbish, they are prepared to keep adding to it. I have raised these issues tonight in the context of urging both state and federal governments to invest more in practical environmental action. We have groups like Landcare and the volunteers who were prepared to join me on a community action day. These are people in our community who are prepared to do the responsible thing but there will always be an element in our community who will treat the environment with contempt. The government needs to work with the people who have the interests of our waterways at heart. SoI urge both the Victorian and federal governments to start backing up their rhetoric with direct action by supporting Landcare and other organisations which protect and maintain the environment of the Gippsland region. Shortland Electorate: Aged Care Ms HALL (Shortland) (9.49 pm)-I have a second-year social work student, Sara Lambert, on placement in my office at the moment. She has been working there since September. During the time she has been on placement in my office she has done some constituent work. She has also organised two forums-one on breast cancer and the other a seniors forumboth of which were attended by about 300 people. In addition to that she had a major project, which was to complete a study within the electorate. She has done that and has put together a fantastic report, You are only as old as you MAIN COMMITTEE feel. It is 29 pages, well researched, footnoted and an excellent piece of work. In addition to that, I have asked her to write a speech for me that talks a little bit about her study. The words I am about to read are not my words; they are Sara’s. You will not believe that she is a secondyear social work student. You would think that she was a fourth-year student. The quality of her work and her ability to handle the many tasks that she has been given in the electorate office have shown that she will be a fantastic social worker when she completes her studies. These are Sara’s words: Australia has seen a 167 per cent growth in the proportion of older people in the population in the past two decades. This has been especially felt in the Shortland electorate where people over the age of 65 currently make up 17 per cent of the population compared to the national average of 13 per cent. This places stress on the provision and accessing of aged-care services in the Shortland electorate as well as on where funding and planning needs to be focused both now and the future. This project aimed to investigate the main barriers to services in both the Shortland electorate and Australia wide and figure out where the gaps in service provision and access lie both presently and in the future. After countless hours of reading, integrating and drawing conclusions, it became clear that the older population in the Shortland electorate is at a severe disadvantage due to ageist attitudes throughout all levels of societal structures. Unfortunately, in Australia ageing is socially and culturally defined. Local newspapers and programs in the Shortland electorate and throughout Australia classify all older people as dependent and frail, individuals who contribute little to society. This project however sought to dispel these negative stereotypes and focus on promoting the attitude that each and every individual will live their lives at their own pace whilst coping with natural and biological changes that occur to each and every person throughout their lives. When looking specifically at health, older people encompass a large part of the disease and injury burden in Australia and in the Shortland electorate. Whilst figures clearly show this and attitudes in society reflect this, many older people suffer from at least one type of chronic illness and actually report their satisfaction with life as fairly high. These types of points especially highlight the need for an attitudinal shift in society to reflect these individuals are capable of living independently within their means and the sooner this shift can occur the sooner more services can be upgraded, expanded and catered to meet the rights and needs of every older Australian in the Shortland electorate and the wider Australian community. Another large concern this report found was in relation to mental health problems in the older population. In 2007-08, mental health was recorded as the ninth most common long-term health condition in the over-65 population. When looked at next to the fact that suicide rates in people over the age of 65 are higher than any other age group, it becomes obvious that there needs to be a significant increase in services which target older people as well as younger people. Unfortunately today’s society has seen mental health focus switch to prevention and early intervention. These mainly target younger individuals and whilst new services have been emerging in recent years most are catering towards youth. This blatantly ignores the older population and their mental health problems. Policies and planning need to shift the focus in the near future to providing long-term commitments to mental health services catering at servicing the older population as well as the younger if it is to decrease the impact of mental health problems in the older population. In promoting these types of attitudes there needs to be acknowledgement paid to the many care services that operate in the Shortland electorate. Community based assessments and services promote independence and individuality by recommending and providing access to services which will help older people remain in their own homes and maintain a satisfactory quality of life as long as possible. These services are also successful in upholding the rights of every older person they come into contact with by allowing them to retain autonomy and independence by leaving all final decisions in their hands and not forcing them into situations which they may be uncomfortable or unhappy with. If these attitudes can be MAIN COMMITTEE spread through society and the work and help of these services be promoted, then it is very likely the Shortland electorate could undergo some substantial attitudinal shifts towards celebrating the older population for what they are and what they offer, not devaluing them for their perceived and stereotyped detriments. The major issue when looking at maintaining the level of service community care agencies offer is how the community care system can continue to function if there is not adequate recognition and provision for informal forms of care and support, most importantly those who offer their time and energy to care for older people without financial incentive. In 2006 there were an estimated 2.6 million carers Australia wide. Of these, around half received a government pension as their principle source of income, and many found their caring role created a barrier to employment they could not surmount. By 2031, the number of old people estimated to require informal care will grow by 60 per cent whilst the number of carers will grow by 57 per cent. If adequate informal supports for older people who require assistance-whether it be social, physical, psychological or financial-cannot be ensured, the impacts will resonate through both the formal community care services and residential care options. To ensure the success of community care packages and ageing-in-place strategies, we need to begin to focus on this most basic pillar of the system: looking after and acknowledging those who put the most time and effort into ensuring the older population is afforded the best quality of life. I strongly believe the work done by local and federal governments towards meeting this goal is exceptional, and hopefully this is representative of changes already beginning in providing adequate recognition for carers throughout all structures from governmental to organisational to societal. Whist the societal attitudinal change will be gradual and can only occur with the support of the majority, the attitudes within the aged-care service provision industry have begun to lay roots in this area which over time should continue to grow. These attitudes encourage autonomy and self-determination in all older people and enforce the positive, realistic view that older people are generally independent human beings who are capable of making decisions for themselves and going after what they want. They are simply at a different stage of the human lifespan to the remainder of society and consequently are experiencing different medical and physical ailments. This does not mean they are not still the unique, autonomous individuals they have been throughout their lives or that they do not deserve to be treated as such. We can change perceptions and lives for the better if there are enough people willing to put the effort in-and really, one day it will be all of us. What better incentive do we need to act now? You can see from those words that Sara is an exceptional young woman and that the social work profession will be very privileged to have her as one of their number. I seek leave of the House to table a copy of Sara’s report, You are only as old as you feel: impacts on Australia’s ageing population. Leave granted. Main Committee adjourned at 10.00 pm MAIN COMMITTEE Ministerial Staff: Separation Payments (Question No. 8) Mr Briggs asked the Special Minister of State, in writing, on 30 September 2010: What is the total cost of ministerial staff separation payments following (a) the change of prime ministership on 24 June 2010, and (b) the swearing in of the Government on 14 September 2010. As a result of the change of prime ministership on 24 June 2010, a total of $1,294,923.61 in separation payments was paid to personal ministerial staff whose employment was terminated under the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act 1984 following the change. As at 22 October 2010, a total of $5,430,162.84 in separation payments has been paid to personal ministerial staff whose employment was terminated following the swearing in of the new Government on 14 September 2010. Ministers and Ministerial Staff: Taxpayer Funded Flights (Question No. 11) Mr Briggs asked the Special Minister of State, in writing, on 30 September 2010: (1) Since3 December 2007, what are the names of the ministers who have taken tax-payer funded flights using Frequent Flyer points, and for each of these ministers, (a) on how many occasions did they take such flights, and (b) what was the date, time and destination of each trip. (2) Since3 December 2007, how many current ministerial staff have booked tax-payer funded flights using frequents flyer points, and on how many occasions. Airlines do not provide information to the Department of Finance and Deregulation (Finance) regarding the accumulation and usage of airline loyalty points by Ministers and Members of Parliament (Staff) Act 1984 (MOP(S) Act) employees relating to travel undertaken in the performance of their official duties.

Ministers and MOP(S) Act employees are not required to provide arrival and departure times relating to these flights. In addition, the information provided to Finance does not distinguish between Airline Loyalty Points used for entire flights or for upgrades to class of travel.

for Immigration and Citizenship, in writing, on 30 September 2010: In respect of asylum seekers processed on Christmas Island from 1 September 2008 to 30 September 2010: (a) by origin of country, how many (i) have been processed, (ii) arrived with some form of travel/identity document; and (b) of those without travel or identity documents, how (i) was their identity established, and (ii) how many of these have been given permanent resident status. (a) (i) In the period from 1 September 2008 to 30 September 2010, a total of 4110 refugee claims from irregular maritime arrivals (IMAs) have been processed. The table below gives a breakdown of the source countries for all people who had refugee claims assessed and finalised during this period.

347,Mr Bowen,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is:Country number India1 Somalia1 (ii) Approximately 18% of IMAs have been found to have some form of documentation which has assisted with establishing their identity. IMAs carrying identity documents within key caseload groups included: Afghanistan 13% Iraq 35% Iran 20% Sri Lankan Tamil 32% Burmese 40% The Afghan Taskera identity document and the Sri Lankan Identity card have been the most common documents provided by IMAs. A small number of passports and documents issued by the UNHCR, some including personal identifiers, were also provided for identity purposes. (b) (i) For people without identity or travel documents, a range of methods are used to establish their identity. All irregular maritime arrivals have their biodata and biometrics captured upon arrival. This data is tested and checked during the entry interview, and then is further explored during the Refugee Status Assessment (RSA) interview by the RSA officer. The information is also compared with other countries as part of the data sharing arrangements discussed below. RSA officers are trained to investigate all aspects of an asylum seeker’s claims, including questions of identity, through in depth questioning at interview. RSA officers must assess the credibility of all claims, including those relating to identity, as weighed against other information relevant to the case, including country of origin information. Australia has also developed strong relationships and information sharing practices with a number of countries to help to verify people’s identity, nationality, possible prior protection or criminal records and to ensure that only people who need and deserve protection are afforded protection through the refugee status assessment process. An example of these information sharing practices is that earlier this year the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship announced that Australia has signed an agreement for biomentric data sharing between Australia, the United States of America, New Zealand, Canada and the United Kingdom. Under this partnership, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship is able to securely and confidentially cross check fingerprints with Canadian, US, NZ and UK databases. These data sharing arrangements allow the Department to undertake more detailed identity enquiries if necessary, and to confirm if a client has had dealings with these countries. (ii) DIAC does not collect or aggregate statistics on people who arrive without some form of travel or identity documents in a way that can track through to identify those who are ultimately found to be refugees and are granted permanent residence. Refugee claims are considered on a case-by-case basis and while identity issues form an important part of the process, the absence of documentation is not uncommon and may not adversely affect the outcome of the case. Protection Visas (Question No. 31) Mr Morrison asked the Attorney-General, in writing, on 30th September 2010: In respect of people smuggling, have any charges been laid against permanent protection visa holders concerning (a) the provision of false or misleading statements to Commonwealth officials, and/or (b) obstruction of Commonwealth officials in relation to their inquiries; if so, can he indicate the specific charges and associated outcomes, including penalties. SinceI previously responded to this question on 11 May 2010 there have been no further charges.",325,Questions In Writing
