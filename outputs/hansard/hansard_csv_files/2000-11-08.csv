But the fact department and the Pharmacy Guild are that we have been able to do that and the fact talking about at the moment is to provide the that we have had the Pharmaceutical Benepharmacy with an electronic swipe so that fits Scheme in for so long means that people they would be able to swipe the Medicare have very little perception of the value of number, to take away the need to write the their drugs.

Anecdotes indicate that people from card. As it is at the moment, when a person overseas often have a greater understanding walks into the pharmacy they have to proof the savings or the cheap price of drugs duce their pension card, and it takes some under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme little time to write that number on.

Drugs: Cannabis for the Terminally Ill government to legalise the use of cannabis for pain relief by terminally ill patients, despite the fact that the use of cannabis is against the law in New South Wales. I have concerns about this initiative on two counts. Firstly, it is against the present law of the land; and, secondly, it sends the message that cannabis is some sort of tonic. This continues the mythology that this drug is harmless, while nothing could be further from the truth. Major Brian Watters, of the Salvation Army, got it right when he said in the Daily Telegraph on 3 November that ‘if cannabis has therapeutic components for pain relief and relief from nausea, then we should extract those ingredients and make them available in measured medical doses like any other medicine’. With estimates of about 14,000 people in New South Wales who could meet the criteria qualifying them to grow up to five plants each, this could mean that there could be around 70,000 legal plants growing in suburban backyards all over New South Wales. In what other circumstance do we allow patients to produce their own medication? How could we then have any hope of trying to lawfully control this insidious, destructive drug? Let us face it: this is really about decriminalising marijuana by degrees of stealth. It seems to me that as a people we have to decide whether or not we wish to live under the rule of law. If the answer is yes, we should totally ban illicit substances and actively do",144,Notices

If the answer is no, we might as well give up here and now and accept the consequences that come with that decision. The problem with the decriminalisation of cannabis for pain relief, as humane and compassionate as it may sound, is that it creates the impression that the smoking of cannabis is therapeutic. Young people can become enthralled by marijuana and can be led to a life of depression, hopelessness and inconsolable isolation. Many clients who are admitted to drug treatment programs identify cannabis as a factor in their addiction histories. It is also identified as a significant element in psychiatric hospital admissions. I commend the leaflet published by the Australian Medical Association titled ‘Taking a closer look at cannabis and your health-the short and long term effects’. I applaud the AMA for lending their weight and authority to the real truth behind this illicit drug. Today, there is significant scientific research and personal anecdotal evidence of users which show us that marijuana is not harmless. Promoting it as a medicine is dangerous. There are other medications which will alleviate pain for terminally ill patients without the negative, depressive, psychotic aspects of marijuana. This move is an attempt to legalise the drug by degrees, playing on our sympathy and our compassion. However, the most important aspect of the current development is that the laws are being bent for specific purposes. I say again that, sooner or later, as a people we must decide whether or not we wish to live under the rule of law. This is a real issue about which there has been no public debate. The choices we make will have real consequences for our children and for the kind of society we become. Small Business: Microcredit came to see me some months ago regarding the microcredit scheme, which members who are here today may be aware of. Microcredit is the provision of small loans to entrepreneurs too poor to qualify for loans from the mainstream financial institutions. It has proven to be an effective measure in the ongoing struggle against poverty, enabling those previously without access to credit on reasonable terms to borrow at reasonable commercial interest rates to start a small business. Over the last 25 years, microcredit programs have been established in many developing and developed countries. There are now more than 1,000 microcredit programs operating to serve more than 22 million poor families around the world, including nearly 13 million people who are among the poorest in their countries. A summit was held in relation to microcredit in February 1997. More than 2,900 people from 137 countries attended the microcredit summit held in Washington DC. The summit launched a nine-year campaign to ensure that 100 million of the world’s poorest families, especially the women of those families, are receiving credit for selfemployment and other financial and business services by 2005. I found this a very intriguing program because the basis of the program was really helping people to help themselves and doing it very much on an individual basis-or, in this case, on a microbasis. That is certainly something that is well worthwhile. I understand that funding for microcredit in Australia’s overseas aid program has increased steadily over recent years, with $6.6 million allocated in 1996-97. I do not have more recent figures than that, but my understanding is that it has generally had broad support. What also really appeals about microcredit is that it looks at the question: why would you target women? The reason you target women is that, of the 1.2 billion people living on less than $1 a day, 900 million, nearly 75 per cent, are women. Women are often responsible for the upbringing of the world’s children, and the poverty of the women generally results in the physical and social underdevelopment of their children.

What this program suggests is that there is a great deal that can be done in a situation with a lot of money being required but at the same time with small amounts of money actually making a real difference to real families right throughout the world. I certainly encourage members to have a look at this program if they are not fully au fait with it. Certainly, I refer them to the web site www.microcreditsummit.org.

Australian Labor Party: Queensland Administration) (9.48 a.m.)-In the Courier-Mail on Saturday morning sensational allegations about systemic vote rorting by ALP supporters in the electorate of Fisher in the 1987 election were outlined. Of course, it would be unrealistic to assume that such vote rorting occurred only in Fisher, and one must now ask whether marginal Labor members elected throughout the country since 1987 were in fact validly elected. Given the fact that the 1987, 1990 and 1993 elections were won by a handful of votes in a handful of seats throughout the nation, one must now realistically ask whether Labor did genuinely win those particular elections. It is interesting that Barry Large, the ALP campaign director in Fisher, said that only three people-Michael Lavarch; Barry Large; and Peter Beattie, then ALP state secretary, now Queensland Premier-were confident that Michael Lavarch would win that particular seat. We have to really ask: how was Mr Beattie aware of this particular fact? The question is: was he aware of fraudulent behaviour and did he condone it? In his autobiography In the Arena, Premier Beattie recounted his own preselection campaign for the outer Brisbane electorate of Redlands in 1986, and he observed then, first-hand, fraudulent ALP enrolments. He stated: Door knocking the area was an interesting experience. One female party member was not at home when I called on her at the vacant allotment where she purportedly lived. To my not particularly great surprise she later voted in the preselection. For the information of the chamber, Mr Beattie lost this preselection to the now member for Bowman, Mr Sciacca. Other reports of rorting by Labor in federal seats have emerged. Dr Watson recounted what happened in the electorate of Forde, now ably represented by the member present, Mrs Elson, during the 1987 election. We also have to look at the election of Cheryl Kernot in the electorate of Dickson in the poll which took place in 1998. Much of what is now Dickson was, in 1987, in the electorate of Fisher. Michael Lavarch, the victor of the rorted poll in 1987, was campaign director for Cheryl Kernot. Cheryl Kernot fell over the line by a little over 100 votes. The same enthusiastic Labor supporters, who were guilty of rorting the Fisher roll in 1987, obviously would still be present in the geographic area which became Dickson. The question the people of Queensland are now entitled to ask is: was Cheryl Kernot validly elected as the member for Dickson in 1998? The Labor Party moralised throughout the 1980s. It took the moral high ground in the area of electoral matters while, at the same time, its supporters were systematically rorting and rigging elections at federal and state levels. The people of Queensland demand answers. Premier Beattie should widen the terms of reference of the Shepherdson inquiry. What has Premier Beattie got to hide?",146,Representatives Main Committee
301,Mr Slipper (Fisher,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and22500 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 November 2000 Employment: Growth country by members on the government benches are nothing more than codswallop. The actual employment growth and the type of employment created tell a very different story. Between 1990 and 1999, the number of employed people rose by just 923,500. But, at 71.4 per cent, the overwhelming growth was in precarious casual employment. That is right: 659,800 jobs-71.4 per cent of the total jobs created-were in casual precarious labour. In fact, the total number of casual employees in Australia is not far from topping two million. Full-time permanent employment has been the traditional entry point for Australian workers to acquire a living wage, standardised working times and conditions of employment to allow for sickness and annual leave. Protection for casual employees in Australia follows the American trend of basically no protection whatsoever rather than the European trend of legislation to provide protection. Perhaps this explains why, in the USA, high wage earners have fallen from 28 per cent to 21 per cent, middle wage earners have fallen from 37 per cent to 16 per cent and low wage earners have grown from 35 per cent to 63 per cent. That is the real labour market this government is creating in Australia. Precarious casual employment has doubled from 13.3 per cent in 1982 to 26.4 per cent in 1999. At the same time as casual employment has grown, full-time employment has been decreasing. In 1990, full-time permanent employment was 73.5 per cent. It has now dropped to 63.4 per cent. Under this government precarious casual employment appears to be replacing full-time permanent employment. As far as part-time employment is concerned, casual employment stands at a quite remarkable figure of 64.6 per cent. For those employees working less than 14 hours a week, casual employment is as high as 81.8 per cent. All of that information was taken from the July 1999 ABS figures. What is often overlooked with casual employment is the distinction between short-term casuals-the true casuals-and the long-term casuals. These employees are increasingly being used by employers as permanent employees but are deprived-‘cheated’ would be a more accurate term-of the standard rights, benefits and entitlements associated with permanency. These trends are extremely worrying. With no security and no loyalty given, why would loyalty and productivity be returned? Some in the world have gone mad on investing their hard-earned cash in the American economy. Unfortunately, as far as employment is concerned, low skills, low wages and casual employment dominate the labour market in the USA and, unfortunately, Australia is mirroring those trends.

306,Mr Slipper (Fisher,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and22502 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 November 2000 Honourable members would be aware that the National Crime Authority was established in 1984 as a national crime body, exercising both state and Commonwealth functions. It is the only law enforcement agency in Australia whose investigations are not limited by jurisdictional boundaries. The authority is not confined to only investigating breaches of Commonwealth law but is empowered to investigate offences against both Commonwealth and state laws. It is a truly national body and its existence reflects the seriousness with which the Commonwealth and the states view organised crime. The decision of the High Court in the Hughes case questions the capacity of Commonwealth authorities to exercise powers and functions conferred on them by state legislation in situations where the power or function is coupled with a duty and there is no federal head of power to support that power, function or duty. The bill amends the National Crime Authority Act to ensure that when the authority is investigating offences there is a connection with a federal head of power in as many situations as possible. This is achieved by expanding the scope of Commonwealth references to include offences against a law of a state where that state offence has a federal aspect. In addition, when the authority is under a duty to investigate a matter pursuant to a state reference, then those references will be limited to matters that have a federal aspect. The bill also amends the act to clarify that the authority does not have any duty or obligation under Commonwealth law to perform any function, or exercise any power conferred by a state law, unless there is a federal aspect. The amendments will ensure that the important work of the National Crime Authority in investigating organised crime is not jeopardised by the decision of the High Court in the Hughes case. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum and a correction to the explanatory memorandum. Amendment Bill 2000, not with any great enthusiasm but in recognition that it is probably necessary to pursue a course of the kind that the government is undertaking-at least as a short-term measure to deal with the implications of the decision in R v. Hughes. The National Crime Authority Act, however, really requires a more extensive visitation. The government has had a number of reports from the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, which have made quite substantial recommendations going to the manner in which the jurisdiction of the National Crime Authority should be exercised and its powers. The government has been more than a little remiss in responding to those recommendations. It is odd that we have had a series of technical amendments to the act necessitated by court decisions which have been brought before this parliament much more quickly than the substantive recommendations of that parliamentary committee. That said, however, plainly once the decision in Hughes was made, there was a need to look at whether or not the National Crime Authority legislation required change. Nothing in Hughes is explicit on this point, but there are a number of comments by judges that imply that in future cases there may be some difficulties with the way in which the act is currently constructed and the way in which the various powers given to the authority from state and federal legislation intersect. So this legislation, which looks at some of the implications that flow from the reasoning of the judges in Hughes, seeks to anticipate possible challenges in the future, rather than dealing with them at a later stage when the court would otherwise perhaps have to grapple with those issues. I imagine it would be fairly predictable that lawyers, aware of the reasoning of the judges in Hughes, would seek to utilise that reasoning in future challenges against some of the determinations of the authority. As I say, nothing in Hughes itself explicitly diminishes or cuts down any of the conduct or reasoning or decisions of the National Crime Authority to date, but I suppose it does flash an amber warning light. This has required the government to act and the government has done so.",149,Representatives Main Committee
307,Mr Kerr (Denison) (10.01 A.m.),"The opposition supports the National Crime AuthorityWednesday, 8 November 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 22503 This bill clarifies the powers, functions and duties of the National Crime Authority. It seeks to address the points made, the weaknesses identified and the signals given in the High Court’s decision in the Hughes case. It inserts definitions of terms, including ‘federal aspect’ and ‘federally relevant activity’. It amends the definition of other terms, including ‘original reference’ and ‘related offences’. It provides for the purpose of the National Crime Authority Act when a state offence will have a federal aspect. The bill rewrites section 55A of the National Crime Authority Act to address in detail the ability of the National Crime Authority, a member or a judge of the Federal Court, to exercise powers, functions and duties. The proposed section 55A, which is the subject of this bill, does the following: provides legislative consent to conferral of certain powers, functions and duties under state law; lists the functions, duties and powers that may be conferred and clarifies that they are to be of the same kind as those conferred on the National Crime Authority, a member or a judge of the Federal Court by a Commonwealth act; specifies that a state law, to effectively confer the function of investigating a matter by the National Crime Authority, a member or a judge of the Federal Court, requires a referral by a state minister in writing, must have the approval of the Inter-Governmental Committee of the National Crime Authority and must have the consent of the Commonwealth minister; limits the functions, duties and powers that may be conferred on the National Crime Authority, a member or a judge of the Federal Court by state law-by providing for regulations to be made to specify those to be excluded; clarifies that a state law cannot purport to confer a duty that is in contravention of any constitutional doctrine; indicates that the Commonwealth does not intend to ‘cover the field’ in relation to the investigation of state offences that have a federal aspect-it provides for a state law to operate concurrently with the National Crime Authority Act if it is capable of doing so, and clarifies that the National Crime Authority can hold concurrent duties and will be able to exercise either state or Commonwealth powers; and it makes a deeming provision to safeguard the duties, powers and functions conferred immediately before the bill is enacted so that they are regarded as the same kind as those conferred in the bill. The attempt in this is pretty straightforward: it is to put the National Crime Authority back in exactly the same place as it was before the decision in the Hughes case-and I have briefings in relation to this from the minister’s advisers. They tell me that it does not make any substantive change to the scope of the National Crime Authority Act, and that is my understanding of the matter. The drafting is quite technical, and it does, unfortunately, make the bill less accessible to the reader than it was previously. But, after discussion, I suspect that little could be done to have a more elegant drafting than that which has been put forward. At a later stage, when time permits, there may be a better opportunity to find a more elegant way of expressing some of these more complex ideas, but at present I think we are just going to have to live with the fact that the legislation now is rather more complex than one would wish. Nonetheless, the end result of all the complexity was to try to get the bill back to where it was before, without all the additional verbiage. So, given that we are confronted with the result in Hughes and the implications that may flow from that, there is not much else the government could have done and not much else the opposition can do now other than to support it. We do think that there is a need for the Attorney to have the senior law officers of the Solicitor-General engage quite significantly in debate in the High Court about the narrowness of some of the decisions that are being made. The Wakim case is a good example, and Hughes is another, of a fairly narrow reading of the Constitution in areas where, as parliaments across this nation, we have sought to find better ways of cooperative federalism. I have spoken previously of the advantage there would be in the Attorney and his Solicitor General making the argument with the court directly, in a polite but engaging way, as only the 22504 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 November 2000 first law officers of the Commonwealth could, by personal appearances in these matters to make sure the Commonwealth’s position is clearly understood-but that is for a future date. This circumstance having arisen, we support the amendments and think the government has done as well as it could in the circumstances and in the time frame available. I know that the member for Moreton, who is about to speak, would join with me in urging the minister to have regard to the need to also address the substantive recommendations of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the National Crime Authority. That is far too long overdue and is a matter upon which the opposition is becoming increasingly, and quite rightly, critical. me in an unfair way. In addressing the National Crime Authority Amendment Bill 2000, I also am very conscious of the important role of parliamentary committees and the fact that, as subcommittees of the entire parliament, there tends to be a great deal of detailed work and assessment, discussion and, over time, expertise developed in various areas. WhilstI have a general lifelong philosophy that if it is good for lawyers it must be bad for everybody else, I do suspectMr Sawford interjectingexpect the member for Denison to. I think generally it is important that we try to make our laws as simple, straightforward and realistic as possible. One of the great frustrations I have, as a much avowed non-lawyer, is that there is a sluggish response to what the bad guys do. That criminals are always going to be several steps ahead of the law I guess is a matter of great tradition over many hundreds of years. Civil societies tend to consider their responses over a long period of time because, by their very nature, they want to get those responses right and correct in certainly most, if not all, cases. WhilstI agree that the views of the statutory committee need to be responded to by the government, I also accept that time should be taken to get that response correct. In regard to this matter, we have here yet another example of the bad guys getting a decision out of the High Court which, in fact, perverts what most people would have expected the National Crime Authority to do. The NCA is an organisation that had certain powers conferred on it in 1984 to exercise both Commonwealth and state functions. It is the only law enforcement agency in this country which has no jurisdictional boundaries that limit its activities and yet it is forever being caught up on jurisdictional matters. It is forever facing the prospect of difficulties, although not as far as cooperation with the various police services is concerned because in fact over the last 16 years the cooperation levels have reached an impressive level. To digress, Queensland police officers say to me individually how proud they are to work with the NCA and the Australian Federal Police to get good results in the drug law enforcement area, for instance. If you look at some of the great results that Queensland police officers have been involved in in recent years-the world record amphetamine factory which was smashed in Fortitude Valley comes to mind, with over half a million dollars worth of makings for amphetamines seized-you can certainly see that Queensland police are doing what they say. But the real jurisdictional battle tends to be with the various state laws and the inconsistency of those laws. I know that the ongoing work of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General is lifelong work. The committee itself will outlive the various Attorneys who aspire to some kind of national consistency to laws. In fact, the only fairly consistent set of laws-although various states wanted to chop and change them around-actually existing in this country relates to gun ownership, while there are no really consistent laws relating to big-ticket crimes like drugs or, in general, organised crime.

I would notWednesday, 8 November 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 22505 of Australia journal, looking at the manslaughter charge, highlighted exactly what I am saying. I stated at that time-and I do not believe it has changed: In Queensland, the maximum punishment is life imprisonment with hard labour. This is under the Queensland criminal code. In the Northern Territory and South Australia, it is life imprisonment. In New South Wales, it is 25 years. In Tasmania, it is 20 years. It is 20 years in the Australian Capital Territory and Western Australia … manslaughter. And it is 15 years in Victoria. Administration is quite correct: the remission laws also allow people who commit manslaughter under the various criminal codes to evade custody, evade the penalty, in a much shorter time than even the laws themselves prescribe in their very all over the place way. Of course, for victims of crime the penalty goes on forever. So we have a real problem in this nation that needs to be addressed. The National Crime Authority Amendment Bill 2000 highlights another one of those fiddling around the edges things that occur from time to time, but we have just got to stop fiddling around. We have actually got to look at the concept of a Commonwealth criminal code which covers a variety of these offences. We have got to look at having something that says, ‘If the state jurisdiction does not get you in an adequate way, perhaps we can prosecute you under a Commonwealth jurisdiction.’ We have got to not necessarily duplicate but rather ensure that the overlap is adequate to make certain that Australian citizens are well satisfied that their legal systemparticularly the court system, set parameters by the political system-is responding to their concerns. We offer a choice under that kind of approach to prosecutors, in the same way as workers have a choice as far as which particular industrial relations laws they would like to sign up to. In that regard there is some need to actually penalise the bad guys. In our activities as lawmakers we, as well as those who judge the law, need to look at a Commonwealth criminal code concept and to stop this fiddling around. The jurisdictional concept of turfdom, where various state authorities stamp out their various jurisdictions and do not want to budge, always wanting to have something different, is something which is only advantaging the criminal. It is certainly not advantaging the honest and decent citizens of this country. I would look forward to a further and really concentrated discussion amongst the various attorneysgeneral. Quite frankly, if they cannot get on with the job that the federal Attorney-General, Daryl Williams, is trying to achieve in his execution of his duties, the various state governments need to look closely at the personalities of their attorneys-general as they currently stand. In the same vein, we have got to look also at matters relating to our electoral laws, the basis on which we elect people, and particularly at what is occurring in the Queensland context at the moment, where, essentially, organised crime activity has been taking place over the last couple of decades by the Australian Labor Party in the way that it is rorting the enrolments in Queensland. I would view the National Crime Authority as having a potential interest in this matter. After all, the NCA, under its 1984 act, is well capable of looking into these matters. There is an organised outcome and an organised benefit, and if that does not fit the standard of an organised crime, then I do not know what does.

As to what sort of remission the people involved in this get, time will judge-although the person elected to replace the member for Fisher picked up about a million dollars worth of benefits over the period of time that he was a member of parliament. I suspect that the National Crime Authority and the important work that it does needs to be more fully supported, and it needs to be supported by a form of jurisdictional broadening. Whilst the act says there is no jurisdictional limit on it, it is nevertheless being restricted in its activities by the various state laws of this country and by the inadequacy and inconsistency of those laws. Whilst this bill is supported by both sides of the chamber, I urge the opposition to also get behind my suggestion that we need to get on with the real job and stop fiddling around the edges with various changes that we try to do in a piecemeal way as far as criminal activities in this country are concerned. As I said, the real advantage is on the side of the bad guys. It is not on the side of the average Australian, as it is not on the side of the average Queenslander, who is suffering as a result of electoral fraud at the moment and finding that their one vote does not mean as much as the 14 votes that a 16-year-old girl cast in Fisher in 1987. institutions-the parliament, the courts, and I have always talked about the media-need to be enforced and need to get on with the job of doing what the people expect, and that is to punish the wrongdoers and assist the people who do the right thing. I commend this bill to the House. Administration) (10.21 a.m.)-in reply-I thank the honourable member for Denison and the honourable member for Moreton for participating in the debate on the National Crime Authority Amendment Bill 2000. We were also very pleased to be able to provide a personal briefing to the member for Denison and I acknowledge the fact that he has recognised that he received that particular briefing. The National Crime Authority is vital to Australia’s efforts to combat organised crime and is Australia’s only true national law enforcement body whose actions are not limited by jurisdictional boundaries. It is therefore imperative that any doubt about the scope of the operations that the National Crime Authority can undertake be put beyond dispute as soon as possible. The amendments proposed by this bill are designed to provide a valid basis for the broadest possible range of NCA investigations by giving federal coverage to what it does. The bill does not otherwise change the nature of the NCA’s activities or powers. The NCA will continue to act pursuant to references. The respective roles of the Commonwealth and the states in the management of the NCA will not be changed. The matters the NCA will be empowered to investigate will continue to be decided by agreement among Commonwealth and state ministers. The honourable member for Denison in his speech referred to a number of technical amendments contained in this particular bill, but he said that there was no thorough review of the legislation. I suspect the honourable member for Denison would admit that short-term fixes have been essential to overcome the constitutional issues raised as a result of the decision of the High Court of Australia in Hughes. Legislation to implement the recommendations from the third evaluation of the NCA by the committee is being developed. As honourable members opposite would appreciate, given the cooperative nature of this scheme, consultation with the states is under way, and consultation among the states and the Commonwealth does take a considerable amount of time.

318,Mr Slipper (Fisher,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance andWednesday, 8 November 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 22507 in his contribution also referred to the need for a review to take place. The bill will enhance the operational effectiveness of the National Crime Authority. The member for Denison also suggested that the decision in Hughes inferred that there would be possible future challenges to the NCA Act, and raised the question that this bill will not be a complete fix. While the Hughes decision creates some doubt about the conferral of duties under Commonwealth-state cooperative legislative schemes on Commonwealth authorities, given the fact that the NCA’s primary reason for existence is to combat organised crime that impacts on a national level, virtually all of its activities will, in practice, have a federal aspect. The investigation of major areas of organised crime activity by the National Crime Authority, such as drug importation and tax evasion, will not be affected. The investigation of state offences that are incidental to the investigation of an offence under Commonwealth laws will also be able to continue. For example, the investigation of a murder that is incidental to international or interstate drug smuggling would not be affected. Some very narrow areas of activity that could potentially be investigated by the National Crime Authority under state law might not have a federal aspect. In these areas the National Crime Authority will continue to exercise its powers and functions under state law. I am pleased to reassure the honourable member for Denison of that particular fact. In his speech the honourable member for Moreton referred to the need for a Commonwealth criminal code. I am particularly pleased to report that the Commonwealth and states are working on a model criminal code. The current shadow minister was responsible for the enactment of the Commonwealth Criminal Code Act 1995. The minister, Senator Vanstone, just last week took through the parliament the most significant chapter of the code, the Criminal Code Amendment (Theft, Fraud, Bribery and Related Offences) Bill 1999. This is the biggest step forward yet in achieving a nationally consistent criminal code. The honourable member for Denison also suggested that there was a need for the Attorney General and senior law officers to discuss the narrow interpretation of the Constitution by the High Court. The Attorney-General, like the shadow minister, appreciates the importance of having an independent judiciary. The suggestion of approaching the court does raise some issues of extraordinary sensitivity, and I suspect that the member for Denison would concede that. However, I will reassure the shadow minister that I will draw his remarks to the attention of the office of the Attorney-General for consideration by the Attorney-General in this way. The honourable member for Moreton also referred to allegations of systemic electoral rorting and fraud by the Australian Labor Party in Queensland. Wearing the hat that I do in this debate, Mr Deputy Speaker, you will be pleased to know that I will confine myself to saying that a number of allegations about electoral fraud have been referred to the Australian Federal Police for investigation. The Australian Federal Police are assessing the information provided and, in accordance with normal practice, it would not be appropriate to comment any further on those investigations at this stage. An effective and efficient NCA is essential to Australia’s fight against organised crime and it is essential that the National Crime Authority is able to act in the broadest possible range of matters. The legislation before the chamber will ensure that the NCA is able to continue its investigatory function to the fullest extent possible. I commend the bill to the chamber. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole. 22508 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 November 2000 simply wish to clarify the point I was making with respect to the Attorney. I was seeking to convey a view that increasingly has been confirmed over recent times-that is, there would be a significant advantage if the Attorney-General, as first law officer of the Commonwealth, took it as a proper and constant course to appear as counsel in the High Court on the most important constitutional matters which go to the distribution of powers within the federal system. I do so because these are fundamental issues regarding the governance of our country. The constitutional division of powers in the Australian democratic system comprises three components of government: the executive, the legislature and the judiciary. At the highest level of the judiciary is the High Court of Australia, with the concomitant power to interpret and give effect to the Constitution. There have been a number of instances over recent times when the relationship and the functioning of federalism and the effective governance of the Commonwealth in the largest sense have been before the High Court. No person can better make the case from the point of view of the other components of that constitutional structure-the executive and the legislature-than the first law officer, the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth. I am not urging that there should be some ex cathedra, out-of-court process, but I am urging that the Attorney, and future Attorneys, have regard to this fact that there needs to be a dialogue between those institutions of governance. That can only be best effected if the actual representative of the executive appears before the court; and, incidentally, because the executive is responsible to the parliament, and the Attorney himself is responsible to the parliament, also conveys the views of the parliamentary process to the court and draws the court’s attention to the relationships and how they ought to evolve in that constitutional framework. We have moved forward a long way since 1901. But that vital, fundamental point still remains-that a functioning federal system does involve all three levels of government and we cannot have a dialogue of the deaf. No matter how well respected silk may be when it is briefed in relation to these matters, or appointed to be Solicitor-General, none carries the same weight as an Attorney-General or minister of the Crown appearing, representing directly the other levels of government before the High Court of Australia on those fundamental matters. That is the point that I was seeking to make. I think the parliamentary secretary may have misunderstood. PerhapsI did not explain it adequately in the earlier remarks that I made. Administration) (10.32 a.m.)-I thank the honourable member for Denison. The Commonwealth does, as he knows from his own ministerial experience, engage very experienced and competent counsel, including the Solicitor-General, currently David Bennett QC, and the Chief General Counsel, Henry Burmester QC, in key cases. These counsel are closely and extensively briefed by the Attorney-General’s Department, which consults closely with the office of the Attorney. The Attorney-General has himself appeared before the High Court on occasions. Of course, that is appropriate. The Attorney-General is one of the most competent lawyers in the land and certainly the most able lawyer in the parliament. As I mentioned before, I will, however, undertake to convey the thoughts of the honourable member for Denison to the office of the Attorney-General for his consideration. Bill agreed to.

320,Mr Slipper (Fisher,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance andWednesday, 8 November 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 22509 Mr O’CONNOR (Corio) (10.34 a.m.)-The Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2000 provides a range of amendments to improve access by farmers and their families to one of the federal government’s key programs for delivering income support to the farm sector. Whilst the changes proposed in this bill might appear to be minor, they are part of an ongoing process of amendment of legislation to ensure that an effective income support safety net exists for farmers who, for various reasons, find themselves financially unviable and who are faced with making extremely difficult decisions about their future in the sector. The opposition supports the legislation and will assist its passage through the parliament. In the last three decades we have witnessed an era of unprecedented structural change in Australian agriculture-changes that are not unique to the Australian experience; nevertheless they are profound. In most Western economies throughout the world, and ones with which Australia compares itself, we have seen a relative decline in agriculture as a direct employer and in the number of farm establishments. Of course, the sector still remains the most important generator of income and wealth in many regional communities. Both direct employment in the sector and the number of farms have declined, but the output of the sector has increased dramatically. The forces that have brought about this structural change are diverse. For example, the introduction of new technologies and ways of farming have seen great leaps in agricultural productivity without the associated generation of rural employment. One particular characteristic of Australian agriculture that is unique is the export orientation of many of its industries and their dependence on access to overseas markets. We can list some of the big industries in the rural sector-sugar, grains, wool, beef and, indeed, now wine-and note that all of these industries are heavily dependent on access to overseas markets, and the prices that they receive in those markets, which in turn affects the survival of enterprises and farm families in the sector. I note that the honourable member for Barker has joined us in the chamber. I mentioned the wine industry. Last night we enjoyed the output of the wine industry and heard of its spectacular growth. I must say, Madam Deputy Speaker, that I am a bit worse for wear and tear today. If at times I wander off the path, it is merely a matter of my mind wandering to those good times that we had last night in the company of the honourable member for Barker and other honourable members who enjoyed the hospitality of the Australian wine industry last night. Mr O’CONNOR-I say to the honourable member for Port Adelaide that there are perhaps some members walking around today who might testify to the opposite point of view. Anyway, a good time was had by all. Another factor that generates enormous pressure on particular areas of Australia and on particular agricultural sectors is the extreme climatic conditions that have to be endured by farmers in particular areas. Drought and flood are part and parcel of the rural landscape and the operating environment for Australian farmers. Recently, the government instituted a package of assistance for sugar farmers, mainly based in Queensland. Over the past three years floods and cyclones have devastated that industry and many farmers have gone further into debt in order to try and stay afloat. Farm enterprises have real difficulty staying afloat; they endure not only the harsh climatic conditions but also a low price for their product on the world market. In areas such as Mackay we see the emergence of diseases that are associated with those climatic conditions, and they are putting increasing pressure on producers there. It all adds to this very difficult pressure of adjustment that farmers have had to endure, not only in that region but also in others.",156,Representatives Main Committee
321,Mr Sawford,"Good wines never do you any harm.22510 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 November 2000 Also, there are decisions of government that bring pressures on the sector. We have had an example of that recently with the decision of the federal government to deregulate the dairy industry in Australia. The federal government did claim that deregulation was all the states’ work and that basically the states were responsible for that deregulation, but it is a matter of the public record that the federal government in that instance, in that industry, made it quite plain that no federal assistance would flow to the industry if it did not deregulate. That was a virtual gun at the head of the industry. It is a regionally based industry throughout Australia and it has dimensions where a deregulated environment would deliver particular advantage to certain regions to the disadvantage of others. What was negotiated there was one of the biggest industry packages that this country has ever seen. You would expect that, if a government was going to contemplate assisting the development of a package of that size, it would have got in quite early and dirtied its hands in developing a plan for the industry, but this government did not. It knew that commercial pressures were building in the industry for deregulation, yet it stood back and pushed the responsibility for developing that industry package onto the industry itself. And without delivering unfair criticism to the dairy industry itself, the particular set of measures that the federal government put in place was sorely deficient as far as addressing the long-term needs of the industry were concerned. We ought to make some points here about that particular package. There was very little federal money in it at all. When we look at the package of $1.7 billion, we see that it was basically financed by a consumer levy, a transfer from consumers to the dairy industry. The federal government went out into the political marketplace trumpeting what it had done for the dairy industry when in fact it had put very little federal money into the package at all. And the package in its totality was quite deficient. It did not set a framework for growth in this industry, it did not set targets or directions, and it did not provide the strategic assistance one normally finds in industry plans to develop a particular industry over a discrete period of time. I mentioned the wine industry as a classic example of growth in the Australian context. We heard at the pioneer wine industry dinner last night about the possible growth prospects for that industry, in both the short term and the longer term. It has been an extraordinary growth in the wine industry and it is one that is regionally based and a generator of employment and wealth in regional areas. As honourable members would know, this was an industry that set about planning its growth and its future back in the 1980s, and it received very strong support from the then Labor government to develop its research and development capacity to lever its way into the international marketplace. It received very strong support for the plan it devised for its own growth, and I think the goals that were set in that plan have certainly exceeded everybody’s expectations-to the nation’s benefit and to the benefit of the rural communities in which this industry now occupies such a special place. I think it is a classic example of what can be done by governments when, in cooperation with industry, they set targets and plans and structure their assistance to encourage that industry to achieve those goals. Sadly, we did not see that in the case of the dairy industry with this government. As I said, there was very little federal money in a $1.7 billion package-the biggest industry package ever delivered to any Australian industry in one throw-and of course now the dairy industry is paying a very heavy price for that deregulated environment in particular areas of Australia. Dairying in Australia has in recent years been a very profitable business, but ABARE reports that, whilst most dairy farms have been profitable, the bottom 25 per cent of dairy farms lost an average of $46,000 per annum over the three years prior to deregulation. If we Wednesday, 8 November 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 22511 look at that statistic alone, we can see that there would be a very high incidence of poverty in that bottom 25 per cent of dairy farmers who are clinging on in their industry. The post-deregulation price that most farms receive for market milk has fallen between 20c and 30c a litre. Farmers in the Riverina, for example, have seen the price they receive for market milk slashed from 53c per litre before deregulation down to 31c per litre. This has largely been driven by the fierce competition among milk processors for lucrative contracts to supply the major supermarket chains. The impact of this has been particularly profound on regions which previously received a high proportion of their income from the sale of market milk. For example, in my neck of the woods in Victoria, regions that have traditionally supplied the manufacturing milk sector have fared much better. If we take just one example of the impact of this deregulation on farm families and regions, it has been estimated that the gross milk income of the Taree region will fall by around $27 million this year as a result of deregulation. That is a substantial reduction in income that is flowing to a particular region as a result of the decision of governments to deregulate. I guess my starting proposition here is that, across the sector, there are some what we would call ‘positive influences’ for structural change, there are others that are quite negative, and all this adds up to a production and marketing environment that is quite precarious for many rural producers. In summary, we have seen massive technological change in the sector which has brought its own structural changes. We have seen industries become more dependent on overseas markets. Many of those markets are quite corrupted, and the prices received in those marketplaces do not vary positively too much over time. We have also seen flood, disease and other climatic conditions exert tremendous pressure on the sector and, of course, I have just mentioned the impact of government decisions. When we roll all these together, it is a precarious production environment for many Australian farmers, and many of them are finding it increasingly difficult to earn a living in the sector. The program that is the subject of our scrutiny here today is designed to put a welfare net under those with particular problems-to ensure that farmers who find themselves in poverty are given the opportunity to consider their futures, either in or out of agriculture. These amendments are the product of a review of the Farm Family Restart Scheme that was completed by the government in March 2000. The review suggested that in the administration of the Farm Family Restart Scheme further consideration should be given to a number of issues. The recommendations of the review included the following: having an end of year or an end of income period follow-up to assess the results of the professional advice that had been given through the scheme, actions planned or undertaken and changes to viability; extending the time given to sell the farm; having provisions so that farmers who lose control of a property to a bank would still be eligible for the re-establishment grant; and raising the asset limit for the re-establishment grant, which would assist older farmers who may want to leave farming and who are likely to have accumulated more assets than younger farmers. Of course, there was a very important recommendation that farmers deciding to leave farming should be encouraged to access career training and education, and this should be actively promoted in the scheme. The main provisions of this bill pick up on some of those recommendations that came through in that review. The bill increases the net assets threshold for re-establishment grants from $90,000 to $100,000. The maximum grant that would be payable to farmers with net assets of $100,000 or less is $45,000. The grant is phased down by $2 for every $3 in assets above $100,000 and will cease to be payable when assets exceed $167,500. The sector has been agitating for this amendment for quite some time. It might seem to be a modest amendment, but it is an improvement on the previous situation. 22512 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 November 2000 I think we need to keep in mind when we structure these improvements that the sector walks a fine line between meeting the special needs of farmers in Australian agriculture and the equity demands of the community. There are many people who look on these programs in a very unsympathetic way. They simply say that-and if I can put it in its crudest form-there are too many whingers in the sector and they get too many breaks from the government. We know that there are a lot of people out there who look at these problems in a very shallow way and what we ask them to do is to go beneath that sort of rhetoric and look at the historical circumstances that many farmers might find themselves in. We are getting to a situation in Australian agriculture where we do have a very large cohort of people in what you would call the retirement age zone. There are many farmers who came to their chosen profession and, whilst they are very skilful farmers and have a broad range of native skills that have been accumulated over time, they do not have formal education and training qualifications. It is not easy when a farmer, who has been there for 35 years, is confronted with the fact that they are running an unviable enterprise and may have to leave that enterprise or make a decision about their future in the sector. So this provision is an improvement on what previously existed, and we commend the government for making this amendment. In this bill, the government also extends the deadline for applications for help under the scheme until 30 November 2003. Currently, the deadline is 30 November 2001. Of course, payments will be made until 30 November 2004. Members might recall that, when the government rebadged a lot of Labor programs and basically put them under the triple A package banner, particular provision was made down the line for a rather strict deadline on this scheme for the take-up especially of the re-establishment grants. The government went into the sector beating the drum on this, saying that the scheme was the greatest thing since sliced bread and that there would be a take-up of 10,000 in the time frame. That was what they were aiming for. Of course, it was a spectacular failure. The government tried to hide that fact but in estimates committees in recent years we have certainly teased out the failure of government policy in this area. One of the reasons for that failure was the criteria that were being employed that severely restricted access by farmers to the scheme. This bill also changes the name of the scheme to Farm Help-Supporting Australian Families. It is merely changing the name of the scheme to fit in with, I guess, the Prime Minister’s new-found concern for Australian families, be they in urban or rural environments. We are not going to quibble over the name change. If the government seeks to fit that within its framework of general policies and badge it so, we do not object. The legislation also includes a provision for a retraining grant of $3,500, and this would be an area that we would support. I think there has to be some care in the administration of this provision. We certainly do not want money thrown at this area without some outcomes for the people concerned. We will be watching this area fairly closely. The bill also offers voluntary case management to clients and it also includes provision for a ministerial discretion in the provision of a re-establishment grant to be available where exceptional circumstances have led to a delay of more than 12 months in the sale of farm assets. That is an interesting provision that gives the minister discretion in these matters but, once again, experience shows that, in situations dealing with farmers, in the disposal of assets and the decisions that have to be made to leave a farm, some degree of flexibility is required. I guess here the government is trying to balance the demands of the community for equity and strict accountability with some flexibility, and we would support them in that. I will, in the remaining time available to me, just raise some matters that were raised with the minister by a Mr Russell Jolly of the Eastern Eyre Rural Counselling Service in Cleve in South Australia. A one-page letter was sent to the minister. As we know, we have yet to get a Wednesday, 8 November 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 22513 commitment from the government on the financial future of rural counselling services. I know that is a particular issue of concern to the member for Bass who is going to speak in this debate and it is a matter of concern to farmers, their communities and the counselling service personnel all over Australia. I think we all know the benefit of this scheme to this sector and the sooner the government makes a funding commitment, the sooner the service will be able to retain personnel who have built up a considerable expertise in servicing the needs of farm families. In that letter to the minister, Mr Jolly made several suggestions for improving the Farm Family Restart Scheme. There are basically three points: Farm Family restart scheme allowance recipients do not have access to the bereavement allowance. Income support is limited to 12 months. When poor seasons are experienced in an area, quite often farms do not sell, despite a genuine attempt by the owner to sell. This is farcical and the scheme needs to be amended to enable people in this situation to continue to receive supportI think Mr Jolly would be pleased that the government has picked up that notion of flexibility in its legislation by providing the minister with the capacity to make decisions on that. Mr Jolly continued his letter: Income and Asset tests for income support. Farmers when planning for retirement and succession often transfer farming properties to discretionary family trusts. It is common in these situations for the farmer to have made a loan to the trust. Policy guidelines issued to Centrelink clearly sets out that loans made to trusts are exempt assets if the loan to the trust is considered essential to the ongoing operation of the farm and likewise if the land has been gifted. However under the income test both the loan to the trust and the value of the land transferred by way of a gift within the past 5 years, are subject to deeming. This has the effect of reducing or completely depriving the farmer of assistance. Why exempt an asset if it is going to be caught up in the income test? I believe that this is not in the spirit of the scheme and as a matter of urgency the Act needs to be amended! Mr Jolly has made suggestions for the improvement of the scheme. I mention this because people often write to government but feel their voices are not heard. We on this side of the House have disputes with the government on a whole range of legislative matters, but on issues such as this, where I think the government has a genuine intent to improve the scheme, we are certainly not going to quibble. I raise Mr Jolly’s letter because it is important for people to know that when they write in, either to government or to an opposition, there is some attempt to take account of the points that are being raised in their letters towards improving programs and schemes that are administered by the government. I reiterate that we will be supporting the amendments that are being made in this bill. They introduce a degree of flexibility to the arrangements and to the criteria that govern the administration of these schemes, and at the end of the day they will be of benefit to farmers. So we support the legislation. I hope that by going my full time here, 30 minutes, I have not caused the honourable member for Barker to nod off. He is probably next in the debate, and having been at the pioneer wine industry dinner last night, along with the honourable member for Maribyrnong and a few others, I acknowledge that it is hard yakka today. I wish him well. Some left earlier than others! (Time expired) member for Corio, but I hasten to add that, while I may wander around like he did, it will not be due to the overimbibing that happened last night. It is interesting that two of the most lovely red wines that we enjoyed as guests of the wine industry came from my electorate. SoI am very proud to continue to support the wine industry in my electorate. The fact that the wine industry has grown so much over the last 10 years has certainly helped a lot of people in my electorate who have had to leave their farm. They have found jobs in an industry where",157,Representatives Main Committee
322,Mr Secker (Barker) (11.04 A.m.),"I did enjoy tasting some wines last night with the22514 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 November 2000 they are still involved in an agricultural sense. The marketplace has worked itself out very well: people have not had to go through the social security system but have found quite satisfying jobs in the agricultural industry, although often of a different type. It is my pleasure to speak in support of the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2000. This bill amends the Farm Household Support Act 1992 in order to: change the name of the Farm Family Restart Scheme to Farm Help-Supporting Families through Change; extend the Farm Help income support application deadline to 30 November 2003-an extra two years-and the income support closing date to 30 November 2004, 12 months later; introduce a mandatory requirement for farmers assessed as non-viable to develop activity plans. I will speak on that much later. The bill also makes consequential amendments to other legislation to give effect to the name change. It will be useful to give some background to the bill. Farm poverty in Australia is not new. It has been a feature of Australian agriculture for many years. Farm poverty was drawn to the attention of the wider community during the severe drought experienced by much of eastern Australia in the early 1990s. Although there has been poverty among farming families for many years, the drought both exacerbated and highlighted the problem, particularly drawing attention to the inadequacies of the standard social security safety net for farm families. Other factors such as drought and poor commodity prices, which vary with each commodity in severity and the length of time, have also had a marked effect on farm poverty in Australia. Wool, for example, has been in the doldrums for some 10 years. Beef, not that long ago, was in the doldrums itself for a couple of years. Who can forget, during 1998, the hard times that the pork producers of Australia were going through. As the honourable member for Corio commented, dairying will cause some problems in the restructuring process. Last night we had the privilege of enjoying some of the best wines in Australia-some of us in small quantities, I might add-but some years ago the wine industry had a vine pull because of overproduction. In the last decade the wine industry put a lot more emphasis on the export of their product, and they have been very successful. Some 10 years ago they were exporting only $100 million worth of wine a year; this year we have already exported $1.5 billion worth of wine. That is just one of the amazing statistics of the wine industry, which with its success provides a lot of jobs and wealth for the whole area and in rural and regional areas in many parts of Australia. Certainly, in my electorate, there are areas that have expanded quite a lot-Padthaway, Naracoorte, Wrattonbully, Mount Benson, Langhorne Creek, Southern Vales and even a lot of the boutique wineries in the southern Fleurieu Peninsula and Kangaroo Island. Five years ago many of them did not exist but, as a result of the success of the industry, that health and vitality are certainly out there. I disagree with the member for Corio, however, who suggested that dairy deregulation was due to the federal government. Of course, that is a nonsense. Deregulation was done by the state legislatures; it is not federal legislation. We, as a federal government and as federal members, had two choices. We had the choice of doing nothing-which would have made the whole restructuring process a lot more painful: a lot more people would have left the industry and it certainly would not have given those that were in the industry the hope to plan and to make decisions for the future-or we could have taken the other decision, which was to actually work with the industry. I note that the member for Corio’s neighbour, the honourable member for Corangamite, put in an enormous amount of work with the dairy industry to set up the restructuring package. We freely admit that it was the right thing for it not to be at the taxpayers’ expense. It was a very soundly funded proposal, and it gives a lot of people in the dairy industry some hope for the future. It shows the difference between this side of the House and the other side of the Wednesday, 8 November 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 22515 House. Their suggestion was that the government should come in and set targets for the dairy industry, whereas we actually believe that the dairy industry people should set their own targets and make up their own minds about where their industry is going. In recent years, governments have addressed the issue of farm poverty through a number of initiatives, including the drought relief payment, the Farm Household Support Scheme and, most recently, the Farm Family Restart Scheme. This bill proposes to introduce Farm Help, a program which renames the Farm Family Restart Scheme to better reflect its intentionwhich is, in the minister’s words, ‘to provide support, addressing the individual needs of farming families, whether they choose to remain on the farm or exit agriculture’. The government announced in the 2000-01 budget context that it would be providing $111.2 million over four years to continue the Farm Family Restart Scheme in order to ensure that farm families in difficulties continue to have access to appropriate family support payments and other assistance. Enhancements to the program were announced later, including a retraining grant of $3,500 available to those farmers and their spouses who receive a re-establishment grant, case management of Farm Help clients-including the mandatory requirement that an activity plan be developed for farmers assessed as non-viable-and an increase of $10,000 in the net asset threshold for re-establishment grant recipients. Rural counselling services have played a very large part in helping those farmers make a decision on whether they can actually go on with their farming operation or whether it is best to leave the farm with dignity. In my own electorate of Barker, these rural counselling services work very well and have a very good success rate in helping people. Their funding has been increased this year, so I am not quite sure what the honourable member for Corio, the shadow minister, was talking about. Firstly, the unique nature of the family farm, which so closely combines business, household and lifestyle issues, can make the standard approaches to delivering income support quite different from the normal social security set-up. Secondly, the application of the assets test to benefits under Australia’s social security system impacts on the family farm quite disproportionately because of the fact that they are often asset rich but cash poor. So we have addressed that issue. I thank the member for Corio for congratulating the government for taking that up. Thirdly, the Howard government has responded to drought and other eventsfor example, the drought relief payment provided relatively generous income support to farmers in designated areas. However, farmers in poverty outside those areas designated by the government to be in exceptional circumstances missed out. The Farm Family Restart Scheme was announced on 14 September 1997 as part of the government’s integrated rural policy package entitled $JULFXOWXUH $GYDQFLQJ $XVWUDOLD ,W ZDV GHVFULEHG WKHUH DV WKH JRYHUQPHQW¶V NH\ SURJUDP for delivering improved welfare support to the farm sector as well as providing adjustment assistance to farmers who wished to leave the land. The key features of the Family Farm Restart Scheme include income support at the Newstart allowance level, and this payment is available for a maximum period of 12 months, and recipients do not have to satisfy an activity test. But, as a government, we recognised that there was a need for an activity test and I think that has gained wide support from all around the government and the opposition. There was a review of the Farm Family Restart Scheme. In summary, it found that farmers in three states-Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland-were more likely to participate in the scheme relative to the state’s share of farming population, whilst farmers in my home state, South Australia, and in Western Australia were very low users of the scheme. At least 28 per cent of the clients had previously accessed exceptional circumstances relief payments. As I previously mentioned, drought and low commodity prices, because they contributed to 22516 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 November 2000 the debt problems, were the most significant factors cited by farmers for accessing the scheme. The distribution of the income support recipients was: dairying, 26 per cent; sheep and wool, 23 per cent; and beef cattle, 23 per cent. Interestingly enough, 30 per cent of the income support recipients had farms of less than 100 hectares. There would hardly be what I would call a genuine farm in my whole electorate that is less than, say, 400 hectares, so I find it interesting that we have this figure of 30 per cent of recipients who had farms of less than 100 hectares. Then we came to what was happening with the re-establishment grant recipients. The distribution of these grants was: dairy cattle, 37 per cent; fruit and vegetables, 19 per cent; beef cattle, 14 per cent; and sheep wool, seven per cent. That last figure is interesting because wool has been in the doldrums for so long, yet only seven per cent have been receiving the grants. Interestingly enough, Victorian dairy farmers accounted for 82 per cent of the dairy farmer grant recipients and for 30 per cent of all re-establishment grants. Obviously Victorians were doing very well, and I do not knock that, but it just shows that the grants certainly seem to be pushed in some areas more than others. It was interesting that nearly three-quarters of farmers exiting their farms resided within the same postcode after leaving the farm, with almost half expecting re-employment in the agricultural industry. That proves what I was saying earlier in relation to the wine industry, where a lot of people still wanted to stay in the area. They had to leave the farm due to their circumstances, but they were able to remain where their families and friends were and find jobs elsewhere in the wine industry. So there were a lot of suggestions that came out of that review. Schedule1 of this bill contains the many amendments to the Farm Household Support Act 1992 to give effect to the program’s change of name from Farm Family Restart Scheme to Farm Help. This is done simply by omitting the word ‘Restart’ wherever it occurs in the legislation and substituting ‘Farm Help’. Item2 renames the Restart Advice Scheme, which is set up by delegated legislation made under section 52 of the principal act. The renamed Farm Help Advice Scheme will commence on the proclamation date. The effect of item 16-this is a fairly important part of the legislation-is to extend the deadline for Farm Help income support applications from 30 November 2001 to 30 November 2003, so we have given an extra two years of commitment to that. Of course, because that income support is paid for a period of up to 12 months, item 17 extends the Farm Help income support closing date to 30 November. This is a very important piece of legislation for Australia. Many farms have been in the same family for several generations, and this sort of heritage is so important to many farming families. It has been in many cases a quite heart-wrenching problem for families and, dare I say it, too many suicides have occurred because people have had to leave their farms and they have felt that they have let down their families and their children to come. This sort of help to either continue farming in a viable way or get them through that hard period can only be commended. I support the bill and I commend it to the House. Ms O’BYRNE (Bass) (11.20 a.m.)-BeforeI go to the content of the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2000, many people have mentioned the wine pioneers dinner last night, which I did not get to attend, but I could not let the comments about some of the finest wines in Australia go by without mentioning the high quality Tasmanian wines, particularly those produced in my own Tamar Valley region. Ms O’BYRNE-It is the niche, quality end of the market. Agriculture, dairying, fishing, food and beverages constitute a major part of the Tasmanian economy, namely one-third of gross state product and approximately 700,000 jobs. In 1997-98, it was estimated that the",161,Representatives Main Committee
323,Mr Secker,"Less than one per cent of Australia’s production.Wednesday, 8 November 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 22517 value of primary production to Tasmania was $931 million. Farmers make up approximately 8.5 per cent of the Tasmanian working population. The Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2000 seeks to change the name of the Family Farm Restart Scheme to Farm Help, extend the family farm income support application deadline to 30 November 2003, and the Farm Help income support application closing date to 30 November 2004. It introduces a mandatory requirement for farmers assessed as non-viable to develop activity plans directed towards either returning the farm to a viable position or securing alternative employment for the farmer. It includes a provision for a retraining grant of $3,500, offers voluntary case management and includes provision for a ministerial discretion in the provision of a re-establishment grant to be available where exceptional circumstances have led to a delay of more than 12 months in the sale of farm assets. As the House would be aware, we fully intend to support this bill, which is the government’s response to a review of the Farm Family Restart Scheme which was completed in March 2000 by AFFA. Overall, the Farm Family Restart Scheme has received industry support. However, there have been some concerns, I think members will agree, that the assets test has been a little restrictive. I would like to take a few moments to put this speech in a historical context. Whilst the Commonwealth of Australia has provided assistance for rural adjustment since the 1970s, the severe Australia-wide droughts of the early 1980s exacerbated and highlighted farm poverty. Introduced in 1985 through an agreement between the Commonwealth and the states, the Rural Adjustment Scheme’s objective was to return to commercial viability those farms and farmers assessed as having sound prospects of commercial viability in the longer term. As well, the scheme provided assistance for farmers assessed as having no prospects of long-term commercial viability in order to leave the farm. The farm build-up provisions were designed to encourage amalgamation of properties that were too small to be economic under the conditions at the time. Assistance for debt reconstruction, farm build-up and farm improvement took the form of loans on terms and conditions that the state authority considered appropriate, or by an interest subsidy on loans through normal commercial sources. The scheme operated on a lender of last resort basis and was an important mechanism for facilitating the Australian rural industry’s adjustment process. As well, household support had been included in the scheme to provide help for those farmers who were judged as being nonviable and had insufficient resources to meet their living expenses; in other words, assistance to alleviate conditions of personal and family hardship whilst farmers considered whether to adjust out of the farming industry. In the early 1990s, when severe drought once again affected a vast area of eastern Australia, the Rural Adjustment Act 1992 and the Farm Household Support Amendment Act 1992 were introduced and tied to the structural adjustment policy of household support and re-establishment provisions. The key features of the Rural Adjustment Scheme and the Farm Household Support Scheme included: concentration on a single program which was to be administered by the state rural adjustment authorities; special interest subsidies of up to 100 per cent under a Commonwealth and state funding arrangement which provided additional support for farmers experiencing exceptional circumstances; support for farmers who were unable to access commercial ‘carry on’ finance to meet their daily family requirements; and the capacity to cash out the balance of the nine-month farm household support grant as a lump sum if the sale of the farm occurred within the nine-month period. Interestingly, in a speech to this House on 15 October 1991, during the debate on the struggle that the farming industry was experiencing at that time, the then Deputy Leader of 22518 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 November 2000 the National Party suggested that, if the Labor government really wanted to do something about the cost structure in rural and regional Australia, it should introduce a goods and services tax so that transport costs could be reduced for those people. However, many farmers, transport operators, business or shop owners from the north-east of Tasmania in my electorate of Bass, a traditionally rural area, do not agree with that prophetic statement. They have certainly not seen any reduction in transport costs since the introduction of the GST. In some instances, overall costs have risen to the extent that some businesses are now refusing to extend credit to farmers. They feel that, by Christmas time, having out laid expenses for capital equipment for the farm, farmers will not have enough money to pay their accounts at the local shop. So the farmers have to find the cash up front for those goods and services. In fact, the costs have surged to the point where one dairy farmer told us that he had to sell the family vehicle to make ends meet, and he had the horrible experience of his children offering to sell their bikes in order to help the family cope better. Another family were forced to sell the business that had been in the family for generations because they were not able to adequately clothe or feed their children. These are not isolated instances, and I am sure that we could probably all recount similar stories of difficulties in farming life. A number of initiatives, such as the Drought Relief Payment, the Farm Hand appeal and, more recently, Agriculture-Advancing Australia, have been introduced to try to address the issue of farm poverty. Agriculture-Advancing Australia incorporates the Farm Family Restart Scheme that the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2000 proposes to amend. Announced on 14 September 1997, the Farm Family Restart Scheme was described as ‘the government’s key program for delivering improved welfare support to the farm sector, as well as providing adjustment assistance to farmers who wished to leave the land’. The Rural Policy and Communications Division of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has managed, in conjunction with Centrelink and the states, the structural adjustment package elements of the Agriculture-Advancing Australia package, incorporating Farm Family Restart schemes. Administered by Centrelink, the Farm Family Restart Scheme replaced the re-establishment grants previously made available under the Rural Adjustment Scheme; converted the drought relief payments to the exceptional circumstances relief payments; introduced the Farm Managed Deposits Scheme; and encouraged older farmers to retire, have immediate access to the age pension and pass the family farm on to a younger generation. Amongst other provisions, the Farm Family Restart Scheme operates as a decision support system for farmers who consider leaving the industry by providing them with access to professional advice on their farm’s future viability and on employment opportunities if they do choose to leave the farm. The key features include: income support at the Newstart allowance level-and this payment is available for a maximum period of 12 the market in order to obtain that assistance; recipients have a binding obligation to obtain professional advice on the future viability of the business and career counselling where appropriate, and financial support is provided to help recipients meet that obligation; and access to a re-establishment grant of up to $45,000 on the sale of the farm. Set up under subsection 52A(1) of the Farm Household Support Act 1992, the purpose of the Restart Re-establishment Grant Scheme is to grant financial assistance to eligible farmers on the sale of their farms. The Restart Re-establishment Grant Scheme is a time-limited scheme and originally had a deadline for applications of 30 November 1999. In December 1999, the deadline for applications was extended to 30 June 2000. On 14 August 2000, the government tabled a further amendment to the re-establishment grants disallowable instrument-Restart Re-establishment Grant Scheme Amendment 2000 (No. 2)-which had the effect of extending the grant application deadline to 30 November 2000. For a farmer to Wednesday, 8 November 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 22519 be eligible for the re-establishment grant, they needed to finalise the sale of the farm within 12 months of applying for the grant or, if they received restart income support, within 12 months of ceasing income support. Farmers and their partners may have up to $100,000 in net assets and still qualify for the maximum grant of $45,000. The net assets threshold excludes household and personal effects up to a value of $10,000. The re-establishment grant is reduced by $2 for every $3 in assets above this threshold and is not payable at all if the assets of the sale are $167,500. At 30 June 1999, the Farm Family Restart Scheme provided 1,208 farm families with income support. In total, since the Farm Family Restart Scheme began in December 1997, 191 Tasmanian farm families have received income support. As at 30 September 2000, 41 Tasmanian farm families were receiving income support. During 1998-99, 172 farmers leaving agriculture were paid re-establishment grants. To date, 23 Tasmanian farm families have received these re-establishment grants. A total of $42.6 million of exceptional circumstances assistance was provided as well, with the drought affected Flinders Island area in my electorate of Bass being amongst the areas in receipt of the exceptional circumstances assistance. Farm Financial Counselling funded 98 counsellors across Australia to provide financial counselling services for farmers, small business operators and townspeople experiencing financial difficulties. In Tasmania, however, since 1 July 1998 only two financial counsellors have been engaged through the Rural Financial Counselling Service-a component of the Rural Communities Program. That situation will continue to 30 June 2001. At this stage, no funding has been provided in the forward estimates for financial counselling after 30 June 2001 whilst the government considers the future of the Rural Communities Program, including the rural financial counselling component. In a time of such change and disruption in the industry, this is a concern that we should not have to be dealing with, and I urge the minister to provide some security for rural counselling. It is surprising and concerning that the farmers in the Central Highlands of TasmaniaMr Deputy Speaker Quick, I am sure you will be very familiar with that area-who have experienced the worse droughts in generations, failed to get exceptional circumstances payments in 1997, 1998 and 1999. They finally received some support this year after the tireless efforts of the industry and the Labor Party. As reported in the Tasmanian Country newspaper on 14 April this year, Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers senior Vice-President Scott Ashton-Jones said that the Derwent Valley and the Central Highlands community was ‘at the end of its tether and needed any help it could get’. According to the Farmers and Graziers senior vice-president, even though the area had a clear case of financial difficulty, feed shortage and low productivity, the National Rural Advisory Council representatives who had visited the region had refused to accept the region’s need for federal government exceptional circumstances assistance. In referring to the Central Highlands and the Derwent Valley area of Tasmania, Scott Ashton-Jones said, ‘It appears that the exceptional circumstances assistance almost cannot work for a region like this.’ He said, ‘It therefore ought to be reviewed.’ The overall scheme has been reviewed. In 1999 Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Australia commissioned the South Australian Centre for Economic Studies to undertake a mid-term review of the Farm Family Restart Scheme. The mid-term review’s findings have been used to inform the changes proposed by this minister. Completed in March 2000, the review’s purpose was to evaluate the whole of the program and its separate elements, report on the program’s progress and to provide comment against key questions, such as: what have been the key outcomes of the program; how effective has the program as a whole, as well as its individual elements, been in delivering its key objectives; have the Farm Family Restart Scheme’s elements brought about positive change for participating farmers; and what has the 22520 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 November 2000 new provision of income support achieved for farmers? The review’s findings included that at least 28 per cent of Farm Family Restart Scheme clients had previously accepted exceptional circumstances relief payment and that drought and low commodity prices, which contributed to debt problems, were the most significant factors the farmers cited for accessing the Farm Family Restart Scheme. The review found that 30 per cent of income support recipients had farms of less than 100 hectares, and that the distribution of income support recipients was dairy, 26 per cent; sheep-wool, 23 per cent; and beef cattle, 23 per cent. On the issue of re-establishment grant recipients, the average age of grant recipients was 44.7 years and they had farmed for an average of 19.3 years. One-third of grant recipients had an asset level of less than $50,000, two-thirds below $150,000, and younger farmers possessed fewer assets on average. Suggestions from the South Australian Centre for Economic Studies review included extending the time to sell the farm and that farmers deciding to leave farming should be encouraged to access career training and education, and advisers should promote that requirement more actively. For grant recipients, 70 per cent of farm enterprises were well below 200 hectares, with 43 per cent below 100. Existing farmers often said that their farm was too small to remain viable in the current market, and 71 per cent of farmers exiting farming resided within the same postcodes after leaving the farm, with almost half expecting re-employment in the agricultural industry. The review also found that farms in three states-Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland-were more likely to participate in the Farm Family Restart Scheme relative to the state’s share of farming population, while farmers in South Australia and Western Australia were very low users of the scheme. The overall impression gained by the Farm Family Restart Scheme review consultants was that many farmers simply do not want to leave farming. Whilst the Farm Help Program and the Farm Family Restart Scheme have explicitly been tied to structural adjustment policy because of the combination of household support with re-establishment provisions, the scheme does not separate farm and family, especially as household support payments are deducted from any subsequent re-establishment grants. Only 10 per cent of farmers who access the Farm Family Restart Scheme make a decision to leave the farm, whereas 90 per cent of Farm Family Restart Scheme clients consider the scheme as providing income support for the 12-month period or as a means of access to planning, counselling and management, and other professional assistance aimed at seeking advice on how to maintain and develop the farm, which may not have been affordable. The review reported that farmers enjoy their lifestyle and believe that their conditions will improve and that they have no identified alternative career to farming. The findings of the mid-term review of the Farm Family Restart Scheme have been used to inform changes as proposed by this bill. In the 2000-01 budget, the government announced it would provide $111.2 million over four years to continue the Farm Family Restart Scheme and subsequently included a retraining grant of $3,500, available to those farmers and their spouses who receive a re-establishment grant; case management to farm help clients, including the mandatory requirement that an activity plan be developed; and an increase of $10,000 in the net assets threshold for re-establishment grant recipients. I want to focus on just how strongly we support the retraining grant and the ability to offer voluntary case management. It will be interesting to see the manner of provision of this support, because obviously outcomes must match the intent. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, Labor will be supporting this bill. The government made election commitments and set targets which have not been taken up by the industry. I believe there had been an expectation by the government of a take-up of around 10,000, but that has not occurred. We are hopeful that the enhancement that this legislation provides will Wednesday, 8 November 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 22521 help struggling farmers with some more realistic and achievable options in a more supportive framework. rural communities and farmers, in particular, over the last 13 years, I, like the member for Barker, a practising farmer, am fully aware of the difficulties that the farming community have to face over the years in trying to sustain themselves in an environment where their income could be described as below the poverty line. The Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2000 seeks to assist those farming families that want to do something else. But before I talk on that issue, I would like to talk about some of the things that create problems for people on the land which certainly flow on to the businesses in the rural communities that rely on the viability and the economic boost that farmers are able to give them to survive. We often hear about what the elements do in destroying the livelihood of farmers. The elements cover many things. Fire is an example. When I was the state member for Burrinjuck I had occasion to experience and participate in assisting farmers in very bad fire situations. I saw the destruction of flocks which, in itself, was very destabilising and played on people’s minds and created enormous stress for farming families. To undersand, one only has to see the devastation that is created by fire and the economic destruction of a person’s livelihood and to see that person, even after the fire has gone through and the animals have been destroyed, buried and cleaned off the place, coming back into his home on a daily basis smelling of ash. One only has to see the mental and physical strain and the emotional breakdown of people who have just lost decades of their stud breeding stock as a result of fire to understand the circumstances that farmers, unfortunately on a seemingly regular basis, face year in and year out. It does not stop at fire. You can also see crop destruction as a result of frost or the oversupply of rain that we sometimes get. We always like to have rain-it is something that people never knock back-but it can come at the wrong time. As an example of what I am talking about, in the last few years the cherry crops in the area around Young have sustained damage from rain right at the time when the cherries are full of sugar and nearly exploding. The rain runs down the stalks of the cherries and splits the crop, downgrading the selling price and the quality of the cherries and creating an enormous financial impost on the growers. During my time in this place, we have seen a restructuring of the wool industry-in which, in my view, government should never have been involved at all-to the extent that there is some light at the end of the tunnel for producers to get more control of their own destiny and obtain better prices, because commodity prices are another factor which impact on the ability of people to survive. More recently, we have seen the issue of ovine Johne’s disease. I have had people come to me who are destitute financially because of the bureaucratic way in which the issue of ovine Johne’s disease has been handled, and it is a very heart-rending situation. We also have to consider that farmers and their families are surviving on very low incomes. The average income for a farmer in the last decade has been somewhere between $6,000 and $9,000 per annum, which is well below the poverty line and indicates the character of the people that they stay on and continue to farm in those sorts of debilitating times. That low income is further compounded, unfortunately, by the exiting of young people from the landthe traditional following of their fathers and their grandfathers. They can see the futility of working from daylight to dusk and getting very small return for their energies and that, in itself, has created a massive problem for the farming community. It is further compounded by the debilitating effect of the importation of produce from countries which have a disease that we do not have-and the latest one that I can comment on is the importation of apples from New Zealand with fire blight disease, which creates further pressure on producers and does",164,Representatives Main Committee
324,Mr Schultz (Hume) (11.36 A.m.),"As a member of parliament who has represented22522 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 November 2000 not auger well for a positive approach to the livelihood that they have grown up with and pressures on farmers and their families. The lack of income has affected their confidence in the community and their confidence in being able to pull themselves out of a situation. And they are placed under further pressure when the banks foreclose on them at a time when they are at their lowest ebb. As my parliamentary colleague the member for Barker said, we have an environment where farming communities are asset rich and cash poor. Because they are asset rich, the criteria for some of the schemes put up by government under the exceptional circumstances grants have been so stringent that the farmers have been unable to qualify. Moving back to the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2000, the Farm Help Supporting Families through Change Program, formerly known as the Farm Family Restart Scheme, or FFRS, is the government’s key program for delivering support to farm families facing those severe financial difficulties that I have just described. Farm Help is available to low income families who cannot borrow further against their assets and who wish to consider their future in the farm sector. Farm Help is a proven effective safety net for farm families if they fall into financial difficulties. The program helps farmers plan their future on or off the farm. Since the scheme began in December 1997, around 4,600 farm families have received income support. Around 4,700 professional and advice sessions have been attended and around 500 farm families have received re-establishment grants. If you think about that, you also have to reflect on the enormous contribution made by those people who are advising, counselling and consoling those people when they are going through that very difficult time. The assistance available through Farm Help is flexible and can be tailored to meet the needs of each farm family. The program elements include up to 12 months income support at the Newstart allowance rate; professional advice-and that comes from rural counsellors in particular and all those other agencies which have the charter to assist people in difficult times on the land-to the value of $3,000 on a wide range of areas to suit individual needs, including financial, legal, business, career or personal advice; and a re-establishment grant of up to $45,000 for those farmers who decide to leave farming. That is very important, because sometimes farmers can be very good at what they do but, because of poor advice they receive from bank managers and sometimes accountants, they can invest their money in an endeavour to set up their future and suddenly find that that investment has been very bad. I can refer back to the problems centred around the Swiss franc borrowings not so long ago. I know of one family of brothers who had been on the family farm for decades and who lost everything. They came out of their situation with the family car-they lost their home, their property, everything. Re-establishment grants are essential to help get those people on their feet. The government has also provided funding in the 2001 budget to extend all elements of the Farm Help program to 30 November 2003 and for program enhancement. The program name has been changed from the Farm Family Restart Scheme to Farm Help to better reflect-and quite wisely so-the intention of the program, which aims to provide support addressing the individual needs of farming families whether they choose to remain on the farm or exit agriculture. The enhancements to the program are consistent with the findings of a comprehensive review of the FFRS, finalised in March 2000, which found that the program is having a positive impact on its client group. The program has played a major role in sustaining farm families in their day-to-day lives and providing them with the opportunity to consider their future. The review highlighted areas of the program that could be expanded and enhanced to build on the program’s success to date. The enhancements to Farm Help include a retraining grant of $3,500, case management of Farm Help clients and an increase in the net assets threshold Wednesday, 8 November 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 22523 for re-establishment grant recipients. The retraining grant will be available to those farmers and their spouses who receive a re-establishment grant. The $3,500 retraining grant will focus on skill development through accredited training, including vocational training, to assist farmers and their spouses in finding alternate careers to farming. All Farm Help clients will be encouraged to participate in voluntary case management. This will involve development of an activity plan which will help provide farmers with a plan of action that is much more closely aligned with their individual needs and circumstances. The development and follow-up of activity plans will be compulsory for non-viable farmers, and so it should be. The net assets threshold for re-establishment grant recipients has been increased for receiving the maximum re-establishment grant from $90,000 to $100,000. This increases the total grant payable to those farmers with net assets of $100,000 from $38,333 to $45,000. The grant will be phased down by $2 for every $3 in assets above $100,000, and will cease to be payable when assets exceed $167,500. My personal view is that that should be extended further because, as has been said over and over again, the assets of farmers that are taken into account really do not give you a true picture of the position that these people find themselves in, not on an irregular basis. Certainly in my time, over the last 10 or 15 years in particular, I have seen some very heart-wrenching cases. The bill also includes amendments to reflect the extension of the Farm Help income support application deadline to 30 November 2003 from the current deadline of 30 November 2001, with payments being made until 30 November 2004. That in itself is an indication that the government understands the concerns and problems that are out there with regard to this system. An amendment is also required for the provision for mandatory activity plans to be developed for those farmers who are assessed as non-viable. As I said, as a person who represents rural people-and I know I can speak for all of my parliamentary colleagues who represent rural and regional Australia-it is very important that we understand that, if we are going to keep the wealth of this country in the hands of Australians, if we are going to ensure the economic viability of this country, we have to ensure that our agricultural people are encouraged to stay on the farm. With an ever increasing population, we are placing more and more pressure on broadacre farming activity because of the way in which people, through natural background issues, are moving more and more into rural communities. Rural communities in many areas, particularly the major regional centres, are expanding to the point where more and more pressure is placed on agricultural land. The only positive thing about that is that it gives those people who are disenchanted and demoralised by the frustrating repetition of being deprived of a means of incomeparticularly from what they produce-the chance to consider selling up, getting some money in their hands, paying off their debts and moving into something less stressful which will allow them to live a lot longer than many of them do under the present conditions. I would like to compliment the government on this initiative in terms of readjustment of the former Farm Family Restart Scheme through the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2000 and I know that there will be many grateful beneficiaries of this particular move by the government. I know that the issue of the pressure on farmers is felt in a bipartisan way by all of the members of this parliament, regardless of whether they come from metropolitan communities or from rural communities, and I commend this bill to the House. I thank the House for allowing me, through your auspices, Mr Deputy Speaker, and those of the Speaker, an opportunity to place on record my appreciation, on behalf of the people I represent, for this fine gesture from the government and from the parliament and, more specifically, for being given the opportunity to talk about many of the difficulties that these people face. These people do not know what a nine to five day is. They get up at dawn and sometimes work after 22524 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 November 2000 dusk to try and eke out what can only be described as a level of existence in the way of remuneration that many of us would not even consider undertaking. Support Amendment Bill 2000. Family farming is the backbone of Australia’s rural industries, but many farmers are facing increased financial pressure due to the changing circumstances in their respective industries-and, indeed, sometimes in their regions. While farm poverty is not new, in recent years agricultural industries have been hit particularly hard by low commodity prices, crop diseases, adverse weather conditions and a myriad of other problems that have left farmers in severe financial difficulty. The Farm Help program, formerly known as the Farm Family Restart Scheme, is the government’s key program for delivering support to farm families facing financial hardship. It is available to low income families who cannot borrow further against their assets and who wish to consider their future in the farm sector. Since the scheme began in December 1997, around 4,600 farm families have received income support, and around 4,700 professional advice sessions have been attended. On top of that, around 500 families have received re-establishment grants. The government announced in this year’s budget that it would provide $111 million to extend the Farm Help program to 30 November 2003 and for program enhancements. The bill today includes amendments to reflect those enhancements. The various forms of assistance available through Farm Help are flexible and can be tailored to meet the needs of each farm family. Elements of the program include income support at the Newstart allowance level, professional advice to the value of $3,000-and this can be financial, business, legal, professional or personal advice-and a re-establishment grant of up to $45,000 for farmers who decide to leave the industry. The enhancements to Farm Help include a retraining grant of $3,500, case management to Farm Help clients and an increase in the assets threshold for the re-establishment grant recipients, which means more farmers will be eligible for the grant. The $3,500 retraining grant will focus on skills development through accredited training, including vocational training to assist farmers and their spouses to find alternative careers to farming. The assets threshold for re-establishment grants has been increased from $90,000 to $100,000. As I said, this gives people greater opportunity to participate in the program. The grant is then phased out at $2 for every $3 in assets above $100,000. That effectively means you can go up to $167,500 before the whole thing cuts out. Further, all Farm Help clients will be encouraged to participate in voluntary case management. The new case management approach will help provide farmers with a plan for their future, either on or off the farm, which will be more suited to their individual needs and circumstances. Farmers will develop an individual plan with their Centrelink case manager, based on their financial viability and skills. The development and follow-up of activity plans will be compulsory for non-viable farmers. Although that might seem harsh in one sense, it is a way of keeping their focus on re-establishment. One of the big issues having a financial impact on farmers in the Wide Bay-Burnett area of Queensland-that takes in my electorate, that of my colleague the member for Wide Bay and a little bit of the electorate of Fairfax-is the number of drought declared properties. Drought declared properties in general have tripled in Queensland to more than 340 in the past couple of months. A third of those are in the Wide Bay-Burnett region. There are 55 drought declared properties in Eidsvold, 51 in Monto, five each in Biggenden and Mundubbera, and four in Gayndah. Those towns are not in my electorate-they are in the electorate of Wide Bay-but a lot of those towns focus on Bundaberg and Gladstone in my electorate. So anything that happens to those farming communities impacts very much on the social and economic life of the city of Bundaberg and the city of Gladstone. Of course, there will be many more that are in the same or similar circumstances that have not yet received drought declarations. If",169,Representatives Main Committee
325,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (11.53 A.m.),"I too want to talk about the Farm HouseholdWednesday, 8 November 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 22525 current weather conditions were to continue-although we have had good storms recentlywe could see more of these. One agricultural industry that has had plenty of bad news over recent years is the sugar industry, which is vital to the economy in my electorate. Sustained low sugar prices have led to significant financial hardships for cane growers and for the communities that depend on them. It is not generally understood that sugar production pervades the whole community. You grow sugar; you then have teams of contract harvesters and even, these days, contract planters; you have sugar mills; you have the Bureau of Sugar Experiment Stations developing new types of cane; and you have engineering firms, supply firms and tertiary industries that float off the secondary industries, like refined sugar and rum production-tonight being Bundaberg Rum night. I mention that just in passing, of course. Then we have a port that sends the sugar out from the district to the wider world. Sugar goes right through the community, from the very basic farming level right through the economy of the town to the export level, and in its all-pervasive nature it is probably unlike any other crop. Although sugar prices have recently improved dramatically from around US5c a pound in March to almost US11c a pound in August, a significant proportion of the crop-in fact, nearly of all of last year’s crop-is forward sold. So the price we are getting this year is the price we locked into last year, US5c a pound. The improvement to US11c a pound will be welcome in the new year, but only if we have the crop. The irony is that in the year to come, 2001, we are going to have a good price but it is doubtful whether we are going to have a crop. The sugar industry organisations estimate that, for every $1 of sugar income, an additional $3 of community wealth is generated in sugar growing areas of Australia. This is the point I was making before: if sugar is down, it affects the whole community. A major manufacturing company in my electorate, Austoft, which makes cane harvesters, recently announced that it would have to shed a third of its work force, some 90 to 100 jobs-which again illustrates the all-pervasiveness I was talking about. This decision has mainly stemmed from hard times at home and, to some extent, in the international market. The adverse conditions affecting the sugar industry in some areas have included damage to crops caused by cyclones and flooding. That is more so to the north of my area, in the Ingham to Innisfail area, but it is very important to my colleagues in the electorates of Kennedy and Leichhardt. There have been rust disease and rats in the Mackay area, bringing down the crop in some places as much as 30 or 40 per cent. That too impacts very badly on the profile. Because of these significant and unusual difficulties, the government developed a substantial assistance package for sugar farmers who have been significantly affected. The package, which was announced some weeks ago and obtained a lot of favourable comment in the rural press, has four key elements to it: family income support, interest rate subsidies for replanting, interest rate subsidies on new or existing loans and financial counselling assistance. With sugar there is not time to build up special counsellors, so industry members and other people who are in difficulties will be able to go to professional counsellors with a subsidy. Still the difficulty is this: we are going into a year where we have potentially a very good price, but have we got a crop? That is why the most significant part of that four-part package is the interest subsidy for replanting. Thankfully, after the storms we have had over recent weeks, that is now looking a bit brighter than it did before. This sugar package and the Farm Help program complement a range of government AAA package is the Farm Innovation Program. The two-year pilot will provide $18.2 million of initiatives to encourage the adoption of innovative practices, processes and production techniques in agricultural food, fishing and forestry industries-and in my electorate I have 22526 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 November 2000 all three of those. The successful FarmBis program has been extended, with an additional $167½ million in Commonwealth funding over the next four years. More than 36,000 farmers have used this program to improve their skills in areas such as business management, marketing, quality control and sustainable farm practices. This is not mumbo-jumbo; it is very important. In addition to sugar there are a lot of small crops in my area. Quality is paramount-even down to the details of colour and size. If you are dealing with Asian markets, first, you have got to have quality and those subsets of quality like size, colour and shape; second, you have got to have quantity-you have got to be able to make an impact on a given market; and, third, you have got to have continuity. You cannot have a crop for just three weeks and say, ‘Sorry, fellas. We haven’t got anything for the next 49 weeks of the year.’ In my area, the farmers came together to form a company called the Burnett Food Alliance, which has recently been granted $200,000 to employ an export manager. They work together not only to improve quality, understand quantity requirements and have continuity of supply but to enhance each others’ products. They go overseas and, while they are selling their own product, try to enhance the saleablity of the other products in the group. I am glad the government has been able to give that group another $200,000 to help them not only with their external marketing but also engage an export market development manager, who will assist them in penetrating overseas markets. Other assistance has been provided in the form of the Retirement Assistance for Farmers Scheme. This scheme provides an opportunity for eligible, low income, pension aged farmers to retire from farming and gift their farms to the younger generation without affecting their age pension. This helps many families living in hardship because their farms cannot support more than one family. I will discuss the main eligibility criteria in a moment. This is a problem that is not readily seen in the community: mum and dad and perhaps two sons and their wives live on a farm and no-one is making enough money to live well. In many instances, they are earning less than pension level. But if dad or mum try to gift the farm to the children, they then become ineligible for a pension for five years. There are reasons for that-to stop farms being handed on in a cavalier manner. At the same time, it captures people in a poverty trap. You have got three families who cannot get off the farm. The young ones cannot go because they know they will eventually have to inherit the farm, and the older ones cannot go onto a pension because, under the old arrangements, by handing the farm on either as a lump sum or in quantities of more than $10,000 a year, they lose their eligibility for a pension. Under the new rules-they are not so new now; they have been in for a few years-firstly, the net value of a farm must be no more than $500,000. In fact, I would like to see that a bit higher. I would be more comfortable if that were $600,000 or $650,000. There are a lot of people in the poverty trap and, although $650,000 might sound a lot, I am not altogether sure that it is. When it is divided amongst three families, we are not talking about a lot of money. Secondly, retiring farmers must have owned their own property for at least 15 years or have been actively involved in farming for 20 years. Thirdly, the retiring farmer must have had an average income of less than the age pension rate in the previous three years-as I have said before, that quite often happens-and, fourthly, the next generation must have had active involvement in the farm for three years prior to the transfer. You often find that because, even if the son or daughter has a job in town, they actively work on the farm. Another important program assisting farmers is the Farm Management Deposit Scheme, which provides an effective tax linked financial risk management tool to help farmers with the uneven income stream common in agriculture. The scheme enables farmers to set aside pretax income in the good years to help them through the more difficult years. In other words, Wednesday, 8 November 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 22527 they are not taxed on the money they are putting aside in the good years. They can benefit from the interest on that, but they pay the tax in the year they liquidate the deposit and take it back into the farm. I think that that is a very fair system and it has been a long time coming. It existed back in the 1970s. I think it has been most welcomed by farmers. It encourages them to be more self sufficient by allowing them to put away funds in the good years that can be used in the more difficult years. It is estimated that, over the first four years of the new scheme, the benefit to farmers will be about $60 million. In recent years, governments have addressed the issue of farm poverty and financial difficulties through a number of initiatives, including drought relief payments, the Farm Household Support Scheme, and now the Farm Help program. The Farm Help program has proven itself an effective safety net for farming families who find themselves in serious financial difficulties. It is not made to purely encourage farmers to leave their farms, as only one in 10 farmers who access Farm Help make the decision to leave. For the 90 per cent of farmers accessing Farm Help, the scheme is seen as providing income support for 12 months or access to professional assistance, planning, management and counselling that an individual might not otherwise be able to afford. A mid-term review of the program found that the advice was sought to maintain and develop the farm, and income support was helping pay off debt and putting food on the table. It is important that we support our farming sector and help farmers, if they need to leave the industry, to leave with some dignity and, if they stay, to be able to hand on farms to younger people and to have those younger people supported by advice. I think this is a particularly good bill. It comes on the heels of a number of other initiatives by the government and I commend it to the chamber. Amendment Bill 2000 is the expansion and the retitling of the popular Farm Family Restart 6FKHPH )DUP +HOS 6XSSRUWLQJ )DPLOLHV WKURXJK &KDQJH ZLOO H[SDQG RQ WKH RXWVWDQGLQJ performance of its predecessor in providing a viable alternative for those farming families battling away on low incomes. This new version will not only extend support payments under the scheme until November 2004 but also provide $3,500 for retraining to those farmers and their spouses who have already qualified for the $45,000 re-establishment grant. It includes a requirement that farmers deemed non-viable, and therefore eligible for assistance, compile activity plans for the future. But most significant for struggling farmers in my electorate of Parkes in western New South Wales-and there are some struggling and there are some very prosperous ones-is the provision for greater flexibility in the period during which farmers wishing to receive assistance must complete the sale of their property. Under the previous scheme, farmers were obliged to show their intent to embark on the offfarm assistance program by completing the sale of their holding within 12 months. Although the one-year time frame was responsible in spirit as a measure to prevent any misuse of funding support, the clause poorly served some farmers whose situation was in fact the most desperate. For some farmers in my region, years of falling commodity prices and a lack of income producing alternatives, interspersed with periodic drought, were the crippling influences-along with non-viable sized holdings-as efficiencies, international competitiveness and, therefore, price expectations changed. Obviously, these factors cannot be eliminated simply by change of owner. As a consequence, the market demand for these properties is pretty half-hearted, to say the least. Perhaps where misfortune and an element of mismanagement were to blame, a prospective buyer might be found within 12 months who could see that the operation could be resurrected. But the incompetent farmer was the first to disappear long years ago during years of prolonged and increasing financial hardship.

326,Mr Lawler (Parkes) (12.12 P.m.),"The key feature of this Farm Household Support22528 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 November 2000 raising sheep, and that cannot be adapted to more lucrative products finding favour in recent times with global consumers. The chances of these farmers finding a party with sufficient capital who is willing to change places with the embattled owners or to invest in their unviable operation are scant at best. This shortcoming was identified by a rural counsellor operating in my electorate some time ago. I commend Cathy Sim from the Macquarie Rural Advisory Service for bringing it to my attention and to that of the minister. In these circumstances, under this new legislation, there will be scope for ministerial discretion in determining payment where the farm sale has not been completed within the allotted 12 months. With these changes, I am confident that the Farm Help package will provide support for farming families looking to make a fresh start, so that they can do so confidently and with a minimum of stress, upheaval and uncertainty. These initiatives have already been shown to be an effective safety net for farm families if they fall into financial difficulties by helping farmers to plan for their futures, whether that be on or off the farm. Since these initiatives began in December 1997, nearly 4,600 farm families have received income support. Nearly 4,700 professional advisory sessions have been attended and nearly 500 farm families have received re-establishment grants. Most importantly, Farm Help can be specifically modified to meet the requirement of each farm family situation. The program includes up to 12 months income support at the Newstart allowance rate, professional advice across a range of fields, including financial, legal, business, career or personal advice, and the re-establishment grant of up to $45,000 for those farmers who decide to leave farming altogether. The figure of $3,500 for retraining will provide the necessary skills through accredited training to equip farmers and their spouses for alternative careers outside agriculture. In an innovative step, the bill urges all Farm Help clients also to participate in the development of an activity plan which will help to provide them with a strategy that is tailored to their own particular circumstances. To indicate that this funding is anything but a handout to the rural sector, and instead comes with an obligation on the part of both parties, the development and follow-up of activity plans will be compulsory for non-viable farmers receiving full support. The net assets threshold for the maximum $45,000 re-establishment grants will also be increased from $90,000 to $100,000. This will effectively increase the total grant payable to those farmers with net assets of $100,000 from $38,333 to $45,000. The grant total will be phased down by $2 for every $3 in assets above $100,000 and the grant will cease to be payable when assets exceed $167,500. Unless my maths is wrong, this means that in the best case scenario, if a farm family acts quickly when they recognise that their equity is threatened, they can re-establish in town with up to about $167,000. An important point is that this grant and the rules surrounding it encourage consideration of this option and other options before equity is diminished to nothing. Importantly, it allows a farmer to leave the land with dignity intact. Further, it structures an approach to future opportunities which may otherwise be ignored in the trauma of the moment. Under this bill, the deadline for income support applications under the Farm Help scheme will be extended from 30 November 2001 to that day in 2003, while payments for recipients will continue until 30 November 2004. These proposed amendments will serve to enhance the scope and quality of this government’s support for struggling farmers and their families and thereby assist communities across rural and regional Australia. For many towns in my electorate and in rural areas throughout the nation, the prospects of tomorrow are tied to the farm prosperity of today. While these towns continue to remain surrounded by embattled primary producers who themselves are unable to start afresh, the economic stagnation has Wednesday, 8 November 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 22529 profound effects. This is clearly evident in findings released this week by the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics which noted the crucial link between farm spending in smaller towns and those towns’ future. The report stated that any reduction in farmers’ expenditure in small rural towns led to a direct and almost immediate population decline. The mantra is familiar to all of us who represent regional, rural and remote areas: lost jobs, lost opportunity, lost young people, lost services and, too often, lost souls. With such a far-reaching and comprehensive scheme as this, people who wish to exit their circumstances and yet remain economically secure to reinvest in their community can do so. By freeing up the logjam of farm families caught between low income existence and lack of alternatives, this scheme offers a great promise for regional economies as a whole. There is little doubt in my mind that, given a fresh start, the industrious men and women from the land will transfer their efforts to more lucrative pursuits in diverse career fields. Many have skills that, in the emotional decision making time, they do not even recognise. They have skills that with a little effort can translate into a job driving a bus or truck, welding, consulting, counselling or in any myriad of small business opportunities. By easing the transition from the farm to another lifestyle this government is recognising and moving to alleviate the suffering of those farmers who, often through no fault of their own, cannot generate sufficient income to provide for their families. In doing so, this government will have also directly encouraged the business activity and the economic diversity so dearly needed in our rural communities. Mr St CLAIR (New England) (12.21 p.m.)-This government has worked hard to support the viability of farm families during some of the most challenging times that the rural sector has faced. During the last 30 years we have seen some of the toughest droughts in history, interspersed with some of the worse floods. At times we have watched helplessly as crops have been devastated by frost, hail, disease, insect attack and storms. But these things are an accepted part of agriculture in this country and most of our rural producers struggle through, often against the odds, and reluctantly call on support from government only when conditions are extreme. My electorate of New England straddles the Great Dividing Range and includes many small communities and a few larger regional cities and centres. It produces some of the world’s finest wool and is a renowned livestock grazing region for sheep and cattle. There are horticultural producers and a fledgling wine industry. These industries are vital to the prosperity of the communities and that makes it vital for the government to provide support in those times of need. That support goes much further than the farm families who receive it. It filters through to the regional economy and, while farmers accept the tough conditions in which they operate, they find it much harder to work within corrupted world markets for their produce. This is a massive problem and challenge and has caused significant hardship to the rural sector in this country. Unfortunately, there is no easy answer because the sheer scale of the forces at work simply dwarf the resources of Australia. For example, total support to agriculture in OECD countries in 1998 was $683 billion. Australia’s total federal government budget last year was about $166 billion-about a quarter of the amount spent by other countries supporting their farmers. In some countries, levels of support account for over 80 per cent of total income for some commodities, and this means those farmers receive only 20 per cent of their income from the actual sale of their produce. It is not hard to realise the impact this has on Australian farmers who operate with virtually no subsidies whatsoever. It is also not hard to see why the government provides support for farm families during those important times of need. 22530 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 November 2000 Under the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2000, the Farm Help-Supporting Families through Change initiative is the government’s key program for delivering income support to the farm sector. Farm Help is available to low income farm families who cannot borrow further against their assets and who wish to consider their future in the farm sector. Farm Help is a proven effective safety net for farm families if they fall into financial difficulties, and the program helps farmers plan their future on or off the farm. Since the scheme began in December 1997, nearly 4,600 farm families have received income support, nearly 4,700 professional advice sessions have been attended and nearly 500 farm families have received re-establishment grants. Assistance available through Farm Help is flexible and can be tailored to meet the needs of each farm family. The program elements include up to 12 months income support at the Newstart allowance rate; professional advice to the value of $3,000 on a wide range of areas to suit individual needs, including financial, legal, business, career or personal advice; and a re-establishment grant of up to $45,000 for those farmers who do make that heart-wrenching decision to leave farming. The government provided funding in the 2000-01 budget to extend all elements of the Farm Help program to 30 November 2003 and for program enhancements. The enhancements to Farm Help include a retraining grant of $3,500, case management of Farm Help clients and an increase in the net assets threshold for re-establishment grant recipients. The retraining grant will be available to those farmers and their spouses who receive a re-establishment grant. The $3,500 retraining grant will focus on skilled development through accredited training, including vocational training, to assist farmers and their spouses in finding alternative careers to farming. All Farm Help clients will be encouraged to participate in voluntary case management. This will involve the development of an activity plan, which will help provide farmers with a plan of action that is much more closely aligned with their individual needs and circumstances. The development and followup of activity plans will be compulsory for non-viable farmers. The net assets threshold for re-establishment grant recipients, as we have heard here on many occasions today, has been increased for receiving the maximum re-establishment grant from $90,000 to $100,000. This increases the total grant payable to those farmers with net assets of $100,000 from $38,333 to $45,000. The grant will be phased down by $2 for every $3 in assets above $100,000 and the grant will cease to be payable when assets exceed $167,500. But there is no obligation under the Farm Help scheme for farmers to leave the industry. They can receive this assistance and remain on their properties. The improvements to Farm Help will provide eligible farmers with access to quality financial help and advice, irrespective of whether they stay on the land and improve their farming operations or leave to find new careers. The fact that rural farmers often suffer significant hardship can be hard for many urban people to understand. They can be further confused when some rural people are described as whingeing farmers who are never satisfied. This reveals a serious communications gulf between city and country, although this is not something new. About 100 years ago, Banjo Patterson and Henry Lawson once ‘fought’ a running poetic battle about the merits and struggles of life in the bush. Farmers are often misunderstood because they are naturally cautious in their predictions about seasons, market prices and so on, because they have had their fingers burnt far too often over the years. I urge city people to look past the surface of stories about life on the land and try to understand the reasons that farmers are so passionate about their livelihoods. The simple reason for their ongoing commitment is they love it. They love the early mornings, with the fog low to the ground and their livestock quietly grazing in the distance. They love the fact there are no traffic jams down their dusty roads. They love Wednesday, 8 November 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 22531 their independence. Words cannot truly capture their love of the land. The closest I have heard is an extract from the poem My Country, by Dorothea Mackellar: Core of my heart, my country! Her pitiless blue sky, When sick at heart, around us, We see the cattle dieBut then the grey clouds gather, And we can bless again The drumming of an army, The steady, soaking rain. Core of my heart, my country! Land of the Rainbow Gold, For flood and fire and famine, She pays us back threefold; Over thirsty paddocks, Watch, after many days, The filmy veil of greenness That thickens as we gaze. I love a sunburnt country, A land of sweeping plains, Of rugged mountain ranges, Of droughts and flooding rains; I love her far horizons, I love her jewel sea, Her beauty and her terror The wide brown land for me. I think it encapsulates all that we love about the country and people who live there. I am pleased that we have a minister who is very conscious of this, who is a man of the land himself and is be able to bring these sorts of bills to the parliament of Australia to help those who are so necessary and have contributed such a great amount to the building of Australia. and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and member for Wide Bay, who is in the Main Committee now, for what I regard as one of the major programs in rural Australia to target and assist families who are going through very hard times as circumstances force some farmers to review their position and, in some cases, leave the land. I have just returned as a member of a delegation to Hungary and Poland. During the few days we were there I was able to learn a little of the plight of some of the farming people in very small farm areas in Poland and Hungary who are heavily subsidised at the moment and who face enormous change in the future as they strive to enter the European Community. I wish those people and those nations well in addressing the needs of their farming families. Their pressures are, of course, different from ours. Just a few moments ago I attended briefly the White Wreath Association’s laying of the wreath in the front of Parliament House. As members would know, it is an organisation that is designed to bring to the attention of the nation the serious problem of suicide in this nation. The fact that 3,000 people committed suicide in our nation last year is just beyond",175,Representatives Main Committee
327,Mr Lieberman (Indi) (12.30 P.m.),"First of all, I would like to thank the government22532 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 November 2000 comprehension. It was very moving to be there, particularly because of the very sad loss of one of our colleagues in recent times. The other night I was at the annual meeting of the Violet Town Bush Nursing HospitalViolet Town is south of Benalla and north of Euroa in Victoria. I was told by the chief executive of the Benalla hospital that in the last 12 months he had personally attended, I think he said, 17 funerals-I am not quite sure of the figure; I know I was shocked by it-in the Benalla region involving farming families who had been affected by the tragic problem of suicide. The Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2000 will help families. I am sure it will assist families who are struggling with changes to farming in Australia, and I hope it will help avoid the tragic problem that I just spoke about. The legislation is an enhancement to one of the government’s key programs. As a member of the government, I am proud to have been associated with developing a set of policies to help families who have been locked into farms where the income is not enough, the prospects are not good enough to perhaps continue, or where major changes need to be made. They are running at negative income; they are heavily borrowed and geared and struggling to pay the interest; and they are in the hands of the banks, virtually, as to what will happen. Their sole livelihood and the roof over their heads are in these holdings. Since 1997, the government has developed some very successful programs, with income support through the Newstart system and professional advice from skilled peoplemanagement consultants, lawyers, accountants and others-who can give advice to families who feel trapped and unable to make hard decisions because they are at a loss to know what to do. I would like at this stage to pay tribute to the excellent rural counsellors we have in Australia. I have some in my electorate of Indi-and to the volunteer and support committees which assist them in their very stressful job of counselling families on the land who are in crisis. In fact, in the last year or two nearly 4,700 professional advice sessions were given to farmers and their families across Australia. Features of the enhancement which this bill provides are to extend the range of assistance programs to farmers and families and to increase the total grant payable to farmers with net assets to $45,000. That is subject to an assets test, the upper limit of which is also being increased. Also, I am very pleased to see a retraining grant of $3,500, which is going to be made available on a case management basis, to assist the very talented people affected. In many cases they are farmers with great skills, learned from their fathers and grandfathers on the land, in vocational areas particularly, and with the ability to handle many emergencies and deal with problems that would almost blow your mind-you would not believe the difficulties that some of those families have been able to work their way through. I was very pleased to see the minister introduce a retraining grant. Those who, sadly, have to leave their farms have a great amount of talent and, given some focused retraining, they can quickly commence to make a major contribution to their families and to the nation, using those skills which in many cases they themselves have not recognised they have. I know that there are many owners of manufacturing businesses in my electorate who acknowledge the skill and the worth of people from the land who have come to work in the factories in the towns. Their reliability, their aptitude to change, their ability to work very hard and their loyalty are characteristics of farming people that we admire so much. They become very valuable employees in towns and cities where their skills and some retraining make them very productive members of the organisations they work for. On a positive note, I was very pleased to recently attend a function with my friend the member for Farrer, Tim Fischer, at beautiful Mount Buffalo. It was the launch of the alpine valley’s new wine region. I mention it today because some of the people who are entering into the very exciting development of what is going to be some of the best cold wine MAIN in Wednesday, 8 November 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 22533 the world-I have no doubt about that-are actually farmers who have made the transition, with advice and assistance such as under this proposed program, from the production of tobacco in unviable circumstances. They have had the courage to make the change and have recognised that their skills as fantastic cultivators have made them ideal people to cultivate grapes and make wine. Many of them have an ethnic background of having been born, or their grandfathers having been born, in countries such as Italy. One of my friends is involved in a little winery, and his family is producing a wine using the label of his great-grandfather from northern Italy. It is a beautiful label and I recommend it. It was great to be at Mount Buffalo because the alpine valley’s wine region personifies to me that out of adversity comes good. With assistance such as is available under this legislation many families can find their way through into a very exciting new phase in their lives and a very productive one for Australia as well. With those comments, I wish the bill a speedy passage through the parliament and thank the minister, the member for Wide Bay, for his great contribution in helping to develop these policies. reply-In summing up, I thank those members who have made a contribution to the debate on the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2000. From what I can gather, all members have spoken with a degree of enthusiasm about the bill and are in support of the changes that are proposed to be made through this legislation. Those changes continue and enhance the farm household support arrangements, and that is appreciated by all members who have any understanding of the difficulties confronting some sectors of the rural communities at the present time. There were though, as often happens in a debate of this nature, some fairly wide ranging references to other matters of agricultural policy, and I think it would be appropriate for me to respond to a number of those concerns. The honourable member for Corio, in summing up the opposition’s position on this legislation, referred to a number of matters, such as the future of rural counsellors. I can report to the Main Committee that the government has received a report of a review into the rural counselling service. I know that many members are receiving letters from local rural counsellors and their committees who are anxious to get some kind of indication as to what the future might be. The review report has identified some issues that are of some concern and that certainly need to be addressed, but the government is conscious of the fact that rural counsellors have played a very significant role in regional communities under stress. The administration of the program is pretty complex in that there is a whole range of different providers of services at a state and federal level and through a number of different programs, and these sorts of issues obviously need to be resolved. The funding for rural counsellors is secure until the end of this financial year, but they are obviously looking for an indication as to what might happen in the future. The government is turning its mind to those issues at the present time. The member for Corio raised some comments that were conveyed to him in a letter from a South Australian counsellor. The same counsellor wrote to me on these matters, so I assume that it is the same letter. The honourable member for Corio acknowledged that some of the issues raised by Mr Jolly in his letter have been addressed in this bill, particularly the issue in relation to the time to sell the farm to benefit from the provisions of this bill, but he also made some reference to the transfer of farms to family trusts and deemed income affecting entitlements. The member for Corio may not be aware that that issue was resolved several months ago, and I believe the concerns that he raised in that regard have been addressed. He also made reference to the fact that bereavement payments are not available under the farm household support arrangements. That is consistent with normal welfare arrangements, where recipients must be receiving benefits for 12 months before they are eligible for bereavement",179,Representatives Main Committee
328,Mr Truss (Wide Bay,"Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (12.39 p.m.)-in22534 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 November 2000 payments. There is no inconsistency between this legislation and the way in which we treat other people who are receiving assistance through our welfare arrangements. Two other issues of wider significance were raised. The member for Corio raised one when he returned to his old theme of dairy deregulation. He is seeking to blame everybody else but the Labor Party for what has happened to the dairy industry. His contention that somehow or other the federal government had driven dairy deregulation is utterly illogical. Whilst some of his state colleagues might be endeavouring to pursue that line to distract attention from their own performance in that regard, it is simply lacking any kind of factual basis. Those sorts of comments do not befit someone who aspires to the position of opposition spokesman on primary industry matters. The reality is that his criticism on these matters is entirely without foundation. Once again, the member for Corio returned to the theme that the Commonwealth was putting up no money for this package and that somehow or other the money was coming from thin air. The reality is that the Commonwealth has imposed a new tax to raise this money. It is a tax that is just as much a tax as GST, income tax, petrol tax or any of the others. So the Commonwealth has to accept the full consequences of raising a new tax, a special tax, to deliver an outcome. To suggest that somehow or other this is not a Commonwealth initiative is, I think, to ignore the facts. Yes, in the truest sense, it is not the government’s money but, in a sense, governments have no money of their own from any taxation source. It all comes from the people. In this case, it is the consumers of milk who are paying to fund this very significant package. I would also like to make reference to the current situation facing dairy farmers. It is beyond dispute that dairy farmers, particularly in New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia, are facing a very difficult adjustment period. Ironically, because the world price for dairy products has improved and the Australian dollar is low, the gross income being earned by the dairy industry this year will be up substantially on last year’s, but nearly all of that increase is in the states of Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia. That is offset by losses of incomes in those states that have been very heavily dependent upon the market milk sector for their incomes. That is where the major adjustment is occurring. The pain that dairy farmers in New South Wales and Queensland in particular are feeling is a direct consequence of the failure of the New South Wales and Queensland governments to provide any compensation whatsoever to the dairy farmers for their quotas, which were made valueless as a result of the states’ decisions to deregulate the milk markets. The states took away the value of these quotas. In some instances, the money to buy these quotas had been paid to state governments, and yet they were made valueless and the state governments have provided absolutely no compensation. I think that that is utterly immoral, and the Labor Party should be embarrassed about the performance of their state colleagues in New South Wales and Queensland because of their complete unwillingness to address the crisis confronting the dairy producers in their states and their unwillingness to do anything to provide compensation for the affected producers. In some states they even want to charge stamp duty on the payments that are being received from the federal government-a demonstration of their utter immorality when addressing these sorts of issues. Only the Western Australian coalition government has provided a state based package to support the dairy farmers in that state. The problems in New South Wales and Queensland are infinitely worse than in any other states, and yet those two state governments are turning their backs on the plight of dairy farmers. The honourable member for Corio should spend his time talking to Mr Palaszczuk and Mr Amery about the shamefulness of their response and should make sure that the federal Labor Party applies whatever influence it can to deliver some kind of justice to the dairy farmers in Wednesday, 8 November 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 22535 those states. The Labor Party stands condemned because of what it has failed to do in the states where it had the capacity to influence the outcomes of the dairy deregulation. Yes, it has happened faster than the industry and many observers expected, but the prices that are being received by dairy producers in those states are about what the state ministers predicted. They knew it was going to happen and yet they turned their backs and did absolutely nothing to help them. The honourable member for Bass raised issues about the declaration of exceptional circumstances for the central highlands region of Tasmania. I agree with her that it took a very long time for that application to be processed and for the farmers to receive the benefits to which I believe they are entitled. But if she is looking to apportion blame for those delays then she again needs to talk to her state ALP colleagues in Tasmania. It was a classic case of bureaucratic incompetence that that particular application took so long to reach a just conclusion. The applications were exceptionally poorly put together by the Tasmanian government. When finally, with the help of federal officials, an application was put together that was half credible and the National Rural Advisory Council that considers these sorts of matters went to Tasmania and saw for themselves and immediately were impressed by the gravity of the situation and determined that there should be immediate action, we found that the application and the request put forward by the Tasmanian government was designed in such a way that, even after we had the application in place, hardly any farmers qualified; and so we had to go back a few weeks later and correct the errors that the Tasmanian government had made in that regard. Even just a month or two ago, the Tasmanian government came back to us and said, ‘Hey, we’ve got the boundaries wrong and we want to extend them and add another set of farms,’ and that is a matter now that the National Rural Advisory Council has reported to me on. We have an incredible piece of appalling administration from the Tasmanian state government that, after all, is responsible for putting these applications forward. I think that the Commonwealth responded as quickly and as sympathetically as we possibly could. When I visited the area of the Central Highlands of TasmaniaI have to say that I was taken aback by just how severe the drought was in those areas. No-one has an image of Tasmania looking the way those parts of Tasmania looked at the time. Fortunately they have had a bit of rain subsequently, but it looked liked a real moonscape, not the traditional lovely green picture of Tasmania that we are used to seeing. I think it is disappointing that the declaration could not have occurred earlier. Finally it has happened and the benefits are flowing to those farmers who are eligible, but it could have happened so much better if the state Labor government had taken the time and had been serious about putting together a proper application to meet the needs of those farmers. Returning to the substance of this bill, which I think all speakers have supported, the amendments in it make changes to reflect the government’s commitment to rural and regional Australia. The Farm Help program provides a proven and effective safety net for farm families facing severe financial difficulties. The Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2000 provides for enhancements to the Farm Help program. These enhancements include changing the program name from the Farm Family Restart Scheme to Farm HelpSupporting Families through Change. The change of name will help better identify the fact that this support is available even to farmers who are not proposing to leave the land and ensure that it better describes the sort of support that is available. The program deadline has been extended to 30 November 2003 and, as a part of the case management of Farm Help clients, there is the compulsory provision for the development of activity plans for those farmers who are assessed as non-viable. 22536 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 November 2000 Further enhancement of the Farm Help program will be included in amendments to the Farm Household Support Act 1992 disallowable instruments. These enhancements include a retraining grant of $3,500 for those farmers who have received the re-establishment grant and the compulsory development of activity plans by non-viable farmers. The enhancements to the Farm Help program will be implemented upon proclamation of the act. I commend this legislation to the House. It will secure the future of this important government program at least until 30 November 2003. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

Australian Defence Force: Glenn Report (Question No. 1712) Mr Price asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 29 June 2000: (1) Which individual recommendations of the Glenn Report tabled in 1995 relating to (a) The External Environment, (b) Vision for ADF Personnel 2005, (c) Principles of Personnel Policy Strategy, (d) Employment and Work Practices, including phased careers, staffing, flexible work practices and social justice, (e) Reward, Recognition and Entitlements, including an independent approach, rank, the pay system, allowances, accommodation and relocation, non-financial recognition and presentation, (f) Support for Members and Families, (g) The Reserves, (h) A Learning Organisation, (i) Setting the Balance– A New Management Style, (j) Strategic Links The Personnel Process, (k) Industrial Relations in the ADF, (l) Supporting Personnel Management, (m) Change and Communication and (n) Major Challenges have been implemented, and when and how were they implemented. (2) Which specific recommendations have not been implemented. (3) Which of the recommendations not implemented are progressing and when and how are they are likely to be implemented. (4) Have any recommendations been rejected; if so, why. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: Since the Glenn Report (Serving Australia) was tabled five years ago there have been a number of subsequent reviews in particular the Defence Efficiency Review that have affected the recommendations put forward in Serving Australia. As a result, many of the recommendations in Serving Australia have since been subsumed by later initiatives. It should also be noted that many recommendations in Serving Australia were general principles that did not require concrete action. These recommendations cannot be easily measured in terms of achievement or non-achievement. Notwithstanding, on 31 March 2000, the Defence Personnel Executive carried out an audit of Serving Australia to determine those recommendations that have been achieved, in progress or not achieved. This audit has been updated in order to provide the basis for the response to this parliamentary question. The results are presented as follows: (1) (a) to (n) Recommendations of Serving Australia that have been implemented are as follows: Chapter One The External Environment. Recommendation: We recommend that the impact of future trends in the social, economic, organisational and industrial environments be noted and that these trends continue to be monitored. Implementation: The external environment continues to be monitored by the ADF noting trends in the social, economic and industrial settings. In particular, a strategic planning and research section is now tasked with collecting information on issues that could impact on personnel management in the ADF. Chapter Two Vision for ADF Personnel 2005. Recommendation: We recommend that the Defence Vision for ADF personnel be noted and that increased prominence be accorded Service values Implementation: Adherence to Defence values continues to be fundamental to the future of the ADF. The Defence Matters initiative has reinforced that ‘people matter’ to Defence, and that Defence values underpin Defence’s operations. Chapter Three Principles of Personnel Policy Strategy. Recommendation: We recommend that the set of ten principles contained in this Chapter (Chapter 3) be adopted as the basis for ADF personnel policy strategy. Implementation: On 11 October 1995, the Chiefs of Staff Committee formally adopted the set of ten principles as the basis for ADF personnel policy strategy. These principles continue to inform ADF personnel management. Chapter Four Employment and Work Practices. Recommendation: Completion Incentives and Resettlement Assistance replace a range of gratuities and bounties that currently exist. Implementation: A new incentive, titled the Medical and Dental Completion Bonus, was introduced in 1998. This completion incentive superseded the provisions for the payment of bounties and gratuities in these areas. Recommendation: Retention Bonuses be provided at the discretion of the Service Chiefs for the retention of a group of members critical to the operational effectiveness of the ADF. Implementation: Provision for the use of retention bonuses has been retained in ADF personnel policy. Nonetheless, the use of retention bonuses has been reduced, and they will in the future only be used in occupational groups that are critical to the operational capabilities of the ADF. Recommendation: The Return of Service Obligation be confined to those cases where members have been given significant training which makes them highly marketable. Implementation: Return of Service Obligations have been reviewed by each of the Services, and as a result, the number of cases where Return of Service Obligations will be applied has been reduced. New policy is under development reflecting these changes. Recommendation: A range of Flexible Work Practices be developed for the Regular and Reserve components of the ADF to apply as local circumstances dictate. Implementation: Part-Time Leave Without Pay for Permanent Members of the ADF, was introduced in early 1999. This policy has also facilitated the use of ‘job sharing’ within the ADF. Variable Working Hours for ADF Members was introduced in early 1997 – this allows personnel, subject to the needs of the working environment, to negotiate their working arrangements. Temporary Home Located Work for ADF Members has also been introduced in order to allow personnel to undertake work from their home. Recommendation: Concomitant conditions of service packages be developed for Flexible Work Practices. Implementation: The policies described above include consideration of appropriate conditions of service packages for ADF flexible work practices. Recommendation: All ADF employment be discrimination free and be based on the requirements of the job and the capability of the member to do the task. Implementation: The ADF has a zero tolerance policy on discrimination. Since January 1998, the ADF has been operating a Defence Equity Advice line, and the Defence Equity Adviser Network has been in place nationally since January 1999. Equity and Diversity in the ADF was issued in February 2000. Recommendation: Job design and specifications and career management systems be reviewed to ensure that any unintentional discrimination against women is eradicated. Implementation: In 1998, a Workplace Equity and Diversity Plan was published to reduce discrimination against women in the workplace. The review of job specifications and the complete eradication of ‘unintentional discrimination’ against women in the workplace is an ongoing task. Recommendation: Strategies be developed to encourage people from non-English speaking backgrounds to join the ADF. Implementation: Strategy for cultural diversity in recruiting drafted and sent to DFRO for comment in February 2000. Recommendation: Strategies be developed to encourage Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to join the ADF. Implementation: An Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Employment Strategy Implementation Team was established in 1997 as part of the Defence Force Recruiting Office. Chapter Five Reward, Recognition and Entitlements. Recommendation: The ADF not be bound to any other group for adjustments of pay and conditions, and that the circumstances dictate the approach to be followed. Implementation: This is an ongoing process. ADF pay and allowances are determined by the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal, and are subject to the same wage fixing principles that apply to the broader Australian workforce. While all movements are merit based and are structured around internal relatives, external comparators are used for benchmark purposes. Non-financial conditions of service are also set internally, but in some cases are linked with either APS conditions or directly with community standards. The methodology employed enables the ADF to maintain levels that are consistent with community movements, while at the same time recognising the uniqueness of military service. Recommendation: The existing rank structure be maintained but the rank be used selectively in organisations. Implementation: The rank structure of the ADF has been maintained. Recommendation: The ‘all of one company’ approach in the context of pay be abandoned. Implementation: The 1995 Pay Structure Review created a pay-graded structure for enlisted personnel with seven pay groups for each rank level. The same structure, based on work value, for Warrant Officer Class One to Colonel (equivalents) will not be implemented until June 2003 after review of the ADF officer structure. Recommendation: Competency based increments be applied to all salaries under the new pay system. Implementation: This has been partially achieved. Specialist officer structures have been or are being developed that will remunerate specialist officers for their competencies. Legal Officers introduced a specialist salary structure in February 2000, while structures for medical, dental and chaplaincy cases are currently being developed. Recommendation: Salary compression be dealt with in the work value examination. Implementation: The work value remuneration based structure prevents salary compression by establishing a 12 percent pay difference between each rank. Recommendation: Performance based pay only apply at the senior management levels and be similar to that applying in the Senior Executive Service of the APS. Implementation: This was achieved via the establishment of the Australian Workplace Agreement. Recommendation: The distinction between the entitlements of single and married members be removed and a decision on the Members Without Family review be finalised as soon as possible. Implementation: Introduction of the main elements is virtually completed. In 1996 a number of significant and beneficial changes were made to the relocation and housing assistance entitlements of members without dependants (MWOD), including access to full removals and storage at public expense, payment of Temporary Accommodation Allowance, increased rates of Disturbance Allowance and District Allowance, and other allowances. On3 September 1998 a number of changes were made to the housing assistance available to MWOD, including the splitting of the Rations and Quarters charges, and replacement of Living Out Allowance and Living Out Away From Home Allowance with Rent Allowance (RA). On7 January 1999, a utilities charge was introduced for MWOD occupying living in accommodation (LIA). On8 July 1999, separate charges for Levels1 to 5 LIA were introduced. Between July 1999 and July 2004, LIA charges will be progressively increased in annual increments, with full charges achieved in July 2004. From6 January 2000, MWOD owning a home in their posting locality became ineligible for housing assistance. From 25 May 2000, members without dependants for whom only Level1 and Level2 living in accommodation is available, are able to apply to live out and receive Optional Rent Allowance, and the entitlement to free transport or Vehicle Allowance from living in accommodation to the workplace has been removed. Recommendation: Alternatives for the provision of accommodation assistance and subsidies be pursued. Implementation: At its meeting of 31 May 1999 the Defence Executive tasked Head Defence Personnel Executive to undertake a review into more cost and tax effective ways of providing housing for MWODs and the ADF generally. The findings of that review were presented to the Defence Executive on 20 September 1999 and the Defence Executive agreed that: Present ADF housing assistance arrangements are generally sound, with some scope for modifications to improve equity and cost-effectiveness; A full cashing out of housing assistance arrangements to members will not be pursued because it would deliver inequitable outcomes to individuals and not support defence capability; A modified Rental Allowance option for MWOD where only Level1 or Level2 LIA is available will be introduced; MWOD retaining LIA or Rental Allowance premises while absent in the field or at sea will be required to continue to pay their accommodation contribution for the first 21 days of their absence; The casual meal charges and discounted fortnightly meal charges will be increased; and The first purchase element of HPSEA will be converted to provide home purchase deposit assistance. Recommendation: The relocation of a unit, formation or facility take account the demography of the organisation involved, and any trends likely to impact upon the people. Implementation: A business case has been prepared that outlines issues associated with relocation. It includes the work and social needs of the people and families, and how those needs will be met. There is now also a responsibility on the ‘client’ Service to clearly articulate the requirement as it impacts on capability and personnel. Recommendation: The purchasing power and beneficial impact upon the community of a Defence presence should be marketed more effectively, particularly in negotiations with state and regional authorities for the provision of infrastructure. Implementation: This recommendation was effectively implemented by the creation of the Defence Estate Organisation in 1997, which in turn developed a Strategic Plan for the Defence Estate. This plan provides a framework within which detailed developments and changes in the Defence Estate take place, and helps facilitate ‘... consideration of key economic and cost effectiveness factors … on regional economies’. Recommendation: The management of removals and housing allocations be placed on a commercial basis. Implementation: Responsibility for the management of removals and housing allocations was passed to the Defence Housing Authority on 1 July 2000. Recommendation: A comprehensive approach be developed for the ways in which non financial recognition can be granted. Implementation: As a result of the Defence Reform Program, policies on Commendations for Service, the Order of Australia and Conspicuous Service Decorations are managed on a tri-Service basis. ADF personnel now have access to a larger range of non-financial awards across a range of levels to recognise their contributions. Recommendation: Whatever conditions of service prevail they be presented as a comprehensive package. Implementation: This recommendation was achieved with the introduction of the Comparative Employment Value Adjustable Model. The model provides the value of employment in the ADF and is a computer based ready reckoner approach that can be accessed on the Defence INTRANET. Chapter Six Support for Members and Families. Recommendation: The ADF develop a strategic policy on family support which determines what families need, what should be provided, what should be the division of responsibility between the member and the ADF, and how the service should be provided. Implementation: This recommendation is the subject of ongoing action. In particular, there is now an Australian Defence Force Family Support Policy– the latest update of this policy was issued on 4 August 2000. Further policy details the organisation, role and operations of the Defence Community Organisation, and provides guidance on the operations of the principal member and family support agencies. This policy is also in the process of being updated to reflect the new structures of the Defence Organisation, and the expectations of the organisational (the Services) and individual clients (ADF members and families). Recommendation: The provision of family support be based on helping members to help themselves, particularly through the development of self help programs. Implementation: This is also an ongoing process, and all Defence Community Organisation programs foster independence and self help. Program1 (Casework) is based on the professional ethic of the core service delivery personnel, Defence Social Workers, that is, self determination. The work of Regional Education Liaison Officers and Family Liaison Officers focuses on assisting ADF members and families to settle into support networks in various locations. Program2 (Community Work) fosters and sponsors self-help projects with the ultimate aim of building support networks for families. The Spouse Employment Assistance Program and the Family Support Funding Program provide seed funding for projects. Recommendation: Family support mechanisms be designed to cope with the transition from today’s environment to levels of conflict. Implementation: The deployment of ADF personnel to East Timor in support of Operation firmly establish its role in the support of ADF members and their families. An internal report on this issue to the Head of the Defence Personnel Executive noted that the family support processes followed in peacetime have been robust enough to ramp up for major deployments. The establishment of the National Welfare Coordination Centre to work in close cooperation with the Defence Community Organisation has provided a single point of contact for the coordination of welfare support to the families of personnel deployed to East Timor. Recommendation: An ADF spouse employment assistance policy be developed to encompass employment assistance service, job search assistance, training and education assistance, and access to unemployment benefits. Implementation: The ADF Spouse Employment Assistance Program has been implemented for ADF spouses seeking employment. Assistance includes access to a Defence Community Organisation sponsored internet based employer/employee matching service, access to internet based employment services and advertising, the use of quality hardware and software for resume and application preparation, “employment expos” and Defence sponsored referral to Job Network agencies. Validation of the scope of the requirement is being pursued to enable further options to be considered. Recommendation: A comprehensive ADF child-care policy be developed. Implementation: A Defence Child Care Policy has been developed. There are currently 16 employer sponsored Defence childcare centres, supplemented by family day care, holiday and after-school services. Management of the program has been contracted to a specialist childcare organisation KU Childrens’ Services. The Defence Community Organisation manages the contract and conducts visits to ensure standards are maintained. Recommendation: The Education Assistance Review consider a communication strategy to influence education decision makers, and also examine the adequacy of education allowance and assistance with accommodation and reunion costs when a child cannot transfer to the new locality. Implementation: The Defence Community Organisation maintains contact with the Commonwealth Department of Education and produces regular briefings for the Minister and other components of the Defence Organisation on education issues affecting Defence families. A Defence representative has been invited to attend the pre and post briefings around the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs. In October 1996 a revision of education assistance introduced assistance to members with tertiary level students and provided limited assistance to members with children who have special needs. Recommendation: A range of measures be adopted to accommodate the requirements of families with special needs. Implementation: Policy was introduced in 1998 which provides a range of support measures to assist families with special needs when posted to a new location. A post-implementation review of the policy is currently being conducted. Recommendation: Strategies be developed to ensure that volunteer organisations remain viable and continue to complement formal ADF support structures. Implementation: Volunteer organisations and support groups are supported by Defence Community Organisation staff, and by seed funding from the Family Support Funding Program. Close cooperative relationships are maintained with the two prominent volunteer organisations the National Consultative Group of Service Families and the Defence Special Needs Support Group. Both have national coordinators and a supporting regional structure. Chapter Seven The Reserves. Serving Australia contained eleven recommendations relating to Reserve service in the ADF. In 1999, these issues were identified as being largely inter-related and best addressed in a composite and coherent manner. In December 1999, two submissions intended to enhance Reserve force capabilities were presented to Cabinet. All the relevant recommendations contained in Serving Australia were addressed within the context of these submissions. Cabinet subsequently directed that Defence legislation be amended to reflect the content of the submissions. To that end, the Defence Act 1903, the Naval Defence Act 1910 and the Air Force Act 1923 are to be amended to extend the options available to the Government for the use of the Reserves. The Defence (Re-establishment) Act 1965 will also be amended to provide appropriate protections for both Reservists and employers. The amendments are expected to be introduced during the current Spring session of parliament. The proposed legislative amendments will: extend the circumstances in which the Reserves may be called out, to include warlike, defence emergency, peace enforcement, civil and humanitarian aid and disaster relief operations in peacetime; incorporate a code to provide reasonable levels of protection for both Reservists and employers in time of call out, upon volunteering for continuous full-time service in connection with operations and in support of operations, and for the normal requirements of peacetime service; provide protections for student and self-employed Reservists; facilitate the payment of financial incentives and compensatory payments to employers of Reservists and self-employed Reservists; and empower the Service chiefs, by Regulation, to introduce categories within the Reserve forces to best suit their service requirements. Chapter EightA Learning Organisation. Recommendation: The ADF adopt strategic policies to ensure that it functions as a ‘learning organisation’. Implementation: This was a general recommendation that is the subject of ongoing action. New policy covering officer education has been published, and this is being further developed to cover enlisted personnel. Recommendation: Training and education issues be included in the broader aspects of strategic corporate planning and policy making and be reflected in the Strategic Personnel Plan. Implementation: Action on this recommendation was subsumed by the establishment of the Joint Education and Training agency on 1 July 1997, which has subsequently evolved to become the Defence Education and Training agency. The Defence Education and Training Corporate Plan reflects a commitment to building an education and training system that supports Defence’s capacity to achieve the ‘knowledge edge’. Recommendation: The Training Commanders’ Forum become an instrument for strategic planning and policy development, and be chaired by ACPERS when strategic issues are considered. Implementation: The Defence Education and Training Committee chaired at two star level serves this purpose. The Committee has recently expanded its membership to provide a whole-of-Defence perspective. Recommendation: The Training Commands adopt best practice and develop a partnership approach to more effectively analyse, develop, conduct and evaluate training. Implementation: The three Training Commands have adopted the Systems Approach to Training, which embraces best practice, and allows Defence to align with the National Training Framework. Partnership of the Training Commands is also supported by the formation of the Defence Education and Training agency. Recommendation: The ADF provide enhanced professional programs aimed at developing management skills including personnel management skills. Implementation: The main vehicle for professional development within the ADF is the Australian Defence College at Weston Creek. This will be augmented by the opening of the Australian Command and Staff College in January 2001. The development of management and personnel management skills is also being addressed as part of curriculum development for other ADF training courses. Recommendation: An over-arching policy on skills accreditation be developed by HQADF and included in the Strategic Personnel Plan. Implementation: With effect 18 February 2000, the National Training Information System had itemised 421 qualifications where Defence training has been accredited. There is a rolling process in place to ensure accreditation remains current. Recommendation: The ADF provide a more flexible range of training and education options taking account of the emergence of new competencies, different delivery methods and learning for personal growth. Implementation: The ADF is actively pursuing flexible delivery of training, has a positive relationship with the Australian National Training Authority (with a Defence Civilian located in the Brisbane office), has representatives on various Industry Training Advisory Bodies, and works closely with the ACT Accreditation Registration Council. This assists the ADF to stay abreast of contemporary training issues. Recommendation: The ADF continue to rationalise training. Implementation: Rationalisation of training within the ADF is an ongoing process, for which Defence Education and Training is primarily responsible. Recommendation: The costs of training be measured more effectively. Implementation: As part of the training rationalisation process, training is being costed. The costing process is being further refined, and several projects underway in Defence, including the adoption of accrual accounting, will assist in this process. Chapter Nine Setting the Balance– A New Management Style. Recommendation: Personnel policy development take account of the shift in balance needed between the corporate needs of the ADF and the needs of its people. Implementation: This is a general recommendation, and the ADF faces an ongoing challenge to balance the competing demands of the Services and the expectations of individual personnel. The implementation of many of the recommendations of Serving Australia goes some way towards achieving such a balance. Recommendation: More discretion be pursued in the design of personnel policies. Implementation: A more positive approach is now taken to how personnel policy is written. Policy is now written in a way that explains what personnel are entitled to, rather than what they are not entitled to. Recommendation: Training for personnel staff include the concepts of equity, discretion, choice and broad banding. Implementation: This was a very general recommendation advocating the application of specific principles during the development of ADF personnel policy. The ADF provides formal training on principles such as equity to all staff, and also meets the intent of this recommendation by ensuring that there is wide consultation with members during the development of personnel policies. Recommendation: A plain English rewriting exercise be applied to any personnel policy document being replaced or changed. Implementation: Although the enabling legislation for ADF personnel policy is often cumbersome, policy is now written in a plain English style wherever possible. Chapter Ten Strategic Links– The Personnel Process. Recommendation: A systemic relationship be established between the personnel, investment and operations functions in managing the ADF. Implementation: The Defence Reform Program also recognised the need to integrate the functions of workforce planning, service conditions and career management. These functions were brought together under the Defence Personnel Executive in 1997. The creation of the Defence Personnel Executive assists the Secretary, CDF and the three Service Chiefs in the discharge of their command and administration responsibilities in relation to ADF and APS personnel. Recommendation: TYDP and FYDP procedures be enhanced by linking personnel planning requirements into all strategic and planning processes. Implementation: The Net Personnel and Operating Cost review process was introduced in 1995/96, and is part of the broader FYDP development process. It involves a review of major new investment projects with the aim of finding significant associated personnel and operating impacts for the purpose of long term resource planning. The Net Personnel and Operating Cost review process addresses the significant personnel costs associated with major capabilities. Life Cycle Costing analysis is another process that focuses on the full life of an acquisition and takes into account personnel costs over the life of the equipment. Recommendation: A planning and evaluation methodology be applied to personnel. Implementation: The Defence Personnel Executive has developed a personnel planning process (the ‘Blue Book’) which facilitates resource planning for the personnel component of the FYDP. Recommendation: A Strategic Personnel Plan be developed for the ADF. Implementation: The Defence Personnel Executive has developed and maintains the ADF Strategic Personnel Plan. Recommendation: At all levels there be a partnership approach to the development of personnel policy. Implementation: The establishment of the Defence Personnel Executive has significantly enhanced the communication and development of personnel policy between the three Services. Recommendation: The senior personnel committee be renamed the Defence Personnel Committee, with strategic outlook and executive powers, and chaired by the VCDF. Implementation: The Defence Reform Program and the creation of the Defence Personnel Executive moved beyond this recommendation, and established a permanent mechanism for strengthening strategic personnel planning in the ADF. Recommendation: There be cross membership between the personnel and capability committees. Implementation: The Defence Reform Program and the creation of the Defence Personnel Executive moved beyond this recommendation. The establishment of the Defence Personnel Executive and Capability Development Division has facilitated consideration of personnel issues as part of capability development. Recommendation: The role of ACPERS be upgraded to accommodate strategic responsibilities. Implementation: With the creation of the Defence Personnel Executive, the title of ACPERS ceased to exit, and the Head Defence Personnel Executive assumed responsibility for addressing ADF strategic personnel issues. Recommendation: The roles of the Service Assistant Chiefs of Staff for Personnel be augmented to take account of their strategic responsibilities. Implementation: With the creation of the Defence Personnel Executive, the single Service personnel functions were subsumed into one organisation. While this structure has been subsequently modified again, Head Defence Personnel Executive retains responsibility for addressing ADF strategic personnel issues. Recommendation: A Strategic Personnel Planning Group be formed in HQADF to provide an analytical and strategic level personnel outlook. Implementation: The requirement to create the Strategic Personnel Planning Group was subsumed by the Defence Reform Program and the creation of the Defence Personnel Executive. Recommendation: A Personnel Policy Coordination Forum be formed to achieve more effective cooperation on personnel issues. Implementation: The requirement to create the Personnel Policy Coordination Forum was subsumed by the Defence Reform Program and the creation of the Defence Personnel Executive. Recommendation: The personnel components of HQADF and HR&M Division be examined to harmonise skills and talents, refine divisions or responsibility and strengthen linkages. Implementation: HR&M Division was dis-established during the Defence Reform Program. The intent of this recommendation was achieved by the subsequent establishment of the Defence Personnel Executive. Chapter Eleven Industrial Relations in the ADF. Recommendation: A mechanism for consultation with members, separate from the chain of command, be developed. Implementation: The ADF has introduced an enhanced consultation and education program for ADF members on conditions of service matters. The process compliments the chain of command process. The process was used during the successful 1999 Australian Defence Enterprise Productivity Arrangement negotiations. Recommendation: Powers under Section 58B of the Defence Act currently administered by DIR be transferred to the CDF. Implementation: These powers were transferred to Defence on 18 June 1998. Changes to the Administrative Arrangements Orders transferred responsibility for sections 58A to 58E of the Defence Act 1903 to the Minister for Defence (ie, Section 58B determinations). Recommendation: Commanders have an understanding of the ADF industrial relations system. Implementation: An ongoing consultation and education program has been introduced to provide commanders with an understanding of the industrial processes (conditions of service) employed within the ADF. The information is available electronically and through presentations by specialist staff. Recommendation: Channels for complaint be adjusted to provide that policy change proposals be dealt with in the proposed consultation process. Implementation: Effective administrative arrangements currently exist to address member’s complaints or other communications. In addition, the enhanced consultation and education program introduced as part of the recent ADF Enterprise Productivity Arrangement provided an open channel for communications on service condition matters. Chapter Twelve Supporting Personnel Management. Recommendation: Personnel management become recognised as a specialist area of employment and career streaming for personnel specialists be adopted. Implementation: This is an ongoing process. Since 1998, the ADF has taken a pro-active approach to employing specialist personnel in career and workforce management by sponsoring personnel in academic studies in Human Resource Management. Recommendation: Personnel experience be a prerequisite for advancement to the highest echelons of the ADF. Implementation: Although the requirement for personnel experience has not been codified as a prerequisite for advancement in the ADF, it should be noted that most key ADF appointments are people focussed. Members of the ADF cannot progress to high rank without exposure to appointments providing ‘personnel experience’. Recommendation: Interoperable personnel information systems be established for the aggregate management of the ADF, with the characteristics of consistent terminology, transparency, analytical and modelling capability, and accessibility. Implementation: The ADF has combined the three Service’s Workforce Planning sections with a view to integrating the strategic personnel planning function. In addition, the Personnel Management Key Solution project is in the process of developing a centralised data base, including pay, training, career management functions and personal records for ADF personnel and Defence civilians. Recommendation: The ADF continuously monitor the external and internal environments which impact on personnel. Implementation: The ADF now monitors the needs of its personnel through the use of attitude surveys, exit surveys and other information gathering techniques. In addition, the Defence Personnel Executive has established a research capability which is able to monitor the external and internal environments which impact on personnel. Recommendation: The ADF enhance and sustain its personnel research and analysis capability. Implementation: The Defence Personnel Executive has established a personnel planning and research section. Recommendation: ADF managers take into account numbers, activity and price when considering personnel costs. Implementation: This was a general recommendation that nonetheless has been addressed within the ADF by the establishment of a consolidated directorate of workforce planning and establishments. Chapter Thirteen Change and Communication. Recommendation: The ADF develop and instil a new culture of personnel management through the introduction of a change management philosophy, in consultation with key stakeholders. Implementation: This is an ongoing process. In 1997 the Defence Personnel Executive was created as a result of the Defence Reform Program. One of the aims of this was to promote greater consultation with stakeholders, and the progressive improvement of ADF personnel management. Recommendation: The change management philosophy include a combination of developmental and task focused strategies. Implementation: This is an ongoing process, however, the recommendations contained in Serving Australia have provided a basis for changing personnel management strategies in the ADF. Subsequently, the Defence Reform Program has further enhanced change management philosophy as part of a broader commitment to change across all of the ADF. Recommendation: A communication plan support the implementation and ongoing management of the ADF Personnel Policy Strategy. Implementation: The ADF has a adopted a number of communication strategies since 1995. The Service newspapers have been enhanced to provide more information on policy changes. The most important conduit of information about personnel policy has been the publication of The Key. The Key is published by the Defence Personnel Executive and provides information on personnel policy in plain English. The Key is sent to all personnel in the Defence Organisation. Recommendation: Personnel policies be promulgated in a comprehensive, accessible and easily understood form which is conducive to prompt amendment. Implementation: This is an ongoing process. The Defence Personnel Executive is in the process of simplifying personnel policies so as to provide easier to read documents. Recommendation: The rationale for management decisions be fully articulated to middle management levels – the change leaders. Implementation: This is a general recommendation which has been supported by the inclusion of personnel policy and management presentations on all key ADF career development courses. Recommendation: A comprehensive external communication strategy be developed toward building the image of the ADF in the Australian community. Implementation: A Defence Communication Development Strategy has been developed in conjunction with the establishment of the Public Affairs and Corporate Communication Division. This provides the foundation for the development of a Defence Communication Strategy that will be completed by February 2001. Recommendation: The outcomes of this Review including the key recommendations, implementation plan and timetable be communicated to the members of the ADF as soon as possible. Implementation: The recommendations put forward in Serving Australia have been widely publicised in Service newspapers and The Key. In addition, the various projects established to implement the recommendations of Serving Australia have at various times maintained web sites to facilitate access by ADF personnel to their work. Chapter Fourteen Major Challenges. Recommendation: The needs of people be considered when decisions are being taken about the relocation or establishment of units, formations and facilities. Implementation: A business case has been prepared that outlines issues associated with relocation. It includes the work and social needs of the people and families, and how those needs will be met. There is now also a responsibility on the ‘client’ Service to clearly articulate the requirement as it impacts on capability and personnel. Recommendation: The ADF review the way in which force elements are configured, operate and deploy. Implementation: The configuration of ADF force elements is a matter of constant review and refinement. Personnel have always been an important factor in shaping these force elements. Recommendation: Resource implications arising out of this Review be handled through normal budgetary processes with detailed work being undertaken to develop financial models of training costs and phased careers. Implementation: Resource implications have been addressed as part of the consideration of individual recommendations in this review. A consequence has been the rejection or partial completion of a number of recommendations, eg, the ‘universal application of completion incentives’ has not been implemented because the cost of this recommendation was prohibitive. (2) The following is a list of recommendations contained in Serving Australia that have not been implemented. While some of these recommendations have been rejected, the implementation of many others is still in progress. This list is a summary only Question Three addresses those recommendations still in progress in more detail, while Question Four addresses those recommendations that have been rejected in more detail. Chapter Four Employment and Work Practices The ADF recruit to a constant base and manage separations. The ADF introduce a system of Phased Careers based on Fixed Terms of Employment, with the number and lengths of phases varying of occupational groups. A Completion Incentive be paid at the end of each career phase, with the quantum varying for occupational groups. Resettlement Assistance be provided for members leaving the ADF at the end of a career phase. Limited Tenure Promotion be extended to all rank levels. Management Initiated Early Retirement be extended to all rank levels. A more flexible approach to the staffing of ADF positions be adopted by the use of relief pools, secondments, exchanges, second career streams and labour exchanges. The ADF encourage more lateral recruitment and the re-employment of former members without detriment. Communication be maintained with members not in continuous contact with the ADF, including advice on training and career development opportunities. Physical fitness standards should be aligned to occupational requirements and meet OH&S responsibilities. Establishment Practices be reviewed to facilitate Flexible Work Practices. At the expiration of the current exemption under the Sex Discrimination Act, no further exemption be sought. Chapter Five Reward, Recognition and Entitlements A new pay system be introduced based on work value and be applied to both other rank and officer rank members. A Market Forces Pay Element, additional to work value, be introduced for occupations where, due to high demand in the employment market, it is difficult to attract and retain members If in the new pay system a member moves from a higher paid job to a lower paid job, the pay of the member should be frozen until the remuneration of the position occupied increases above the frozen rate. Members who have plateaued in rank but who are performing at a demonstrably superior level be paid one or more performance increments. A Mobility Allowance, comprising three elements (an incentive to move, posting turbulence and disturbance) be introduced and paid on the occurrence of each move, with the quantum varying with members’ circumstances. Service Allowance covers those elements that apply to all members and be incorporated into salary. The proposed work value based review of ADF pay considers whether any allowances or elements thereof can be incorporated into salary. The work value elements of Flying Allowance and Submarine Service Allowance be incorporated into work value based pay, and the attraction and retention element of Flying Allowance be dealt with under the Market Forces Pay Element. The provision of living-in accommodation be reassessed and the management of such accommodation be transferred to a commercial agency. A team and unit citation be introduced to recognise outstanding contribution or achievement in non operational activities. Chapter Six Support for Members and Families All recommendations have been implemented. Chapter Seven The Reserves All recommendations are being addressed as part of proposed Government legislation on enhancing the contribution of the Reserves to ADF capability. Chapter EightA Learning Organisation The competencies and skills required for each ADF occupation and the pre-requisites necessary for entry to training in those occupations be clearly specified. The Australian Defence Force Academy be used in a more flexible manner to meet ADF training and education needs. Chapter Nine Setting the BalanceA New Management Style All recommendations have been implemented. Chapter Ten Strategic Links The Personnel Process All recommendations have been implemented. Chapter Eleven Industrial Relations in the ADF The mechanism consist of forums at the local, regional and central levels where personnel issues would be resolved. A Defence Member Representative be created, with a small secretariat to assist members in the forum process and to make formal representations on behalf of members. The employer role for the ADF be vested in the CDF and the role of HQADF staff be adjusted accordingly. Chapter Twelve Supporting Personnel Management The ADF establish a simple and flexible legal infrastructure to support the personnel process. Chapter Thirteen Change and Communication All recommendations have been implemented. Chapter Fourteen Major Challenges Geographical stability for members and their families be achieved through the collocation of support infrastructure and operational elements and the tri-Service clustering of mutually supporting units, formations and facilities. Respite for members be achieved by adjusting manpower requirements and the level of activities and operational commitments including preparedness requirements. Job requirements be clearly specified and that members be promoted on merit. (3) Recommendations not implemented that are being progressed are as follows: Chapter4 Employment and Work Practices. Recommendation: The ADF recruit to a constant base and manage separations. Implementation: Given the significant personnel shortages across the ADF, it will take a number of years to stabilise recruit numbers to the point where a constant base can be established. Recommendation: The ADF introduce a system of Phased Careers based on Fixed Terms of Employment, with the number and lengths of phases varying for occupational groups. Implementation: Fixed terms of employment (fixed periods of service) were introduced in July 1998. The introduction of Phased Careers however has proved problematic, and has failed to gain Service clearance to date. It is unlikely that the concept of ‘Phased Careers’ will be fully adopted. Recommendation: Resettlement Assistance be provided for members leaving the ADF at the end of a career phase. Implementation: The Career Transition Assistance scheme is developing an enhanced range of resettlement provisions that will be more widely available to ADF personnel. The emphasis is on better marketing and documentation of ADF competencies and experience. The intent is to de-link benefits from the 20 year service point. Development will continue throughout 2000 and the planned implementation date is in July 2001. Recommendation: Limited Tenure Promotion be extended to all rank levels. Implementation: Amendments to the Defence Act 1903 and the Naval Defence Act 1910 were recently passed by Parliament to extend the provision of Limited Tenure Promotion to the ranks of Lieutenant Colonel and Commander. These amendments are currently awaiting Royal Assent. Amendments to relevant Defence Regulations to extend the provision of Limited Tenure Promotion to the ranks of Wing Commander and Warrant Officer Class One (equivalent) are currently being drafted. Because there is a requirement for personnel who accept an offer of Limited Tenure Promotion to resign on completion of their appointment, it was not considered appropriate to further extend the use of Limited Tenure Promotion to more junior ranks. Recommendation: Management Initiated Early Retirement be extended to all rank levels. Implementation: A draft policy has been raised extending eligibility for Management Initiated Early Retirement to the ranks of warrant officer and major (equivalent). Legislative changes have been initiated and are expected to be in place by the end of the year 2000. Recommendation: A more flexible approach to the staffing of ADF positions be adopted by the use of relief pools, secondments, exchanges, second career streams and labour exchanges. (This recommendation and implementation also appears in response to Question 4) Exchanges/Secondments. A new policy on exchanges is being raised and should be completed within 12 months. Further development of secondments is being examined. A concept paper on this issue has been raised and sent to stakeholders. Second Career Streams. Army’s ‘Project OPERA’ (Officer Professional Effectiveness Review– Army) has rejuvenated interest within the other two Services at addressing second career streams. Both Navy and Air Force are now assessing the outcomes of Project OPERA. Recommendation: The ADF encourage more lateral recruitment and the re-employment of former members without detriment. Implementation: Lateral recruitment and re-employment are components of the Flexible Employment Practices project. Concept papers on these issues have been circulated, and it is expected that action on these recommendations will be finalised by the end of this year. Recommendation: Physical fitness standards should be aligned to occupational requirements and meet OH&S responsibilities. Implementation: Each of the Services is in the process of developing detailed physical fitness requirements, however the requirement to match standards with occupational requirements has not been achieved and is unlikely to be achieved in the near future. A more holistic approach has been taken by the Services to meet their deployability needs. Chapter Five Reward, Recognition and Entitlements. Recommendation: A new pay system be introduced based on work value and be applied to both other rank and officer rank members. Implementation: A structure has been set up based on work value methodology for ADF officers, however the pay system is not yet in place because of a requirement for cost-neutrality. Recommendation: A Market Forces Pay Element, additional to work value, be introduced for occupations where, due to high demand in the employment market, it is difficult to attract and retain members Implementation: This activity has been incorporated into the ADF Financial Incentive Scheme draft policy, which is expected to be finalised by the end of this year. Notwithstanding, the availability of funding is likely to severely restrict the use of this facility. Recommendation: The provision of living-in accommodation be reassessed and the management of such accommodation be transferred to a commercial agency. Implementation: Studies are being undertaken as to the best method of providing living-in-accommodation. Consideration is being given to the provision of accommodation off-base and for the Defence Housing Authority to assume responsibility for the management of it. Recommendation: A team and unit citation be introduced to recognise outstanding contribution or achievement in non operational activities. Implementation: A submission is currently with CDF proposing introduction of a citation to recognise activities in support of East Timor, however consideration of a non-operational team or unit citation has not been progressed. Chapter Eight– A Learning Organisation Recommendation: The competencies and skills required for each ADF occupation and the prerequisites necessary for entry to training in those occupations be clearly specified. Implementation: This is being addressed via the Defence Scoping Project, currently limited to other ranks, with the intent being to subsequently expand the Project to include Officers. Recommendation: The Australian Defence Force Academy be used in a more flexible manner to meet ADF training and education needs. Implementation: This issue is being progressed as part of the renegotiation of the (ADFA) agreement between UNSW and Defence. In particular, Defence Education and Training is proposing reform of the Academy through the development of: An institution capable of greater flexibility in the delivery of education services to support the Services’ needs for officer development. Policy and management frameworks that will support increased diversity and level of access by Defence (and possibly others) to the resources embedded in the institution. Chapter Eleven– Industrial relations in the ADF Recommendation: The employer role for the ADF be vested in the CDF and the role of HQADF staff be adjusted accordingly. Implementation: A proposed amendment to the Administrative Arrangements Order seeking transfer of sections 58F to 58Q of the Defence Act 1903 from the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business to the Minister for Defence is currently with the Prime Minister’s office for approval. Chapter Fourteen– Major Challenges Recommendation: Geographical stability for members and their families be achieved through the collocation of support infrastructure and operational elements and the tri-Service clustering of mutually supporting units, formations and facilities. Implementation: Chief of Defence Force Directive 19, issued in 1995 advised that: geographic turbulence is to be restricted and that members are to be retained in the same geographic location for two successive postings if possible, the only exceptions are postings required for operational effectiveness and the need for career development of the individual, and financial considerations for both the Service and member are to influence the movement of personnel. More recently, the Posting Turbulence Review Team (PTRT) has been established by the CDF and Secretary to review posting turbulence within the ADF. The PTRT has been tasked to: Examine all the costs associated with postings and related relocations to determine why the costs are so high. Review posting philosophies, policies and practices to try and slow the frequency of postings. Examine service conditions to see if they achieve their original aims. Examine removals and accommodation policies to see if they are efficient, and to reduce the overall costs to Defence of moving and accommodating its people, and Assess the impact of the Defence Estate Strategic Plan on posting costs. A central aim of the review is to reduce the frequency of postings and removals in order to reduce posting turbulence, allow greater job mastery and create greater geographic stability for ADF families. Recommendation: Job requirements be clearly specified and that members be promoted on merit. Implementation: This is an ongoing process. This is a major task and each of the Services recognises the need to provide accurate job descriptions. Each of the Services has gone some way to addressing this problem by providing generic job annotations. However, the annotations are not yet linked to succession planning, recruiting targets, and training requirements. (4) Recommentations of Serving Australia that have been rejected are as follows: Chapter Four Employment and Work Practices. Recommendation: A Completion Incentive be paid at the end of each career phase, with the quantum varying for occupational groups. Implementation: Resource constraints mean that completion incentives can only be paid to selected occupations. Further, there is conflicting evidence about the value of completion incentives in improving the retention of personnel, and for this reason, extensions to the use of such incentives are now tightly constrained. Recommendation: A more flexible approach to the staffing of ADF positions be adopted by the use of relief pools, secondments, exchanges, second career streams and labour exchanges. (This recommendation and implementation also appears in response to Question 3) Relief staffing pools: This recommendation was made prior to the Defence Reform Program and consequential reductions in the size of the ADF. While there was an early attempt to create ‘tiger teams’ for special projects and to provide assistance where necessary in the workforce, there is now insufficient redundancy in ADF staff levels to implement this recommendation. Labour exchanges: While there has been no formal implementation of this recommendation, the Services make every attempt to co-locate married Service couples. If a member is married to a member of another Service, each of the Career Management Agencies contacts the other Service to advise them of their intention to move the individual. Recommendation: Communication be maintained with members not in continuous contact with the ADF, including advice on training and career development opportunities. Implementation: The requirement to maintain communication with former members of the ADF, and to provide them with documentation on training and career development opportunities would be cost prohibitive. Information is, however, made available to members in the Active Reserve component of the ADF. Recommendation: Establishment practices be reviewed to facilitate Flexible Work Practices. Implementation: The Personnel Management Key Solutions project will provide a consolidated ADF personnel and establishment database (at present there are five different databases: one for each of the Services, one for the Australian Public Service and another for ADF Headquarters positions). It may be possible to review establishment practices once the new database is on-line, however this recommendation is considered highly problematic, and the staff and resources do not currently exist to implement it. Recommendation: At the expiration of the current exemption under the Sex Discrimination Act, no further exemption be sought. Implementation: There is no time limit to exemptions under the Sex Discrimination Act unless there is a change to the Act. Chapter Five Reward, Recognition and Entitlements Recommendation: If in the new pay system a member moves from a higher paid job to a lower paid job, the pay of the member should be frozen until the remuneration of the position occupied increases above the frozen rate. Implementation: The model recommended by Serving Australia has not been followed by the Pay Salary Review but has been used as the basis for the development of the ADF work value model. The ADF work value model allocates a pay band according to the averages of all the jobs a member’s specialisation could expect to perform. Recommendation: Members who have plateaued in rank but who are performing at a demonstrably superior level be paid one or more performance increments. Implementation: This recommendation was not implemented because the ADF pay structures and remuneration scales that were developed were based on work value, not on individual performance. If a member has plateaued in rank, then they will have already reached the top increment under the Common Pay Scale. Recommendation: A Mobility Allowance, comprising three elements (an incentive to move, posting turbulence and disturbance) be introduced and paid on the occurrence of each move, with the quantum varying with members’ circumstances. Implementation: The allowance was to be implemented on a cost neutral basis, with funding achieved by freezing Service Allowance. Any additional increase in Service Allowance through normal pay increases was to be transferred to a Mobility Allowance ‘fund’. This attracted a number of adverse comments from various interest groups within Defence, and the decision to implement the Mobility Allowance has been put on hold. Recommendation: Service Allowance cover those elements that apply to all members and be incorporated into salary. Implementation: This concept has been regularly considered over the last 10-15 years. Each consideration has concluded that there is a requirement to separately identify the elements of Service Allowance for industrial reasons. These elements, which are separate to the concept of work value upon which salary is based, would lose their impact if incorporated into salary. The Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal has identified this allowance for review in the current financial year. Recommendation: The proposed work value based review of ADF pay consider whether any allowances or elements thereof can be incorporated into salary. Implementation: This recommendation was considered, and it was proposed to incorporate the work value elements of the four ‘environment’ allowances into salary. This, however, proved difficult to implement because; roll-in was differentially applied across the ranks, it was hard to separate the work value component of the rank, and the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal expressed reservations about the concept during conference time. Recommendation: The work value elements of Flying Allowance and Submarine Service Allowance be incorporated into work value based pay, and the attraction and retention element of Flying Allowance be dealt with under the Market Forces Pay Element. Implementation: As above this recommendation was considered, and it was proposed to incorporate the work value elements of the four ‘environment’ allowances into salary. This, however, proved difficult to implement because; roll-in was differentially applied across the ranks, it was hard to separate the work value component of the rank, and the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal expressed reservations about the concept during conference time. Chapter Eleven Industrial relations in the ADF Recommendation: The mechanism consist of forums at the local, regional and central levels where personnel issues would be resolved. Implementation: This issue has been considered however the staff and resources do not exist to establish the network of local regional and central forums recommended in Serving Australia. Notwithstanding, the Defence Personnel Executive has established a mechanism using the Defence policy. Recommendation: A Defence Member Representative be created, with a small secretariat to assist members in the forum process and to make formal representations on behalf of members. Implementation: This issue has been considered however the staff and resources do not exist to establish a Defence Member Representative and associated secretariat. Alternative mechanisms-in particular the Defence Equity Organisation-have been established by the Defence Personnel Executive to facilitate representations by ADF personnel on the development of personnel policies. Chapter Twelve Supporting Personnel Management Recommendation: The ADF establish a simple and flexible legal infrastructure to support the personnel process. Implementation: This recommendation involves fundamental reform of all of the legislation which pertains to the ADF, is far beyond the capacity of the Australian Defence Organisation to undertake with present staff resources. Chapter Fourteen Major Challenges Recommendation: Respite for members be achieved by adjusting manpower requirements and the level of activities and operational commitments including preparedness requirements. Implementation: Respite continues to be a problem for ADF personnel in some areas. The operational tempo has actually increased since the release of Serving Australia, thereby increasing pressure on many ADF personnel. The ability of ADF personnel to sustain this increased operational tempo will be considered during development of the Defence White Paper. Department of the Environment and Heritage: Salary and Staffing Levels (Question No. 1826) Mr Tanner asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 16 August 2000: In 1999-2000 in the Minister’s Department, what was the (a) average salary paid in each Australian Public Service Salary band and (b) average staffing level (average number of employees) for each band. following answer to the honourable member’s question: (a) The average salary paid in each Australian Public Service Salary band in 1999-00 is set out in columns A, C and E of the following table for the Department of the Environment and Heritage (Environment Australia), the Bureau of Meteorology, and the Australian Antarctic Division.

(2) What evidence does the Government have that it is providing sufficient support to groups such as these, whose aim is to improve living conditions of Aboriginal people in Australia. the following information to the honourable member’s question: (1) I have been informed that both the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission and the Department of Health and Aged Care are aware of media reports relating to a decision by the Central Australian Aboriginal Alcohol Programs Unit to curtail its services. This organisation was required to operate with a reduced budget allocation, as both the Territory Health Service and Aboriginal Hostels Ltd, an independent statutory authority within the Portfolio of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, determined not to provide ongoing funding for a men’s program. Rather than discontinue its men’s program, the Unit chose to operate for only 40 weeks of the year. The funding decisions of the Northern Territory Government and Aboriginal Hostels Ltd did not alter a decision by the Department of Health and Aged Care to provide $470,838 to the Unit for a women’s program. The Office for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health, within the Department of Health and Aged Care, is currently discussing with the Unit concerns that it has in relation to overdue financial reports, the Unit’s budget and accounting practices relating to the acquittal of grants, as well as concerns relating to $50,000 unspent from the 1999-2000 Financial Year. (2) Both the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory Governments share responsibility for providing health services, including drug and alcohol harm minimisation services, for Indigenous people in Central Australia. In the Alice Springs region, the Department of Health and Aged Care provides financial support for the Injatrnama Aboriginal Corporation ($213,089) for petrol sniffing and alcohol programs, Ilpurla Aboriginal Corporation ($108,194) also to address petrol sniffing and alcohol problems, Ngkarte Mikwekenhe ($43,205) for an alcohol liaison officer, Central Australian Aboriginal Congress ($495,607 over four years) for a mobile youth outreach program and for counselling, and the AIDS Council of Central Australia ($295,000 over four years) for a youth outreach program. These programs demonstrate the Commonwealth Government’s commitment to addressing problems arising from licit and illicit drug abuse. Australian Film, Television and Radio School (Question No. 1981) Mr Tanner asked the Minister for the Arts and the Centenary of Federation, upon notice, on 3 October 2000: Is the Australian Film Television and Radio School campus at North Ryde carried as an asset in the Commonwealth’s balance sheet; if so, (a) has the valuation been based on historic cost, replacement value or deprival value (b) when was the valuation made and (c) what is the balance sheet value. Land and buildings at the Australian Film, Television and Radio School’s North Ryde campus are carried as a non-financial asset on the Australian Film, Television and Radio School’s balance sheet. (a) In accordance with Schedule2 to the Commonwealth Authorities and Company Act Orders, the North Ryde buildings are revalued progressively in accordance with the deprival method of valuation in successive 3-year cycles. Land is valued annually on the basis of its existing use value. (b) Leasehold land and buildings were revalued at 30 June 2000. (c) The balance sheet value of the land and buildings at the North Ryde campus as at 30 June 2000 was $26.579million. This excludes accumulated depreciation and amortisation of $1.636 million. Australia Post: Telephone Directories (Question No. 2003) Mr Andren asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 3 October 2000: (1) Do Australia Post outlets no longer stock the complete range of Australian phone directories.",204,Intranet To Allow Adf Personnel To Contribute To Discussions On The Development Of Personnel

334,Mr Mcgauran,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(2) What is the reason for the withdrawal of phone directories from Australia Post outlets. (3) Does the Minister recognise that while phone directories are available on-line, many people, particularly in country areas, do not have access to the Internet and require the use of hard copies. (4) Will the Government take action to restore this service, if not why not. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: Based on advice received from Australia Post. (1) Australia Post has not displayed (or been required to display) full sets of all directories since they split from Telecom/Telstra in 1975. The display arrangements have changed over the years to reflect cost saving initiatives introduced by Telstra and customer demand. Australia Post has a commercial agreement with Pacific Access (to which Telstra has outsourced its White and Yellow pages distribution function), for the display of telephone directories at postal outlets. Under the current agreement: GPOs are required to display a full national set of White and Yellow Pages directories (excluding Local Yellow Pages); Other postal outlets in metropolitan areas are required to display local directories; Postal outlets in major country centres are required to display a full State set of White and Yellow Pages directories (excluding Local Yellow Pages); and Other postal outlets in country areas are required to display the State’s capital White and Yellow Pages directories, local directories and directories of areas bordering their location. In addition, from time to time, by mutual agreement, selected postal outlets may be required to display specialist telephone directories. (2) Demand for full sets of telephone directories at the majority of postal outlets is minimal. The current agreement was negotiated on fully commercial terms and accurately reflects customer demand. (3) Australia Post recognises that some people, particularly in country areas, do not have on-line access to telephone directories. Under the current agreement, individual postal outlets can obtain “out of area” directories, if requested. (4) The arrangements are a commercial matter for Australia Post. In accordance with the provisions in the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989, Australia Post is required to perform its functions, as far as practicable, in a manner consistent with sound commercial practice. Australia Post has advised that it does not have any plans to review the current display arrangements. Australian Defence Force: Reservists (Question No. 2028) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 5 October 2000: (1) In 1999-2000 how many reservists were recruited into the (a) Navy (b) Army and (c) Air Force. (2) What are the 2000-01 recruitment targets for reservists for the (a) Navy (b) Army and (c) Air Force. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1)(a) Navy: 29. (b) Army: 1566. (c) Air Force: 104. (2)(a) Navy: 132. (b) Army: 4 778. (c) Air Force: 205.",206,Total 1195 03 1438 00 338 51

Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: My department is aware of 2819 former Australian Prisoners of War of the Japanese who were living in Australia as at 30 June 2000. Royal Australian Air Force: Personnel (Question No. 2043) Mr Horne asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 11 October 2000: (1) Is he aware that some Defence personnel from the RAAF have been classified as medically unfit and therefore discharged because they are insulin dependent diabetics. (2) Is he aware that some Defence personnel in the RAAF, the Army and the Navy who are also insulin dependent diabetics have been maintained in the Defence Forces. (3) Can he investigate and explain why those Defence personnel who have been discharged as medically unfit do not receive the same right to employment as other RAAF personnel with insulin dependent diabetes. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) Yes (2) Yes (3) Insulin dependent diabetics are deemed to be non-deployable. If the parent Service considers that an individual possesses expertise that is essential and in short supply within the Australian Defence Force (ADF), the individual may be retained on waiver under tightly controlled conditions. In general, insulin dependent diabetics are discharged medically unfit for further service. The ADF has a duty of care for such individuals that cannot be waived by the individuals themselves. Telstra: Cable Industry (Question No. 2069) Mr Latham asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 12 October 2000: (1) Is he aware of recent criticism by the head of Microsoft, Mr Bill Gates, that the involvement of Telstra in the cable industry has inflated broadband Internet prices in Australia and slowed the take-up rate for high-speed access. (2) What is Telstra’s response to this criticism. (3) What is his response to this criticism. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) I am aware of claims by Mr Gates during his visit to Australia in early September that broadband Internet penetration tends to be higher in countries where telecommunications companies are not significant owners of cable infrastructure. (2) Telstra advises that it has taken a prudent and cautious approach to the use of Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) technologies in its network, to ensure that standards were resolved to avoid high-speed systems impacting both with each other in the network and on the several million existing customers served by the copper network. (3) Telstra further advises that many global companies can exclude Internet Service Provider costs, installation, activation and GST from their prices. Telstra considers that if these elements are included,",207,Total 1195 03 1438 00 338 51
336,Mr Mcgauran,"The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Artsits own costs for Asymmetrical Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) services compare favourably with those of ADSL providers in the USA, Asia, the UK and New Zealand. The Government’s view is that it is not necessary to structurally separate the ownership of infrastructure from the supply of telecommunications services in order to enjoy the benefits of competition in broadband services. What is important is that there be arrangements in place to ensure that telecommunications companies can gain access to the underlying infrastructure on reasonable terms and conditions. In Australia, we have a telecommunications access regime which has increasingly become a model for other countries. Telecommunications companies may seek to have essential services ‘declared’ by the ACCC for access. The ACCC may declare a service where it considers this would be in the long term interest of end-users of telecommunications, normally following a public inquiry process. Once a service is declared, a carrier or service provider who supplies that service must meet standard access obligations in relation to it. The declaration of the ‘unconditioned local loop’ service in July 1999 is an example of how the access regime can promote competition in broadband data services. Declaration of the service enables competitors to use Telstra’s local loop cable to connect their own electronic components and switching equipment, in order to supply high-speed data services direct to end-users. In addition to Telstra, around ten telecommunications companies have already indicated their intention to provide ADSL services using Telstra’s local loop. In addition, there is an increasing range of broadband delivery options, using cable modem, microwave radio and satellite technologies. Significant new network rollouts utilising these technologies have recently occurred or are proposed, as detailed in the report of the Telecommunications Service Inquiry. These new delivery options will continue to reduce reliance on the existing cable networks for supply of broadband Internet services. A raft of new service providers are currently positioning themselves to take advantage of these opportunities in the highly competitive telecommunications environment. Telstra: Maintenance Contract with Skilled Communications (Question No. 2073) Mr Rudd asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 12 October 2000: (1) Has Telstra recently awarded a maintenance contract on Telstra’s cabling in South-East Queensland to a company called Skilled Communications, if so (a) when was this contract awarded, (b) how much was it for and (c) what period of time was it intended to cover. (2) Has Telstra refused to honour its contract with Skilled Communications; if so, has this resulted in a large number of employees in Skilled Communications’ Geebung plant being given notice. (3) What reasons has Telstra provided to the company and the Government on why it is not proceeding with this maintenance contract at this time. (4) As the majority shareholder in Telstra, what action does the Government intend to take on this matter. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: Based on advice received from Telstra. (1) Yes (a) September 2000, effective from 1 October 2000 (b) Telstra regards this information as commercial-in-confidence (c) 3 years (2) The contract is now active and Telstra is working with the contractor.

As a consequence Skilled Communications may be in a position of having to reduce its workforce. This is a matter for Skilled Communications. (3) The contract is active. Telstra is currently working with the contractor to deliver the required levels of activity to maintain the network and thus customer service. (4) Consistent with the arrangements for Government Business Enterprises, Telstra’s Board and Management are responsible for the day to day running of the Company’s operations. Immigration: Parent Sponsorships (Question No. 2083) Dr Theophanous asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 12 October 2000: (1) Is he able to say what the Government’s likely response will be to the failure to pass legislation relating to the creation of a special category requiring payments for parents sponsorships. (2) Will he abandon the idea of charging for parent sponsorships. (3) Will he increase the quota under the general parents category from 500 to 4000 over two years, as envisaged under the proposed legislation. (1) I am disappointed that the proposed visa category for aged parents was not supported by the nonGovernment parties in the Senate. My disappointment is nothing as compared with that of Australians wishing to sponsor their parents. Full passage of the legislation would have allowed 4,000 more parents to be reunited with their families in Australia. The legislation would have achieved a fairer contribution by the parent and Australian sponsor to cover the substantial health and welfare costs, thus reducing the burden on the Australian taxpayer. While the creation of a new visa category for parents was rejected, Schedule1 of the legislation was passed which amends access to Medicare by certain applicants for a permanent visa. Notwithstanding the recent defeat of the legislation which would have allowed more parents to come to Australia, the Government is committed to family reunion and will continue to look for viable alternatives for parents to join their families in Australia. In the meantime, the flexible visitor visa policy for parents, which has been in place since November 1999, means that parents who meet the criteria are not separated from their children in Australia for extended periods. I am sure that community views on viable alternatives for parent migration will be forthcoming in my current consultations on the 2001-2002 Immigration Program. (2) I have consistently proposed that parents and their sponsors should make a fairer contribution to the significant health and welfare costs that would otherwise be borne by the Australian taxpayers. I will continue to explore ways of achieving this. (3) The number of parent visa places available in the 2000-2001 Program Year consists of the 500 places for the existing visa categories (subclasses 103 offshore and 804 onshore) and about 750 places for the Designated Parent Visa category (subclasses 118 offshore and 859 onshore). Therefore, the total number of expected parent visa grants in the 2000-2001 Program Year is in the order of 1,250. The 4,000 visa place contingency reserve was intended to be utilised by applicants in the proposed new visa category for aged parents. As this visa category was not allowed to proceed, the 4,000 visa place contingency reserve cannot be accessed. This contingency reserve of visa places for parents would have been additional to the total estimated Program level of 76,000 for the 2000-2001 Program Year.",209,Total 1195 03 1438 00 338 51
