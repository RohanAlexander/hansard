At the time, the inforcome tax. Perhaps should this Parliament impose an inconie tax, a remission will be provided for honourable members. under the Seamen's Compensation Act have been brought under the notice of the Minister of Trade and Customs, and how much money has been paid?

Compensation Act became law, the shipowners are bound to furnish returns giving the number of accidents and the amountspaid, and some of these returns have cometo hand, though I do not think that all*, are yet available. If the honourable member will give notice of his question for Tuesday next, I shall try to get the information which he desires. His suggestion, that an annual return should be laid on the: table is a very good one. -WARRAN T OFFICERS-FACILITIE S FORPrime Minister been drawn to an interview published in the Sydney Daily Telegraph between Captain Davey, of the Canadian Cadets, and a representative of the newspaper? which the honourable member refers.

This -contrary my orders, issued atst June; and Caplain Hollander, Area Officer concerned, will be -dealt with to-morrow. One hundred and thirty cadets were prosecuted, and each fined thirteen shillings costs and ordered to make up drills. I should like to add that the' Minister of Defence has asked for further information .as to why the costs were so high in each case. from the answers given by the Honorary Minister to various questions that have been put to him in reference to the prosecution of cadets, that the lads are henceforth to be allowed to evade their training, and that they are not to be prosecuted under any conditions ? has been given. The statement made by me was very clear, namely, that those who had put in fifty-four hours or more out of the sixty-four hours per annum, which they were required to devote to drill, would not foe prosecuted provided that they gave their personal undertaking to drill the necessary -number of hours, and that those who had -drilled for less than fifty-four hours would be prosecuted. At the same time, the presiding magistrate in each case will be asked -to take their personal assurance that they will do the balance of the drill necessary. question asked by the honourable member for East Sydney regarding the fining of cadets in New South Wales, I wish to ask the Minister representing the Minister of Defence -whether he does not think it desirable that officers who have disregarded the authority of their superiors should be removed from their command ancl superseded? -particulars of each case, it is impossible for me to say whether it is desirable that the officers should be removed. I would point out, however, that the telegram from the State Commandant, which I have already read, is very emphatic. pears to have acted contrary to express orders, and the State commandant says that he "" will be dealt with to-morrow."" the Minister representing the Minister of Defence what the Government propose to do, in the last resort, in the event of any cadet refusing to carry out his personal undertaking ? refusal, the Act will be administered as it stands on the statute-book. Minister representing the Minister of Defence whether he is aware that the parades in the South Maitland district are so fixed that it is necessary for cadets to lose a day's work in order to put in an hour's drill, and that the failure to put in that one hour's drill renders them liable to prosecution? If^so, will he see that proper provision is made for the bovs to attend drill ? the position is as stated by the honourable member. I know that definite orders have been issued to the Area Officers so to arrange the parades as to cause a minimum of inconvenience to the lads and to all persons concerned. They have been instructed to meet, as far as they humanly can, the requirements of the different localities, and the industries carried on therein. The Minister will be glad to have brought before him any instances where this direction .is not carried out, and no doubt, when any such case is brought before him, he will take what steps are necessary to meet it. representing the Postmaster General aware that a messenger of the Department in Hobart was instantly dismissed for failing to attend drill, although no provision had been made for giving him time off to attend? fact stated, but I shall have the-matter inquired into. 1 ' V :-Postmaster-General's Department to retain the 7 s. 6d. deposit paid by candidates for examination for admission to the Public Service? done, but the practice of the Postmaster General's Department would be the same as that of the other Departments, because Some officer apthe matter comes under the control of the Public Service Commissioner.",14,Attending Drill Dismissal Or Messenger Postmaster General S Department

If the accusation is true, it would indicate a very extraordinary condition of affairs. Whether true or not, it ought to.be inquired into, and perhaps the Prime Minister will see his way clear to make himself acquainted with the facts. big a surprise to me as to the honourable member; and I had the same idea as himself. There is not only going to be some inquiry, but some alteration. The positive statement is that the rates for Government advertisements are about three times higher than those for commercial advertisements. That is the statement of Messrs. Gordon and Gotch, who invite honourable members, if they so desire, to see the firm's books. Minister aware that in different States, particularly in New South Wales, the country press do all their advertising business through a co-operative press agency, and that a proper scale of charges is arranged? I should like to know whether the Cooperative Press Association had an opportunity to tender for this work? that opportunity was given or not. NeitherI , nor any other honourable member in the House, can direct the Governor of the Bank how he is to carry on his business. ister favour a return being placed on the table showing the amount paid for advertising the Commonwealth Bank, the number of newspapers in which the advertisements appeared, and the price paid to each newspaper ? for Echuca has tabled a motion for a return connected with this subject, and that return is being prepared. ticularly in connection with the advertising with that. I think the Governor would be willing to give the information desired by I shall inquire, the honourable member for Maribyrnong; indeed, Messrs. Gordon and Gotch would give it to the honourable member. from the Governor of the Bank. ister tell us whether Messrs. Gordon and Gotch, who were apparently given this contract without any competition or tendering, haye in any instances increased the original price offered for the advertisements by 50 per cent.; and, if so, can the Prime Minister explain how that is consistent with the statement that they are getting only commission on the sum they receive for advertising? Messrs. Gordon and Gotch have increased the rates by a few pounds in the aggregate to some newspapers where they thought the advertisement was worth the money, and that this was done out of the commission. The honourable member would be able to get all the information from Messrs. Gordon and Gotch, who are very anxious in this regard, seeing that they have been accused of being sweaters. to hold a brief for Messrs. Gordon and Gotch.

Why do we want any Federal Territory? extraordinary thing. It is as though we were a body of people separate from Australia, and must have something special for ourselves-as if we were representatives of a separate State, independent of all the others and of Australia. It seems to be thought that we remain absolutely distinct from them. The cry that we should have a separate territory is, to me, an extraordinary one. It suggests that the Federal Parliament consists of members differing from the rest of the people, and antagonistic to them. In the State Capitals now the Federal Government has all the public buildings it needs. Is it proposed to move the Customs Houses, the barracks, and all other Federal buildings to Yass-Canberra? To carry out the idea to the full"" it would be necessary to have a lake at Yass-Canberra for the accommodation of our men-of-war, with a canal leading to it from Jervis Bay. Boiled down, the idea is a ridiculous one. As a matter of fact, very few of the Commonwealth buildings will be in the Federal Territory. The Federal Capital will not be an industrial centre. The Federal Woollen Mills will be at Geelong, the Small Arms Factory at Lithgow, the Cordite Factory at Maribyrnong, and other factories in other parts of the Commonwealth. In this matter we have slavishly copied the example of the United States of America. Because of the jealousy of the States, it was decided to have the Federal Capital of Washington in Federal Territory, and some people thought it necessary for us to imitate that example. I have not the slightest doubt that if the Australian people are allowed to decide the matter-as they have a right to do-the y will vote' for an amendment of the Constitution so that the Federal Parliament may meet at Sydney, and that thus an expenditure of millions on the building of a new city far removed from any other place may be saved.

We send to the Old Country annually £13,000,000 to pay interest on money borrowed; and a perusal of the commercial columns of the newspapers will show that we are exporting an immense quantity of gold. This year something like £8,000,000 have already been exported. When our imports exceed our exports, and we have to pay cash for what we buy, in addition to interest on our debts, we shall find ourselves in an awkward position. Every business man knows that at the present time it is difficult to get money. The banks have not too much, and if we had fifty Commonwealth Banks we should not be any better off. Unless economy is practised by the Governments of the Commonwealth and -of the States and privately, the country will be in difficulties within a few years. We have had five or six prosperous years, and have got a little bit inflated. With all .this expenditure ahead of us, the Government will do well not to waste money, and money will be wasted if we build a city that is not required, when we could meet our needs by the expenditure of £500,000 'in Sydney.

Our first thought should be for works of a utilitarian character, from which we can get a fair.return for the money invested. If , as has been stated by the Minister of Home Affairs, the rentals from the land resumed in the Federal Capital will be sufficient to pay interest on the amount which has been spent there up to the present time, the expenditure has hitherto been justified; but no interest would be earned by the money spent on large public buildings, and the peopie are beginning to regret that they entered into Federation because of the vast expenditure whicb confronts them. In any* case, a referendum would settle the matter. The proposal of the honourable member for Balaclava is to give to New South Wales what I think that State is justified in getting. Before the Constitution was adopted, it was stipulated by Victorian representatives that until the Federal Parliament met in the Federal Capital in New South Wales it should sit in Melbourne. Many Victorians are now prepared to say that they do not wish the Federal Parliament to remain in Melbourne for an inordinate length of time t and would consent to an alteration of the Constitution which would enable it to meet in Sydney.

He is generally sound as to his facts, but to-day he suggested the taking of 100 acres of the Centennial Park for the use of the Federal Government as a means for saving money. Does he know the value of that land? It is from £ 1 0 to £ 2 0 a foot, and therefore its resumption would cost more than the building of the proposed city. easy to see the policy behind this proposal, namely, to promise, pause, postpone. to block the construction of the Capital. that in my mind.

Balaclava wishes to intensify this evil. He spoke of the desirability of immigration, but are all the people who come here to live in Sydney and Melbourne? Who provides the revenue of this country? Is it the middlemen of the cities who tax the producers, or the producers themselves? I hope that this Victorian move will get no support. We have fought out the question of sites 'here. ber for Echuca is responsible for the defeat of the Dalgety site. that tlie matter bung on his vote. stated in the hearing of several that he would vote for Dalgety, and then voted against it . Now he is trying to cover uphis tracks. It was not the same with the honourable member for Balaclava. He and I do not wish to be guilty of a number of other Victorians stood their ground. Mr *K.ELLY I thought that the honourable member was not going to deal with this question from a provincial stand-point. tainly am not doing so. If I had any idea of speaking from a provincial point, of view I should advocate the transfer of fact, however, I accept the verdict of the Parliament. The question has been settled, and the proposal now before us is merely a clever move on the part of an'able political engineer to block altogether the establishment of the Federal Capital, and to make Melbourne the Seat of Government for another ten years.' It is all very well to talk of this provincial feeling dying down. Maybei t is, to some extent, but behind this proposal is a move to retain Melbourne as the Seat of Government. It is said that Melbourne is not benefited. I think it is. It would be just as reasonI t is able to say that the running of the Melbourne Cup every year does not bring a lot of money into Melbourne and benefit This is merely a Victorian move the tradespeople as it is to assert that the establishment of the Seat of Government I had nothing like here is of no advantage to the people of this city.

The honourable member for Eden-Monaro has repeated a statement that has been made from time to time by other members that my individual vote was responsible for Yass-Canberra instead of Dalgety being selected as the Federal Capital.

At the sixth ballot, the -voting was the same; while at the seventh, twenty-four votes were cast for each site. A t the eighth ballot, thirty-one votes were cast for Dalgety, and twenty-seven for Yass-Canberra; while at the ninth and final ballot thirty-three votes were cast for Dalgety, and thirty-nine for Yass-Canberra. These figures show that in no case could my vote have affected the decision. personal explanation, I wish to -say that I did not assert that the honourable member's individual vote had resulted in the selection of Yass-Canberra rather than Dalgety, as the site of the Federal Capital. My statement was that the honourable member, with others, was responsible for the rejection of Dalgety, and I look upon the honourable member as being jointly responsible with three others for the decision arrived at. The honourable member made a statement in this House that he was in favour of Dalgety, and, notwithstanding that statement, at a critical stage he I desire to make a pervoted for Yass-Canberra. There are honourable members in this House who heard him make the statement that he was in favour of Dalgety, and I would ask whether it is not remarkable that he carries about with him figures to show how he did vote on the occasion in question? -The honourable member for Balaclava deserves to be congratulated on the motion that he has submitted to the House. It may appear to some honourable members that I am indulging in something in the nature of high treason when I assert that the a great deal is to be said in favour of it . That view of my attitude will be taken more especially by those antiquated members who have sat in this House since the inception of Federation; but it may surprise some to know that there is throughout Australia a feeling that is not at all favorable to a large expenditure at the present time in connection with the Federal CapiMy individual vote, theretal.

After all, I do not consider that there is anything sacred in the Constitution.

We could get land reasonably only by going out into the suburbs. want to see the present disproportion between city and country made greater by any means whatever. Rather do I want to see some rational decentralization. That is our master problem which we must face, sooner or later. It is becoming more acute year by year, and we ought to do nothing to increase the baneful effects which we see at present following the growth of our huge cities. I believe the goodsense of this House will prevail, as it has prevailed during the last twelve years and more.' The Capital will not cost the taxpayers of Australia one penny in the end. They will gain, and not lose, by its establishment, if it is wisely built and wisely governed. This matter is so important that I shall take this opportunity to give my views regarding tbe continual cry that the building of a Federal Capital will be a source of endless expense. At the outset let me say that, in my opinion, the constitutional provision that the Capital must be in New South Wales was the result of huckstering between the Premiers then in power. However, the engagement was solemnly entered into among the States that the Capital should be in New South Wales, though not within a hundred miles of Sydney. As the representative of the city within which this Parliament now meets, I shall have much pleasure in voting for its removal to Yass-Canberra, though 1 should have pre-: ferred Dalgety. If the motion had suggested a change of site, I should have voted for Dalgety as 1 did before, it being for many reasons the better site; but a majority in its wisdom decided for Yass-Canberra, notwithstanding the fact thatwater to supply the town will have to be raised 800 feet. No other capital city in the world was ever built under such circumstances. It is -possible, however, that in the future a .good supply may be obtained by gravitation from a source 30 or 40 miles away. During my twenty years of political life I never saw more leg-pulling, ear-biting, -and other unfair tactics, than were indulged -in to carry the Yass-Canberra site, and in saying that I am accusing certain persons who belong to my own party. A page of English history that has not yet been f u l l y instance written is that relating to land tenure. The ronly place of importance in the Empire where there is a system of land tenure similar to that of the Federal Capital Territory, is Hong Kong, where, with the exception of a few portions sold many years Frankly, I do not ago, all the land is under lease. In a fewcases the leases are for 999 years, in others for 99 years; but generally, they are for 75 years. ' Our experiment was well worth trying. If any man will walk down Collins-street, where the land is worth on an. average'j£8oo to £i,""ooo a foot, and count the partition walls, he will see how much is wasted. Between William-street and Russell-street the loss amounts to neatly £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 worth of land. The building of the Federal Capital will largely increase the value of the land on which it is built. Land which now may be worth only 5s., may become worth £ 5 , 0 0 0 . . The referendum proposed is not worthy of the name. I say that, though I claim and value the friendship of the honourable member for Balaclava: By the referendum of the future, every citizen of Australia will have the right to change the situation of the Capital, if he can secure a majority to vote with him. The people will then be dominant, and may order what legislation they please. We shall then have a Government elected by the whole House. The absurd practice of the past, and the less absurd practice of the Labour party, wall be succeeded by that mode of election which is the best of all. Then, by means of the referendum and initiative, the people will tell Parliament what legislation must be passed. Regarding the cost of the Capital, I am glad to be in accord with the honourable member for Parramatta. A l though politically we quarrel very often, we occasionally agree. I was glad to hear him say that ultimately the Capital will not have cost the Australian public one penny. That is my opinion. Buti t need not cost a penny even at the commencement. In America, more money is spent on statistics than in any other country in the world, and the best statisticians there and elsewhere are now giving attention to an experiment that was tried in the island of Guernsey by a municipality. The adoption of the means taken by that municipality to have a market erected will enable any State to construct its public works, whether revenue-producing or not, without cost. All that is necessary is the issue of certain paper currency. As one concrete is worth an ocean of talk, let me set out what took place in Guernsey, a State allied to Great Britain. The islands of Guernsey, Jersey,",27,Chapman Eden The Capital To Dalgety As A Matter Of
146,Mr Joseph Cook,We could get,28,Chapman Eden The Capital To Dalgety As A Matter Of
147,Dr. Maloney (Melbourne) [4,"10]and Sark were never conquered by Great Britain, but came to her through the marriage of one of her kings. In the early part of last century, the capital town of the island of Guernsey possessed no market place; but having the land, desired to erect a building on it. In those days, it was not easy to borrow in the money market of London or of the European capitals. But the town had a splendid governor, a man whose reputation as a statesman will in the future be one of the brightest in the world-D e Lisle Brock. He said to the municipal councillors, "" Have you no brickmakers, no stonemasons, no carpenters? If you have, why cannot you build a market yourselves?"" The seed sown germinated, and the plant grew and flourished. The municipal council called together its citizens, and it was agreed to issue currency notes in the name of Market House Scrip. Each note had the value of £ 1 . The contractors accepted them, and the shopkeepers accepted them, the municipal council providing the financial circuit, which currency, like elecnext step would be the introduction of a tricity, must have. It agreed to take the notes in lieu of rents and taxes. As a consequence, the market house was built, and the fish stalls, instead of remaining in the streets, were placed in a splendid building which to-day is a monument to this mode of financing. Every year a holiday was proclaimed, and the money received in rents and taxes was burnt, so that within ten years the whole of the market house scrip had been redeemed and destroyed, and Guernsey thus obtained without spending a penny a property which returned £500, or more. Had the railways of Victoria, which cost close upon £53,000,000, been paid for by the issue of currency notes, backed up by the value of the land on which the lines run, the rolling-stock, and the State's security, we should not now be owing £53,000,000, and should not have paid over £55,000,000 to the money lenders of Europe, borrowing in some instances at 6 per cent. Our railways would to-day be paying nearly 4 per cent., and there would be no interest charge. regard to the building of the P'ederal City, we can issue currency notes which will not be redeemable in gold, and will be specially ear-marked. They will be supported by the value of the lands in the 'Federal Territory, by the value of the buildings erected there, and by the value of every improvement carried out by the Commonwealth. In the city, there will have to be residences, hotels, coffee palaces, shops, and factories. Rent should be on a 4 or 5 per cent, basis, and every year when it was paid in this special currency, the notes received should be destroyed. Then within twenty years every note would have been redeemed, and we should have a capital which would not have cost a penny, and there would be no huge interest bill to pay. Honourable members can see in how short a time these notes would be redeemed. What makes it hard to repay debts is the constant mounting up of the interest. I make this suggestion like the sowing of seed, and have no hesitation in saying that I shall vote against the motion. I regret that I appear to be opposing a referendum, but what is proposed is not a real referendum that would do honour to the country or to the people. debate to which we have listened would be very valuable if the passing of the motion would put this problem in front of the people, but were the motion passed, the Bill for the amendment of the Constitution, and the form in which that Bill would leave this House would depend largely on the Victorian representatives. The Bill would, as introduced, propose to give the people.the alternative of Sydney or Yass Canberra as the Federal Capital, but, with every newspaper in Victoria clamouring for consideration for the interests of Melbourne, the omission of "" Sydney would be moved in Committee with a view to the substitution of ""Melbourne."" I wonder how long these broad Nationalists I see two or three in the Ministerial corner and others in the Opposition cornerwould then support the claims of Sydney as the Capital of the Commonwealth This proposition may at first sight appear fascinating to one who, not only as a resident of Sydney, but as an Australian citizen, recognises that Sydney is pre-eminently fitted to be the Capital of the Commonwealth, but when one looks at the element of human nature which is present, even in the innoIn cent member who has submitted it, and at the smiles with which it is greeted by other representatives of Victoria, one must come to the conclusion that there is in it a great deal more than meets the eye. However, I do not wish to treat my honourable friends from Victoria in the way that some of them would like to see our claims to the Capital treated, and consequently I shall not endeavour to talk out'this motion.

I maintain, and will endeavour to substantiate, that not only has the Trust been misUsing its power ever since that report was submitted, but that it is continuing to do so, so far as the public are concerned. I have already said that, in regard to the employ6s in the industry itself, I have nothing to say against the Trust; but it is still misusing its power in a way detrimental to the interests of the Australian people. report of the Commission goes on to sayNeither, in our opinion, would it be of advantage to the Commonwealth for Parliament, by legislation, to break up the existing organizationThat is a most extraordinary stand to take, in view of the admission that the Trust is misusing its powers to the detriment of the people of Australia. The report proceedsNeither, in our opinion, would it be of advantage to the Commonwealth for Parliament, by legislation, to break up the existing organizajection, so far as I understand, of a num-' tion, to revert to the wasteful and unorganized methods that existed prior to the formation of the combine. There is no evidence to show that in Australia the combine has up to the present time endeavoured to force a policy of exclusive dealing in their goods on the retailers. I venture to say that if a Royal Commission were to inquire to-day, they would find ample evidence, because, as. I am credibly informed, retailers are practically compelled, not only to sell the goods of the Trust, but the particular goods which it happens to suit the Trust at the time to sell. the do so, if they are ""allowed to retain full power-if power is not given to this Parliament to deal with the Trust? in this Parliament to prevent these things being done. has said the contrary. power in this Parliament to deal with questions of manufacture; but, in regard to ample power to prevent the Combine operating in a way detrimental to the people-ther e is every power that this Parliament can ever have.

We have ample power to deal with the Trust up to a certain point, and then the State Parliament has power to do the rest. It might be, from some points of view, more advantageous for one Parliament to deal with the Trust-that is a question for argument-bu t it will not add to the total sum of our powers as a sovereign people to vest the whole of the power in this Parliament. . the whole of Australia at one stroke. stroy the power of local government to that extent. However, that is not the particular point I am now arguing. While the Royal Commission found that there was no evidence to show that in Australia the Combine had, up to the present, endeavoured to force exclusive dealing on the retailers, they reported that evidence was given that the British-American Trust had endeavoured to do so in their respective countries. I venture to say .that if an inquiry were made to-day it would be found that the British and American sections of the Trust have now obtained an absolutely predominating influence, and are applying in Australia to-day the methods which the Commission state they were endeavourirfg to apply in their respective countries. If any honourable member were to ask a tobacconist who happened to be his friend, whether he dare sell certain brands of cigars and tobacco at less than a certajn price he would be very quickly told that it could not be done-that the goods were supplied by the Trust on the strict understanding that they were sold at a certain price. The Trust can now supply practically any quality it likes, and some of the tobacco, cigars, and cigarettes, even those sold in Parliament House here, are not what they might be. The report of the Commission goes on to sayAttempts have been made by the Tobacconists' sion reported, there were eighty-three facAssociations of New South Wales and Victoria to form limited liability companies of their members, the object apparently being to cooperate with Kronheimer Ltd. in fixing a scale of retail prices. A scale of retail prices has been fixed, though by the Trust, and not by the retailers. At the risk of losing supplies, retailers dare not sell at a lower price than that laid down by the Trust; they quickly find, if they do so, that they get no more tobacco, cigars, or cigarettes. candles, and other articles. tailers are at liberty to get other brands of soap and candles. The Tobacco Trust has now got practically the whole control of the manufacturing processes. There is only one factory of any size-and that is in Melbourne-whic h to-day is standing up against the Trust. The other day I mentioned the very small amount of capital which this Trust put into the business originally. I find, on reference to Knibbs, that the total value of their land and buildings, in which the greater part of their capital is invested apart from their stock, is set down at £379,866. That does not represent the original value of the land in 1902, when the Trust was formed. Land was then of very much smaller value, and, as nearly all the Trust's land consists of business sites, in regard to which there has been an enormous increment of value during the last decade, we may safely say that the original investment in land and buildings was not more than £225,000-that the difference between the value then and a the value now must be 40 per cent. The capital invested in plant and machinery is only £ 2 5 0 , 3 1 1 . have all that. tenths ? cent. In order to give honourable members some idea of how this Trust is progressing, I refer once more to the Royal Commission's report, which states :Returns supplied by Mr Fergusson, Chief Inspector of Excise, Melbourne, show in 1903 12 tobacco, 75 cigar, and 16 cigarette factories; in 1904 return shows that these had decreased to 11 tobacco, 68 cigar, and 14 cigarette factories, a decrease of 10 factories in one year. That is to say, when the Royal Commistories of one sort and another engaged in the manufacture of tobacco in Australia. On reference to KnibbsI find that these eighty-three factories have decreased to",31,Tobacco Industry

Notwithstanding the great decrease in the number of factories, there has been a proportionate increase in the actual amount of tobacco manufactured in Australia. In finding No. 16 the Commission give some rather interesting figuresThat this decrease was not due to any falling off in demand or production is shown by the fact that the local manufacture of all forms of tobaccoes increased from 6,601,015 lbs. in ryoi to 7,556,416 lbs. in 1903, and to 7,790,157 lbs. in 1904; and the number of employees increased from 2,662 in 1903 to 2,816 in 1904. F if t y per cent, of the leaf used in New South Wsiles in 1904 was worked in one factory; in Victoria nearly 80 per cent, of total leaf was worked in one factory: in Queensland 60 per cent., and in South Australia 80 per cent, was so worked, showing that the figures in the return as to the number of factories in existence are largely illusory, the great majority of them being small ciiiar manufacturers, and the output of their factories being insignificant when compared with the factories controlled by the combine. That is exactly what the Minister said, and what I willingly admit to be the truth; but the figures I have quoted only go to show how the Combine has practically totally eliminated the small manufacturer. the spirit of modern production. is a combine or not. It is the same with your co-operative dairying companies. tions, with huge combinations of labour on the one side, and capital on the other, you must, to a certain extent, eliminate the small man. The more labourers' wages are increased, and the more labour-saving devices are introduced, the more will this go on. It is only the man with money who is, in the first instance, able to establish 'manufactories. To show the enormous increase in the consumption of tobacco in Australia, the factories which in 1904 dealt with 7,790,157 lbs., dealt in 19n with no less a quantity than 12,115,000 lbs. That shows that the actual amount of material handled by the factories is very much larger to-day than it ever was before; and that the decrease in the number of factories is not in any way attributable to a decrease in the consumption of tobacco. I believe the consumption is increasing rapidly all the time, and that the proportion of smokers in the population is greater than it ever was before. I wish to draw attention to one or two findings of the Commission bearing out what I have already said with regard to the manner in which the shares of these companies are held. In finding No. 6, the Commission sayThe prospect of this competition had the effect of driving the principal Australian firms into closer combination, eventually culminating in an arrangement which embraces not only the chief Australian tobacco, cigar, and cigarette manufacturers, but is also connected with the British-American Tobacco Co. of the United Kingdom and America. Each of such manufacturing businesses holds a proprietary interest in every other such business, and also in the distributing firm of Kronheimer L t d . The Australian firms completed their combination in 1903, and the final arrangement was completed in February, 1904. They also stateWe find that the combine is a partial but not a complete monopoly. If they were sitting to-day, I think they would find that it was, to all intents and purposes, a complete monopoly in AustraliaIn plug tobaccoes (local and imported) expert witnesses gave the proportion of the combine's business compared to the total business from 75 per cent, to 99 per cent. I think it is pretty well 100 per cent, today in those particular lines. I do not think there is any plug tobacco sold in Australia to-day that does not pass through the hands of the Combine. very limited. how you would break down the Trust. ment have already, at the instance of their predecessors, taken action against the Coal Vend, action could be taken against the Tobacco Combine, and we could then have a certain amount of healthy competition in the trade. I do not object to combination up to a certain point. It is necessary to have a certain amount of it ; but we can avoid having one Combine operating all over Australia in an article that is used by a very large proportion of our population.

It can prove that the Tobacco Trust is a monopoly, injurious to the Australian people, and that it is necessary for the Government to put into operation against it the law as we have it to-day.

March, 1904, Mr Attorney-General Drake, having been asked by Senator Plavford to advise as to the power of the Commonwealth to establish the manufacture of tobacco, cigars, and cigarettes, adopted Mr Deakin's opinion-addin g that the only difference between the iron industry and the tobacco industry, so far as regards the principles there laid down, seemed to be that it was not easy to conceive how the manufacture of tobacco, cigars, and cigarettes could be incidental to the execution of any of the express legislative powers of the Commonwealth. With those opinions I entirely agree. Your questions cover a wider ground, as they include the business of importation as well as of manufacture. I am of opinion that the power to make laws with respect to trade and commerce with other countries does not extend to enabling the Commonwealth to monopolize, or even to carry on, the "" business of importers ""-and that there is no other provision of the Constitution which confers such a power. My categorical answer to your questions i» as follows :U) No. (2) There is no "" express or implied prohibition "" of such action; but neither the Executive nor the Parliament of the Commonwealth has any powers, apart from those which are expressly or by necessary implication, conferred upon them. The same opinion is held by the present Attorney-General. With what object, then, could the inquiry proposed by the honourable member for Richmond be made? He suggests that we shall do what was done in the case of the Coal Vend. Does he say that there is any more competition today in regard to the sale of coal than there was before the Vend decision of the High Court?

The only effective means for putting an end to a monopoly is to take it over and run it for the people. -desire the nationalization of industries, they will not recognise as having any weight proposals for the restraint of monopolies. but would the honourable member vote for the appointment of a Royal Commission merely to inquire into the operations of the Tobacco Trust? It would be interesting to know how this motion is supported, and whether a real genuine inquiry is intended. that the Trust has nothing to hide? other commercial institutions, it has a great -deal to hide from the people. We have Seen recently that one monopoly was not -desirous of putting its representatives into the witness box, and legislation has had to be passed to give Commissions greater powers for the obtaining of information regarding the operations of combines. The honourable member for Richmond says that there is much to be learnt since the operations of the Tobacco Trust were inquired into six years ago. That inquiry was made by a Select Committee which was converted into a Commission, and consisted of seven senators, four of them-Senators Pearce, Story, Findley, and Stewartmembers of the Labour party, and the remaining three-^x-Senators Gray and Styles and Senator Keating-member s of the Liberal party. The report was signed by the four Labour members, ex-Senator Styles having resigned from the Commission about the time the report was drawn up. A telegram was sent to Senator Keating on the 20th February, 1906, intimating that the report would be finally disposed of on the 23rd February, and on the 22nd his reply came that he could not be in Melbourne by the 23rd. Senator Gray furnished a minority report. When the inquiry was proposed in the Senate, every one of those who voted against it belonged to the party of which the honourable member for Richmond is a member, their names being ex-Senators Dobson, Mulcahy, and Playford, and Senator Millen, while ex-Senator Pulsford and Senators Gould and Walker paired with them. Speaking against the proposal Senator Millen saidI cannot conceive of anything more like shirking our responsibility, more degrading to the Senate, or more childish in itself,, than to appoint a Select Committee to inquire into some-' thing we have not the right to deal with by legislative enactment. . . . Does Senator Pearce expect the Senate to appoint a Select Committee to consider the advisability of doing something the unconstitutionality of which he is beginning to recognise? No matter how desirable it may be-if it were fifty thousand times more desirable than he contends it issurely that is no justification for us to attempt to do that which the Constitution expressly forbids. I ask honourable senators to refrain from appointing a Select Committee to inquire into a matter concerning which we have . no earthly business. Tb do so would be to proclaim to the Commonwealth that we know absolutely nothing of the provisions of the Constitutionwould invite ridicule, and justly so, from any student of constitutional history, and bring down on us the just condemnation of the press. of the inquiry the bringing about of the nationalization of the industry? proposed to the Senate. If the honourable member for Richmond suggested nationalization, he might get the support of some members on this side, though, unless the Constitution was amended, nothing would be gained. Royal Commissions cost more than Ministers to travel about the country. Senator Millen further saidI can only vote against him, holding, as 1 do, that apart from its utterly unconstitutional character, it is a very pernicious proposal indeed. It is-and that is probably one of the reasons why it is made-the first direct Socialistic proposal that we have had here. . . . I shall vote against the motion, not only for the particular objections I have to this specific proposal, but because, in my opinion, it is the first attempt to, by the introduction of State enterprise, utterly abolish that which has so far built up this community to what it is, and that is private enterprise. Ex-Senator Dobson saidI believe the first two paragraphs of the motion are not in order, because they are unconstitutional, and with respect to the last, I am astonished that any honourable senator who desires to uphold the dignity of this Chamber should for a moment propose to submit it to a division. . . . The motion now before the Senate can only end in a fiasco. It can only end in the spending of the people's money on an abortive inquiry.

270,Mr Tudor,"No, I do not say that.Sir JOHN QUICK (Bendigo) [5.48] The Minister of Trade and Customs has raised two objections to the granting of the proposed inquiry. First, that the Commonwealth has not the power to deal with the alleged Tobacco Trust and nationalize the industry; and, secondly, that the inquiry would be too expensive, and would prove abortive. the Minister has shown extraordinary solicitude on behalf of this alleged Tobacco Trust. considering that he is the representative of a party which has been indulging in denunciations and fulminations against trusts and combines in every shape ancl form throughOut the length and breadth of Australia, and also considering that the same Minister and party gave assistance in placing on the statute-book anti-trust and anti-monopoly legislation. I have no hesitation in saying that that legislation is stronger and more effective than any legislation of the kind in any part of the world, and _ that, therefore, the Minister is not justified in the attitude he has taken up on either economic or alleged unconstitutional grounds. There are many honourable members who will not agree that nationalization is the only remedy, and I challenge the accuracy of the statement. The legislation we have passed has already been tested as to its constitutionality in the High Court, and it empowers us to deal with trusts, combines, and other forms of commercial iniquity by prosecution and penalization. common form of attack known to British law and civilization up to the present time. fective in America. begun in Australia, and our law is more effective than that in America. If it is desired to exterminate trusts, including the alleged Tobacco Trust, why not initiate a prosecution in the same way as in the case of the Coal Vend and the Shipping Ring, which resulted in the conviction of the defendants, and the vindication of the law ? case. peal, we have to assume the constitutionality of the law. If there has been any defiance of the judgment of the High Court, there is a remedy in the shape of an application to the Court for an injunction to restrain the continuance of these, alleged combines and monopolies, or, if it is not desired to appeal again, another prosecution may be instituted. To show the effectiveness of the law ancl the necessity for enforcing it, I remind the Minister that offenders do not go scot free by merely paying a fine. The offence is a continuing one, and offenders may be prosecuted from day to day; they cannot plead that they have been convicted, and are not liable to another I cannot help remarking that prosecution and conviction. We ought to be able, under our present law, to stamp out the evils of combination in restraint of This we can hardly understand, trade by fines, confiscation, and sequestration, just as we stamp out by law the crime of thieving. The Minister might as well' argue that we cannot stamp out thieving because people continue to thieve after a conviction. We can punish and restrain thieving, even if we cannot completely exterminate it. out commercial thieving. law; and it has been proved that there are means of obtaining evidence and a conviction. Under our anti-trust legislation there is a right to go into the camp of the offenders and to examine accounts; they can be compelled to answer interrogatories, and so practically convict themselves out of their own mouths; and in the recent High Court case the Government succeeded in having imposed a heavy fine with costs, amounting altogether to ^20,000. It seems absurd for the Minister to say that these people can snap their That is_ the fingers at the Commonwealth and go on victimizing the public without any fear of the law.

The Minister has told us to-day that he believes that there is such a thing as a Tobacco Trust. Sir JOHN QUICK If the Minister believes that that Trust is in restraint of trade, and is to the detriment of the public interest, it is his duty to enforce the law.

Surely there is abundance of means and opportunity at the disposal of the Government to prove the existence of a trust, and to undertake a prosecution? It is merely a political excuse for the purpose of Bolstering up a claim for the amendment of the Constitution to suggest that nationalization is the only remedy. The fact' that the Minister has this evening quoted the excuses and defences put forward on behalf of the Tobacco Trust in the Senate by Senator Gray indicated that he is endeavouring to apologize on behalf of the Trust, or to shield it, and show that no strong case has been made out against it, in order to shunt the proposed inquiry. His attitude to-day shows that he and the Government, and the party he represents, are not sincere in their loud-mouthed, violent denunciations of this and other trusts. Is it true that recently a memher of the Labour party submitted to this House a motion in favour of an inquiry into the operations of the Tobacco Trust, and then abandoned it? planation of it? planation. his explanation? with the matter from the point of view of the present position. When the Government have the opportunity, with the Opposition quite prepared to support an inquiry, if. Ministers think there -is a case for inquiry, why not snap at the opportunity, and go in for a thorough exposure of the tactics ancl tricks of this or any other trust or combine that may be operating in Australia in restraint of trade, and detrimentally to the interests of the public? Now is the opportunity, and the fact that the Ministerial party are not ready, and willing, and anxious to go on with an inquiry such as the one indicated in the motion, shows that they are not sincere, and that this cry about trusts, combines, and monopolies is a mere piece of political clap-trap, indulged in. to mislead the people outside, and to sustain, if possible, a cry for an amendment of the Constitution for other and ulterior purposes. The Minister, having admitted that he believes there is a monopoly in plug tobacco and in machinemade cigarettes, ought to welcome an inquiry. If it is not to be an inquiry by a Select Committee, it ought to be by a Royal Commission, with all the increased powers given by the Bill now before another place! What is the justification for those enormously drastic and Draconian provisions of the Royal Commissions Bill that recently passed through this House? Is it not that we should be able to ferret out information and challenge and fight these trusts and combines ? Surely the operation of the Bill is not to be limited to any existing quarrel with a sugar company. Is it not to be utilized for investigating and attacking all the evils that come under the heading of trusts and combines? The attitude of the Ministry on this question shows that they are not sincere. They say that the Federal law on the statute-book is not effectual, although they have secured a conviction against the Coal Vend and Shipping Combine. So far as the Shipping Combine, for instance, is concerned, why do they not set the law in motion again? Why not begin another prosecution, and go on prosecuting those concerned until they are rooted out you hear his exof their stronghold ? The law which imposes a fine of £500 for every offence in the nature of a combine or monopoly, in the case of a private individual, and a fine of ,£1,000 a day in the case of a corporation, ought to be drastic enough for the most strenuous anti-trust advocate in this country. Why not go on with those prosecutions until you come to a dead-end ? No dead-end has been reached in this matter. The law has been completely sustained in a practical case before the High Court. The Government ought, therefore, to go on, and not to make use of this cry about trusts, combines, and monopolies as a mere stalking-horse to hide their ulterior objects. Minister, in resisting the desire of the honourable member for Richmond for an inquiry, said, mainly, two things. In the first' place, he said we already have the evidence, and, in the second, that it would be a waste of money, because we can do nothing when we have obtained the evidence proposed to be obtained by the inquiry. We have evidence which is a number of years old. I hold in my hand the report of the Royal Commission issued in 1906, with the evidence taken. That Commission was a "" packed "" Commission. The report was signed by four Labour members, strongly in favour'of the nationalization of the tobacco industry. This evidence, according to the Minister, is all that he",40,Tobacco Industry

Paragraph 7 of the report says that there is not a complete monopoly, and we are told later in the report that the reason given for raising the price of tobacco was the increase in the duties. Yet we are told by those who favour nationalization that the reduction of the duties would not affect prices ! VVe could, at least, try to reduce the cost of tobacco by reducing the duties, because certainly the tobacco manufacturing industry is not a struggling or languishing one; it is not necessary to tax the smokers to keep it on its tottering feet. that the prices of tobacco would be reduced if duties were reduced? dence of the tobacco trade; perhaps my honourable friend may know. opposite appear averse to attempting to mitigate an evil. It is idle to say that the proposed inquiry tobacco with other tobaccoes, the regie o would result in a waste of money. If to inquire into the tobacco industry is to waste money, why is it such a noble project to inquire into the sugar industry, and the pearl-shelling industry ? It is only when an investigation is proposed by a member of the Opposition into tobacco that it becomes unconstitutional and useless. I have shown from a cursory examination of the Commission's report that the evidence we now have is valueless; the Minister himself has said as much. We hear a great deal from honourable members opposite about the public taking control of manufacture and production; but, as a matter of strict fact, when there is nationalization, not the public, but the politicians, take control, and what the politician always wants, no matter what his party, is money for projects that will secure or increase his personal popularity. The more money a politician has at his disposal, the more projects he can finance, and the more popularity he and his party can obtain. The nationalization of industries is availed of to increase taxation without the consent of the people. That has happened wherever there is a national tobacco monopoly. In France the manufacture and distribution of tobacco were monopolized by the Government to obtain revenue, and, at first, the tobacco sold was of good quality; but as it was impossible for the Frenchman to compare the tobacco manufactured by the Government with any other, the politicians were able, by reducing its quality, to increase the revenue obtained from the monopoly. At the same time, such prohibitive rates were imposed against importation that the French people were unable to compare their tobacco with tobacco manufactured elsewhere. bacco in the world. has no proof of that. lived in France; and I say frankly that I would rather give up smoking than use French tobacco. of taste. where there is not a Government monopoly, I can obtain the tobacco I desire, but I Members cannot get it in France, or in other countries where there is a regie. If an opportunity were given to contrasf a Government would go by the board, and an insidious means of taxation would come to an end. ready to follow Japan, now ! They are ready to imitate the example of any country that uses these Tory means of extracting revenue from the people without the people knowing that they are being taxed. France commenced with tobacco equal to the world's standard quality, but succeeding Ministries, desiring more revenue, and finding it impossible to raise prices without the public knowing what they were doing, maintained prices and depreciated the quality; sd that now, in that Republic, and wherever there is a Government monopoly, you get the worse tobacco in the world. is like the debasing of coin. modity used generally by the public is de based for the benefit of the politician.

If there were only one baker, even a Government baker, would the public know that its bread was as good as it gets now through competition? When finally the community reaches the ultimate miserable stage of serfdom and slavery, in which everything will be nationalized, the consumer will not be able even to express his dissatisfaction with any commodity; he will not be able to write to the newspapers, because, they being nationalized, will publish only such views as suit the Government of the day. Even the itinerant stranger will not be able to make his opinion of the country known. One of the subjects into which inquiry should be made is whether the quality of the tobacco sold on this market is deteriorating. I am not a cigarette smoker; but I 'have been informed that the cigarettes manufactured by the Messrs. Wills, a partner in the Tobacco Trust, and marked "" Sydney,"" are not equal to those marked "" B r is to l , "" although put up in a similar tin. We might well ascertain whether, under the partial monopoly which exists, quality is suffering. The fact that the employees in the industry are being treated well is not a complete answer to the request for an investigation. There is a wider question. is being treated well? that j t would be unconstitutional, or a waste of public money, to inquire whether the public is being properly treated by one of the strongest industries that is supported by our Tariff. The members of the Labour party try to humbug the public by savage attacks on one or two successful industries, but make no attempt to deal comprehenMr Chinn was not apsively with trusts and combines. A trust may be beneficent. The bona fide consolidation of management leads to economy of production and distribution which may enable articles to be reduced in price. T h a t is grossly incorrect, pointed that out. there may be combinations of independent companies to keep up prices, and tliese Every one would admit that it are contrary to the public interest. It seems to me that the question of combines is one that ought to be watched far more closely in reality than the question of trusts. In the case of trusts there is no pretence that any competition exists; in the matter of combines there is such a pretence. Walk down town to-day, and you will see a hundred different signs on a hundred different fire insurance offices, each claiming lhat that particular fire insurance company gives the lowest rates, although, as a matter of fact, all charge the same rates. MrK ELLY -They have an arrangement; but each pretends to be in competition with the other. There are many such combines; and these .are tilings that might very well be the subject of inquiry, since there is a pretence of competition when competition does not exist. That, to»my mind, approaches commercial dishonesty. amongst the fire insurance companies in everything save the rates. All have a fixed rate. extent that every company employs as many agents as it can afford to employ, but the cost of those agents is added to the cost of the policies. to the tariff. tariff of fire insurance companies in Australia is from 80 to 100 per cent, higher than is the rate for similar risks in England.

325,Mr Kingo ' Malley Laid Iipon The,"Minister) [7.46] I move That this Bill be now read -a second time. It falls again to the lot of the present Minage of our boys are enjoying their holiistry to ask the approval of this House to a further amendment of the Defence Act 1903-11, and on this occasion we are asking once more that one or two of its more rigid features may be amended with a view to greater elasticity, and, we hope, greater effectiveness. Necessarily in the administration of an Act of such magnitude, the operations of which extend over the whole Commonwealth, and closely touch practically every human being in it, there would be found some features of a more or less harsh character, as well as some omissions, and it would be discovered that some amendments are necessary to provide for its smooth to break down their high spirits by harshworking. In all probability it will be found every year that some slight amendment is necessary. In this instance we are asking that the principal Act should be amended so that we may embrace within it what is known as the veterinary corpsa corps practically unknown when the oiiginal Act was passed. Then, again, the question of aviation has to be considered, and provision made for its inclusion in the Forces. We find also that the Act, so far as its jurisdiction is concerned, does not cover in some minor respects the territories owned by the Commonwealth-such , for instance, as Papua. A slight amendment is therefore proposed, so that it may be applied if necessary to that Territory. ing to bring the people of Papua under the compulsory training provisions of the Act? not operate at present in such territories. There are one or two minor features of this Bill which, I believe, will meet with the approval of honourable members. Leaving them for the moment I may mention that it is proposed to prevent the sale of intoxicating liquors to cadets in uniform. That, I believe, will meet with the approval of honourable members, no matter what may be their views respecting the liquor traffic. I think all will agree that it is essential that our youths should be protected, at any rate, while they are weareighteen years, all our Senior Cadets pass, ing the uniform of the Commonwealth, and that any indiscretions on their part shall not be painfully apparent while ^they are in that uniform. The Act requires registration of our boys for Senior Cadet purposes in January of' each year in which they reach the age of fourteen. That is found to be almost impracticable, inasmuch as during that month a very heavy percentdays, or, at all events, are away from school, and we have to rely on the information circulated in the schools to aid us in securing the full registration of all the lads in the Commonwealth. It is, therefore, proposed, under this Bill, that the month of February shall be added, so that, during those two months, boys may register to fulfil the obligations they are called upon to carry out under the Act. Some of our lads are somewhat recalcitrant, and that, perhaps, is only to be expected, having regard to the high spirits of the boys of Australia. I , for one, would not seek ness of an unnecessary character; but some of them will need at'times, perhaps, to be reprimanded. It is felt that when this high spiritedness too commonly displays itself in the case of lads under the age of sixteen years they should not be taken unnecessarily to the ordinary Police Courts. We, therefore, provide under this Bill that any youth under sixteen years of age, whose conduct is such as to necessitate action being taken against him shall be brought before what is known as a Children's Court in every State in which such institutions have been set up and there dealt with, I hope, to his benefit, and to the general welfare of the community. We propose, in addition, to ask that the hours during which our Junior Cadets are required to engage in physical exercises, and .to learn the elementary rudiments of drill, shall be reduced from 120 hours to 90 hours per annum. At the present time Junior Cadets of from twelve to fourteen years of age have to engage in light exercises at their different schools, or elsewhere, to the extent of 120 hours per annum, but after consultation with a conference of educational expertsit is confidently believed that 90 hours per annum will be sufficient. Honourable members will, therefore, be asketl to agree to an amendment of the principal Act in that respect. There is another feature of this Bill to which I desire to call attention. It is found that since, on reaching the age of from the cadet corps to the Citizen Forces, the cadet corps are automatically depleted of their officers. Many youths,",44,Audit Bill

They become efficient and useful officers, and help materially in imparting to the cadets the education so essential to them. Yet on reaching the age of eighteen years they are required, as the Act now stands, to pass into the Citizen Forces so that their value as officers is consequently lost to the cadet corps. We ask the House to agree to a provision that will permit those who become officers of cadet corps to remain in those corps, notwithstanding that they had reached the age of eighteen years, and which declares that the time they spend as officers in the cadet corps, after they have reached the age of eighteen years, shall count, if they so desire, in lieu called upon to perform, and I regret much of the time they would have to spend in the Citizen Forces. that provision leading, so to speak, to overthat they have requested that the whole crowding ? position of officer is by competitive examinaarrears in the drills. tion. greater number than is absolutely necessary? there may be more aspirants for positions as officers than are required; but promotion is the result of competitive examination, and if the applicants are too numerous it seems to be fair in such circumstances to take those most proficient, so that the standard will necessarily be higher.

As the Act now stands we find it practically impossible to properly officer the cadet corps, because, just as cadets become reasonably useful, they reach the age of eighteen years and pass on to the Citizen Forces. There are two other features of an important 'character to which I ask special attention. The first concerns boys who have not completed the necessary number of drills, and the punishment to be inflicted when the cases are called before the Courts. As the Act now stands, £ 5 is the minimum penalty on all offending cadets; and I am sorry, indeed, that this provision was not more carefully looked over when the Bill was before us, because, as it stands, the magistrates have no option. carefully looked over? branches of the Legislature are to blame for not having foreseen what practice has proved to be too severe a provision. was ""gagged"" through all its stages? just now to touch that feature of the case.

Then there is the question of imprisonment; and it is proposed that this punishment shall be eliminated from the Act so far as our cadets are concerned in connection with absence from drill. The punishment will be to commit them to the care of what is termed a "" prescribed officer,"" which is, in fact, to commit them to tlie care of the Area Officer, or the non-commissioned officer of the area, who will do his best, in the circumstances, to put the lad through the necessary number of drills. We do not desire that our lads, because they happen to be deficient in drills, shall be made criminals in any sense of the word, or that they should see the inside of the gaol.

It is not perfect, but we hope to continue endeavouring to reach the happy goal of perfection. Our hearths and homes, our free institutions, our race, and, above and beyond all, the glorious womanhood of Australia, are worth defending. And so I say to those lads that there is a slight obligation they are called upon to perform; and I sincerely hope they will perform it cheerfully. It may be said that if necessity arose to-morrow, or in twelve months, or in twelve years' time, practically 99 per cent, of the manhood of Australia would cheerfully offer . themselves in the defence of the country, irrespective of political or social opinions. To those who are taking slight objection to the Act, I say that it were better, should necesturned out subsequently, I believe, that the sity arise, to have an organized defence rather than an enthusiastic rabble, even for the protection of their own lives. But there is another excellent feature of our defence system. I am confident that the physique of our youths will be materially improved, to the national welfare, by the slight drills that are imposed. I submit the Bill for the consideration of honourable members; and, in view of its urgency, I ask them to permit it to pass through all its stages this evening. I think I voice the unanimous views of the Opposition when I say that we welcome this; or any other, Bill calculated to improve and smooth the operation of the principal Act -All parties in this House, I beclauses, and also in the clauses relating tolieve, regard the Act from a sympathetic stand-point, and desire to assist in making it as workable and as acceptable to the people of the country as possible. There can be no doubt that it introduced a very novel and radical change in the principle of defence, as compared with previous State and Federal laws; and, under the circumstances, it is not a matter of surprise that some slight discontent and restiveness has been manifested among certain people, to whom the change may have come with something like a shock. But I thir.l: that, Australia and its possibilities as public men, we are bound to recognise the impossibility of introducing such a revolutionary reform without encountering some kind of difficulty and preliminary objection. It introduces what is, to some extent, ai burden which many of those affected regard as serious; but I believe that time and experience will reconcile the public conscience to the change, and that, ultimately, this fundamental military law"" of the countrywill be regarded as one of the bulwarks of with such labour and self sacrifice in the past. When this Act came into operation, no doubt some people were surprised andi dismayed at the manner in which it was administered in some of the Courts of Australia. I myself was somewhat astounded at the decision of one Court, I think, at Broken Hill, where a man wasfined £100 for refusing to allow his son to participate in the military drill. However serious the conditions may have been, as this was the first prosecution at the time,, one would have thought that the magistrate, if he had any discretion, would have taken the fact into consideration, and not imposed the full penalty of the law. It magistrate thought he had no discretion ii* the determination of the fine, and on an appeal to the Full Court of New South. Wales, it was found that he had a discretion which the Court exercised on his behalf. I am sure the strongest advocate of compulsory naval and military training would not desire to see this most important reform introduced with anything like drastic punishment, that might cause a revulsion of feeling against a system which we desire to see perfected and made acceptable to the whole people. Consequently, I , and, 1 believe, most honourable members, will be disposed to welcome any Act of interpretation or mitigating Act, or any Act which, tends to give greater elasticity in the penal compulsory service. At the same time, I should like to utter a note of warning. Whilst we desire to reduce and remove complaints, and not to make the service so burdensome or onerous as to incite feelings, of resistance, it would be a very grave blunder to go on reducing the term of service by one amendment after another until we have frittered away the compulsoryprinciple of the Act, and the efficiency of the service itself. One of the first amendments grafted on to the principal Act was Act No. 37 of IQIO, section 15, which first",47,Defence Bill Second Reading

361,Sir John Quick (Bendigo) [8.9],"artade provision for a substituted service as an alternative to the service defined in .paragraphs a, b, and c, of section 127 of the principal Act. By paragraph a, it was provided that for Junior Cadets the service should total 120 hours; and by paragraph b, that Senior Cadets should put in 4 whole-day drills, 12 half-day drills, and 24 night drills. The first cut into that definition of service was made by the Act of 1910, introduced, I believe, by this Government, which substituted a limited term of not less than seventy-two hours for the balf-day and night drills. One of its provisions wasProvided also that in the Senior Cadets the number and duration of half-day and night -drills may be varied by the substitution of other drills as 'prescribed of a total duration of not less than 72 hours. That was, so to speak, the first mitigation. Then we find, by the Act of last year, that the seventy-two hours substituted service was reduced to sixty-four hours; and now, in the amending Bill before the House, the sixty-four hours term is reduced -to forty-eight hours. to particular drills; it does not include the -dav drills. four whole-day drills; so that the main -drilling takes place in the half-day and night drills. The Bill cuts the sixty-four hours down to forty-eight hours. The words "" sixty-four "" were put in last vear through an error in arithmetic. -dence, on the face of the Bill, that it was an error in arithmetic. last year from seventy-two hours to sixty-four hours. If this Bill is passed, it will still be sixty-four hours; but forty-eight of those have to be put in in half-day or evening drills. oppose any provision in the Bill. I merely wish to call attention to what appears to be a downward grade of service, and utter a word of warning .in which, I am sure, all true friends of the important principle of the Act will join. Whilst we desire to meet public clamour, and prevent it acquiring unnecessary force or volume, and check the growth of public alarm, we must be loyal to the fundamental principle of the Act. That principle is a certain amount of compulsory service, which, although limited, must be effective and efficient. It would be a fatal blunder if we frittered away the period to a mere form or shadow. I understand that the Bill is intended to allay any discontent for the time being, and also to reduce the penalty, which in the original Act was undoubtedly too severe. It seems a pity that it was allowed to pass in that rigid form, and certainly it was a great pity that the magistrates had not greater latitude and more discretion in administering an Act of this kind, which brought before them a large number of the youth of Australia with whose liberty to enjoy themselves as they thought fit in their years of youth, the compulsory training principle no doubt interfered. Nevertheless, I hope the Ministry will maintain a fairly firm and reasonable attitude on this subject, and here I should like a pay a tribute to the manly courage of the present Minister of Defence in the reply which he gave yesterday to a deputation that waited upon him in Melbourne to make serious complaints about the burdens imposed upon the youth of Australia by the compulsory provisions. One of the speakers said that he "" did not see what the lads had to defend beyond the property and machinery of the employers, who used it for their own advantage."" I should like to quote with approbation a passage from the reply of the Minister of Defence. He is reported to have said thatHe would like in all friendliness to say that the statement that the boys had nothing to defend was made without due consideration. They all agreed with the white Australia policy, and it was necessary to have a strong defence system to uphold it. So far the British Navy had supplied this necessity. He would characterize the statement as rather rash, for the social and political position of Australia, imperfect as it was, was yet far in advance of other countries. The Minister deserves credit for the firm attitude he took up. I am sure he knows that he has the support and sympathy of all sides of the House in endeavouring to maintain the integrity of the Act, while reducing its rigidity, making it a little more elastic, and providing for special cases of hardship. I should like the magistrates to be intrusted with even a little more discretion than may be found within the four corners of the Act. The magistrates say that they have to deal with an Act as they find it, and not read into it Ministerial instructions or Ministerial views. They might regard it as an intrusion upon the exercise of their judicial functions for any prosecuting officer to indicate a sort of scale",48,Defence Bill Second Reading

367,Sir John Quick,"I am not going toof punishment which, in the opinion of the Minister, ought to be inflicted. The more discretion is allowed to magistrates in dealing with boys for these offences, the better it will be in their interests, in the interests of the service, and for the efficiency of the Act. I am sure that the magistrates of Australia who are intrusted with this Federal jurisdiction are of such great experience and sound judgment, and so kindly disposed and sympathetic to the rising youth, that they would not inflict any severe fine except in special cases. I think they ought to be encouraged to inquire into the merits of every case brought before them, to see whether there are any special excuses for boys not putting in their term of service. For instance, I was interviewed by a constituent a day or two ago with reference to his son, who, he said, was engaged in the daytime carting quartz, and complained that at the end of his day's work he felt too tired and worn out to put in his period of compulsory training. Of course, if an excuse of that kind were allowed in every case, it would soon undermine, and even demolish the Act, but special cases might arise where through ill-health, combined with work, young men might be unable to comply with the rigid requirements of the law. In such cases, I think the magistrates would be justified not only in exercising their common sense, but in giving play to their feelings of humanity. Such offenders might be given an opportunity to comply with the law before being punished in any way. of judgment and kindliness the magistrates may largely assist the administration of the Act, and prevent its becoming unpopular. Boys who do not attend drill should be regarded as guilty, not of a semicriminal offence, but of military insubordination. These amending provisions, and the protection of the cadets from being offered intoxicating liquors when in uniform, will be very salutary. ber believe in Saturday afternoon drills? on which I shall not enter. We are concerned now only with the number of hours for which the boys shall be drilled; the times at which drill shall take place is not under consideration. the measure with feelings of mingled regret and pleasure; regret that there is need for a defence law, and pleasure that an attempt is being made to rise to the situation. I view with a cautious eye the steps taken to establish a defence system, and look askance and with fear and trembling at the enormous expense which is imposed on the country. Indeed, I sometimes fear that we may have run mad on the subject. I hope that we shall not be led too far by our fear of invasion, or of attacks on the Empire. Of course, we must stand shoulder to shoulder for the Empire's defence. We cannot concede a jot or tittle of what we have won, but I sincerely deplore the imposition of so large an expenditure for defence upon this young Australian people. Having gone carefully through the. Bill, I agree with its provisions in the main, though I am in distinct opposition to the proposals of the Administration in regard to the imposition of pains and penalties on trainees. Something like 40,000 boys have failed to perform their military duties. The Bill is an acknowledgment that our methods have been faulty, and penaltieswhich should have fallen on the boys havefallen on the parents. Often when a boy is sent to drill he fails to go, and later his father is served with a summons. When the boy is fined by the magistrate, he has not the money to pay, and the father pays. When I mentioned these facts as having occurred in my own constituency, I was greeted with jeers from the other side. By the exercise think so; there is as much humanity on this side as on that.' greeted with jeers, and I am glad that honourable members opposite now recognise the need for an alteration of the law. From my stand-point the amendment is not vvhat is needed. It is proposed to bring boys who fail to attend the necessary drills before the Courts, to fine them, and, in addition, to make them do the drills which they have missed. If you can compel the boys to make up the drills that they have missed, you should not also fine them. You should not impose a fine, and, at the same time, require the boy to make up the necessary number of drills. give his personal undertaking to complete his drills, no fine will be imposed. fails to do so? with.",49,Defence Bill Second Reading

It is a quid pro quo for the failure to attend drill, and if the boy is required to make up the number of drills, there is no occasion for it. I hope that honourable members will support this view. Our object is not to impose pains and penalties, but to make our lads do their service to their country. When the boys see that Parliament is determined that the laws shall be administered strictly, they will rise to the situation, and the experience of the last few months will not be repeated.

The honourable member for Bendigo said just now most truly that he voiced the opinions of the Opposition without exception. Those opinions do not tally with the remarks of the honourable member for Dalley. To taunt honourable members on this side with lack of humanity, fair play, and decency is too frequent an offence of honourable members opposite, and it is time that we protested against its constant repetition. The Opposition have no desire to inflict harsh penalties on cadets. We know that the fines are paid, not by the boys, but by their parents. the Commonwealth have paid fines. Mr VV.

The honourable member is one of [15 AUGUST, 1912.] Bill. 2255 the most kindly-disposed persons in the House, but statements such as his, when circulated in cold print, create a false impression among our constituents. Those who do not intend their remarks to be taken seriously should not, even jocularly, reflect on their fellow members. We, on this side, have as much humanity as honourable members opposite. The desire to make the defence system as perfect as possible is general, and is not affected by thedifferences of opinion on political questions which divide political parties. Knowing the feelings of most members ot the Opposition, I say that they will hail with satisfaction any measure which, while securing the training necessary to make oui boys conversant with military duties, will prevent harshness in the administration of the defence system. The object of this Bill is really to meet a difficulty that has arisen, and, so far as it meets that difficulty, I think that the Minister may count upon the support of all sides of the House. I agree, however, with the honourable member for Dalley that we might very well dispense with the imposition of monetary penalties. I think they are quite unnecessary, for the reason that they fall, not upon the boys, but upon the parents, who, in many cases, find it difficult to make ends meet. I congratulate the Government on the introduction of this measure. I certainly think that it has not been introduced a moment too soon; but I do not blame them for having failed to bring it in before, since, in this Parliament, as in all others, there are some measures of special urgency to which preference must be given. The duty of the Minister administering the principal Act has been a most difficult one, The boys are not inasmuch as it has brought about almost a revolution in the feelings of the people, so far as compulsory military service is concerned. I believe that the majority of the people are in favour of the system, since the tiaining for which it provides has a tendency to improve the physique of our lads, and also because they recognise that it is absolutely necessary to provide for the defence of Australia. The Government are somewhat to blame, however, for their failure to realize the serious inroads that were made upon the habits and customs of the people by the introduction of this system, and I am afraid that the officers charged with the administration of the Act have not displayed, in",50,Defence Bill Second Reading

Their failure in that regard has led to a certain degree of blame falling on the shoulders of the Government, and particularly upon that heavily-worked Minister, Senator Pearce. some of the States. stance, comes chiefly from New South Wales. my own State, there has been much open grumbling on the part of the people, and every honourable member is aware that a feeling of irritation in connection with the operation of the system has been aroused throughout Australia. That such a. feeling should exist is not at all surprismay meet with an eccentric magistrate who ing. Public men of experience know that, on the passing of an Act that interferes with the customs of the people, an outcry is usually raised. variably made of the passing of such a measure until the people become accustomed to its operation, and then they wonder why they ever cried out against it. That has been the case in connection with the passing of our early closing Acts and other measures interfering with the customs of the people, and this is a fact which all Governments should bear in mind. There is something in the contention of the honourable member for Bendigo that there has been a tendency to whittle away, by means of amending Bills, the number of hours during which the members of the Forces are to engage in drill. I should not like to see any unreasonable reduction made, but I do not think that the reduction now proposed will prove to be an unmixed evil. I repeat that we have to remember that we are making an inroad on the habits and customs of the people, and are calling upon lads to drill at a time when they would prefer to engage in sport. In the circumstances, therefore, I do not think any harm is likely to arise from a reduction of the hours, provided that the number of hours is not so reduced as to endanger the proper training of the lads. Ten years hence there will be no difficulty in increasing the hours of training, whereas to-day a reduction will have the effect of making the system more popular than it is with the lads. As to the proposal to give magistrates a discretionary power to deal with cases arising under the Act, I think that there is a great deal of force in the argument advanced by the Defence [REPRESENTATIVES.] Bill. honourable member for Dalley. I see no occasion for having any appeal to magistrates. I appeal to the Minister in charge of the Bill, ancl the Attorney-General, to frame an amendment providing that every lad shall serve so many hours' drill per quarter. If during the first quarter a lad failed to put in the requisite number of hours I should not be hard on him; but if during the second quarter he sought to escape his duty in this regard the authorities should have power to arrest him, and make him do the requisite number of hours' drill right away. An amendment of the principal Act to that effect would render it quite unnecessary to bring the boys before a magistrate. I agree that most magistrates exercise wisely the discretionary powers vested in them, but here and there we makes remarks that provide "" good copy "" for our friends of the press, and whose statements, circulated all over Australia, Complaint is inhave a tendency, perhaps, to bring the system into disrepute. There would be no harm in dealing leniently with lads who, because of overtime or sickness, were unable to put in the required time at drill during any one quarter; but, speaking generally, a lad should not be allowed to escape his drill. I think it wrong, however, to make the parents pay the penalty for the neglect of the lads. Another point which I should like to make is that if during the next five or six years we were to spend considerably more than we are doing upon our area officerr and less upon other military requirements, it would be better for the country. What is the use of spending a tremendous lot of money on armaments, and so forth, unless at the same time we make this system popular with the people, and get hold of the lads whom we desire to drill ? I should not object to a heavier expenditure than is at present incurred in connection with the training of our lads. Care should be taken by commanding officers to select as area oflicers men who are not only well qualified to impart drill instruction, but who have plenty of tact. We do not want men of the "" drumhead-court martial order "" moving amongst our boys. We hear a great deal about the maintenance of discipline, and discipline certainly must be maintained amongst the lads, but, at the same time, tnere must also be discipline amongst the officers.

We were told only this afternoon of an order that had been issued by the State Commandant in New South Wales being utterly disregarded by an officer who should have carried it out. Such a man ought to be cashiered. We have no use for men of his kind in the Defence Forces of Australia. It cannot be denied that military officers generally work together, but they must understand that the Minister, although he is not a military man, is the responsible head of the Military Forces. friction that has occurred may be brought down to the irreducible minimum, we must have more tact on the part of officers than has hitherto been displayed. 1 do not blame the Minister. I recognise that he has had a very difficult task to perform. We all know that military men generallywork together in cliques, and that if you scratch one you scratch the lot of them. This fact makes it all the more essential that Parliament, while recognising that it ought not to interfere with military details, One of these . amendments, however, alshould insist upon the Act being administered with more tact than has hitherto been shown in connection with it. I congratulate the Government upon introducing this Bill, and on the fact that they have done nearly all that is possible to remove the causes of the existing friction but I cannot see why parents should be penalized as they have been, and why we should direct that lads who fail to put in the requisite number of hours at drill shall be brought before a magistrate. A lad who can give a reasonable excuse for failure to attend drill should receive fair consideration; but we should never forget that an Act of Parliament must not be deliberately defied by any one in the community. There must be no misunderstanding in that respect; but errors committed because of ignorance should be dealt with judiciously. We are bringing into operation a military system that will be of tremendous advantage to Australia and of great benefit to the people of tlie community, and it ought to be brought in with the least possible degree of friction and harshness. me' that if instead of bringing a lad before a magistrate because he had failed to attend drill we were to provide that he should be practically arrested and required to do his drill straight away, no further trouble would arise. Four or five hours' continuous drill might Vfe more 13enefit5al [S3] to a lad, and would certainly make a greater impression on his mind, than would one or two hours' drill a night. The penalty would then fall on the right shoulders, and the practice would not prove a bad one. Australian lads will compare, for high spirits and other qualities, with any lads in the world; but it is just as well to let them know that they must undergo a certain amount of restraint and discipline, not only for the benefit of the country, but in order to build up their own character. With all our talk of education, I regard character-building as most important; and the discipline that these In order that the lads are called upon to bear will leave beneficial effects throughout their manhood, and eventually result in a better type of Australian. The Government are, I believe, making an honest endeavour to render this Act more workable, and thus remove some of the pinpricks whicli are causing dissatisfaction. So far as I can see there is nothing to object to in the proposed amendments. though merely the substitution of one word for another, may be more significant than at first -appears. It is the amendment in clause 2 to omit from sub-section 2 of section 31, after the word ""ordnance"" the word "" staffs,"" and insert in its stead the word ""corps."" I take it that this will mean that, not only the officers, but all the non-commissioned officers'and men of the Army Service, Medical, Veterinary, and Ordnance Corps will become permanent, whereas, at present, only the staff is permanent. may be classed as corps without being made permanent. permanent ? be made permanent. quite approve, because I think they will be of better service as permanent men. 1 do not cavil at the reduction of the hours It seems to for drill, so long as the Government are sure that the lads can, in some way, be forced to fulfil their obligations.

We have military law in all our camps, and an offender may be arrested at the direction of the commanding officer, or officer in charge, and detained in the guard tent. He is subsequently brought before the commanding officer, who, if he chooses, may confine him to barracks for so many days, while for more serious offences various penalties are provided.

I am very glad to see the wise precaution taken to make it an offence to supply intoxicants to cadets; but I must say that I consider it an insult to the men to declare that there shall be no canteen in camp. When I asked a question on this subject a little while ago I was told that the provision had been agreed to by this House without a division, and that' fhe Government did not feel called upon to say anything more about it. AllI can see of any provision being passed is an amendment agreed to on the motion of Mr Coon, then member for Batman, to the effect that no intoxicating or spirituous liquors should be permitted in camp. That, truly, was carried without a division; but I see no mention of it in the Senate reports; and I should like to know how it is that ever since then there have been canteens in camp? into force by proclamation, and it is possible the camps were held between the passing of the measure and the issue of the proclamation. to this year, and I have never been in one in my life without a canteen. My opinion is that this provision or regulation is responsible for some of the dissatisfaction in the ranks of the Australian Garrison Artillery, who have been given to understand that they can have no canteen in camp. My experience is that men take no undue advantage of the camp canteen, and, in several large gatherings of the kind, I have never seen a solitary instance of drunkenness, particularly in the case of the Light Horse which came more particularly under my notice. When a man has been out before daylight, working hard in the heat and the dust all day, and he comes back at night, tired out and dry, it is a great hardship if he cannot have a glass of beer. Why should not the military be allowed to obtain a glass of beer if the general public are allowed to do so?

409,Mr Ryrie,"I am extremely gratifiedonly is Australia worth defending, but our liberties and our free institutions are worth given away by these amendments, but I defending, and surely our wives and families are. It is disgraceful that any one should voice such sentiments as we have seen attributed recently to certain individuals. A man should be ashamed to say that there was nothing here to defend but the property of rich men. I hope and trust that the compulsory scheme will be a success. I have done my best to make it so, regardless of the fact that it is being administered by my political opponents. The matter is of too much importance to allow any petty party feelings to intervene. I have done, and will do, everything in my power to make the scheme a success for the sake of Australia. I have from many platforms throughout this country exhorted the lads cheerfully to undertake the duties which will devolve upon them under the compulsory scheme, and parents to put up with any little inconvenihis training, and I do not think there will ence to which they might be subjected. It is absolutely essential for the welfare of Australia that the scheme should succeed. Like honourable members opposite who have spoken, I regret that it is necesset down, the boys are notified to attend, sary to spend an enormous amount upon defence; but it is essential that we should do so. We must make preparationsI do not say against the inevitable-bu t to meet what may happen in the future. It is an old saying that the greatest factor in mainfor this state of affairs would be found if taining peace is preparedness for war. The nation that is prepared to defend itself is not likely to beattacked. It is necessary that we should spend the money, and do all we possibly can to get the boys to do their training, not simply because they have to do it, but, if possible, in a spirit of patriotism. If we can get our' lads imbued with that feeling, it will augur well for fhe success of this great scheme. It is a pity we Have to use harsh measures to force some of them to do their duty to their country; but that cannot be helped. They will have to be forced in some way. Although there are amendments in this Bill limiting the hours and lessening some of the harsher penalties contained in the original Act, I trust that it is not the beginning of a system of giving way to these lads, who will, perhaps, use every endeavour to escape doing their training. I hope the Government and the Department will not be weak-kneed in the business, and give way again and again, until they find it almost impossible to get the training done at all. They will have to be firm. I do not cavil at what is being hope it will not be followed up by more concessions. A great deal of the success of the scheme depends on the Area Officers themselves. I have watched closely the different methods employed by different Area Officers, and noted the different results obtained. One Area Officer that I know well takes a great interest in his work, and succeeds in interesting the lads in theirs. He can get a full parade at almost any time. In fact, the boys would do more drills than they are really called upon to do for him. He provides recreation and amusement for them. He has boxing and fencing contests for them and clubs and dumb-bells, and entertains them, and is most popular in his area. It is no trouble for him to go round and get a £5-note from the people in the area at any time to provide entertainment for the lads. Every boy in that area does be any need to. prosecute any of them. Other Area Oflicers may not employ the same methods, and the consequence is that they do not get the work'done. The drills are and if they are not there, their absence is noted, but no effort is made to interest them or provide recreation for them. The difference between the one system and the other is very marked, indeed. A remedy the Area Officers were given sufficient remuneration to enable us to select the very best men. We cannot expect for £ 3 a week men of the type I have just instanced. A man, smart and intelligent, who knows his job, and will devote the whole of his time to the training of the boys in the area, cannot be got for that sum. that £5,000,000 defence vote? against it. pense with a number of these Area Officers soon, and replace them with partly-trained officers ? to replace them with partly-trained officers. It requires a highly-trained officer to be a successful Area Oflicer. The training of the boys depends absolutely on the class of men we have in those positions. Some redistribution of the areas themselves is necessary, because the duties devolving upon the officers differ materially in the different",54,Defence Bill Second Reading

413,Mr Ryrie,"It will be a great mistakeareas. There are some omcers in metropolitan districts who have only about three companies in their area, and have, perhaps, only one place to drill in. It is no hardship for an officer, in those circumstances, to do his work and attend to his own business, but there are other areas where the officer is supposed to visit every centre twice a month, and to do that he has to be travelling the whole of his time, and has not a minute to devote to his private business. Some distinction should be made in the pay or the boundaries of the areas should be altered to equalize the work. I know several Area Officers living in the country who have great difficulty in getting through the whole of their work. The Area Officer at Goulburn, for instance, a very keen military man, who was my adjutant' in the 3rd Australian Light Horse for some years, and is still nominally adjutant of the regiment, does absolutely nothing but his area work, and works very hard at it. He is continually travelling, and is distinctly worth more than £150 a year. The sergeant-majors engaged in these areas are not paid sufficient. I am not afraid of increasing the military vote. It is essential that we should have the best material. If we are going to do the thing at all, we must do it properly, and, Jn the circumstances, these men do not receive sufficient remuneration. The staff-sergeant major has a lot of responsibility, and in many of the areas it is he who does the great bulk of the work, although it should not be so. This is partly because some of the Area Officers are inexperienced men, who do not know their work, the whole of which devolves upon the instructional' sergeant major. If he has to do the whole of the work, he should get more pay. If we get the best men as Area Officers, and give them sufficient remuneration, we can insist on their doing the work. The regulations for universal training set out the duties of an Area Officer as follows: 1. Supervision and direction of the registradoubtedly the Light Horse is an aim of the tion, organization, and training of the Senior Cadets. That is a pretty big thing2. Inspection of Junior Cadet training in the schools. That is lost sight of by many,, who forget that the area officers have to visit all the schools, and oversee the training of the Junior Cadets. 3. Administration of troops (all arms) provided by his area, including equipment, clothing, pav and transfers. Mr Ryrie. Any one who has had anything to do with military matters knows how much clerical work is attached to these duties. This clerical work alone would occupy the greater part of a man's time, because there are so many books to keep, and returns to make. There is a good deal of red tape in the Defence Department4. Supervision of training of all recruits within his area. 5. Duty in any military appointment (e.g., adjutant), and attendance at the training of the unit in which such appointment is made. Any one knowing anything about military matters is aware that an adjutant would have enough to do without the work of an area officer. The adjutant of a regiment is a very hard worked man. positions. 6. Supervision of general registration and charge of records of all persons registered within his area. 7. Organization of reserve units. 8. Attendance at a school of instruction for not more than fourteen days in each year after first appointment. In spite of the magnitude of the sum which is being expended on defence, it would be advisable to give the Area Officers and the staff sergeant-majors an increase of pay. I understand that it has been determined that the adjutants of Light Horse regiments are to be lieutenants and militiamen. If that is so, the efficiency of those regiments will be lost. is, I think, confusing a proposal to give certain warrant officers commissioned rank, and to allow them subsequently to become adjutants. I have been told by a brigadier. I understand, too, that the pay of the Light Horsemen is to be reduced from 8s. to 4s. a day,and that they are to have no allowance for their horses. That is a vital mistake. Unservice that we shall greatly need, and we are making a mistake in forgetting it,°and doing everything for the Infantry. If there were trouble, the war would be conducted in a manner similar to the South African war, in which a mobile force was needed, and there cannot be such a force without a large proportion of Light Horsemen or Mounted Infantry. At present, no encouragement is being given to the mounted men. At a recent camp at the Victoria Barracks for area officers and",55,Defence Bill Second Reading

417,Mr Ryrie,"I am speaking on whatstaff, a certain amount of light horse training was supposed to be given, but everything had to be done on foot. Although we have spent large sums in purchasing country for horses, and there were 300 or 400 horses within a few miles of the camp, all the work was done on foot. I think that the Government has made a great mistake in abolishing the distinctive uniforms of the various regiments, and I shall hold that view even though the change may have been made on the recommendation of Lord Kitchener. member anticipating a motion on the notice paper ? Mi. RYRIE I am not. referring to the abolition of the kilts. I was very proud of the uniform of the 3rd Light Horse, to which 1 belongeda green uniform, with a black plume, and gold facings. ber is now going beyond the scope of this Bill. that I have no serious objection to make to the proposed amendments. I hope that the concessions which are being made in the shortening of hours and the lessening of penalties will not be regarded as evidence of weakness. If it were so regarded, it would make the training of cadets all the more difficult in the future. Compulsory military training is in its infancy, and must be popularized if it is to continue, because its existence depends entirely on the good-will of the parents and youths of Australia. Unless our legislation meets with their approval, it will soon be repealed. The Government, realizing this, has determined to amend many of the penal provisions of the Act. The prosecutions which have taken and are taking place have not made the Act more popular, and should have been prevented directly Ministers realized that there was cause for making amendments. The amendments will, to a large extent, meet the case, but I am altogether opposed to the double penalties which are provided for. I have never before heard of double penalties for any offence. The Minister made it very clear that where young boys refuse-to drill, not only may they be compelled to make up lost time, but they may be fined as well. wilful disobedience. pelled to make up lost time,' that is suffiwill receive the approval of the people if cient. make up his drills, a fine will not be inflicted. that if a lad is ordered to make up his drills, he cannot befined? impose a fine. He may say to a lad, "" You must make up your drills,"" and not impose a fine. Where a lad agrees to make up his drills, no fine will be inflicted. be made clear in Committee. The Court will have the power to order boys to make up their drills, and they should not, in addition, be fined. Tbere should not be two penalties for one offence. Under the prin-cipal Act, if a lad is not efficient .when he reaches the age of twenty-three years, he may be compelled to undergo.another year's training. Many of the speeches that have been made assumed that the fault is always the lad's when drills are not attended, but that is not my view. You can secure ""the good-will of the lads and their parents only by strict justice. For the first time in the history of Australia, our boys are being compelled to give up part of their free time to military training. They are being deprived of a certain amount of liberty; and we are all chary about parting with our liberty. It is necessary to have a defence system, because the country is worth defending, and each citizen should be prepared to do his duty in that matter. But in depriving our youths of their liberty, we should take care to make the compulsory training popular. In my district, no attempt has been made to meet the convenience of the lads. I do not wish to occupy the time of the House by giving a number of illustrations, but I shall put before honourable members a case that was brought under my notice today. I received to-day from one of my constituents a letter in which he states that he is in favour of compulsory training, and that he desires that his two lads shall attend drill. The drills, however, are so arranged that his boys, who work two shifts, and are employed at the hour at which the drill takes place, have to lose a shift in order to attend. In that way each loses 9s. per week, so that this compulsory training system means to the household in question a loss of 18s. per week. The lads have either to attend prosecution for their failure to do so. Is",56,Defence Bill Second Reading

427,Mr Charlton,"That will have towe do not attempt to meet the special circumstances of various localities? Lads are being prosecuted to-day for not attending drill, and the position, so far as many of them are concerned, is that they have either to remain away from their work to attend drill, and so lose money, or be prosecuted for their failure to comply with the law. The managers of different mines in my electorate complain of this system. One manager says that lads have to remain away to attend drill, and that their absence interferes with the working of the mine. When we have this information before us, there is certainly no justification for going on with these prosecutions. If possible, the prosecutions should be.deferred-especiall y in view of the fact that it is found necessary to amend the Act as we are doing tonight, so that these lads will not be placed in such a position. I , like the honourable member for Dalley, take exception to what has been done, and trust that the Minister will be guided by the discussion that has taken place to-night. I hope that he will endeavour to frame an amendment that will do away with the right of a magistrate to impose double punishment. able member mean by double punishment ? when before a Court says: "" I refuse to make up my drill,"" the magistrate can order him to make it up, and may also inflict a fine. is not punishment, since all boys have to drill. ishment. Take the case of lads who have to go into camp with an officer for sixty-four hours to make up lost time, and must leave their work to do so. Is that not a punishment both for the lads and for their parents, who are deprived of their wages? In addition, a lad ordered to make up time in this way may lose his employment, and his parents his earnings. The honourable member for North Sydney spoke of the necessity for paying Area Officers a better salary. I am not prepared to agree to the payment of increased salary to them, for the reason that they are not compelled to devote the whole of their time to military duties. Almost every Area Officer follows some other occupation in respect of which he is in receipt of a fair salary. We must not lose sight of the fact that Area Officers are only temporarily employed. Under Lord Kitchener's scheme the cadets at the Military College are tp be equipped for this work, and on leaving the College are to take it up. It is for that reason that all Area Officers have been gazetted as being temporarily employed. We have to look to the Military College for our future officers, and it seems to me that Area Officers who are receiving £ 1 5 0 per year for acting in that capacity, and are also earning a salary at their ordinary occupations, are not badly paid. Officers, in country districts, at all events, have not much time to devote to outside employment. member admits, as I think he must, that they can follow other avocations, and also act as Area Officers, they must have sufficient spare time to devote from place to place in the country districts. serves within a prescribed area, and he fixes his drill for certain hours in different districts. I wish that we had men leaving the Military College to-morrow to take up this work, and to devote their whole time to it, for those at present acting as Area Officers are compelled to fix upon days for drill in different districts which best suit their own convenience. The times fixed are not always convenient to the lads or their parents, but they suit the officer, and the result is very often that lads are prosecuted for failing to attend drill, although their failure to attend has been due to the fact that the hour fixed is most inconvenient for them. I do not agree that the salary of Area Officers should be increased. Our defence expenditure is growing far too rapidly, and growing chiefly in the direction of the Navy. While honourable members display great anxiety to secure additional remuneration for officers, it must not be forgotten that we are asking all who have reached the age of eighteen years to go into camp next year, and to give their services for 3s. per day. In the case of married men, an extra payment of 10s. for their wives and of 2s. 6d. for each child is also to be made. When we are talking about increasing remuneration we ought not to forget the men who have to give up their time to go into camp, and who do not receive fairremunerationin respect of the time during which they have to remain away from their ordinary occupations. Many men at their ordinary employment can earn ios. per day, or £ 4 in respect of eight days' . service, whereas",57,Defence Bill Second Reading

If any increases are to be made we should see that the men who have to drill, and who will have to fight, receive a fair return for the time they devote to the work of fitting themselves for the defence of their country. I deplore this expenditure, and believe that in many cases it is going in the direction of the man with the big salary, while the poor man is not receiving fair payment for his services. If we are going to make this system popular we must have the people with us. It is a question not of what we think, but of whether the people approve of what we are enacting. We desire that the Act providing for compulsory training shall remain on the statute book. We believe that compulsory training is necessary in the interests of the counable member will not be in order in dealing try, but we do not believe that men should be obliged to comply v. *h a demand such ,; as was made recently, at the very initiation of this system, to go out and take up arms, whenever there is any little trouble, under the guise of dealing with "" domestic violence."" I am sorry that we have not in this Bill a definition of "" domestic violence,"" because it is unreasonable to expect men to go out and to take up arms against their fellows every time that a poli< tician makes a speech about a little trouble in one or other of the States. The Act is intended for the purpose of defence, and to that purpose it should be confined. It ought to be made clear that it is not going to be used in such a case as that in which an application for military assistance was recently made, but is going to be utilized for one purpose, and that is to defend our shores against an invading foe -no t for the purpose of aggression, but for the purpose of defence. I believe it is necessary, in the interests of Australia, that we should have a Citizen Force, and that every one who is capable should be able to defend the country in the hour of need. At the same time, I think it is necessary to be as careful as possible to make the Act popular and acceptable to the people, both old and young, so that we can rest assured that every one will come forward and be prepared to do the drill, not only from a feeling of loyalty, but also from a feeling that he is doing what is necessary and in the interests of the. country to which he belongs. tirely disagree with the latter remarks of the honourable member for Hunter in regard to the'' obligations of the mifitary. These are undoubtedly to stand as a bulwark, not 1 only for the defence of the people against invasion, but also for the defence of the Constitution under which we are governed. If , in the wisdom of the Government, it appears to be necessary that they should be employed for the purpose of suppressing acts of violence against the constituted authority of a State, then the military organization must be called into requisition. assistance of the military is asked for when there is no domestic violence, and that is going to make the system unpopular. military was asked for in the case of the Brisbane strike. with that matter. to me to be able to compliment the Government in regard to this amending Bill. In the first place, I wish to refer to the provision which enables officers of the Senior Cadets to continue as officers there, even when, by age, they have qualified to become members of the Citizen Force, because it appears to me to offer a very substantial inducement to the lads to acquire special qualifications. I think it is a very wise provision indeed, and I congratulate the Minister of Defence upon what he has done in this direction. While I am in the mood for congratulating, I would also like to congratulate him, in common with the honourable member for Bendigo, upon his attitude and his reply to a deputation which addressed him yesterday. If there is one thing we should do to popularize our defence system and the compulsory training of lads, it is to gain the good-will of their mothers. The clause which provides that there shall be no intoxicating or spirituous liquors sold to a cadet while he is in uniform will, I feel sure, commend itself most heartily to every woman in the community. I endorse the provision most heartily, and commend the Government for putting it in the Bill. I am a"" little doubtful about the following provisionIn places where Children's Courts exist offences against this section committed by cadets under the age of sixteen years shall be prosecuted, in such Courts as far as is reasonably practicable.

440,Mr Palmer,"It is certainly pleasingthink it will be unfair if any provision is introduced which will make it possible for lads in country districts where Children's Courts do not exist to be treated more harshly than lads in towns where Children's Courts are in existence. I notice that the Minister representing the Minister of Defence nodded his head in regard to this matter, seeming to indicate that there shall be no difference made. I hope that, by some regulation, it will be made more than certain that every lad who is tried in a Police Court shall not be treated more harshly than those who will be tried in Children's Courts. I wish to refer to a matter which has been brought under my notice by my constituents, and that is the time when the drills are discontinued at night in country places. I could cite one instance where the lads live at a distance of 6 miles from the place of training, and the complaint is that they are drilled so long that they return home at inordinately late hours. Whether they are kept at drill or not, of course, the parents do not know; but I think that the lads should have a card indicating that they have been at drill, and stating explicitly at what time they have been discharged, so that parents may know exactly when to expect their lads to return. If lads ""do not return at a reasonable time, their parents will know that it is the fault of the lads themselves, and not of the person who is training them. If we really want to popularize this movement, we shall have to avoid the mistake made in the past of fixing drills for recognised pubshall be not less than six hours, of a half lic holidays. There are some holidays which are so generally recognised as to be an unfitting time for the purpose of drilling. I hope that the Defence Department will avoid the mistake of permitting any officer to prescribe such days for drilling. I have no desire to prolong the discussion. I wanted to put these two or three thoughts before the House, because I wish to popularize the movement, and to make it as great a success as possible. which can be done in reason to make it easier and pleasanter to those who have to submit to compulsory service, will be a step in the right direction, and tend to make the movement what I am sure we all desire it should bea very great success, indeed. is a measure on which a very great deal . \'. * -* . . . might be said, and a good, deal ought to be said; but, so far as that is absolutely perticonnexion there seems to be a general want nent to the measure, it can be said in Committee; if then netsessary'.

460,Mr Roberts,"I admit that the finespaid, and the hardships to which reference has been made, have not yet been inflicted on the parents. It is the intention of the Ministry to remit the lines which have been inflicted up to the present moment, and to administer the Act with the utmost leniency. But in the interests of discipline harsher treatment must be meted out in some cases than in others. Surely my honourable friends will not urge that a few lads should be able to defy the law and the Parliament of this country? If even one youth is permitted to do that we must allow all to do it. ings often lead to a poor father losing time at his work. to point out that all that a lad has to do, even if he be ten hours behind out of the sixty-four hours' drill that is required of him during the year-that is less than one and a quarter hours per week-is to tell the Area Officer that he will make up his deficiency. That will end the whole matter. In such circumstances there will be no prosecution. Even if he be more than ten hours deficient in his drill, and he is taken before the Court, there is no possibility of a line being inflicted upon him if he intimates his readiness to make up the sixty-four hours that are required ot him. But where there is a distinct defiance of the magistrate and of the Act. some different treatment is essential as an example to other lads who are loyally discharging their duties. quite agree with the Honorary Minister as to the necessity of exhibiting leniency in the administration of the Act. But while affirming that if a lad agrees to make up his deficiency in drill he will not be prosecuted, the Honorary Minister does not say that the language of this clause prevents a boy who declares that he has not time to make it up, being ordered to do so, in addition to being subjected to a monetary penalty. I can quite understand the Minister's argument in respect to recalcitrant youths.. If the language of the clause can be interpreted in the way that he suggests there will be no cause of complaint. But I hold that under it a magistrate has the power, both to order a lad to make up his deficiency in drill and to fine him as well. I do not suggest that many magistrates would do that. But, nevertheless, the power is there. If the clause merely means that a recalcitrant youth who refuses to do his drills, shall be subjected to extra punishment, 1 shall be perfectly satisfied. But we are dealing now with difficulties of the principal Act, and we ought to take every reasonable care to exclude harsh treatment as far as possible. 1 repeat that if the provision will bear the interpretation which has been placed upon it by the Honorary Minister it is all right. Buti f a magistrate may order a boy to make up his deficiency in drill, and fine him as well, I submit that he is in a position to mete out double punishment. Minister) [10.18] I would point out to the honourable member for Hunter that power must be given in the Bill to deal with a lad who openly defies the law. If we remove the possibility of -dealing with those who are specially defiant, they will escape their obligations. youth being ordered by a magistrate to make up his deficiency in drill, and refusing to do so, the magistrate should have power to inflict punishment. is allowing himself to be led away by an enthusiasm that is laudable. The following are the instructions which have been issued by the Government in connection with this matter(a) That in the first instance a monetary penalty be not imposed. Mr W. J. JOHNSON -But no notice is taken of that instruction. Area Officers are thoroughly acquainted with the position. The second instruction issued by the Government reads(i) That the magistrates be asked to adjourn for two months the cases of those who promise to make up all their deficiencies, and if they make up their deficiencies the cases be dismissed. These instructions will apply in the future. If a lad makes up his deficiency in drill the case against him will be dismissed, so -that the position put by my honourable friend has really been met. But the power to do certain things, if the necessity for doing them arises, must be retained in the Bill, otherwise the standard set up by the particularly recalcitrant will be the standard guiding conduct on the part of all the boys. Under the circumstances I ask the honourable member for Dalley not to press his amendment. Amendment negatived.",61,Defence Bill Second Reading

Navigation Bill, and on Tuesday begin tbe standard rates for standing advertisements; debate on the Budget, ending it, I hope, the next day. During question time to-day the Prime Minister, on the authority of one of the Melbourne agents, said the country newspapers charged the Government for advertisements three times their usual charge for jected that I knew this was incorrect. Some confusion may easily have arisen, because there are two classes of advertisements inserted in newspapers-casua l advertisements charged for per insertion and by the inch, and standing advertisements inserted for a stated time, and charged for at a fixed rate. The difference in the prices for standing and casual advertisements, the latter being the kind usually inserted by the Government^ has no doubt given rise to the impression that there is a discrepancy. Since the statement was made this afternoon I have placed myself in communication with the Country Newspaper Association, and with Messrs. Gordon and Gotch, the firm in question. From the latter I have received the following replyReferring to your inquiry of to-day, concerning the Commonwealth Savings Bank advertising, I wisb to say that there is no great variation between tbe commercial casual rate and the Government rate for casual advertising. There is, liowever, a big distinction between commercial contract rates and casual rates; these advertisements are looked upon as quite apart from one another. We feel, upon fuller consideration, that some confusion may have arisen in dealing with this matter. We were requested to provide a price for a series of advertising for the Commonwealth Savings Bank, and quoted a price based upon commercial contract , rates, which, as I have explained to you, 'are mucb below either Government casual rates or commercial casual rates. No doubt you are aware that the Governments do not arrange standing advertisements by contract, and as this was the first case of the kind that we had to deal with, we discussed the matter with tbe Governor of the Bank, and be informed us that if more than the rates for commercial contract' advertising were 'demanded he would not go on with the advertising.. We accordingly quoted him the commercia, contract rates, the totai of whict., as is customary with us, has been offered to the country newspaper proprietors. ister, and to the country newspapers throughout ""Victoria, I thought it was right newspapers want to charge more? the country newspapers made no attempt to Question resolved in the affirmative.
