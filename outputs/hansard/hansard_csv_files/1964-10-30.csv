That prayers. dressed to the Acting Minister for Health. course, is obviously correct. Incidentally, I Is it correct that the pensioner medical serpoint out as a matter of history that this is vice does not cover the cost of physiothe first occasion on which Australian therapy treatment given in either a public troops have actually been in combat with hospital or a private hospital by an outside Indonesian troops. We will report to the physiotherapist, even though such treatment United Nations the measures that bave been is given on the recommendation of the penundertaken, the fact of the involvement of sioner's own doctor? If that is so, and as our own troops, and that we will continue many pensioners require this treatment but to act in this way to help Malaysia to cannot afford to pay for it, will the Minisdefend itself against unprovoked attack. ter recommend that such treatment be included in the pensioner medical service? If not, why not? included in the national health scheme to date. This matter has been raised on several occasions in the past and has been considered. However, I will look at it again and advise the honourable member of the result. Prime Minister whether he has any information that he can give the House concerning the cecent infiltration by Indonesia against Malaysia and the counter action which has involved Australian troops? that we have is largely in line with what has appeared in the newspaper cables. A further group of Indonesian raiders, estimated at between 50 and 60, was put ashore south of Malacca in the small hours of yesterday morning. It is pretty clear from the examination made that the forces included a substantial number of regular personnel of the Indonesian armed forces. Immediate counter action was taken by security forces, including a company of Australians. The situation is well in hand. There have been quite a few surrenders and the Indonesian operation appears to be likely to be as complete a failure as the ones at Pontian and Labis. I do not need to remind the House of the discussion that occurred in the Security Council and of the overwhelming condemnation would have been the more effective but for the veto of the Soviet Union. We believe that this is once more a very clear case. So far as we are concerned, the action taken to resist this aggression, of to the Treasurer. Is it a fact that the Defence Forces Retirement Benefit Fund had an income of more than £6i million in the year ended 30th June 1964 and paid to ex-servicemen benefits amounting only to less than £31 million? Is the Minister aware that the Fund has been the subject of considerable criticism by service personnel in recent years and is recognised as the main reason for the high rate of resignations of commissioned officers from the forces -especiall y the Army-ove r the past two years? Will the Treasurer take steps to have the law relating to this Fund amended so that retirement benefits will be brought more into line with the pensions paid to Commonwealth public servants of comparable rank? Finally, will the Treasurer advise the House as to what were the total investments of the Fund at the end of June 1964? the House will expect me to have available now the detailed information sought by the honourable gentleman. I shall study the text of his question and secure the information for him. But there are one or two general observations which ought to be made. I think we do no service to the servicemen or to the public if we regard the defence forces retirement benefits scheme which has been adopted by this Parliament as unreasonable",7,Setup

7,Mr Harold Holt,"I do not thinkor ungenerous. This scheme arose from recommendations of the Allison Committee. I believe that it is by no means an ungenerous scheme, having regard to the basis of Commonwealth contributions to the Fund. Quite obviously when there are claims to be made on the Fund in the future, and it has not enjoyed a long life as a fund, it will be left with a substantial capital amount against the contingencies of the future. We have reviewed the Fund from time to time. I believe, from my own knowledge of the Fund, that it is certainly no less favourable for the contributors to it than would be, say, the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund for members of the Public Service. If there is, as I doubt, any considerable number of officers who have retired from the forces because of their belief in the inadequacy of the Fund, I would conclude that this .nr.tion has been based upon an inadequate knowledge of the benefits to be derived from the Fund and of how they compare with provisions made elsewhere. for Labour and National Service a question. Has the Minister seen or heard of a statement in which Mr Kenny, a senior vicepresident of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, said in regard to the strike at General Motors-Holden's Pty. Ltd We are now faced with a situation of extricating for the co-operation of the Commonwealth the unions from a ridiculous situation. The trade unions would be disgusted if I were to tell the full story. Can the Minister throw any light on this remarkable statement in which Mr Kenny referred also to the "" debacle "" of the trade union movement? already been said in the House by me in answer to several questions was a prelude to what Mr Kenny said at the Trades and Labour Council last night. Mr Kenny made it clear in his statement that the spate of strikes that are now taking place at General Motors-Holden's Pty. Ltd. and, I add, at Mt. Isa are contrary to the expressed views of the organised trade union movement of this country. The General MotorsHolden's strike cost the country between £23 million and £25 million of production. About £1} million in wages was lost. No benefit has accrued to the workmen themselves. I pointed out that this strike was called, and deliberately called, by a small section of left wing trade union leaders. This is to be deplored, and I am glad that Mr Kenny has had the courage to make this statement condemning the small group of people who are sabotaging Australian industry. Dr. J . F . CAIRNS I ask the Prime Minister a question relating to the proposal of the Victorian Government to impose a separate income tax. I ask whether the Government's consideration of this matter is complete. If it is, what is the attitude of the Government to the proposal of the Victorian Government that its separate income tax be collected by the Commonwealth Government? able member was good enough to raise this matter in the House a day or two ago and I have therefore put myself in a position to set down a reply to his question with some precision, this being desirable. As all honourable members know, in his Budget Speech of 9th September, the Premier of Victoria announced certain proposals for the levying of an income tax on individual persons resident in Victoria. The tax was to be payable from lst July 1965. Subsequently the Premier wrote to me asking in collecting the tax, as envisaged in the provisions of section 15 of the Commonwealth Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act. Naturally, my colleagues and I have given this important proposal very close and detailed consideration. In the light of this, I have now informed the Premier that wefindourselves unable to meet his request. I have pointed out to Mr Bolte that it has been necessary for us to study his request, not simply as a matter between the Comonwealfh and Victoria, but as one having implications for thefinancialrelationships between the Commonwealth and all States. From that standpoint, it had become apparent to us that for the Commonwealth to meet Victoria's request could very well raise problems essentially of a kind with many of those we knew to be involved in a full return of tax powers to the State Governments.",13,Defence Forces Retirement Benefit Fund

10,Sir Robert Menzies,"The honorAs the House will recall, at various Premiers' Conferences in the past the Commonwealth has indicated its willingness to consider arrangements under which the States might once more exercise income tax powers. However, it being our view that this matter is necessarily of concern to all States, we have been prepared to consider it only with States as a whole and not with States separately. Our position has been and is that the Commonwealth could contemplate an arrangement involving the abandonment or modification of uniform taxation only if the arrangement met certain essentia] conditions-mor e particularly that it should be supported by all States, that it should contain adequate safeguards for the interests of taxpayers, and that it should regarded as illegal, numbers among its provide a sound basis for future financial relationships between the Commonwealth and each of the States. However, in conveying our decision to Mr Bolte, I have made it clear that should he or the Premier of any other State so desire, the Commonwealth would be prepared to discuss this or any other aspect of Commonwealth and State financial relationships when the financial assistance grants arrangements are being reviewed. to the Minister for Social Services. I refer have resources to follow it for many years to representations I have made and to discusto come. sions I have had with regard to an application by the Tumut Sub-Branch of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia for a grant under the Aged Persons Homes Act.

Is it a fact that the penny, bearing the portrait of the Queen or of former Monarchs, will disappear when decimal currency is introduced? If this is a fact, is the Treasurer aware that this coin is regarded as of great value in two-up schools for use in an Australian national pastime? Is he also aware that the game is not for basic wage earners and, whilst patrons men from every walk of life, including legal men, business men and members of the Liberal Party? In these circumstances will he favourably consider the retention of the penny in the interest of those who seek their enjoyment and fortune in patronising this national pastime? gentleman may have found the answer I have been seeking as to why 80 million pennies had to be minted this year.

In view of the general interest in the future method of marketing the Australian wool clip, proposals for which are at present being held up by the action brought by the Logan Downs Pastoral Co. challenging the levy for wool promotion purposes, is the Minister in a position to give the House any information in general terms of the grounds on which this action is based? a question for the Attorney-General to answer, because he is in possession of information that I have not received. In the absence of that information, I could not give a detailed reply. I shall ask my colleague to supply the honourable member with an answer. to the Prime Minister. I ask: Has he received from the National Nursing Education Division a request for a grant of £10,000 to assist the Division in its programme of nursing research? If no decision has been reached, will the right honourable gentleman expedite consideration of this important matter which involves the many problems that beset the nursing profession? whether this request to which the honourable member refers is some recent one. Offhand, I am not in a position to say whether such a request is at present in my office. If it is, it will certainly receive very prompt consideration. the Minister for Housing. He will know that the maximum income limit for eligibility for State Housing Commission homes in rural areas of Western Australia is £28 16s. 8d. a week, or £1,499 per annum, plus £25 per annum for each child under the age of 16. I ask: If the State Government decided to widen the area of eligibility for Commission homes by increasing the maximum income limit, would the decision vernment's policy in respect of the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement? Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement concerning the allocation of houses that comes within the control of the Commonwealth is the very general obligation on the State to make dwellings built with funds provided under the terms of the Agreement available primarily to families on low and moderate incomes. Some of the States, but not all, impose a means test. Under the terms of the Agreement, there is no power for the Commonwealth to suggest any particular detailed test. The general policy of the Commonwealth under the Agreement is that, apart from the matters in respect of which specific provision has been made for Commonwealth authority to be exercised, the Agreement should be administered, and the requirements for the allocation of houses built with funds provided under its terms should be decided by the States. WINE. for Trade and Industry a question about the United Kingdom surcharge tax on imports, particularly imports of Australian wines.

25,Mr Giles,"I address to the Ministerfhe scale of promotional drives to aid the sale of Australian wines in countries bearing some potential for sales, such as Canada and Japan? Prime Minister informed our Prime Minister of the surcharges to be applied, the Prime Minister advised Mr Wilson that we would immediately wish to enter into consultations with a view to ascertaining the full implications of the proposals, the effect if any on our trade agreement with the United Kingdom and the implications to our preferences, as well as raising the issue of any particular hardships that might result to Australian industry. One of the matters requiring discussion was the point at which goods in transit might be subject to surcharge. Steps are in train for formal consultations between the two Governments on those matters. Obviously one of the industries that may be affected, and affected perhaps quite importantly, is the wine industry. Every effort will be made to protect the interests of the wine industry. If it appeared with the legislation before the House that the proposed British action will have a detrimental effect on the wine industry we would, in consultation with the Australian Wine Board, see whether there was scope for more actively trying to penetrate alternative markets. Immigration a question. In view of the deaths that occur from accident or sudden illness among Australians visiting the United Kingdom, Europe and the United States of America and in view of the fact that so few of such people leave wills, with subsequent legal inconvenience to their sorrowing relatives, will the Minister, through his officers, consider requesting all Australians who seek passports prior to going overseas to make a will before they leave this country? The legislation, admittedly, is complex; I do not want to frighten anybody, but the necessity for this precaution was brought home to me only last week when I had to assist in the case a young Tasmanian woman who had died suddenly from a brain haemorrhage on 20th October in Essex, England, and did not leave a will. the case referred to by the honourable member. Apart from the matters of this nature that come to my notice as MinisterI am aware of the position because of a particular case that arose at one time. I think the honourable member's suggestion has quite an amount of merit and, therefore, I will take up the matter with my Department. Although many people when applying for a passport are reluctant to supply the information that is sought from them, I am sure that they will recognise that the furnishing of information of the type suggested by the honourable member is most desirable. I think members of the Parliament who travel abroad should also be advised to make a will before leaving Australia. a deputation this morning from representatives of organisations interested in the income tax legislation that has been introduced into this House? Will the right honourable gentleman say whether the Government will proceed rises? If so, will he say whether the organisations interested will have an opportunity to discuss the mechanics of the legislation with Treasury officials and to place their views before the Government before the debate takes place? requests from several quarters to defer the legislation so that it may be carefully studied by accountants, lawyers, organisations representative of taxpayers and others. This morning I received a deputation representative of many of those who had made these proposals to me. I pointed out that there are important practical considerations why the Government believes it desirable that the legislation be passed through both Houses during this sessional period. but it would not be practicable for us to deal with it until about April or May of next year if it were not to be disposed of in this sessional period. I believe that this would leave too long a period of uncertainty for many people who would wish to deal with their affairs with afirmerknowledge of what the Parliament had adopted than would be the case if a continuing delay were to occur.

In any event, in the interval between the passage of the legislation-assumin g that we go ahead with it-and the meeting of the jlouse next year, there would be opportunity for further study, both by the officers of the Taxation Branch and by outside organisations. If, in the new year, it can be demonstrated to the Government that there are particular aspects of this matter which should be examined, then the Government will be willing to look at them in the light of the representations then made to it. While I shall give some thought to what has been put to me this morning, for the practical reasons that I have outlined, my own disposition, and I believe that of the Government, is to proceed with the legislation to adoption by both Houses before the Parliament rises.

Minister for Trade and Industry a question supplementary to one answered by him a few moments ago. It relates particularly to the export of manufactured goods to the United Kingdom and has particular reference to an organisation in my electorate which exports photographic goods. Will the Minister make particular representations to the United Kingdom Government that some relief should be given to those exporting firms in Australia that have existing commitments for exports? Will he ask the United Kingdom Government to give special consideration to those firms which have relied on the good faith of the United Kingdom and which would suffer hardship if any sudden imposition of duty were made? If the United Kingdom is unable to carry out its legal or moral commitments under its trade agreement with Australia, will the Australian Government look sympathetically at the question of giving some kind of relief to firms in Austraha which are likely to be affected? myself actively with the issue raised by the honourable member. We must comprehend that it is the responsibility of the government of any country whose overseas balances are running out to take some appropriate step to protect its balances. We ourselves have done this by introducing import licensing, a very unhappy step for any government to have to take but a quite inevitable one.

The Minister will be aware of the apprehension felt in many places about future markets for indigenous crude oil. While the oil exploration industry enthusiastically welcomes the Minister's assurance that the Government will insist that all locally produced oil is purchased by Australian refineries, there remains the vital question of price. Will the Minister assure the nation that the Government will use its influence to ensure that local production, so vital to our defence and economy, is not threatened with low cost imports from areas of over-supply, such as Indonesia? In particular, will he give an assurance that when the present shotgun marriage of the Moonie producers and the refineries comes to an end the Government will do what it can to ensure the fixation of a price more in keeping with Australian conditions? honourable member's aversion to shotgun by an Opposition spokesman to the effect marriages; I understand he is a minister of that a public authority should determine the the Church. I can assure the honourable member that the Government and I have in mind that any locally produced crude oil must be sold at a fair and reasonable price, and at a price profitable to the people who search for, and discover oil. We realise that unless this happens there will be a lack of encouragement for these companies to carry on their search for oil. I hope I will still be Minister for National Development when Australia becomes self-sufficient in crude oil. Obviously, this will happen only if a fair, reasonable and profitable price is paid for local crude oil. The Governnient is considering ways in which this can be brought about. Prime Minister who is representing the Acting Minister for External Affairs. It appears that two months ago the InterParliamentary Union Conference, on which our delegates reported to us two days ago, did not discuss a draft resolution on apartheid in South Africa because it failed by six votes to achieve the two thirds majority required to place it on the agenda, and that the draft resolution would have been listed if the seven Australian delegates from the Government parties had not voted against its listing. I ask the right honourable gentleman: As the Australian Government since 1960 has ceased to vote against the discussion of apartheid in the General Assembly of the United Nations, why did the members of the Government parties vote against the discussion of this subject at this recent international conference? I can get any information on this matter.

This seemed to me to be entirely consistent with the firmly held views of the honourable member in relation to the programme of nationalisation to which he and all other honourable members sitting alongside him in Opposition, I understand, are pledged. directed to the Minister for the Army.

Is it also true industry as a declining industry. The Departthat the limited training involved practice against targets drawn by a 1947 vintage plane borrowed from a private owner?

The Army beheves that their skills are perfectly adequate for the purpose and that the men are quite capable of manning these guns in Darwin, if required. Minister for Primary Industry. I refer to the latest sale of wheat to Communist China by the Australian Wheat Board. No doubt Minister for Trade and Industry will recall the numerous representations that have been made on behalf of the flour industry by the honourable member for Mallee and me, and also by other honourable members. I ask: First, does this recent sale include any flour? Secondly, is there any truth in the suggestion that a further sale to Communist China is contemplated? Thirdly, if there is any truth in that suggestion, will the Minister bring to the notice of the Australian Wheat Board the distressing position of the flour industry so that in future contracts with countries such as Communist China a reasonable amount of flour can be included, and thereby at least try to counter the decline of an industry which was once a very good export industry and which does much to help to give employment in country areas? of the recent contract made between the Australian Wheat Board and China is that it does not include any sales of flour. The honourable member referred to the flour ment of Trade and Industry has had some successes in relation to this industry, notably with Ceylon which has renewed for two years an agreement for the purchase of 100,000 tons of flour.

It has been found possible-w e hope that it will be found to be constitutionally validfor the Parliament to decide that any fraction remaining after dividing the number of people in each State by the quota will mean the addition of one more member for that State. The whole matter comes down to what is meant by the statement in the Constitution that the number of members of the House of Representatives shall be, as nearly as practicable, twice the number of senators. No-one knows what the opinion of the judges of the High Court of Australia would be on this matter. But some of us believe that the Government could allow the Parliament to make a decision on it. There has never been any decision by this Parliament on what that section of the Constitution means. F.l 2500/64 -Jt -[94 ] Many of us believe that the House of Representatives should be much bigger than it is. There are now members representing more than 100,000 electors. The number of electors in an electorate falls to around 33,000, which is about the number of electors enrolled in my electorate of Melone in which there is such a small number that a new Parliament House is 20 or 30 years ahead. I do not think there is any I hope that some means will be found deadlocks? very valid argument against increasing the size of the Senate by two for each State. It should be increased by four for each State. We considered this matter in 1948 when we were enlarging the House of Representatives. We rejected a proposal to increase the size of the Senate by two for each State and decided on an increase of four for each State for the very reason that was advanced in the interjection that the honourable member for Higinbotham just made. Mr Turner, the then Chief Electoral Officer, was the man who pointed out the danger of deadlock if senators are elected by the system of proportional representation.

51,Mr Calwell,"That is so. That is aThe Constitutional Review Committee, which reported to the Parliament in 1959, suggested that the Constitution be altered so that the Senate should consist of no more than 10 members for each State. The provision in the Constitution is that it shall constitution may be made. sist of not less than six members for each State. We wanted the Constitution altered by writing in "" ten "" instead of "" six "" and also to provide that there would be no power in the Parliament to increase the size of the Senate any further. At that time, in order to meet the situation with which we are faced today, we proposed that the Constitution should be further amended to permit the size of the House of Representatives to be increased, on the basis of having one member for every 80,000 people living in a State. If that alteration had been made we would have a House of Representatives now of about 140 to 144 members. sise the word "" people "". for giving me the correct figure. There would be nothing wrong with having a House of Representatives of 139 members today. The Constitutional Review Committee used the term "" 80,000 people "" because there are children whose interests have to be served by members of Parliament. More importantly, those children will some day be voters. Also, there are many unnaturalised people in the inner metropolitan electorates today who will not become naturalised, but they must have their interests served and they, in many cases, make more demands on members of Parliament than do natural born or naturalised Australians. So we feel that the Government should have put to the people the various proposals advanced by the Constitutional Review Ccromittee. It has not done so. We think the matter is so important that a referendum should be taken on the subject now. Indeed, as an Opposition Party we have moved so far in this matter that Senator McKenna, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate has brought down bills in the Senate to give effect to the recomof the quota provision, which in the Elecmendations of the Committee on this and other matters. I ha^e heard it said that although the Government is not very keen about doing anything on the recommendations of the Joint Committee it is at least open to conviction that the sections dealing with the relationships of the two Houses should be submitted to the people in order .that the necessary alteration in the ConI do not want to deal at any great length with what the Constitutional Review Committee recommended, but I think it is germane to the argument, and quite relevant, that I should read out what the Committee did recommend. In paragraph 44 of the report which, as I have said is now five years old and five years neglected, the Committee recommended that the Constitution should be amended to provide as follows(1) The number of members of the House of Representatives should be no longer tied to being as nearly as practicable twice the number of senators. (2) The ParUament should have power to determine the number of senators provided equal representation of the original States is maintained, but there should be not less than six nor more than ten senators for each original. State. (3) The Parliament should continue to havepower to make laws for increasing or diminishing the number of members of the House of Representatives, and the number of members chosen in the several States should remain in proportion to population. However, the power of the Parliament to deterrnine the number of members of the House of Representatives should be subject to the qualification that the number of members to be chosen in any State should be determined by dividing the population of the State by a figuredetermined by the Parliament which is the same for each State and is not less, than 80,000, thus providing that there should be on average at least 80,000' people for every member. Where, upon a division, there is a remainder greater than one-half of the divisor, there should be an additional member to bechosen in the State concerned. (4) The power of the Parliament referred to insub-paragraph (3) above should be subject to the present Constitutional provision that there should be no less than five members chosen in each original 1 State. In its long and very valuable report theCommittee said at paragraph 316, in respect toral Act now is 20 per cent The Committee feels constrained to say, however, that the one-fifth margin on either side of the quota for a State which the Act allows may disturb >",21,Representation Bill 1964

55,Mr Calwell,"I thank the Ministerquite seriously a principle which the Committee beheves to be beyond question in the election of members of the national Parliament of a Federation, namely, that the votes of the electors should, as far as possible, be accorded equal value. The full application of the margin each way to two divisions in the State could result in the number of electors in one division totalling SO per cent more than the number of electors in the other division. Such a possible disparity in the value of votes is inconsistent with the full realization of democracy. sition thinks that 10 per cent, is more reasonable? good, but 10 per cent, is? recommended that the electoral law should be amended to substitute 10 per cent, for 20 per cent., and if the honourable gentleman will contain himself for just one moment I will tell him that this decision was made after the greatest consideration, that it was a unanimous decision of the Committee and that the two members of the Country Party, Mr Hamilton and Mr Drummond, who served on the Committee agreed with the Labour representatives. The four Liberal Party members also agreed. difference between the 10 per cent. ber for Indi oan make bis contribution later, but I hope he will read the report of the Committee before he does so, because he is liable, judging by his interjection, to run counter to the opinion of his own party's two representatives on the Committee. that the honourable member's interjection should not open up a wide debate on redistribution. 329 of the report states. . . the Committee concluded that it should recommend the inclusion in the Constitution of provisions ensuring the regular review of the electoral divisions of each State and also accord near uniformity to the value accorded to the votes of the electors for each of the States. Paragraph 330 is significant. It statesOne form of gerrymandering is the creation of electoral divisions in which there are substantial this is a matter to be considered for partidisparities in the number of enrolled voters so cular areas, but at the moment I am trying securing for a political party greater representation to show the House that the preponderance than it should have. In all its forms, the device is thoroughly subversive of the democratic process. In making possible minority governments, the majority can be deprived of the government of its choice and the way is opened for arbitrary action impairing the freedom of the individual even though that action stands condemned by the majority of people who comprise the electors of the Commonwealth. That statement also was unanimously agreed to. There were certain features of the Bill introduced into the Senate to which we think the Government should have given effect. I refer to the provision that a referendum should be held to repeal section 127 of the Constitution which prevents Aborigines from being counted fbr the purposes of determining the population of the ComCommittee monwealth. Had the Aborigines of Western AustraUa and Queensland been included in the census of 1961 Queensland would not have lost a seat and Western Australia would not have lost a seat under the later proposals. We think the Government ought to give early consideration to including, in the referendum, proposals for the deletion of section 127. There is not very much more that I want to say on the matter. This is largely a technical bill. However, I want to emphasise that this very valuable Committee did recommend that the Constitution should contain a provision that there should be no deviation of more than one-tenth of the quota. I would like to read one other section of the report. At paragraph 345 the Committee saidThe Committee considered the extent of the problems which would arise from inserting in the Constitution a requirement that no division in a State should depart from the quota for that State to a greater extent tban one-tenth more or one-tenth less. The Committee was assisted in its task by the then Chief Electoral Officer for the Commonwealth, Mr L. Ainsworth, who also obtained the views of the Commonwealth Electoral Officer and the Surveyor-General for each of the States. The preponderance of that opinion was clearly in favour of retaining the marginal allowance at the existing one-fifth fraction. from the quota be any greater in one of the gigantic electorates such as Kalgoorlie? and I will show just how in the past the deviation has been greater than 10 per cent.

64,Mr Mcewen,Could the departure,23,Representation Bill 1964
65,Mr Calwell,"I shall say, ""Yes"";of feeling was that the tolerance should be not more than 10 per cent. I hope it will never be suggested that every country electorate should have 10 per cent, less than the quota or that an outer metropolitan electorate should have 10 per cent less because it is an expanding district, whereas electorates in the inner areas, which today are being rebuilt, should have a burden of an additional 10 per cent, placed upon them. It is suggested that populations will move out of the inner metropolitan areas, which wiil become industrial centres, but the trend all round the world today is to build big blocks of flats in the inner areas and for people to move back into these areas. We do not want dead cities. In one sense, it is perhaps as well that the Electoral Act is not before us for review at the moment. Very serious consideration must be given to quite a number of factors when the Electoral Act is being considered by Cabinet. I have said that the preponderance of evidence given before the Constitutional Review Committee was in favour of retaining the one-fifth fraction. But in paragraph 346 the Committee-agai n unanimouslysaidUndoubtedly, it would be easier to apply a one-fifth margin than to work within the limits of a one-tenth marginal allowance from quota. Nevertheless, the Committee is satisfied that the problems of applying a one-tenth margin are quite manageable. The Minister for Trade and Industry( Mr seconded? McEwen) asked me a question a moment ago about the deviation for big electorates. In paragraph 349 the Committee saidIn the 1955 redistribution there were, however, only three very large divisions, Darling, Kennedy and Kalgoorlie, outside the one-tenth margin of allowance. Details were as followsThe Committee then set out that in New South Wales the quota was 43,482 and the assessed enrolment for the Division of Darling was 38,486, the percentage below quota being 11.5. In Queensland the quota was 41,309 and the assessed enrolment for the Division of Kennedy was 33,906, the percentage below quota being 17.9 -in order to maintain the minority control would not object to that? would be all right for those areas, but broadly where we have big centres of population, we should get as near to one vote one value as we possibly can. Leader of the Opposition not to be drawn too far away from the provisions of the Bill. If he is, it will be difficult to control the subsequent debate. The question of redistribution is not before the Chair. to complete the quotation from the Committee's report? that in Western Australia the quota was 37,378 and the assessed enrolment for the Division of Kalgoorlie was 32,159, the percentage below quota being 14. The very fact that we mentioned this in our report shows that we were alive to the significance of it. There is really nothing more for me to say on the Bill. It at least does not deprive the Parliament of two members; it at least gives the Parliament two more members. AllI am sorry for is that no way has yet been found to give the Parliament the number of members it would have if the recommendations of the Constitutional Review Committee were given effect to. The Minister for the Interior has said that the number of members would then be 139. ment and reserve my right to speak to it. a facade of such high sounding principles as "" the protection of the interests of the rural voters"" and "" the democratic rights of those in outback Australia "" lies a sordid and sinister story of political intrigue between the Liberal Party and the Austrahan Country Party to produce this plan designed not for the purposes stated but rather to destroy the very basis of democratic representation-on e vote one value of the Commonwealth Government by members of the Australian Country Party, which is rapidly disappearing from the political scene. In other words, this measure is the first step in the introduction of a blatant gerrymander of the Federal electorates.",23,Representation Bill 1964

This is a very difficult matter to determine and the co-operation of all honourable members is required. fully studied the terms of the Bill and I do not think you will find that I am departing from them. I submit that I am entitled to tell the Parliament of the circumstances that led to the introduction of the Bill, which provides for four seats more than the previous proposal did. With your approval, Mr Speaker, I will deal with these matters. The Bill amends section 10 of the Act and provides that a State will obtain an additional member for any fraction of a quota. It provides on this basis for 124 members instead of the 120 members in the previous proposal. I believe I am entitled under Standing Orders to show why the Government now wants to increase the previous number of 120 to 124. Although the legislation proposes only certain changes in the Representation Act, it presents to the Parliament the sinister picture of events yet to come when the Government deals with redistribution. For this reason, the amendment moved by the Opposition, which seeks to have these proposals placed before the Parliament, should be supported and accepted. I wish briefly to trace the events that led can be measured against the promise of an to this Bill being placed before the Parliament. At page 110 of "" Hansard"" of 22nd February 1962, the then Minister for the Interior advised the House that, as required by the Representation Act 1905-1938, he would give certainfiguresshowing that the number of members of the Parliament should be 120, a decrease of two. There was no opposition to that statement from the Country Party, the Liberal Party or any member of this Parliament. It was all over in about 30 seconds. On 10th April 1962, following the introduction of those proposals, the then Minister for the Interior( Mr Freeth) announced the appointment of redistribution Commissioners. They were independent and reputable men, and no opposition, not even from the Deputy Prime Minister, who is Leader of the Country Party, or from those who have since spoken and been responsible for the introduction of this present legislation, was voiced in this Parliament. Those who were appointed were unanimously chosen to draw up the electoral boundaries, with the full support of the Country Party and of the Deputy Prime Minister. On 4th October 1962 the Minister presented to the Parliament the report of the commissioners, and then, to use words that we all understand, all hell broke loose from the Country Party. From that day forth nothing has been too nasty to be said, and under the facade of rural demands for more representation all manner of things have been said in attack on the original intention that would have produced 120 seats in the House of Representatives. Of course, the Standing Orders do not permit me to do so at length, but I mention in passing that on the 29th November 1962 the Minister for the Interior moved for the adoption of the proposal and since then there has been a campaign by members of the Country Party. To the credit of the member for Bradfield ( Mr Turner) he said the Country Party was endeavouring to do what is apparent to everybody by introducing to the Parliament this measure to bring aibout a blatant gerrymander of Federal electorates. Of course, action has not been confined to this Parliament. The Country Party stood over the Victoria Government, and whether we agree with the policies of the Government or not, its members are elected by the people. The terms of Country Party success electoral gerrymander in Victoria. The Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) made his attitude clear. He was not in favour of this proposal being brought to the Parliament, because he was reported on 8th August as saying that the Government had no alternative but to accept the electoral redistribution recommendations of the Electoral Commissioners. He saidThis must be done to remove the function of fixing electoral boundaries from suspicion of gerrymandering. That statement arose out of the enthusiasm to force this legislation before the Parliament. To digress a little, I go back a little earlier to the time when similar proposals were introduced prior to other redistributions. Similar legislation was introduced in",24,Representation Bill 1964

This is what he said about legislation in which no Country Party seats were to be reduced. He was quite adamant when he saidWe have left it to the commissioners to consider these protests, and we accept their decision. How statesmanlike. No Country Party seats disappeared then, so in no circumstances was there any injustice then. Notice the difference when the Parliament is to be reduced from 124 to 120. In 1955 the then member for New England, Mr sioners did under their terms of reference could not Drurnmond saidI cannot recall that I have ever appealed against operate needs changing, would be an argument a decision of the umpire. How great are the traditions of the Country Party when its interests are not affected. Of course, at that time the Deputy Prime Minister did not see fit to speak on the proposals, nor did the Prime Minister. Because the Labour Party was being adversely affected by the redistribution of seats there was no sympathy or call for electoral justice. If we study the history right through, the pattern behind the legislation is apparent. The Deputy Prime Minister went almost berserk when it was decided in 1962 to reduce the size of the Parliament. From one end of Austraha to the other we saw newspaper headSeats Plan"", which appeared in the Melbourne "" Age"" of 17th November in that year. That newspaper reported as followstonight it was "" crazy"" and "" cock-eyed'"" that Queensland should have its representation reduoed in the Federal Parliament under the recent redistribution. At that time he was attacking the scheme to reduce the number of seats to 120. Under the heading, "" Attack on Redistribution Dismays Government"", the ""Sydney Morning Herald"" of 20th November 1962, statedThe slight hopes that the Liberal Party may have had that its coalition partner, the Country Party, would accept the current proposals for redistribution of electoral boundaries, were dashed by the outspoken attack by the C.P. Brisbane on Friday. All over the country Press reports like this were appearing. When the legislation was introduced to give effect to the proposal the then Minister for the Interior did what I have done today-h e traced the history of the proposals and referred to the impartiality of the Commissioners and how they had done their work honestly and impartially. Then he saidAt the very least one would have thought that the objections on the wider grounds should have been taken before the Commissioners embarked on their task, when it became obvious, after the tabling in this House of the Chief Electoral Officer's Certificate on 22nd February, that a redistribution on the existing system was imminent. To await the outcome of a redistribution and then to say in effect that whatever the Commisbe right because legislation under which they that could lead the public to feel that, like the fox in the fable, the individual advancing it had suddenly found that the grapes were sour. If the legislation were necessary, the former Minister for the Interior was quite right in saying that objection should have been taken when it was first proposed to reduce the number of members of 120. However, what the Country Party thought and what the hopeful Liberals thought at that time was that there would be three or four fewer Labour seats and that their parties would not be affected. The truth was that Labour did lose a number of seats and the sympathy of the Deputy Prime Minister for the Labour Party almost makes me laugh now. When the proposals of the Commissioners came before the Parliament, on 4th December 1962, the Deputy Prime Minister saidThe Australian Country Party manifestly is concerned with the protection and betterment of rural society. The rural voice in the Parliament is only as strong as the numerical strength of its representation in the Parliament When I speak of the rural voice I make clear that I am not referring only to the rural voice as expressed through the lips of an elected Country Party representative. I make it clear that I am referring to the rural voice as expressed through the lips of whatever member representing whatever party the electors choose to send to the Parhament Historically, rural electors have chosen to send to the ParUament representatives from all of the great parties. He went on to sayI make it clear that my party-the Country Party-is the only political party which has been created exclusively for the purpose, primarily, of",25,Representation Bill 1964

It is all very well for honourable memin the great export industries-ar e sufficiently expressed in the Parliament. I tell this Parliament that that is downright rot, and I will tell honourable members why. In this ParUament today there are 21 Labour members representing country seats, 16 Liberal members representing country seats and 20 Country Party members representing country seats. For every Country Party member in this Parliament representing a rural district there are almost two representatives from the Liberal and Labour Parties. The largest country party-wit h a small "" c ""-in this Parliament is the Australian Labour Party with 21 members representing rural seats, so what humbug the Deputy Prime Minister talks. Let us refer further to what he said. He went on to sayI repeat that I am not harping on the Country Party; I am speaking of rural seats generally. He said that he did not care then where members came from, he was speaking in the interests of all parties. What the Leader of the Country Party wants us to believe when he supports this legislation is that his intention is solely directed to helping all parties with members from rural electorates. I ask this question seriously: Can anyone imagine the Deputy Prime Minister doing anything in a redistribution proposal that would help the Labour Party gain office? The purpose of his whole campaign is to see that the electorates are gerrymandered by the Country Party. He can try to hide behind this facade, but this is quite apparent. The Prime Minister in 1962, of course, did tell the honourable member for Moreton( Mr KiUen) that the boundaries had to be accepted. I must say here that I thought he made a sound contribution that day in the"" Parliament on that question. This is what he saidWe also decided, having discharged that function, that as there is no issue of governinent policy going to be subordinated to CP. demands. McEwen which arises in relation to the report of independent commissioners appointed under statute, we would not seek to impair the normal rights of any member, in such circumstances, to a free opinion and the free expression of that opinion in the normal way. I have seen the right honourable gentleman allowing these free expressions of opinion. I have seen the Minister for Labour and ing a member of the Liberal Party of Australia with fisticuffs in this chamber on this bers opposite to say that they can have a free vote on redistribution. Every member of the Parliament knows that the Government, judged on its attitude to the 1955 proposals, had a responsibility, whether or not it agreed with the redistribution findings, to support independent commissioners who had been appointed under a statute of this Parliament and whose reports were rejected, for the first time since I have been a member of this place, at the dictates of the Australian Country Party, the members of wbich sit in the corner opposite. Blatantly and without principle, they decided on that occasion that they would not support the proposals of the independent commissioners. Let us consider the attitude of the Australian Country Party towards the distribution proposals. On 8th December 1963, the "" Daily Telegraph"", under the heading, ""CP. Criticises 'Silence' of Liberal M.P.'s "", reportedLiberal parliamentarians' inactivity in the redistribution debate was "" inexplicable "", the Chairman of the NJS.W. Country Party, Mr J. B. FuUer, said today. Here is another newspaper report. Under the heading, "" New Plan on Federal Boundary Changes Aims at C.P. Consent"", it states-A new plan for electoral redistribution, aimed at winning Country Party consent to boundary changes, provides for raising the effective voting seats in the House of Representatives from 122 to 124. This is not the policy of the Liberal Party of Australia. It is the policy of the Country Party and it was enforced at the point of the political gun, because, at the time, the Government had a majority of only one. On 7th April 1963 the ""Sun-Herald"" reportedIt looks as if Liberal scruples and interests are has served notice that any new plan will have to be good. I put these facts on record because the people are entitled to know that tiie Deputy Prime Minister is party to a proposed electoral gerrymander that is unequaUed in the history of our time. The ""Canberra Times"" of 25th July 1962, pubUshed the headline, ""Country Lost Vote Power, Says McEwen"". Of course",26,Representation Bill 1964
80,National Service ( Mr Mcmahon) Threaten,"country areas must lose voting power, because population is drifting to the cities. That is not surprising when one sees the kind of representation that country people are given in this Parliament by members of the Australian Country Party. Members of the Country Party in this Parliament talk about decentralisation but have done nothing about it in all the years that that party has been represented here. The"" Sydney Morning Herald"" of 28th March 1963 pubhshed the headline, "" C.P. Stands Firm on Boundaries."" There is no doubt about whose redistribution this is. Everybody knows that the Country Party wants one vote in the country areas to be worth three in the cities. They intend to instruct the commissioners accordingly. I understand that, as a first step, a special study has been made of the methods adopted by Sir Thomas Playford in South Austraha in an endeavour to keep in office for all time in this Parliament a Liberal-Country Party Government, no matter what means have to be adopted. The ""Daily Telegraph"", on 3rd April 1963, published a report under the heading, "" Public kept * in the dark '"" , in these termsday called for new legislation on electoral redistribution. Why was he silent in 1955? Why was he made, the ""Sydney Morning Herald"", on so silent in earlier days?

Is he trying to tell the people that they should put the Labour Party into office? One would have to be a hillbilly to believe that that was what he was trying to say. In 1955, the Deputy Prime Minister agreed to accept the referee's decision, but today he puts those high principles behind him. He turns his back on the principles that he held then and he is prepared now to look after the interests of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. It is always handy to keep reports like those that I have been reading. They are enlightening to members of the Liberal Party and the Country Party as well as to us on this side of the House. A newspaper report appeared on 3rd April 1963 under the heading, ""Strong McEwen Attack on Redistribution "". It statedLiberal Parly hopes that an early solution might be found to the problem facing the Government on redistribution faded today because of an outspoken speech by the Country Party Leader and of the Victorian Country Party, described last year's redistribution proposals as ""quite incredible "", the kindest word he could apply. He said the Country Party wanted "" electoral sanity "". Apparently, electoral sanity means the election of a majority of Country Party members, if we correctly follow the pattern of thinking of the Deputy Prime Minister. Time will not permit me to read all these newspaper reports, Mr Deputy Speaker. I should very much like, however, to have them all on record in "" Hansard"" to show the political and electoral blackmail that has been practised by honourable members who belong to the Australian Country Party. On 25th February 1964, on the occasion of the opening of the Parliament, the Governor General delivered a Speech which contained the following statementRegarding the Electoral Act, my Government will introduce amending legislation to make it clear that, in making any proposed distribution of a State into divisions for electoral purposes, the Distribution Commissioners shall take into account community of economic, social and regional interests, difficulties of communication, remoteness or distance, the trend of population changes, physical features, and the relative areas of proposed divisions. No fixed quota differential is proposed. F.12500/64 -fi -[95 ] That is the basis of the nieasure at present before us. Mr Deputy Speaker. All that the honourable gentleman is now saying is quite plainly out of order. It relates to another bill and therefore cannot relate to this Bill. I suggest that he is completely out of order in debating something relating to another nieasure while the present Bill is under consideration. He will have plenty of opportunity to debate those other matters when another bill comes before the Parliament next year. The terms of the amendment proposed by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) make it quite plain that this Bill should be considered in conjunction with anothei measure which, until the present Bill was introduced, has always been referred to in the same terms. This measure is part of the same pattern. The present Bill will remain dormant until the other measure is brought in and disposed of. It is quite clear that if the Bill now before us is to be properly debated it must be discussed in conjunction with the terms of the other measure, because the prescnt Bill is part of the pattern that was presented by the Government in the policy speech of the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) during the last Federal general election campaign, and in the Governor General's Speech at the opening of the Parliament, in which proposed legislation was detailed. This is the way in which the Minister for the Interior( Mr Anthony), who introduced this Bill, has dealt with the subject in all the subsequent questions which he has been asked about it. I submit that we cannot deal with this Bill for the first time in isolation. The amendment which was proposed by my Leader and which I have seconded makes it still more clear that it is necessary to consider the foreshadowed measure if one is to discuss the amendment properly. I wish to speak to the point of order. I suport the honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr Turner).

I want to advise the honourable member for Grayndler and any subsequent speaker on this Bill that I will not allow a full debate of any anticipated legislative proposals dealing with redistribution.

I was happy with your decision earlier, not that it was correct but because honourable members opposite wanted to stop me from speaking. The Minister for Primary Industry is touchy. He should remember 1955 and accept the referee's decision. The honourable member for Bradfield is as silent as the grave today. He is one of those rebels who fights here as long as he does not have to stand up and be counted. On a former occasion he described the proposals contained in this legislation as a blatant gerrymander through the back door and nothing else.

According to officialfigures,55 per cent, of the population in 1960 lived in the capital cities as against 51 per cent, in 1947. This shows a trend. In the last Federal elections the Liberal Party polled 2,045,571 votes, the Country Party 489,498 and the Labour Party 2,507,168. The Liberal Party won 52 seats, the Country Party 20 and Labour won 52 seats. Of the formal votes 37.14 per cent, went to the Liberals and a miserable 8.89 per cent, to the Country Party, and the Labour Party received 45.52. remind the honourable member that he is getting close to the point when I may have to stop him from speaking. I would like the honourable member to confine his remarks to the Bill and to the amendment. the last elections Labour polled five votes for every one polled by the Country Party and the Liberals polled four votes for every one polled by the Country Party. The Country Party wants more representatives in this Parliament from rural areas despite the fact that Labour polls five times and the Liberal Party four times as many votes as the Country Party. Notwithstanding that fact the Labour Party has only two and a half times as many members in this Parliament as the Country Party. These facts destroy completely the theory put forward by the Country Party that Labour as a party is discriminating against country entitled to greater representation.

Today the Country Party is blatantly telling the world that this will be a Country Party redistribution loaded against all other parties but particularly the Labour Party. In the political sense the Deputy Prime Minister has stood over the Prime Minister and the Government and in exchange for Country Party support has demanded that the Government bring down this legislation. Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you for your tolerance despite the fact that some honourable members have tried to upset you. I have, despite interruptions, recorded the history of this legislation. It is a story of intrigue and electoral blackmail by the political bushrangers of the Country Party. It is a roundup and a retreat on the part of the Liberals. It is the first move in the implementation of a blatant gerrymander of Federal electorates. not need the honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Daly) or any other honourable member to speak for me. I am perfectly capable of speaking for myself and expressing myself, I hope, with the utmost clarity. What does this Bill do? In determining the number of members that may represent a State in the House of Representatives the Constitution lays down a formula. Under that formula a State, depending on its population, is entitled to a certain number of members which may include a fraction. As the law stands at present, if that fraction is less than one half that State does not get an additional member. If the fraction is greater than one half the State gets an additional member. Under the existing legislation a State such as New South Wales or Western Australia may lose a member despite the fact that its population has increased. The legislation now before the House is designed to prevent this situation .from occurring and to ensure that whenever there is a fraction, no matter whether it is less or greater than one half, the State tions of the Constitutional Review Comshall have an additional member. This is all that the Bill proposes. The Opposition has very cleverly introduced an amendment. I must congratulate thc Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr cent, is adequate for all normal purposes. Whitlam), who must have had a hand in -framing the amendment. He is a most astute -lawyer, but I do not think the people of this country are looking for leaders who are merely astute. What is the amendment? The amendment isThat all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place thereof:"" this House is of opinion that a decision on the proposal contained in the Bill should be deferred until the Government introduces other electoral legislation announced in the Governor General's Opening Speech "". Mr Deputy Speaker, I hope that you will consider further whether the amendment is permissible. If an amendment of this kind is permissible in respect of any Bill coming before the House, clearly it can throw the debate wide open. If the Bill before the House happened to concern arbitration, no matter what that Bill proposed, an amendment of this kind could open up the whole field of arbitration for discussion. I do not believe that this is in accordance with the principles and forms of the House. I believe that the amendment is not the kind of amendment that is in accordance with the usual procedures of the House. However, I did not rise to make technical points; I am not like the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in that regard. He may make as many technical points as he wishes. The people of this country do not want as leaders people who are merely clever and astute; they want people of character. They do not want the honourable member. However, I did not rise to be legalistic. I rose to say something. I have no objection whatever to the Bill and I do not believe any honourable member or any member of the public has any objection to it. Quite clearly it is absurd that under the existing formula, although the population of a State has increased, that State should have one member fewer than it had before. This is so patently absurd that I do not believe anybody will quarrel with the purpose of the Bill. But, because the debate has strayed a long way from what I believe to be the purpose and intention of the BillI wish to make my position perfectly clear. I agree broadly with the recommendamittee. In particular, I agree with the recommendation that the principle of one vote one. value sbould not be departed from. I also agree that a margin of 10 per There may be perhaps half a dozen seats, such as Kalgoorlie, Darling, Kennedy and Maranoa, in which the margin should be somewhat larger, but, in general, I agree",30,Representation Bill 1964
103,Mr Turner (Bradfield) [12.11],"I dowith the recommendation of the Constiti tional Review Committee that 10 per cent, is sufficient. Indeed, when the major legislation comes before the House, I hope to be in a position to move an amendment in accordance with the recommendation of that Committee, with a proviso relating to exceptionally large electorates like Kalgoorlie and the others I have mentioned. I am entirely in favour of the principle of one vote one value, and, when the relevant Bill comes before this House in the next sessional period, I shall support that principle with my voice, and with my vote. There can never be any question about that. I have expressed this view in the past, and I adhere to what I have said.

Nothing will be done pursuant to this Bill until the companion bill is passed. They should be considered together. Only in the last couple of weeks has there been any suggestion that this Bill would be introduced at any time other than the dme of introduction of the proposed amendments to thc Commonwealth Electoral Act. It will be remembered that last November the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) said in his policy speech that there would be amendments to both Bills, and the Governor General, in the Speech he delivered when opening the Parliament on 25th February last spoke thusMy Government will submit amendments to the Representation Act and to the Electoral Act. Under the current provisions of the Representation Act, the Chief Electoral Officer, in determining the number of mcmbers each State shall have in the House of Representatives, is required to find that where, after dividing the State population by the electoral quota, there is a remainder equal to less than one half of the quota, no member shall be chosen in respect of that remainder. In a situation where State populations are growing at different rates, this requirement can have the effect that some States may lose representation, despite a general growth. My Government considers that, in such circumstances, there should be no loss of representation, and proposes to legislate accordingly; member oppose that? this Bill should not be taken in isolation. HouseI propose to read the companion piece from brought into the House within a year. the Governor General's Speech. debate it. at the moment, Mr Deputy Speaker. anticipating it, because the honourable member said he was going to read that part of the Speech. I wanted to remind the honourable member that we cannot have this part of it debated. in mind the amendment, this is the other electoral legislation announced in the Governor General's Speech. But we arc dealing with the Bill before the House. We have already discussed the matter and the Chair has already expressed an opinion as to how the debate should proceed. I wanted to remind the honourable member that so long as he understands the position and complies with the requirements he will be in order. proceededRegarding the Electoral Act, my Government will introduce amending legislation to make it clear that, in making any proposed distribution of a State into divisions for electoral purposes, the Distribution Commissioners shall take into account community of economic, social and regional interests, difficulties of communication, remoteness or distance, the trend of population changes, physical features, and the relative areas of proposed divisions. No fixed quota differential is proposed. On 4th March the Minister for the Interior was asked by the honourable member for Banks( Mr Costa) when legislation could be expected on this subject. The Minister replied. . . the honourable member . . . may rest assured that it will be within a year. On 16th April the honourable member for Lang( Mr Stewart) asked the MinisterWhat progress has been made in the proposed alterations to the Commonwealth Electoral Act and the Representation Act to enable the agreement between the Liberal Party and the Australian Country Party for a gerrymander of electoral boundaries to be put into effect? Will the legislation be introduced by the end of this year? The Minister repliedWhenI first answered this question in the I said that I thought something would be Again on 2nd September the honourable he proposed to bring in the legislation, and the Minister repliedI have nothing to add to the answer that I gave to a question asked by the honourable member in the first sessional period earlier this year, when I said that legislation to amend the Representation Act and the Electoral Act would be introduced within a year from that time. Everything that has been said by the Government on the hustings, by the Governor General on behalf of the Government, and by the Minister for the Interior who is responsible for both Acts has been on the basis that both bills would be brought in together. These are companion pieces of legislation, and the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) and seconded by me would ensure that they",32,Representation Bill 1964

117,Mr Whitlam,"The Governor-Generalwere dealt with together, as was foreshadowed in the election campaign and in the announcement of the legislative programme and as was implied in answers to questions. No other interpretation is available from all that we have previously heard on this subject than that the bills would be brought in together. One would have to be a very astute lawyer to distinguish between the timetables for the two bills. If the companion piece of legislation, the Commonwealth Electoral Bill, is not to come in, then we can put this Bill through immediately. If it is to he brought in it should be considered conjointly with this Bill. We have moved that this Bill be deferred until the other one can be considered conjointly with it. As my colleague the honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Daly) has pointed out, they are being brought in separated to disguise the difference of opinion between the Country Party and the Liberal Party on this subject. The Minister himself, when speaking on this matter outside the House, has quite obviously had both bills in mind. Let me quote from his family newspaper, the Murwillumbah "" Daily News "", of 15th JuneThe Minister for the Interior, Mr J. D. Anthony, tralia if the Government had put the told a Country Party dinner at Murwillumbah thai, in carrying out the proposed redistribution of Federal seats, he would make sure fewer people were required to elect representatives in country areas than in the cities. He said Australia's electoral system was the finest in the world, but lacked Opposition has had a motion on this sublerritoral representation. Representation now was based on population, not area, with the result that power in Parliament was confined to the heavily populated areas. There was not enough development in the inland and northern areas as the tendency was to develop Australia's thickly populated eastern seaboard. Mr Anthony. . . said the task of electoral reforms was probably one of his worse jobs as Minister for the Interior and one on which bis political future hinged. Outside the House, as in the House, the Minister's constant theme has been that these bills go together and that the House should consider the bills together. The House should determine how many divisions there will be in each State at a time as close as possible to the time when the distribution is to be made, because if the division of States were to be made now and the distribution was made later, then the distribution might automatically be distorted by the number of divisions now determined. These go tQgether. They have always gone together. Why are they being separated now for the first time? The report of the Constitutional Review Committee was brought downfiveyears ago this month. Six years ago last month honourable members were provided with a preUminary number of reasons for all of the Committee's proposals, including the method of dividing the States into divisions and distributing between divisions. If the Committee's recommendations had been put to the people and adopted by them there would have been no need to amend this Bill and any provision under the companion bill for a gerrymander would have been nipped in the bud. I will point out how the recommendationsof the Constitutional Review Committee, if adopted, would have made this Bill unnecessary. The justification for this Bill has been that if these amendments are not made Western Australia, Queensland and New South Wales will each have one fewer member in this House after the next distribution. But there would have been no diminution in numbers of members in this House from Queensland and Western AusConstitutional Review Committee's proposals to the people concerning the counting of Aborigines in the population and had had them accepted. The Leader of the ject on the notice paper since last April. Discussion of it cannot continue unless the Government puts aside the second motion by the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Killen) on fluoridation of the Canberra water supply-o n that matter of course we support the Minister for the Interior and his predecessor. Section 127 of the Constitution readsIn reckoning the numbers of people of the Commonwealth, or of a State or other part of the Commonweallh, aboriginal natives shall not be counted. The Constitutional Review Committee saidApart frcm its statistical significance, the main effect of section 127 of the Constitution is to preclude the aboriginal population of a State from being taken into account when determining the number of members of the House of Representatives to be chosen for the State. Aborigines in all the States now have votes for the House of Representatives, although they are still denied a vote in State elections in Queensland and until recently were denied it in Western Australia. But although they now have votes for the House of Representatives they cannot be counted in the working out of the number of divisions for each State in the House of Representatives. member of Parliament despite the fact that he is not one of the population? lation now permits an Aboriginal to be elected a member of Parliament, but even if the legislation does not, the Parliament ceuld pass a law enabling an Aboriginal to be elected a member of Parliament. If Aborigines could be counted in working out the number of divisions in each State, then Queensland and Western Australia would retain their present numbers. There would be no need to bring in this amendment. The principal Act precludes Aborigines being counted in working out the number of divisions for a State. This is because sections 25 and 127 of the Constitution require that they be excluded. If sections 25 and 127 were removed, then this offensive section of the principal Act could be deleted. On my first point, if the proposals of the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review to replace section 25 and delete section 127 of the Constitution were adopted, then there would be no need for this Bill in ordec to maintain the present numbers for Queensland and Western Australia. Again, the Constitutional Review Committee recommended that the number of mcmbers in this House should no longer be limited to twice the number of members of the Senate and that it should be possible to increase the number of members in this House as long as there was no more lhan one member to every 80,000 persons, on the average, in each electorate. Here again, if this proposal were adopted not only would Western Australia retain its present number of divisions in this House, but every other State on the mainland would have additional divisions in this House. There again, there would have been no need to introduce this Bill. Every State would have retained its present numbers, or even increased them. The third proposal that the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review made concerned the size of the deviation from the quota that could be made in a distribution. The Constitutional Review Committee stated that such a provision was necessary for this reasonThe adoption of a maximum margin of one-tenth would make a very material contribution towards preventing possible manipulation of the divisional structure of a State for political purposes. The Committee further pointed out that it had only ever been necessary in the rarest cases to have a distribution which allowed for a greater deviation than 10 per cent. At the last distribution in 1955 only three divisions, Darling, Kennedy and Kalgoorlie deviated from the quota by more than 10 per cent. In every other case, it was possible to make a distribution within that amount. In most cases, the deviation was less than 5 per cent. The joint Committee on Constitutional Review reportedIn the preparation of a proposed redistribution of a State, the Distribution Commissioners enjoy substantial discretion so that they might achieve the most equitable results possible. They are required to pay regard to the considerations laid down in section 19 of the Act which include community or diversity of interest, means of communication and physical features. But, in the opinion of the Committee, it is quite unrealistic to imagine that in electorates covering more than 100,000 square miles, the reduction of the permissible margin from one-fifth to one-tenth will produce any vastly different results. Community of interest and the other factors mentioned in section 19 can mean a great deal in drawing the boundaries of divisions of small areas, but they become rather unreal in the determination of the boundaries of the mammoth divisions which exist in four States. It is the Committee's view that each division can be fitted into a marginal allowance of one-tenth without frustration of the purposes of section 19. The same legal considerations have applied to the last three redistributions, but the assessed enrolment of Kalgoorlie, Darling and Kennedy, for purposes of the redistribution in 1937, was, in each case, considerably greater than the quota determined for each of the States concerned for purposes of the redistributions in 1948 and 19SS. A steady increase in the population of the undeveloped areas of Australia, accompanied by an increase in the number of members of the House of Representatives to meet the requirements of a general increase in population, is needed to make possible a substantial reduction in the size of the large divisions in Australia. I reiterate that in the unanimous opinion of the members of the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review, which comprised members of the Labour, Liberal and Country Parties, the best way to see that",33,Representation Bill 1964
118,Mr Cope,Can any Aboriginal be a,35,Representation Bill 1964
119,Mr Whitlam,"Yes. I think our legisthere was more adequate representation for the sparsely settled parts of Australia is to increase the number of members in the House of Representatives. You do not increase the representation in this Parliament significantly by gerrymandering the present number of members. More divisions are required. The only way under the present Constitution that we can have more divisions for election to this House is to increase the number of members of the Senate by another 24, as happened in 1949. The reason for this is that there must be even numbers in the Senate from each State if half the senators are to retire at each election. If however, there were only eight or twelve senators from each State, then every election would return equal numbers of Government and Opposition senators in each State under the proportional system of election, which all parties accept for the Senate. It would then be inevitable that the Senate would always be deadlocked. The result of that would be that little legislation could ever be passed by the Senate or the Parliament. The consequence is that if we are to increase the number of members in this House under the Constitution as it stands, we have to increase the number of members in the Senate by 24, so that seven senators would be elected each time in each State and either the Government or the Opposition could obtain a majority of them. If the outback, inland and northern areas of Australia are to be more adequately represented, the only solution is to have more members in the House. The way the Constitution stands at the moment, this can only be done by increasing the number of members in the Senate by 24. Nobody supports that. Senate might. Actually, I think they enjoy the relative exclusiveness of the club. The three matters then, that I have raised, relate to the countthan they are now, just as they all are ing of Aborigines; the standard quota of electors for each division in this house and the number of members in this House, irrespective of the number of senators. These three matters were recommended for attention by the Joint Committee on Constitution Review six years ago. The reasons for the Committee's recommendations were given five years ago. If those recommendations had been put to the people and adopted, then not only would this Bill be unnecessary and the gerrymander contemplated in the companion bill impossible, but also this House would already have a greater number of members, and the outback, inland and northern areas would be more adequately represented. The basis of our Federal compact in Australia is the same as the basis of the Federal compact in the United States of America on whose constitution our own Constitution is based. This basis is that every State should have equal representation in the Senate but that the population should be proportionately represented in the House of Representatives. One might suggest that if we are to develop the inland and the north of Australia, as the Leader of the Country Party suggests will be done by this Bill, then we ought to see that Queensland and Western Australia have as many members as any other State in this House as they have in the Senate. Sitting suspended from 12.45 to 2.15 p.m. suspended I stated that, if the Government had given the people the opportunity to adopt, and if the people had adopted, the recommendations of the Constitutional Review Committee which were made over six years ago and for which full reasons were given five years ago, this Bill would not have been necessary. The Aborigines in Queensland and Western Australia would have been counted and the present number of electoral divisions in those States would have been preserved. There could have been one member in this House for every 80,000 persons in every State of Australia, which would have meant not only that Western Australia would have preserved its present number of members but also that every other mainland State would have had an increased number of members. Furthermore, as a result of Aborigines being counted the most northerly electorates in Australia would have been smaller in area smaller now than they were before the 1949 enlargement of this House. This Bill only postpones the decision on the number of members in this House from the various States. It is impracticable to increase the number of members in this House by increasing the number of senators by 24, which is the increase that would be necessary to make the Senate workable,",35,Representation Bill 1964

122,Mr Whitlam,"Before the sitting wasto preserve it from deadlocks, and to permit lt to pass legislation sent to it from this House. Unless the proposals made by the Constitutional Review Committee are written into the Constitution, there will continue to be fluctuations as between the States in their numbers in this House. After this Bill is passed, there can be no increase in the total number of members in this House; it will remain at 125-fiv e from Tasmania and 120 from the mainland. anything. merely postpones the solution of the problem. It means that as the populations of the States vary, in due course some mainland States will have more of the 120 votes than they have at the moment and some will have fewer. This Bill does not solve the constitutional problem of having in this House proper representation of the Australian people, wherever they live and from whatever racial stock they come. As regards representation in this House, the whole principle for which we strive within each State and within the Commonwealth as a whole, is the principle of one vote one value. We will not tolerate and we will not condone any dilution, under-valuation, debasement or discrimination in representation. Those terms come from decisions of the United States Supreme Court over the last two and a half years. The Minister for the Interior has referred to the case of Baker v. Carr which was decided in March 1962. That was the first in a long line of significant cases decided by the United States Supreme Court. It dealt with distribution in a State legislature. written into the statute book of the ComIn the United States the State legislatures are responsible for distribution not only for the State legislatures themselves but also for the primaries to select candidates for the Federal Congress, and for the distribution of seats in the Federal House of Representatives. In successive cases-Bake r v. Carr, which was decided in March 1962; Gray v. Sanders, which was decided in March 1963; Westberry v. Sanders, which was decided in February this year; and Reynolds v. Sims, which was decided in Tune this year-fh e United States Supreme Court has extended the principle of one vote one value, or men not acres, to every form of representative and elected government in that country. Earlier speakers in this debate have suggested that, if this Bill is passed, there might be a challenge to it in the High Court to decide the question whether this House has, as nearly as practicable, twice the number of members that the Senate has. But I have no doubt that if the companion bill to this BiU-the Commonwealth Electoral BUl-is introduced and passed by this House in the form forecast by the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) a year ago, by the Governor General last February, and by the Minister for the Interior inside and outside the House ever since, it will be challenged in the High Court. The United States Supreme Court has now interpreted sections of the American Constitution, which have been adopted in the AustraUan Constitution, in such a way as to say that the principle of one vote one value is fundamental to representation in the United States House of Representatives. And it is just as fundamental to representation in the Australian House of Representatives. An astute lawyer recently left this House to preside over the High Court of Australia. He would be very greatly extended to distinguish the American cases in their application to the proposed BUl to amend the Commonwealth Electoral Act. But we may not get to that stage. A Senate election will be held before then. The Senate cannot be gerrymandered. In the Senate election which will take place on 5th December the AustraUan people will have their last opportunity to ensure that gerrymanders are not monwealth of Australia as they are written into the statute books of most of the States. If the Australian people vote to safeguard their right to one vote one value, the Senate wiU not pass the companion to this Bill and equal representation in this House will be preserved. -Order!

125,Mr Speaker (Hon. Sir John Mcleay).,,37,Representation Bill 1964
126,Mr Cope (Watson) [2.21],"The Billamendment of section 10 of the Representation Act 1905-1938. The intention is to alter the formula for determining the numbers of members of the several States in the House of Representatives. The Bill, if agreed to, will increase the number of members of the House of Representatives with full voting rights by two-fro m 122 to 124. As the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) has stated, the Opposition does not oppose the intention of this measure, but we do ask for the measure to be deferred to coincide with consideration of the suggested amendments of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. This Bill stems from the attitude of the Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the the Leader of the Opposition in rejecting the redistribution proposals that were submitted in 1962. Those proposals, if accepted, would have reduced the number of members of this House with full voting rights by two, from 122 to 120. New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia would each have lost a seat and Victoria would have gained a seat. The Distribution Commissioners, in determining the numbers of members, must act in conformity with the Representation Act. Therefore, the Distribution Commissioners were not in error in submitting their redistribution proposals in 1962. As most honourable members are aware, section 10 of the Representation Act 1905-1938 conforms with section 24 of the Constitution which reads as followsThe House of Representatives shall be composed of members directly chosen by the people of the Commonwealth, and the number of such members shall be, as nearly as practicable, twice the number East Sydney( Mr Devine) and West Sydney of the senators. The number of members chosen in the several States shall be in proportion to the respective numbers of their people, and shall, until the Parliament otherwise provides, be determined, whenever necessary, in the following manner:(i) A quota shall be ascertained by dividing the number of the people of the Commonwealth, as shown by the latest statistics of the Commonwealth, by twice the number of the senators: (ii) The number of members to be chosen in each State shall be determined by dividing the number of the people of the State, as shown by the latest statistics of the Commonwealth, by the quota; and if on such division there is a remainder greater than one-half of the quota, one more member shall be chosen iri the State. But notwithstanding anything in this section, live members at least shall be chosen in each Original State. All that we seek to do by this amendment is to omit the words ""greater than one-half"". As an illustration of the way in which this would work, on the occasion of the last redistribution proposals Australia's population, according to the 1961 census figures, excluding the population of the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory, was 10,415,654. That figure was divided by 120 which gave a quota of 86,797. The quota was then divided into the individual populations of each State, and if on such a division there was a remainder of greater than one-half of the quota of 86,797 that State was to be entitled to another seat. In numbers of seats by States the result of the division would be: New South Wales 45.13, Victoria 33.76, Queensland 17.44, South Australia 11.14, Western Australia 8.47 and Tasmania 4.04. But as section 24 of the Constitution says that an original State must have at least five members, the 4.04 figure would not be applied to Tasmania. It is quite obvious that one of the greatest anomalies in the Constitution was brought about by the fact that the founding fathers who framed the Constitution did not envisage our great immigration scheme. As a consequence, now, particularly in the industrial areas of Sydney and Melbourne, these are numerous people who are not counted for the purpose of determining electoral quotas. In those areas, particularly in my electorateI know that this applies also to the electorates of colleagues the honourable members for Scullin( Mr Peters), situation that we represent a great number of new Australians, many of whom are eligible for naturalisation; yet we are handicapped by the fact that those persons are not counted when determining the electoral quotas. It was only recently that the Minister for Immigration ( Mr Opperman) told me that he gets probably more case3 from me than he does from any other member relating to new Australians who want to bring their friends or relatives from overseas. To illustrate the situation in which some honourable members are placed, I should like to cite some figures for the division of",37,Representation Bill 1964
127,Australian Country Party ( Mr Mcewen) And,,38,Representation Bill 1964
128,( Mr Minogue),"w e are faced with theWest Sydney. According to tbe last census the population of that electorate exceeded 80,000, but the division had an enrolment of only 35,000. Yet in the electorate of Wentworth the census showed a population of about 62,000, and in that electorate there are 41,000 people on the electoral roll. The House will appreciate from those figures that honourable members who represent industrial areas containing people who are eligible, and some who are not eligible, to be counted in determining a quota, are forced-althoug h we do it willingly-to represent all those people. In that way we are penalised. In reply to a question that I placed on the notice paper recently I received information that at the present time in Australia 250,000 new settlers who are entitled to be naturalised have not yet applied for naturalisation. Included in that number are about 60,000 under the age of 21, which means that 190,000 people in Australia could, if they took the trouble, become naturalised. If they were naturalised this would have a great bearing on the quotas of industrial electorates. The matters to which I have referred are some of the ludicrous features of the system under which we work and which was initiated by the founding fathers of Australia. The Leader of the Opposition referred to pression of their argument was that they section 127 of the Constitution. This is a were saying they should not have to repsubject that cannot be mentioned too often. resent more than about 40,000 people Prior to the suspension of the sitting it was because of the size of the areas that they stated that if Aborigines had been counted represent. They said that they would as pan of the population there might very accept 40,000 people as being a reasonwell have been no need for this amendment able number for each Country Party to the Representation Bill because a seat member to represent. would have been retained in Western Australia, just as one would have been retained in Queensland. Including Torres Strait Islanders, Queensland has approximately 18,000 Aboriginal people. In addition, satisfied if every member of the House there are approximately 6,000 Aborepresented only 40,000 people? That is a rigines in Western Australia, and South point that we must have explained to us. Australia has 4,000 to 5,000. If the Do those honourable members want less Aborigines had been counted Queenspeople in each country electorate and more land would have needed a population people in each city electorate? At the time of only 4,000 more to have retained its 18th of the last redistribution proposals, of the seat. Western Australia, with an additional 45 seats in New South Wales no fewer than population of a little more than 2,000, would 23 were in the metropolitan area. There have retained its 9th seat. But then we come were 22 extra-metropolitan seats, that is, to the impossible and ludicrous position seats in areas outside Sydney. I believe where a person who is not counted as one of that that number gave a fair and adequate the population could sit in this chamber as representation to people outside the metroa member of the House of Representatives. politan area, for they were represented by He could even become a Minister of the Crown and still not be counted as one of the population. Such a situation is quite possible. Honourable members may tbink that it is not probable, but the situation is possible in future years. Matters such as this must be rectified if we are to make our system work as it should work. The Australian Labour Party has never, at any stage in its history, suggested that people in rural areas should not have proper and just representation in this House. That is evidenced by the fact that the Chifley Government in 1949 took the action that increased the number of members of the House of Representatives from 72 to 120 and the number of senators from 36 to 60, which meant that people in rural areas had much greater representation. People jn those areas have much greater representation today than they had in former years. I expect that redistribution proposals will be introduced next year. PerhapsI am getting a little wide of the Bill in referring to this subject which would be relevant in a debate on the Electoral Act, but other honourable members have referred to the subject so I crave your indulgence, Mr Speaker, to refer to it briefly also. Members of the Country Party have referred to the permissible margin, which is now 20 per cent., on either side of the quota. My imIf the Constitution were amended by referendum 1 , would the Country Party be 22 members of the 45. Nothing could be fairer than that. I am a stickler for the principle of one vote one value. That is the only possible way to exercise a true vote in any community. This is just another matter tion in the bill that will be brought before from the facts. I have never known a us at some time in the future in regard to minority vote to be adopted by a meeting; electoral matters. But the point about it is but this is happening in South Australia that one vote one value is a true principle and in Queensland. We do not want this of democracy. Arguments have been raised system introduced in the Federal sphere about the gerrymanders in Queensland and and we must be careful to see that it is what has happened because of gerrymannot. ders in South Australia. I am not concerned about who was responsible for what happened. The only thing I am concerned about is that one vote one value is the only enrolment figures, the average quotas for true principle of democracy. It would be each State on the basis of 124 members absolutely fantastic for any Australian to and the average quotas on the basis of go to a parliamentary conference overseas, 120 members. This is interesting and or to any other conference, and advocate gives a sound reason for everyone to supgreat principles of democracy while we had port the Bill. The table shows the difference a minority party in control in Australia. in the quota when we take 120 members Delegates from other countries would just and when we take 124 members.

AlthoughI support the Bill in its entirety, I think that its validity could be challenged in a court. Section 24 of the Constitution lays down specifically that the House of Representatives shall be as nearly as practicable twice the size of the Senate. It is quite definite; in this context the word "" shall"" has only one meaning. The provision is mandatory; it must bc observed. If we increase the size of the House of Representatives without increasing the size of the Senate, and this is what we do when we amend the Representation Act, the question arises as to whether the House of Representadves is as nearly as practicable twice the size of the Senate. It is very doubtful whether the Bill would stand if its validity were challenged in a court of law. However, despite this doubt, I support the Bill in its entirety. for the Interior) [2.39] I want to refer to some of the matters that have been raised, but I do not want to taketoomuch of the time of the House. I am glad that the Bill has the complete support of the House. It makes a meagre increase in the number of members of the House of Representatives and I think that everybody will agree that an increase in numbers is justified. The constitutional provision makes it very difficult to effect an increase in the size of the House of Representatives without substantially increasing the size of the Senate. I want to refer to the amendment moved by fhe Opposition. It is in two parts. First, it requires that the Bill be deferred and introduced later with a bill amending the Commonwealth Electoral Act. Secondly, it Members Enrolment Quota Permissible Permissible Maximum Minimum 45 2,223,725 49,417 59,301 39,533 34 1,650,042 48,351 58,021 38,681 17 852,512 50,148 60,178 40,118 11 550,303 50,028 60,034 40,022 8 410,984 51,362 61,635 41,089 5 195,843 39,169 47,003 31,335 asks the Government to refrain from doing anything about the Representation Act until after the holding of a referendum concerning the nexus between the House of Representatives and the Senate and also concerning section 127 of the Constitution. It is not true that bills amending the Representation Act and the Commonwealth Electoral Act have always been introduced together. On occasions, a Bill amending the Representation Act has been brought in by itself. Not many amendments have been made to the Representation Act since it was originally introduced in 1905. It was amended in 1905 and in 1938 and on both those occasions the amending Bill was introduced without a Bill amending the Commonwealth Electoral Act being introduced at the same time. In 1948 and 1949, when the size of the Farliament was increased, Bills amending the two Acts were dealt with together, but these would be two of die few occasions on which this has been done. amendment is that the determination under the Representation Act has been made on the eve of a distribution under the Commonwealth Electoral Act. The number of divisions has been determined under the Representation Act just before the determination is made as to how the divisions will be distributed. always been brought into the House at the same time. The Representation Act has been altered on only a few occasions and on two of those occasions the amending Bill has been brought into the House without an amendment being made to the Commonwealth Electoral Act at the same time. Therefore, there is nothing peculiar in our dealing with this Bill by itself. I would",40,Representation Bill 1964
137,Mr Anthony (Richmond,Minister,41,Representation Bill 1964
138,Mr Whitlam,What is meant by the,41,Representation Bill 1964
139,Mr Anthony,"Both Bills have notalso point out that the Representation Act and the Commonwealth Electoral Act are two vastly different Acts. The Representation Act is a simple Act which determines the number of members in the House of Representatives. The Commonwealth Electoral Act is a very big Act. It deals with a wide range of subjects including the appointment of Commissioners, the determination of quotas, the order of candidates on ballot papers and voting hours. An amendment to it would justify a lengthy debate and in this sessional period, when time is limited, we have not the opportunity for such a debate. It would be unfair to rush such a big Bill through the House at this stage without giving honourable members a reasonable opportunity to debate it. The second part of the amendment deals with a referendum. If we are to have a re-distribution in the life of this Parliament, we must forget about a referendum related to such a re-distribution. The holding of a referendum and the consequent redistribution would take a long time. I have worked out the time table and I have found that it would be difficult to hold a referendum, to have the necessary Bills passed by the Parliament, to effect a re-displeted in less than two years, and that is tribution, and to print the rolls in less than on a tight schedule. We would be lucky two or three years. I will give a little more detail of this. Let us assume that the decision has been made to hold a referendum on the nexus or on section 127. A Bill must be introduced, debated and passed by both Houses. This takes time. The Bill must be prepared by the draftsman, printed, introduced in the Parliament and debated. The referendum cannot be held within two months or more than six months from the time the Bill has been given the Royal Assent. that suggested by the Leader of the Opposition could have been held at any time since May. It could have been held on 5th December. member for Werriwa has already spoken. in favour of the matter put at the referendum, we must then prepare the necessary Bill to amend the principal Act and that takes time. Then the Electoral Commissioners have to be appointed. It takes at least six to seven months. appointed. the redistribution, and it would take at least six to seven months. The proposals then have to come into the Parliament, have"" to be agreed to by both Houses of the Parliament, have to. receive the Royal Assent, and then the rolls have to be printed. The printing of the rolls takes six months. On a redistribution the rolls cannot be printed in under six months. months? ber says, "" Nonsense "". sense "". I asked who said it takes six months. hear the honourable member correctly. At any rate, I do not think any member would like to go into a new electorate and have to canvass it in less than six months before an election. If there is to be a referendum concerning redistribution, the whole related process cannot be comto get it through in two years. This is a matter for thc Parliament. If it does not want a redistribution in the lifetime of this Parliament, all right; but I think there are strong grounds for a redistribution when some members have over 100,000 electors to represent and other members have as few as 32,000. This is a great variation, so, I say, there is justification for a redistribution. Some speeches from the Opposition were mainly playing politics, and I will disregard their political content. I was very pleased to hear the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) bring the debate on to a higher plane, because this is an important Bill. It is a question of how we are to increase the size of the Parliament, and this is a difncult problem and one to which we should give a lot of thought. The Constitution lays down that the size of the House of Representatives shall be, as near as practicable, twice the size of the Senate, and it is difficult to deviate from that provision.

He quoted a number of cases and said that they dealt with United States Congressmen. I should like to refer to one case, Westberry v. Sanders, which he referred to. This case was heard in February of this year, and it concerned the State of Georgia. It was shown that in this State there was racial discrimination and that there was one electorate which had 858,000 negroes and about 330,000 other electors represented by whites. The court ruled that there should be as near as practicable one vote one value and a new redistribution was carried out under court direction. It showed a variation of 38 per cent, between the outlying cities and the metropolitan cities. That was what they determined as being as near as practicable to one vote one value. I add that just for the interest of the House, because a lot has been said about some of these American Supreme Court cases. Amendment negatived. Original question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee. The Bill. briefly I want to say a few words about thc Bill as a whole. It comprises, as the Minister has stated, four clauses which are very brief but very important in view of what has taken place in the Parliament. I represent many more electors than do those whom this Bill is designed to assistthe members who represent the country interests, so it is said. I thought that a Country Party member might have put the case for the electorates with fewer electors, but not one member of the Country Party, other than the Minister, has spoken. I think it is only fair that we should hear their views for the electors they appear to be so concerned for. Is it not worth some member of the Country Party rising in his place to say why the Country Party wants the discrimination which is incorporated in Sir: Is the honourable member for Grayndler the Bill? 1 think mine is a reasonable in order in continuing this tedious request. Even the Minister did not reply repetition? to the charge of gerrymandering. I can say only that their silence is acquiesence. None can defend the charge that has been made that this Bill is going to direct the commissioners-goo d men though they are-that they must carry out a redistribution to suit certain interests in this Parliament. if they are not interested enough to talk on this measure? Why increase thc number of Country Party members in the Parliament? The 52 members of the Liberal Party of Australia in this Parliament to you, Sir, the proposition that the Bill as a whole is before the Committee and that speakers at this stage are required to discuss the Bill and should not use the time of the Committee in an attempt to deride others. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Mackinnon) -Order! I suggest that the honourable member for Grayndler connne his remarks to the Bill. fhe Biil, Sir. I ask whether any member of the Country Party individually, or whether members of that Party collectively, have any views about clause 1, clause 2, clause 3 or clause 4. If the Bill is as justified as the Minister has stated, surely he or some other member of the Party to which he belongs' should now rise and tell us why these changes in the Representation Act are necessary. However, I do not direct my remarks only to members of the Country Party. There are 52 members of the Liberal Party on the opposite side of the chamber who apparently have no views on this political brigandry that is being practised by the Country Party in relation to the distribution of electoral boundaries.

173,Mr Speaker (Hon. Sir John Mcleay).,"yesterday, and I wish to make a personal explanation about the misrepresentation. I claim that, yesterday, the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Maicoim' Fraser), deaUng with something that I had said on an earlier occasion, quoted a statement entirely different from the one that I had quoted, and in so doing misrepresented me. The statement by the honourable member that I claim to have been a misrepresentation of my remarks appears at page 2493 of "" Hansard"" of this House and is in these terms. . . the honourable member for Yarra has amendment made by the House of repeated his conclusions that no outside military support is being offered in South Vietnam Representatives to this Bill. That statement taken by the honourable member for Wannon is in contrast with the statement that he made earlier, which is reported at pages 2492 and 2493 of "" Hansard"", and which he alleged was a fair statement of my speech on 21st October, which is reported at page 2165 of "" Hansard"". An examination of my speech will show that the statement made by the honourable member for Wannon and reported at page 2493 is a misrepresentation. The honourable member said that I had said that no outside military support is being offered. Reference to page 2165 shows that I saidI think the evidence shows that revolutionary wars are mainly indigenous-internal . Examples of this type of war are those in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, I have examined the evidence of this over a period of years and as far as I have been able to discover there is no evidence whatever of any material assistance coming from outside Vietnam-fro m any country outside that area. Well over 90 per cent, of what is done there is determined internally. That is clearly not everything. It allows some 10 per cent, or so for outside interference. I further saidThe feature of this, as I have suggested, is that there has not been significant outside interference. Opposition supports the Bill. We believe Again consistent with no material interference. FinallyI saidFor instance, far more weapons have been delivered to Indonesia by the United States of America, the Soviet Union and Great Britain than ever have been given to the Vietcong in South Vietnam. That speech clearly shows that I was well aware that some weapons had been given to the Vietcong. It is completely consistent with my statement that no material assistance had come from outside and is completely contrary to the statement made by the honourable member for Wannon that I said no outside military support is being offered to the Vietcong.

We believe that it is well within the capacity of air operators to pay the charges out of the profits which they make from air operations. It should not be necessary for air",46,Personal Explanation
174,Mr Whitlam (Werriwa) [3.8],"Th eoperators to increase air fares, as they have, in order to pay the increased charges imposed by the Bill. It is well known tiiat air fares have gone up in recent years because Ansett Transport Industries Ltd. has to carry out many functions other than that of air transport. Trans-Australia Airlines has this Bill is not nearly equal to the increases had to increase its air fares in recent years because the Government compels it to match the fares charged by Ansett-A.N.A. The Government allows Ansett-A.N.A. to put up its fares because the Government's arrangements with Ansett Transport Industries-that is with all the operations of that company, not just air transport-ar e such as to ensure that a 10 per cent, dividend is given to shareholders in the parent company. Therefore I say there is no question that the air operators could pay these increased charges. They would not even have to increase air fares in order to do so. It is also well within the capacity of air travellers to pay the increased air fares. Air travellers more than any other travellers travel on expense accounts or on Government warrants. This is very much more so in the case of air travel than in the case of travel by rail, sea, road or metropolitan public transport. Air travellers are well able to make this increased contribution insofar as air fares have been increased ostensibly to meet it. It may be that air operators and air travellers could make a bigger contribution than they now do to the Government expenses in this field. It is idle for us to consider this aspect. For 10 years the Government has undertaken not to put up air navigation charges more than 10 per cent a year. The Government agreed to do this as a result of instructions given before the 1961 elections by Mr R. M. Ansett in the letter he sent to all honourable members and which he boldly proclaimed for all the world to read in full page advertisements taken in the newspapers. Mr such as Australia, shipping also has a great R. M. Ansett's letter became the Draftsman's instructions for the Airlines Agree? ments Act 1961. Accordingly, even if air operators and air travellers could or should pay more towards the cost of government installations in thisfieldit is no longer possible to make them do so. The Government has agreed not to increase the amounts by more than 10 per cent, a year. And the Government has bound its successors in this matter. The increase in charges being made by in expenses being met by the Governnient in civil aviation. Between 1960-61 and last financial year the Commonwealth's expenditure on air navigation purposes of all kinds increased from £14,900,000 to £18,300,000. Between the same years the Government's revenue from air navigation charges increased from £1 million to £1,870,000. Accordingly, the expenditures by Governments increased by £3,400,000; the increase in contributions by air operators increased by £870,000. Nor is the position greatly improving. The increase last year over the year before was £1,600,000 in Government expenditures and £370,000 in operators' contributions. It will be seen that the net cost last year to the Commonwealth for all air navigation purposes was £16,400,000. The number of passengers embarked was 3,400,000. It will thus be seen that every passenger was Subsidised by the Commonwealth by £4 16s. every time he entered an aircraft in Australia. This is far and away the largest subsidy that Australian Governments give to any form of transport. It becomes all the more conspicuous in these days when reference is being made by the Commonwealth and, indeed, by some State Governments to coordination of transport services. The Commonwealth has never in fact interested itself in the co-ordination of transport services in general. It has not concerned itself with any calculation of the relative merits of the different types of transport and how the prices charged should relate to one another. But it has frequently said that it is necessary for the Commonwealth to subsidise air transport because of its defence and developmental value. The railways bave a defence and developmental value; ports have a defence and developmental value, and, for a trading country developmental value. Because of our general isolation and numbers, and because of the absence of an overseas shipping line and of contemporary naval vessels, we would clearly have to depend mostly on other countries for shipping in time of defence need. I shall content myself with a comparison, since it is readily available to honourable members, with the costs ofrailway operations. I shall quote from the latest report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission. The report indicates at page 114 that in 1962-63 the net operating surplus of the six State railway systems in Australia was £10,345,000. New South Wales showed an operating profit of £12,067,000 and Victoria showed an operating profit of £78,000. The other States all showed operating losses. At page 115, the Commissioners show the financial results for the State railway systems after including payments for interest, sinking fund and exchange on capital chargeable to railway accounts, but excluding debt charges from which the railways have been relieved. They show that the net loss-to put it that way-o n the six State railway systems for 1962-63 was £15,436,000. The New South Wales raUways, which had, an operating profit of £12,067,000 ended up in the overall financial result with a loss of £1,572,000. The Victorian railways have been relieved of all debt charges with regard to funds from State sources, but not with regard to funds from Commonwealth sources. If their charges with respect to funds from State sources had been included, then fheir overall financial result would have been a loss of about £8 million. I draw the contrast between the State railways of Australia which had a loss in 1962-63 of £15,436,000, or, if one includes the Victorian loss charged to the overall budget in that State, about £23 million, and the amount which the Commonwealth contributed last year to air travel, which was £16,400,000, or £4 16s. for every passenger who took off in an aircraft. It is quite clear that no assessment is made of the relative roles to be performed by rail and air transport in Australia. At the present time no assessment is made of the relative contributions which these two forms of transport make to overall development or defence. It is not possible for another seven years, as the Minister has reminded me, to review the relative contributions which air operators and air travellers can make to this particular form of transport which the Commonwealth subsidises so highly-whic h is subsidised more per person and more pcr ton than all the other forms of transport in Australia combined. Air transport caters for fewer people and carries less freight than any other form of transport in Australia; but the Commonwealth Government pays more towards it than aU governments pay towards aU other forms of transport in Australiaroad, rail, wharf and shipping. The Opposition supports the Bill as far as it goes. No person in this Parliament, or the next Parliament or the Parliament after that, can really do anything about proper air navigation charges in Australia because our hands have been tied by the 1961 legislation. This is the best that anybody who is elected to this Parliament or the next two Parliaments can do on this subject. Therefore, we support the Bill as far as it goes. Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) I reluctantly support the legislation befpre the House. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has pointed out, the Air Navigation charges being levied on airlines today are completely inadequate. Clearly the Government has no desire to impose anything but a nominal charge for the use of such costly installations as navigational aids and runways. I agree that airstrips and runways are essential to defence and that, in the event of this nation becoming involved in a war, these runways, in the main, would be taken over by the Royal Australian Air Force. However, we still have no clear indication from the Government that it proposes to levy a charge on airline operators that will reimburse the Department of Civil Aviation for the huge expenditure it incurs in providing and maintaining these facilities. I have taken out some figures relating to expenditure and revenue for the last financial year. They disclose that expenditure by the Department of Civil Aviation last year amounted to £18,286,000 while revenue totalled £5,400,000, leaving a deficit of £12,886,000. I point out that the revenue figures include the profit of £1,478,000 which was earned by Trans-Australia Airlines and Qantas Empire Airways between them, so that, in effect, Trans-AustraUa Airlines is contributing twice to the cost of maintaining runways and navigational aids throughout the Commonwealth.",47,Bills Returned From The Senate
175,Mr Jones (Newcastle) [3.21],"Lik e theI am sorry to say that, although the airlines receive this very favourable treatment from the Government, they do not reciprocate by giving some assistance to others. For example, I was approached recently by the Young Women's Christian Association in my district to endeavour to obtain for its members the benefit of concessional air fares. This organisation is committed to heavy expenditure for new premises and the fitting out of those premises. It also bears the cost of sending trainees around the Commonwealth to obtain further training in the particular courses in which they specialise. I wrote to the two principal airlines and I am sorry to say that Trans-Australia Airlines rejected my request for concessional air travel for the members of that very worthy organisation. The airline merely stated that it regretted that it could not extend the concessions. I remind honourable members that the various State railway systems, especially that of New South Wales, do grant concessional fares. In this case, however, while the airline is prepared to accept help from the Commonwealth, it is not prepared to reciprocate by making concessional fare travel available to deserving people. The only excuse offered was that if it acceded to the request of the Y.W.C.A. it would have to extend the concessions to everyone else. The airlines have a monopoly of this trade and they should be prepared to meet people half way. They should do as the Railways are doing. They should grant concessional fare travel to worthy organisations such as the one for which I requested it. Let me give the House an example of the result of monopoly control of airlines in certain States. A short time ago I had occasion to travel from Sydney to Whyalla. I travelled by T.A.A. as far as Adelaide, but the aircraft on which I was travelling ran into a headwind of 100 miles per hour and we were almost an hour late in arriving in Adelaide. I knew that I had to transfer to another aircraft in Adelaide to fly to Whyalla, so I had the captain of the aircraft send a message by radio that the aircraft would be arriving at almost the same time as the Whyalla plane was to leave. The intrastate airline in South Australia is Airlines of South Australia Pty. Ltd., a subsidiary company wholly owned by the Ansett interests. Did that company agree to hold back its aircraft? Of course it did not. As the plane on which I was travelling taxied to the terminal the Whyalla plane taxied past it on its way to the runway. passengers? travelling to Whyalla on that flight; there were others. But we had committed the sin of travelling by T.A.A. from Sydney to Adelaide instead of by Ansett-A.N.A. had travelled by Ansett-A.N.A. the otber aircraft would have waited for us. It did in fact wait for the passengers on the Ansett aircraft but as soon as they had transferred to the Whyalla plane it packed up and left. I was left in Adelaide until the next morning, as were the other passengers going to Whyalla. I am not bringing this matter forward just because I was involved. I am simply showing what happens when the Ansett companies enjoy a monopoly. Let me refer to a letter from the Premier of South Australia to the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) dated 19th October 1964, the penultimate paragraph of which readsMy Government recalls that, although express requests have been made for additional services to be established in South Australia to meet its requirements, the Commonwealth Government has, by administrative action, prevented this from being done The Commonwealth Government has, in this way, failed to implement its announced policy of fostering competitive air services. It is quite clear that this Government capitulated to the Ansett interests in restricting the rate of air charges that would be levied on the airlines. After all, Ansett uses the air navigational services of this country to a greater extent than any other operator. He is the one with the most to gain. He is the one desirous of maintaining a monopoly. T.A.A. has no intrastate airline services in Victoria, South Australia or Western Australia because this Government has decided not to allow T.A.A. to extend its activities. Therefore any concession granted is mainly in the interests of Ansett. I would like to have had a lot more to say on this Bill, but my time is limited. I",49,Bills Returned From The Senate

The Minister for Health wrote to me in due course setting out his views, and said that the matter would be referred to a special committee which considers these questions. I put it to the House that from llth May to 30th October is an inordinate delay. It is a harsh delay. It bears cruelly upon the person concerned and is a matter which ought to have received consideration. I regret very much that the Minister for Health is a sick man and is not available to make a reply at this time. I acknowledge a letter fronvthe Acting Minister for Health( Mr Swartz) of yesterday's date dealing with this particular case. My purpose inrisingat this stage is to make a plea to the Minister and to the Government to deal with these matters in a most urgent way. These questions requiring thought by a special committee are matters of the utmost concern to individuals. In this tion be given to this urgent human particular case, I have been told by a specialist that, if the woman could have received the drugs that she sought, her condition could have been greatly improved. He said, in fact, that when she was receivMonday, 9th November, at 2.30 p.m. ing the drugs her personality had been restored and she was enjoying considerably better health. The constituent on whose behalf I speak today is a deserted wife. For some period her late father paid the cost of the necessary drugs. Bnt, since his death, it has been extremely difficult to obtain these valuable pharmaceutical preparations. I put it to the Government this afternoon: Please treat this case as one of the utmost urgency. Please treat all cases of this kind with a greater degree of consideration and humanity than has occurred in this case. Under no circumstances can the delay in this case be justified, nor can it be condoned. It is a ministerial responsibility. It is a Government responsibility. There is too much of passing these matters to committees of various kinds. I say to the Minister at the table ( Mr Bury) that I would like bim on behalf of the House to take this matter to his colleague, the Acting Minister for Health, and ask that speedy consideraquestion.
