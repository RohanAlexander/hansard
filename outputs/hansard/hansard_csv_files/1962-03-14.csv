Mr J. R. FRASER I ask the Minister for the Interior: Is he in a position to make any statement on published allegations of malpractice or dishonesty by members of the Australian Capital Territory Police Force in the operation of a towing-service roster?

The information is expected to be available very shortly. is addressed to the Minister representing the Acting Minister for Trade. Is it a fact that the Department of Trade has not yet received from the Tariff Board a report on its inquiry into permanent protection for the Australian paper industry, although the board completed its hearing in August, 1961?

How does he reconcile the present state of affairs with previous assurances that the eliminated? carefully considered by the Minister for Trade, who, as the honourable member knows, is overseas at present.

In view of the financial stress that is placed on some parents who sities, will the Government consider providing, in the forthcoming Budget, for small personal loans to be made through the Commonwealth Bank for third-year university students who are proving themselves scholastically capable of completing their courses, responsibility for repayment of a loan to rest on the student? the honourable gentleman constitutes a novel approach to the problem of bank lending, particularly where personal loans are involved. I should like to study the implications and give some further consideration to the proposal. ter a question. Although the High Court bas ruled that the agreement between the Commonwealth and the State of South Australia for the construction of a standard gauge link between Broken Hill and Port Pirie is not enforceable at law, will the Government favourably consider providing assistance for this work in the near future; or is it intended not to grant assistance until 1968, by which time the Commonwealth will have fulfilled its commitments with regard to the construction of the railway between Kalgoorlie and Kwinana in Western Australia?",6,Setup

23,Mr Failes,"My question is directed tofor the television transmitter to serve the central western slopes of New South Wales yet been finally determined? If the tentative site on the Warrumbungle mountains is to be the final choice will the Minister inform the House whether the Australian Broadcasting Control Board is aware that the Australian National University is examining a site on Siding Spring Mountain in the Warrumbungle mountains as the possible site for an observatory? Would there be any technical difficulties in having both the transmitter and the observatory on almost the same site? which I have had some discussion with the honourable member for Lawson in the past few days. The position is that a site for a television transmitter to serve the central western slopes of New South Wales has been tentatively selected in the Warrumplans have been completed can we be probungle mountains area, but the exact site has not yet been chosen. The Australian Broadcasting Control Board and the Postal Department are aware that there is a proposal for the establishment of an observatory also in that area. I am advised that the exact site for the observatory has not been chosen either. However, since the plans are known both to the department and the board and to those responsible for the establishment of the observatory, I can assure the honourable member that discussions will take place between the bodies concerned to ensure that there will be no interference between the two services when the sites are finally chosen. the Minister for External Affairs. Is it a fact that Miss Cynthia Nelson, whose charm and efficiency are recognized by all who know her, has been appointed counsellor in the Australian Embassy in the United to the Postmaster-General by-referring to States of America? Is Miss Nelson the the proposed opening of transmission by first woman to be appointed to such a the national television station at Bendigo, position?

Will these rate of pay as a male officer occupying a transmissions merely be relays from the similar position in the Department of national station, Channel 2, in Melbourne? External Affairs? If not, how can the If so, will the programmes have no local differentiation in salary be reconciled with content? Will the new station not employ the Australian Government's obligations, local artists or televise local events? If it undertaken at the 1931 International Labour will not, what steps will the Government Organization convention, in respect of equal pay for the sexes? that Miss Cynthia Nelson has been appointed to the post mentioned by the honourable member. Miss Nelson is the first lady to be so appointed and I welcome her appointment. I am sure she will be very successful. The question of pay and conditions is governed, as the honourable member well knows, by Public Service regulations and not by the Department of External Affairs. General's Department completed its plans for improving radio broadcasting, particularly for the elimination of static and interference as has been done by broadcasting organizations in other countries? If these vided with an outline of them? that the Australian Broadcasting Control Board had completed all its investigations and its planning for the elimination of static from broadcast transmissions. Such a claim would be rather far-fetched because new problems are always arising, particularly with the development of other forms of communication, of power reticulation and things like that. Nevertheless, the question is constantly under review and I can assure the honourable member that thc matter will be further investigated. I think that the best thing that I can do for the honourable member, seeing that this is a highly tech-, nical matter, is to ask my officers to prepare a report containing the latest information on this matter and let the honourable member",14,Television

Mr L. R. Johnson -You might have improved since then. altered. The honourable member for Bendigo asked whether this station would merely transmit the programmes which are televised by the national service in Melbourne. I do not think that "" merely "" is an appropriate word to use in this context. The viewers in the honourable member's area will receive from the local national station programmes of exactly the same high quality as those which are received in the capital cities. As I pointed out in reply to a previous question, although country television stations will all relay programmes for a start, it is the plan of the Australian Broadcasting Commission eventually to provide matters of local interest among items from the general programme put out by the national stations in the capital cities. I repeat that this is the policy which has been pursued in national broadcasting with such good effect for a number of years. take steps to have any outstanding departmental reports that are within the jurisdiction of his department presented to the House as early as possible? I have in mind, particularly, the annual report for 1961 of the Commonwealth Office of Education, and I think there are one or two others outstanding. do my best to expedite presentation of these reports. There are, of course, various circumstances affecting each of them, but I will do my best to produce the result which the honourable member wants. addressed to the Treasurer. Is it a fact that recent amendments to the income tax legislation were designed to encourage life assurance offices to place a greater proportion of their investible funds in government and semi-government loans? Is the right honourable gentleman aware that the life assurance offices report that, at the current rates of interest, they obtain an advantage, after tax, on new investments in Commonwealth Government securities as compared with securities of local government and semi-government bodies, and that accordingly they have declined loan applications from municipal councils? Finally, in view of the Government's hopes that increased local government activities will assist in absorbing the unemployed, can the Treasurer suggest alternative arrangements whereby local councils can obtain loan funds? the Government introduced legislation' which, it was hoped, would have the effect of attracting more of the income of life assurance offices into Commonwealth loans. I believe that the results of recent loans reveal that the legislation is having useful effects in that direction. The comparative advantage to be obtained from investment in Commonwealth loans and semi-government or local government securities will, perhaps, vary from time to time, but I have not been made aware, Sir, that local government bodies are experiencing any serious difficulty in securing the loans required by them up to the totals authorized by the Australian Loan Council under the gentleman's agreement. The last check of the position that I made indicated that loan raisings by semi-government authorities had been proceeding rather more favourably than was the case in the previous year and that those for local government authorities were proceeding at about the same rate as in the previous year. In respect of both of those groups, according to my recollection, the full entitlement was taken up in the previous year. At the time when we met the Premiers at the Loan Council meeting quite recently it was agreed that no limit should be imposed on borrowings by local government bodies up to an amount of £100,000 between that point of time and the end of the financial year, and I do not recollect anybody seriously claiming that the money would not be available.

The honourable member asks what action is taken by a phonogram operator, to whom the caller transmits a message, to ensure that the source is a reliable one. Because of what I have seen to-day I have naturally made some urgent inquiries. I find that, in this case, the phonogram operator did make exhaustive inquiries from the caller about the name of the organization he was supposed to represent, and the telephone number, which the operator later phoning from that service. Those queries were answered in a manner which seemed to the operator to be satisfactory, the answers being given in confident manner. The person who transmitted the message to the operator obviously had very clear information about the addresses of the various newspapers and people to whom he wished the message to be sent. It was, obviously, a well-prepared hoax and, as a result, tbere was nothing to suggest to the operator that the material submitted to him was not authentic. Of course, immediately the hoax became apparent, the Postmaster-General's Department assigned its Chief Postal Investigation Officer to investigate this matter and we are pursuing urgent inquiries to try to discover the identity of the person who originated the hoax. from TasmaniaI will let the House know. question to the Minister for Labour and",16,Finance

I have no complaint about that; I wish thc principle were extended to other companies, including banking and insurance companies. But because the Pye organization could not hold the licence, another company had to buy it. It was sold to the ""Daily Telegraph "" interests in Sydney. To-day, these interests hold two licences, one in Sydney and one in Melbourne. It was surely never intended that one newspaper organization should bold two big commercial television licences in the two principal cities of Australia. Apparently, nothing can prevent a company from circumventing the decisions of the Government. A company may act through subsidiaries to obtain the ownership or control of all the commercial television stations operating in Australia. To us, this seems to be against the public interest. It seems to us to be injurious of the public interest. We believe that the present position with two commercial stations in each of the four main capital cities of Australia is wrong. We believe that the extension of the system to include a third commercial station in each of those capital cities would also be wrong. Such an extension would make the present position even worse than it is and the public interest would suffer. That is why we use the words "" the injury to the public interest involved in increasing the number of commercial television licences in the capital cities "". There is another consideration that must be given some attention by this House. Why must we pander all the time to the great swollen populations in the capital cities? What about the great outback? What about the people in other areas of Australia who do not see television at all? What about the people in the northern part of Australia? Why, there are some parts of Australia in which the people cannot even hear the radio broadcasts of the proceedings of this Parliament. thanking the Almighty that they cannot, but that, of course, is the cry of the dinosaur. One part of Australia is just as important as any other part, and the facilities that are provided for one part should be made available to every other part if it is humanly and economically possible to do so. Before considering plans to put more commercial stations into the capital cities, we should be considering phase 4 and some other aspects of the Government's programme to provide television services in other places in Australia such as north Queensland and parts of Western Australia. Geraidton and Albany want a television service. Kalgoorlie also wants one. These places will not get television services for a long time to come. There are also places in Tasmania such as Launceston and Burnie which have no television service. Why are we to have the rat race over again with at least 20 or 30 combinations of big interests fighting before the Australian Broadcasting Control Board to get the additional licence in Melbourne and in Sydney because they regard the licence as a gold mine, something out of which they will make money, and not something through the possession of which they will be able to serve the public interest? In our view, the time has arrived when a select committee of this Parliament, on which the Government will have a majority, should be appointed to inquire into the whole question of television and the whole of the operation of the act to date. It should look into the future of broadcasting in this country, even under the dual system wbich cannot be altered, apparently, while the Constitution remains as it is. If such a select committee reported back to the Parliament as the Broadcasting Committee, which was appointed under the original Australian Broadcasting Act, used to report to the Parliament, then we would know what the next step ought to be. Before such a select committee is appointed, nothing further should be done to extend the grip of the commercial interests on commercial television in this country.

74,Mr Davidson (Dawson,"PostmasterInjury to the public interestl I asked myself just how such a statement could be justified if, having regard to what we have done already in the expansion of television, the interests of all the people are properly to be regarded and looked after. But then, after a little thought, it occurred to me that I should not be very surprised about the action of the Leader of the Opposition, because, of course, we have had many indications, not only from the honourable gentleman but also from those sitting behind him, that they believe that the establishment of commercial stations is not in the public interest. Why do they say that this is not in the public interest? Is it because of the plan for socialization which is the basis of the Opposition's policy in this matter. The Opposition does not want commercial stations to develop. Honourable members opposite have said that time and time again. This is not something new. Therefore, when we announce our intention to license a further five commercial stations in the capital cities honourable members opposite say, "" This is not in . . . "" I delete the word "" public "" and insert "" our ""meaning the Opposition's "" interest"". I repeat, the Opposition says, "" This is not in our interest"". The thought having occurred to me, I was is completely untrue. very interested indeed to listen to the words of the Leader of the Opposition. They confirmed what I have just said.

Another thing which surprised me was that, in spite of the condemnation by my friend, the Leader of the Opposition, of our proposal to give an opportunity for another commercial station to operate in each of these capital cities, I find upon reading the press-if one can believe what one reads in the newspapers; and sometimes one can-that the Australian Labour Party intends applying for some of these commercial licences. not to grant such licences, too. of the sort!

That is the public interest for which we should cater.

On 30th November last, I called for applications for licences for country stations. After making that provision, we turned our attention to our undertaking that we would consider the licensing of further stations in the capital cities. That is all there is in this proposal.

Is our be a national service operating in areas that television service the best that the Governare not served by commercial services. I pointed out that, in phase 3, there were giving the nation the best television services. thirteen commercial licences, and that thirWe believe that commercialism has taken teen national stations were also to be estabover. It is utter rubbish for the Minister lished. Each commercial licensee has the task of providing only one station. Obviously, he can do that much more quickly than the Postal Department and the Australian Broadcasting Commission can complete the task of providing thirteen new stations. Therefore there must be a lag between the establishment of commercial stations and national stations in some areas. That will apply also to phase 4. In that phase, there will be twenty national stations. Therefore, in the light of those circumstances, how can it be suggested that, as a matter of urgency, there is a need to increase the number of national television licences in all areas? Where are the additional stations to be put? We have spent £27,000,000 in six years on national teleter to give us a select committee to tell us what has been done with television in We on the Opposition side have asked for ment can give the people?

84,Mr Haylen (Parkes) [3.47],"Th eto say that you can make an application for a television licence if you want one. A cabin boy can ask to be made an admiral, but what chance would he have? The Minister's statement on that point was absurd. WhatI want to ask the Minister in the short time at my disposal is this: How does it happen that under his wonderful administration, a private company can make £647,533 a year from showing on television mostly imported rubbish, while 1,000 scriptwriters, photographers and technicians are out of work? Would that not be a fair question to put to a select committee? Is not the Minister interested in the provision of employment? I propose to deal now with the much discussed question of the sort of programmes we are getting. But we can discuss here important matters in relation to the standard of of conduct. Are we to give a licence to just any company? One has only to read appendix "" D "" of the Thirteenth Annual Report of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board to see that, in the words of W. S. Gilbert, it is a case of "" their brothers and their sisters and their cousins and their aunts "". If it is not Frank Packer it is Fairfax, been waiting for years for telephones, and if it is not Fairfax it is Associated Newspapers, if it is not Associated Newspapers it is Consolidated Press, and if it is not Consolidated Press it is some other old stooge down the line. If the honourable member who is interjecting would like a television station he has only to write a friendly note to the Postmaster-General and it will be considered. We all know how absurd that is. This is careering big business and naked commercialism taking over a public service. We should be able to say, "" We do not like this"", or, ""We do not like that."" We should be able to say that we do not like profits being made at the expense of good taste and good standards, and that we do not like to have unemployed actors, actresses and others in television. The question of programmes will eventually work itself out. But the question of control, if it is not handled now, will be gone for ever. The Labour Party, representing the people, looks seriously at the practice of issuing licences haphazardly and only for the reason that people want to make a profit. The Television Corporation Limited which operates channel TCN9 in Melbourne and its subsidiaries, earned a combined profit of £647,553 in the year ended 1st July, 1961. That was equal to 44.7 per cent, on capital employed during the year. The 20 per cent, dividend declared by the corporation absorbed £289,800. This was an enormous profit. But what do these organizations do about the out-of-work Australian actors? Do they say, "" Come in and we will see if we can make an Australian film or knock together the background for a good Australian story ""? Of course not! Their policy of commercialism is dictated by shareholders, including overseas shareholders. They do not give a tinker's damn for the kind of television the people get. They are out after profit. programmes and the standard I think that the Postmaster-General made out a good case for controlling television as the Bruce-Page Government was forced to do with radio by the naked cupidity of entrepreneurs who would do everything except give people good programmes. The Minister tootles along on his coaxial cable and tells us what he will do in the sweet by and by. People in many electorates have I am afraid that in this matter the Minister will be just as dilatory. Surely, we on this side of the House are entitled to ask for a select committee and not be fobbed off by the Minister saying "" Why do you want a select committee?"" I will tell him why. I think the Minister is weak. I think the Australian Broadcasting Control Board is absolutely vapid and is senseless to the demands that are made on it. We should give the whole damn show a shake up. It is valid for us to ask for a select committee to do as the Leader of the Opposition has asked. There is in New York a company called the American Musical Society. Whatever broadcasting station you listen to, and whatever television station you look at, the music all comes from this concern. It is a sort of BHP. of the musical world. If a television station wants a musical film this organization has one. It will supply a musical film, but with this film the station will have to take half a d'ozen live artists to support it. The station has to buy the lot. It is a package deal. Yet an honourable member opposite has had the temerity to say that the Australian people are getting a wide sweep of entertainment! That is all rubbish! Art is international; entertainment is international. We all like to be able to see the greats from all parts of the world, but we do not want rubbish. The commercial television stations are making enormous profit while our Australian artists and writers are standing by without jobs. 1 am a member of Actors Equity as a scriptwriter and I know that in Sydney to-day there are people who were famous on radio but who are now Uving on much less than the basic wage. Some of them are in receipt of social service payments. That information came from Hal Alexander, the secretary of Actors Equity, and Hal Lashwood, the president, only the other day. People have been driven out of the industry by the naked commercialism of the commercial stations. There is no room for any one with an Australian outlook in his mind and Australian patriotism in his heart. We want something better. Surely no Minister and the stupid licensing system responsible government will parcel out which enables people to make £500,000 a further licences just to extend what is being year or more out of television programmes. done now. The root of the trouble lies The Opposition is asking for a select comwhere the Minister will not touch it. The mittee to inquire into these things and the set-up is rotten. It is wrong that television other matters enumerated by the Leader of companies should be allowed to make huge the Opposition. There are the questions of profits by exploiting people. I have mentioned an overseas organization which has a clamp on all entertainment. If you do not take all they send you, you do not get any. Some of the programmes are good, some bad and some indifferent. Does the Minister agree that Australian commercial stations should have to accept whatever entertainment the combine in America says that they must' have? The Government has tried to avoid answering the Opposition's questions about a quota. The United Kingdom is the home of entertainment. It has a great background of culture and a great number of playwrights. To safeguard its own writers and artists it imposes a quota of up to 70 per cent. In other words the United Kingdom Government says, in effect, "" You can bring in programmes from outside the country but you must give adequate opportunities to the people who live in this country "". There is no national content in Australian television. It could be from anywhere. It belongs to the great bodgy conglomeration of westerns and so on. It is all right if you like that sort of a show, but somewhere there should be a content of Australian thought, culture and understanding, otherwise money is being wasted and we are being derelict to our trust as Australians. If somebody from another country asks, "" What is your Australian television like?"" we only reply, "" Exactly what you get in Kalamazoo on a wet night"". There is nothing Australian in it. The honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Howson) says that Australian films are not much good. If we took some money from the swollen profits of commercial stations and taught Australians how to produce better films and how to mount plays better, and if we helped them in the production of their scripts, we would get first-rate Australian drama. It is only waiting to be born. The reason it cannot be brought to television is the muddleheadedness of the trade malpractices, quotas honourable member's time has expired. for Supply) [3.58] -It seems to me that somebody has committed the unpardonable crime in the Australian Labour Party's eyes of making a profit and, consequently, must be condemned. This is an odd kind of motion. Apparently, it is another effort on the part of the Labour Party to identify itself with what it defines as the public interest. Look as you may at the words of this motion, Mr Deputy Speaker, you must come to the conclusion that it definitely calls for a limitation of television services to the Australian people. How, in the words of this motion, the Labour Party assumes that an extension of commercial television",25,Television

86,Mr Fairhall (Paterson,"Ministe rmust be at the expense of the national service, I do not quite understand. The Opposition is inviting us to accept the proposition that we ought not to persist with the extension of commercial television by permitting an additional service in each of the capital cities, as well as new stations in budgeted for is £4,920,000 and in the folcountry areas, until the national service has been further extended. Let us look at this proposition because it will not bear the minutest investigation. The frequency channels for the extension of commercial television are available and are reserved for that purpose. There is no call on public funds to establish these stations. They will be established by private investment. These stations will open up completely new sources of television programmes and will then make a great contribution in the field which is supported so heavily by the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen). In addition, and for the reasons quoted by the honourable member for Parkes, there is available adequate advertising revenue to maintain these new to import our television requirements. commercial stations. What the Labour Party seeks to do is to that is true. But here is the evidence that tell the people of the capital cities that (he job is being done and being done expealthough somebody wants to come in and ditiously and in the public interest. give them additional service and although there is revenue to sustain such a service, they must not have it until somebody else of the Leader of the Opposition. We all gets national stations. Well now, I have know very well that most of the honourable been having a look at this question of expenmembers present on this side of the House diture by the Government on the extension represent country electorates, and there is of television, and I think that I ought to say, not a member on the Government benches first, that the way in which television has who would not, if he could, see that serbeen handled by the Government has been vices like telephones, good roads, water and outstandingly in the public interest. In the first place, we delayed the introduction sewerage, good radio and television and of television in this country with the result so on were taken out to the very limits of that when we did produce it we were the settlement, because that is where they are first country to go on to international techmost urgently needed. Yet we have to be nical standards at the outset.

This show beyond doubt that that is not just the really means something. At the same time, way it can be. the public interest is definitely being served because the Government extended television only slowly, so that in Australia our prevent the city from having an additional television has grown into a firm service on service that will soon be available for it. sound foundations and has done so without It is the old story once again. The Leader injury to the Australian economy which has of the Opposition deplores public taste in so much else to do. That is surely in the entertainment. public interest. I want to get back now to this question of expenditure. I do not have to go back any further than the financial provision for television services in the current year, 1961-62. That expenditure will be £2,750,000. Next year the expenditure lowing year the expenditure will be £5,300,000. These are the things about which the Labour Party is arguing to-day. Honourable members opposite are not complaining that this is not going to be done. There is the evidence that it is going to be done, and in a completely orderly fashion. The Postmaster-General himself has given sound technical reasons why, because of the limitation in the number of people who are able to build transmitting equipment, if for no other reason, this job cannot be done more quickly than is being proposed. I am quite sympathetic with the position The Labour Party is only anxious to In other words, these gentlemen opposite are prepared to say:",27,Television

And they invite us to improve television programmes by installing more national television stations. had a quick look at the figures, which are quite authentic, and to-day the national teletruth is that television, run by commercials vision chain is drawing 12 per cent, of the Australian audience. This is not a complaint about the national service. It does not mean that the national service's programmes are no good; it merely means that the Australian people prefer the type of programmes presented by the commercial networks. This, of course, does not stop the Labour Party from saying, "" When we get hold of this, if we have our way, we will put on super programmes ""-writte n no doubt by the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) and people of that kind "" and you will listen to them whether you like to or not"". They may listen under some sort of compulsion, but I assure you they will not like it. It is not as if there were nothing else to do. You ask why, if 88 per cent, of the Australian people prefer to watch commercial television programmes, and those programmes are rubbish, they do not do something else. You only have to look at the falling attendances in theatres to-day to understand that the Australian people prefer this kind of entertainment to any other available to them on or outside television. about the people in Actors Equity, because So what the Labour Party is arguing with that would be doing an injustice to those is the free choice of the Australian people. members of that organization who are in it I sympathize with the honourable member going to have a lot of hangers-on who are for Parkes also.

I think he is a the Government distort the whole structure true novelist. He has written a chapter or of Australia's major entertainment industry two from experience and observation and in order to provide jobs for second-raters, filled in the balance. But this, of course, exclude me from this sort of support. I do is what they do on television, and he comnot know what is to come out of the plains about it.

The mostly, has opened up these completely new channels for the employment of writers and artists. I am very touched by the generalizations uttered by the honourable member for Parkes. He tells us of the artists and actors, members of Actors Equity-the y are brother unionists of his and I do not object to that, because it is a good thing-and about the thousands of them who are unemployed. He talks in general terms. I should like very much to know whether one has to do a paper or write a play or produce something before one can join Actors Equity, because if one has to do so I will be very concerned about the unemployment that allegedly exists to-day among its members. But if you are going to have Actors Equity and invite people to come along with their membership fees and join it, and they think that thereby they have a passport to easy entry to this new, well-paid and rather exacting industry, then I would quarrel with the honourable gentleman and tell him that he does not know what he is talking about.

I have given some consideration to whether there was any need for a change in those terms and thought that there was none.. This is not to indicate that I am not prepared to consider any constructive proposals for modifying the terms. The terms have been modified in the past, as suggestions have been made to, and accepted by, the Government. However, I feel that I ought to sayseveral things. First, the committee has proved its value as a useful forum in which a representative group of members can examine and become familiar with external affairs problems. As has been said before, this body is not a policy-making body and for that, reason the initiative that is permissible to the committee is necessarily restricted.. Policymaking must remain the responsibility of -the .Government. Looking through the records of past discuss'ions on the. type""of motion I"" have proposed I see that. it.has been thought at times that there is.room for establishing, a ciated with the United"" States Congress; However, I remind honourable members that the constitutional arrangements of the two countries ""are so radically different that there is no place for such a committee in our system. Our system Of ministerial responsibility and of government »leaves no room for a committee of the kind with which the United States is familiar. The Foreign. Affairs Committee does get very valuable informationfrom my department. It receives a great deal of confidential information which, because of its nature, cannot be -publicized or publicly attributed to any particular source.' The limited size of the committee makes it possible for its members to receive foreign affairs experts from time to time and question them in a private and informal, atmojphere. This results in the House having the benefit of the views of a substantial group of members, who are not merely very interested in this topic, but who also become informed in a manner which fits them to assist the House in discussion and which enables them, when they desire to do so, to converse with the Minister in an informed manner. Minister for External Affairs( Sir Garfield Barwick) says that the terms of the resolu. tion are identical with those of the resolution passed by the last Parliament. Since they are identical with those passed by the last Parliament, the Opposition takes the. identical attitude towards this resolution as it did to the previous one. The resolutions governing the appointment and functioning of this committee have not been altered in any material particular in the ten years during which the committee has existed. The difference between the present Government parties and the present Opposition party on this matter does not flow from any misunderstanding or confusion concerning the role of a foreign affairs committee in an Australian or British parliamentary system,as compared with the role of a similarly named committee in the United States of America or. under what we .can call a congressional system. We have never, suggested",31,Import Duties
97,Mr Whitlam (Werriwa) [4.20],"Th eas a ground of our criticism, nor was it ever suggested by several of the present ministry who spoke in support of some such committee in 1949, when the party to which I belong was in government, that this committee should be a policy-making committee. That has never been suggested. We quite understand that in a parliamentary system the executive determines policy on foreign affairs and other matters, and that it continues to determine policy as long as it retains the confidence of the popular House. Nor, Sir, is our objection to this committee that it would consider foreign affairs purely in the abstract, or in order to inform itself, or that it would merely be a study group. None of these things would be objectionable. Our objection to this committee is that it is so circumscribed and so superintended by the executive that it serves no useful purpose at all. I direct the House's attention particularly to the following parts of the Minister's resolution:(4) (h) subject to the Minister for External because even if the committee does report Affairs being informed, the Committee shall have to Parliament-and it can do so only with power to invite persons to give evidence before it; Sub-paragraphs (e) and (g) of paragraph protests may be expressed, and no minority (4) read(4) (e) the committee and its sub-committees sequence of the provisions of Standing will sit in camera and their proceedings shall be Order No. 340, which deals with comsecret unless the Minister at the request of the Committee otherwise directs; (g) . . . in the case of matters not referred to the Report. to it by the Minister for External Affairs, the Committee shall not submit a report to the Minister nor inform the Parliament accordinglyThere are other committees of which memwithout the Minister's consent. It is clear, therefore, that the Opposition can choose from its ranks certain members who will be appointed by the House to this committee. Once, however, the Opposition's chosen members are on the committee, they cease to be representatives of the Opposition. They are precluded from discussing the proceedings of the committee with their colleagues. They are precluded from discussing the proceedings of the committee in Parliament. They are precluded from discussing the proceedings of the committee, or the information they get as members of it, in public. That is, the committee does not serve as a body to educate members of the Parliament or members of the public. Nobody disputes the proposition that external affairs are of very great importance tc Australia, and that they are becoming of greater importance to Australia. External affairs, both strategic and commercial, are becoming more and more crucial to this country in its exposed strategic and trading position. But, Sir, this committee does not serve to educate members on these subjects unless the Minister consents to its doing so, and, unless the Minister consents, members of the committee cannot play their part in educating the public on these subjects. Let me summarize our objections, Sir. The committee must sit in camera, unless the Minister for External Affairs otherwise directs. It must regard as confidential all written or oral evidence submitted in camera. It shall not, without the Minister's consent, report to the Minister or inform the Parliament on any matters that the Minister has not referred to it. That is, tbe committee must, except by the Minister's leave, remain silent. But, Sir, that is not the end of the matter, the consent of the Minister-n o dissents or reports may be submitted. This is a conmittee reports in general and concludes. . . no protest or dissent shall be added bers of this House, and of the other place as well, are members. Some of them operate under statute. They include the Public Works Committee and the Public Accounts Committee. Those committees are parliamentary committees in the fullest sense. They are committees with almost the same powers as congressional committees in the United States of America. They do not sit in camera unless the witnesses desire that they should. Their proceedings are reported to the Parliament which set them up, as a matter of parliamentary right. Any protests, dissents or minority reports, as well as particulars of the voting, are recorded in the committees' reports and made available to the Parliament and to the public. Again, Sir, committees which are set up under our Standing Orders can make provision to meet the objections that I have outlined. This was done, for instance, in the case of the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review, which was constituted sue years ago and reconstituted three, years ago. It was composed of equal numbers of members from both sides of each House of the -Parliament. There is no question that its deliberations were quite prolonged and the evidence it took quite exhaustive. There was provision in its charter for the committee to send for persons, papers, records, &c, and to sit in public if it wanted to, and also, overyour Foreign Affairs Committee? "" riding the Standing Orders, for any member to add a protest or dissent to any report made by the committee. That was a parliamentary committee on which both sides of politics were equally represented, and both sides were equally free to express their opinions before the committee, in this Parliament or in public, and every member was free to record his opinion, his dissent, his protest, or his minority report. Members of my party freely and willingly, and, I think it would be conceded, usefully and profitably, participate in the work, and always have participated in the work of the statutory committees-the Public Works Committee and the Public Accounts Committee-as well as in the work of such a potentially contentious parliamentary committee as the Joint Committee on Constitutional Review. But we have always adopted the attitude that we cannot participate in the work of this Foreign Affairs Committee, because although we are free to choose members of our party for appointment to the committee, those members, once having been appointed, no longer represent the Opposition and are no longer individuals. They can express no views other than those expressed by the majority of the committee and approved for publication by the Minister. The criticisms I have offered are not confined to my side of the House. The original, and so far the only, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee has been the honourable member for Chisholm( Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes). strictly correct. At any rate, the honourable member for Chisholm has been chairman of that committee for several years. In a television programme in Melbourne on 21st January last, he was interviewed about his general view, which he had expressed in the press and in the Parliament, that the Australian public should be made much more fully and quickly aware of Australia's exposed position in the world. The questions which were put to the honourable gentleman on this matter and the replies which he gave are reported as follows:Mr Warner: "" Couldn't you have done something along those lines yourself in Parliament through Sir Wilfrid: ""We have tried. We have sent In recommendations, which I am not allowed to give in public. In the past three years, we have been warning of the shape of things to come."" Mr Howard: ""Does anyone take any notice of the Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee?"" Sir Wilfrid: "" I do not know. The reports got to the Ministers, but none has been presented to Parliament."" Mr Howard: ""None has been presented to Parliament? "" Sir Wilfrid: ""They cannot be without approval of the Minister."" We do not know what is in these reports, Sir, but we do know that they dealt with the general position in which Australia finds itself, and we have the view of the honourable member for Chisholm that they made vital recommendations. We have, also, his statement that these reports were given to the Minister but were not given to the Parliament. As we know from the terms of the motion for the appointment of the Foreign Affairs Committee on each occasion in the last few parliaments, the contents of the committee's reports may not be given to the Parliament unless the Minister for External Affairs consents. We know of only three reports by this committee. The latest of them related to extradition treaties. It was made in October, 1956. The two earlier ones were of lesser moment, and no action was taken on them. The report on extradition, as I have said, was made in October, 19S6. I almost said "" expedition "". That certainly would have been inadvertent because expedition is one thing which has never been shown in the Ministry's handling of the reports of this committee. About a year ago, I asked the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies), who was at the time also Minister for External Affairs, what action had been",32,Import Duties

The fact that members of the Foreign Affairs Committee study _a subject closely and have continuous access . tp information enables them, when they .take part in a debate on foreign affairs, to speak with an informed mind and not to base their . comments on ignorance and prejudice. To take a case in point, I wonder whether the Leader of-the Opposition, if during the last few years he had been a -member of the Foreign Affairs Committee and had made a continuous study of West ---New Guinea, as we have done, would have burst into print in January last with the .point of view that he expressed at that time. ' If he had been a member of the committee, he would have come in contact with the people concerned and would have known something about the susceptibilities of our Asian neighbours. He would have known that to call the head of a great state that . is important to us a fascist and to accuse him of Hitlerism would not win us friends .in Asia. This is one very good example of the educative role of the Foreign Affairs Committee. It may well be that the honourable gendeman would still have made the remarks he did; but he would have done so on the basis of prejudice and not on the basis of ignorant prejudice. I cannot believe that Opposition members understand the nature of the committee. It would be in the interests of the country if they were at least to give it a try and become members of the committee. They would then find out whether their suspicions are justified. If they find this is' so, scrutinizing the actions of the executive. they can leave the committee. But surely they owe it to their country at least to try, -through the commiteee, to develop a bipartisan view on matters of foreign policy which are so vital to us. At least they owe it to their country to give it a try, to find out whether their fears are confirmed in the event. They can always leave the committee, but their responsibility to their country requires them to become members of the committee to find out what happens there. subject-matter dealt with by the Foreign Affairs Committee, as the honourable member for Barker( Mr Forbes) contends, is -not the difficulty that the Opposition experiences. The difficulty, confronting the Opposition is the essential structure of the committee. It is absolutely unlike anything else in the Parliament. Perhaps the nearest analogy to .it is the Committee of Public Accounts, which also has power ,to:question -the administration and .to. look-..into (tie actions, of the executive government. . But -it-also has the power to report back to. the -Parliament. The Foreign Affairs. Committee has not the-power to report back to the Parliament and Opposition members on -the committee would have no power to report back to their party The party, therefore, would have no knowledge of what its members on the committee were doing, saying or thinking on questions that may be vital to it. This would, I think, be quite -serious for the Australian Labour Party, having regard to its structure and creed, particularly if members who were supposed to represent it on a committee could not in fact be responsible to it. Members could be responsible to it only by violating the oath or the undertaking given by members of the committee from time to time. One of the troubles with the committee is that it has been dignified with a name that is well known in the United States constitutional practice. The Foreign Affairs Committee of the United States Senate is, of course, a powerful body. But in that constitution the Parliament has power, without overturning the executive government, to accept or reject the actions of the President and the .presidential cabinet. Members of the committee there are the eyes and the ears of the Congress in The constitution, of the United States gives the Senate very great powers in relation to foreign policy, in the ratification of treaties, in the appointment of ambassadors and in many other respects. Our political structure is such that it does not matter what committees' are constituted-thi s is the only committee that is in any way an adjunct to the executiveforeign policy remains a responsibility of the executive government of the country. The. only.respect in which the Parliament has power over foreign policy is in the rejection of a government on the basis of some issue of foreign policy or in the ratification .of treaties. But the Parliament has very little power in the day-to-day conduct of foreign policy. . . . . . . . .",35,Import Duties
101,Mr Beazley (Fremantle) [4.43],"Th eThe honourable member for Barker may not remember that a Labour government set up an all-party advisory committee on the Japanese peace settlement. It was different in structure from the Foreign Affairs Committee in that it included people Committee, we would not be able to reveal who were not members of Parliament, but who were experts in different fields. For instance, Antarctic whaling questions were considered to be related to the prospective Japanese peace settlement; so the late Sir Douglas Mawson was a member of the committee because of his specialized knowledge in that field. If the honourable member cares to look back, he will find there was considerable discontent on the part of the then Opposition members of the committee. It was a committee set up by the Government that I was supporting at the time. We received from the department documents with the "" Secret"" stamp on them, but any persons could go to Keesing's ""Contemporary Archives"" and be much better informed than they would be if they confined themselves to the material that came from the Department of External Affairs. I do not know whether that is the position now. I do not know whether the Foreign Affairs Committee can extract evidence from witnesses, from officers of the Department of External Affairs, from our ambassadors or from other people who may give it advice. If it can, the informaserving their country a great deal better tion is no doubt very interesting. But the fact still remains that the information is unusable from the Opposition's point of view. It could not be used to attack the Government. Let us suppose that experts came before the committee and gave very strong testimony that was contrary to the Government's policy. The position we would be in would be completely invidious. We may regard the subjectas a valid ground of criticism of the Government's position, but we would be obliged by underfrom an electoral angle which could concern takings not to reveal the proceedings and this would be a disability to us. I accept absolutely what the honourable more to say about that. later-it does do member for Barker has said. I have extremely valuable work, from the direct observed members of the Foreign Affairs angle, particularly in connection with matters Committee, including its former chairman, in respect of which it may influence departthe honourable member for Chisholm( Sir mental thinking. Wilfrid Kent Hughes), speaking on foreign affairs matters. No one would suggest for one moment that they are inhibited in ings, I submit that it does not require any expressing their points of view. But, after all, when the debate becomes really important, we deal not only with points of view but also with facts on foreign policy. If we were members of the Foreign Affairs those facts. There is no derision of the Foreign Affairs Committee on our part; there is merely the contention that, with its existing structure and with undertakings concerning the confidential nature of material before the committee and so on, it is quite impossible for us to serve on the committee. I am sure honourable members of this House will have been far better informed of the attitude of mind of the Australian Labour Party on this subject by the two speeches we have heard this afternoon than they would be from the normal ill-tempered speeches we used to hear from the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell). We regret that the Opposition cannot take a broader nationa] outlook on this question of foreign affairs. I believe the basic reason why it cannot do so is because it cannot use the Foreign Affairs Committee as a weapon in the party political struggle. If honourable members opposite would only realize their responsibilities as an Opposition on the broad level of the need for a bi-partisan foreign policy, I am sure they would be than they do by regarding this committee purely as a possible weapon in the party political struggle. It has already been pointed out that the committee has done, and will continue to do, very useful work. For instance, it brings a different type of scrutiny to the recommendations and decisions of the Department of External Affairs. It possibly puts a practical political tinge on subjects the Government in its relations witb countries overseas.

That is mere common sense. Some of the conclusions reached, and recommendations made, in those reports would be dynamite if published and would probably have a dangerous effect on some of our representatives overseas who obviously must submit the information upon which the committee works. That is one important point which I think has escaped the minds of the more imaginative honourable members opposite who have spoken on this subject. The fact that we were being fed with information from our neighbouring countries, or from other countries elsewhere, about their internal economic and political situations would become known and it would be obvious that the information could come from only one source. The position of our representatives in the country concerned would be prejudiced if the sources of information, or the conclusions drawn from the information coming from those sources, were broadcast in this place and published in the press. just suggested' that those members of the If a little more consideration were given to that point I think honourable members would realize that it is impossible for the Opposition to ask that reports from the committee be presented in this place every month. I deeply regret that the Opposition has decided not to co-operate by appointing members to the committee, but I do say that the attitude expressed by the two speakers on behalf of the Opposition was in very refreshing contrast to the views expressed by the Leader of the Opposition on other occasions when he has spoken on this subject. Quite frankly, his recent illtempered and ill-informed outbursts on this and other matters have done neither himself, his party, nor Australia any good overseas. If the speeches we have heard this afternoon may be"" taken as a sign of a better approach towards problems associated with foreign affairs policy, we at least have achieved something by having had the opportunity of criticizing the Leader of the Opposition for his rather extravagant and offensive remarks. strongest arguments supporting the rejection by the Opposition of the Government's proposal that its members participate in the work of this committee have been furnished by the honourable member for Barker( Mr Forbes) and the honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Mackinnon). Although we have never been told so, it is obvious now that when this committee was formed in October, 1951, it was the Government's intention to manoeuvre the Opposition into a position in which it would be supporting a bipartisan policy on foreign affairs. That would be impossible because our views on foreign affairs differ from those of the Government as greatly as they do on internal affairs. In effect, what the Government really wanted to do by establishing this committee was to enveigle the Opposition into agreeing to have what would in effect be the equivalent of a national government dealing with internal affairs. The Labour Party refuses to have any truck with such a proposal. As the committee-is at present constituted we cannot see how it can serve any useful purpose whatever. The honourable member for Barker has Government who have served on the committee are now much better informed than they were previously. AllI can say in reply to the honourable member is that I have not noticed evidence of that during the debates we have had on foreign affairs here. If they are better informed now, they must have been very ignorant when they first joined the committee. Let us examine the proposed constitution of the committee. The Government does not say to the Opposition, ""We will have seven Government members from the House of Representatives and the Opposition will have six "". The Government merely says, "" There will be appointed thirteen members of the House of Representatives "". If we were to agree to the proposal I assume that six would be appointed from the Opposition and seven from the Government side. This Government is very generous, especially when we remember that it represents less than 41 per cent, of enrolled electors, whereas the party to which it offers six places on the committee represents approximately 7 per cent, more of the electors of",37,Import Duties
103,Mr Ward (East Sydney) [4.59],"Th ethis country. In those circumstances, if any party has a right to determine not only internal but also the foreign policy of Australia it is the Labour Party, which now sits -in opposition because, under our electoral .system, this Government was able to win a majority of one vote on the floor of the . House by inducing the people supporting other political organizations, including the -Communist Party, to extend their preference votes to it. This Government occupies the' -treasury-bench by the grace of a handful . of Communist preference votes.. There can be no doubt about that. The honourable member for Barker could 'not resist throwing a shaft at the Leader of the Opposition by referring to a statement which he had made some little time ago and implying that some speeches by Opposition members in connection with foreign affairs had antagonized the Afro-Asian -nations against the Australian people and the Australian nation. If this committee is to avoid antagonizing the Afro-Asian nations, it should avoid any dealings with the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) himself. If there is one person in this country who has helped to antagonize the Afro-Asian nations against the Australian people and -the Australian nation by his speeches during debates on foreign affairs, and by his published statements and by his actions overseas, it is the Prime Minister. But the .honourable member for Barker has made no 'mention whatever of the affairs overseas in which the Prime Minister has taken some part. We recollect the part played by the Prime Minister in the Suez negotiations. Did his actions there help us with the AfroAsian nations? We also remember that he expressed no strong disapproval of what happened in South Africa at the time of the massacre at Sharpeville. Did that improve the attitude of the Afro-Asian nations towards Australia? Why, we have only to consider his latest performance at the -United Nations. General Assembly when he opposed a motion for a summit conference moved by some of those nations whjch were then friendly disposed towards Australia and later proposed an .amendment in an endeavour to spike their guns When the -vote was taken, so lacking in support from :the nations of the world was he that only -five votes, including his own,.were recorded -in .favour of the amendment..""' -. It can be seen, therefore, that if this committee is really designed, as the Government claims, to promote a more sympathetic approach to matters of vital concern to Australia by other countries of. the world, it has ample scope for work, amongst the .members of the Government. parties. The Labour Party, will have nothing to do with the proposal. . The 'Government parties have made a number of statements which will require 'some explaining in the near future. To-day, when the trend in most countries is towards the ending of colonialism, we have a Government and a leader of a government that think differently; On a visit to New Guinea not long ago, the Leader of the Government declare'd that we were there and were there to stay There was no question on that occasion of independence for New Guinea in the future. So there can be no doubt in the world that this is the attitude and the policy of the Government-andits -leader, and that they alone are arousing the antagonism, particularly in Afro-Asian countries,to which the -honourable member for Barker referred. I believe that the Foreign Affairs Com^ .mittee has had ample opportunity to prove whether it is worthwhile and whether the expenditure on it is justified. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) pointed to the two or three"" reports that have been submitted by the committee to this Parliament in a period of about ten years and upon which the Government had taken no action. Yet the Government has had the audacity to submit the motion which states in paragraph (g)Provided the Opposition is represented on the Committee, copies of the Committee's reports to the Minister for External Affairs shall be forwarded to the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives for his confidential information; So the Leader of the Opposition is to get the reports only if we are prepared to be represented 'oh the committee, and if he gets the reports they are for his own confidential information. This is a secret organization. It is a bad thing for the Parliament and the country to have this type of organization established. ' . I have .a. question on the notice-paper seeking more detailed information about this committee and await the answer with great interest. I have asked what this worthless committee has cost the Australian taxpayers. It is all right for Government supporters to talk in a general way about honourable members being able to become better informed on foreign affairs by becoming members of the committee, but they have given us no demonstration that members of the committee have become better informed. I strongly support the attitude of the Opposition to the Foreign Affairs Committee. It has been consistent since 1951. We refuse to participate with this Government in a bi-partisan foreign policy and in this worthless and extravagant committee. not detain the House long but I wish to refer to a matter that was raised by the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr because I think they rightly brought some Beazley). I understood him and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) to say that under the Australian Constitution, the Executive has the responsibility for decisions on foreign affairs. Therefore, this was a recognition of the fact that there is a difference between our type of constitution and that of the United States of America in respect of the way in which foreign policy decisions are made. Surely that is recognition of the fact, as the Opposition has already expressed it, that the chief aim should be to provide a Minister for External Affairs with the best possible advice on confidential matters that may not be made public but on which views can be expressed by persons on both.sides of the House and then can be conveyed to the person who has to make the decisions. 'As I understood him, the reason why the honourable member for Fremantle is opposed to the appointment of Opposition members to serve on the Foreign Affairs Committee is that they would not have the right afterwards to inform other members of the Opposition and the public of matters discussed in the committee. I should like to put to the Opposition the other point of view, which is that the main aim surely should be to influence the person who actually has. to -stake the final decisions in ( Mr Whitlam) wasI say this with great the name of Australia. Therefore, those views are of greater importance to the nation than are the disadvantages to which the honourable member referred. I wonder whether that is a valid argument against the views put forward' by the honourable member for Fremantle and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. -Minister for External Affairs and Attorney-General) [5.5] -in reply-Unti l the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) had spoken I rather agreed with my colleague who thought that the Australian Labour Party, as represented by the Opposition, was making a more sound and useful approach to this matter than it had done previously. However, I prefer to address myself to the speeches made by honourable members who spoke before the honourable member for East Sydney thoughtful views to bear on the motion. It seems to me that those speakers conceded that the Foreign Affairs Committee is a useful body. Formerly, I heard something to the contrary. I was pleased to hear that they did not deride the committee or its members. Up to a point, that is something new. I think honourable members opposite have stated the fundamental reasons why the Opposition will not join in what we hoped would be a committee that might have lead progressively to something which this country could well do with. I refer to a bi-partisan foreign policy. After all, I suppose that the Australian Labour Parly at some time will provide the government, and it is shattering to think that those who will attain office have not participated in the dissemination of information on foreign affairs and on the approach to problems that are vital to the nation and the people, whether they vote for this side of politics or the other. We have had an open declaration by Labour members that they will not, for any reason, enter into a bipartisan foreign policy. I beard that statement with great regret, but, of course, we have to accept it. I think the reason that was put forward by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition respect-somewha t spurious.

But in very truth, there is a marked difference between a proposal for the erection of a new courthouse in Canberra, upon which the Public Works Committee can report, and a discussion on confidential information, derived not only from Australia but also from other countries whose confidences we must respect. There is no similarity whatever between the two problems. Foreign affairs, of their very nature, are different and one would expect most significant differences between the Foreign Affairs Committee and other parliamentary committees. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition spoke of tbe ability of the Constitutional Review Committee to sit in public. There are no secrets about the Constitution except to those who do not understand it. say to whom that comment applies. But, when it comes to foreign affairs, the setting up of a Foreign Affairs Committee of this House to meet in public, unlike the committee of the United States Senate, would simply mean that the supply of information to members would have to be cut off. sides and we became the Government, would you willingly sit on such a committee and hear discussions in confidence? the question.

If we very great hardship. derived from one of our allies highly confidential information but we -thought it was the sort of information that members of the committee could well have, they could not just sit in public. It is folly, in such circumstances, to talk about sittings in public. The committee simply would not get the information. If the committee is to be of any use, of necessity it must sit in camera. It must, of course, be under the control of a Minister who has charge of policy. The Opposition says, on the one hand, "" Of course the Government must have charge of policy "", and on the other hand it complains of these minimal controls, which have been brought down in this resolution. I have perused them closely to see whether they could be relaxed and still maintain ministerial responsibility for policy. I do not think they can. I am open to be convinced if any one brings a proper matter before me in that respect. But my own consideration leads me to think that these are minimal to protect the fundamental constitutional principle of ministerial responsibility which the Opposition concedes. It is idle and spurious to say that this is different from other committees. Of course it is; and it must be. As for reports, he who measures a man's worth or influence by the number of reports that he writes does not understand how things work in this world. This committee, without writing a line in the way of a report, could have much greater influence than fellows who write reports by the yard.

113,Mr Whitlam.,"I am not going to to £3,500 for the acquisition of a house. The argument that was raised against this amendment when the Opposition put it up on the last sitting day of the last Parliament was that if applicants were able to borrow a greater amount, individually, a ""smallernumber of applicants could borrow at all. That is, the Government was then -trying to help the maximum number of applicants instead of helping applicantswith the maximum need. There is no more money available for war service homes in this financial year now than there was at the time when the Government and its supporters, voted against our amendment. There is still only an amount of £35,000,000 all told, and the arguments then expressed by the honourable member for Maribyrnong and a few others, which were supported by every one in the Government parties, still hold all the' validity that they had then. But they are now disregarded. There are three arguments given by the Minister in favour of this legislation. The first was stated as follows:It is apparent that, to some extent, applications have declined because some ex-service men can no-longer-bridge the gap between the maximum amount of the war service homes loan and the prevailing costs of constructing or of acquiring a home. That is very true. In fact, it was pointed out by the Director of War Service Homes in his annual report a"" month before every Government member and supporter voted against the amendment last October. The"" director reported to us, in his report which he signed on 26th September, and which was tabled-the following dayWhilst inquiries have been received from a large number of eligible persons, it is apparent that many ex-servicemen to obtain war service homes, are not in a position to provide the deposit necesand why the amount of accommodation sary to finance the acquisition of a home.

The second reason given by the Minister exercise a constitutional responsibility in representing in this place the, Minister in respect of housing. I say finally that no charge of the War Service Homes Division adequate initiative has ever been shown by was expressed as follows:. . . the Government .took into account the ing for public servants-agai n a constitu-. housing' needs of ex-servicemen and particularly tional responsibility, in the housing field, of views placed' before if by the Returned Sailors, Soldiers. and Airmen's Imperial League, of Austhe Commonwealth Government -. tralia regarding the maximum loan under the war service homes scheme. It did take those views into account-afte r a long interval. And the views of the Returned Soldiers League o n this subject' ; have been quoted in each'of the last three Budget debates by honourable members oni this side-and have been ignored, and sometimes expresslyrejected, by members of the Government parties. At its forty-third .national congress in October, .1958,. the Returned Soldiers League unanimously passed a resolution that "" the maximum war service homes loan be increased to £3,500 with a corresponding increase in the war service homes Budget allocation"". The Minister for National Development (Senator Spooner) replied that this raised a matter of policy and'should be. kept in abeyance for the time being. So the first reason given by the Minister in introducing this bill was reported to the Parliament a month before honourable members opposite voted against the Opposition's amendment in the last Parliament. The second reason given by the Minister was also public property then, because all of us received the RSL. national congress report three'years before honourable members opposite voted against the amendment. The final reason for this, legislation was stated by the Minister in this wayThis Government believes in the principle ot home ownership and has always accepted the responsibility of encouraging home ownership within its .constitutional powers.. 1 suppose that that is why so many devices have been used to reduce the eligibility of available to immigrants has been reduced, sioners and other recipients of social services, for all of whom this Parliament can this Government in. the provision of housHowever, we are dealing with this broad field of responsibility which applies to men who have enlisted for service overseas or who have served overseas. A war service home was for long the only tangible and predictable advantage of war service. It is true that one could be granted a pension or medical treatment if one were injured, and that one could have a war service land settlement block according to the luck of the ballot; but it used to be the principle that every ex-serviceman who asked for a war service home was able to obtain one. It is only under this Government that rationing schemes have been introduced. First', there was the introduction of the waiting periods. Then there was the intro' duction of the schem'e for interim mortgages. Then there have been various ministerial direotions abrogating the legislative provisions concerning eligibility. For instance, one cannot have a second advance except on very restricted conditions, nurses cannot have war service homes, and so on. The advantages of the war service homes scheme used to be very great, and for those who were able to find, or are able to find, the requisite deposit, they are still very great. The scheme provides for a long period of fepayment, for low interest, for low insurance and for secure occupation in times of economic adversity. But all these advantages depend on the ability to find the necessary deposit, and even the provisions which are now being made belatedly available by this amending bill will not be available to persons who had already received permission to raise interim mortgages-that is, those who had already undertaken, with the division's approval, the usurious interest conditions that apply to interim mortgages. A person who was told, before the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) made his announcem'ent on 6th February, that at that stage he would have to wait twenty months for his loan but in the meantime, if he desired, could receive permission to raise finance elsewhere, still has to wait the full twenty months. He still has to pay the usurious interest, guaranteed by the division, and will get no assistance from this bill in this financial year or, in all probability, in the next financial year, either. I come now to the very restricted benein New South Wales and South Australia, fit that this bill will provide within the £35,000,000 gross made available for war service homes this year. I know that £35,000,000 sounds a great deal, but in actual fact the net cost to the Commonwealth of war service homes this year will be less than it has been in any other year under the Menzies Government, because the repayments now amount to almost two-thirds of the gross advances made in any year. Therefore the cost of war service homes to the Commonwealth this year will be less than it has been in any other year under the Menzies Government. that money. to provide that there should be a revolving fund under this act, as under the housing agreement legislation. matter. tional matter at all, but a matter of statutory enactment by this legislature. The legislature has refused to do it in respect of war service homes, although it has done it under the housing agreement with the States. The amount of £2,750 which formerly applied had applied ever since 1952. At that time that sum was greater than the average cost of house and land for applicants who were assisted by the War Services Homes Division. As honourable members know, the reports of the division contain a table setting out the average cost of dwelling house and land for applicants wbo had received advances from the division during the preceding years. In 1951-52 the average cost of dwelling house and land for applicants who received advances was, in every State, less than £2,750. So when, in 1952, the amount of the advance was raised to £2,750 it was more than enough to cater for the total average cost. ID the last full financial year the average cost of house and land had gone up by £2,000 and even now, with this increased amount of £3,500 available, the average borrower from the War Service Homes Division will have to find more than £1,000 more than £750 in Victoria, and £200 or £250 in the other States.",42,Pairs

But that is the responsibility of the Commonwealth Parliament, because this Parliament can make grants to the States for all purposes on any terms and conditions which it thinks fit. And it has chosen to make inadequate grants to the States for housing. I will deal now with some of the other made available over the last ten years for war service homes applicants.

And this, one remembers, is under a government which believes in exercising to the utmost the Commonwealth's responsibility in housing! Only a month ago the Commonwealth Savings Bank increased its maximum permissible loan from £2,500 to £2,750. It cannot increase the maximum beyond £2,750, no matter what its board desires, until the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) makes new regulations under the act. The Commonwealth Banks Act 1959 permits the Government to prescribe the amount of housing loans to be granted by the bank. On 9th January, 1960, the present Treasurer, by His Excellency's command, gazetted a limit of £2,750. It is true that henceforth one will be able to borrow more from the War Service Homes Division than from most other sources except the housing commissions, but the source which grants the smallest maximum amount is the other direct Commonwealth responsibility, the Commonwealth Savings Bank. Let me remind the House, too, that the advantage that can be gained by approaching the War Service Homes Division rather' than other sources is smaller now than it was when the maximum amount available from the division clear title the division could not do that. was last increased.

The War Service Homes Division cooperated with the electricity and gas authorities by deeming such goods to be, in fact, the property of the applicant, although he had not yet paid for them. Furthermore, many land companies, project builders and estate agents permitted war service homes purchasers, without the execution of mortgages, to occupy property on which the applicants had not yet paid the full price. That is, these development companies, estate agencies and like bodies and individuals trusted the war service homes applicants. They said, "" Very well, we will not take a mortgage over your property. We will trust you to pay off the amount you still owe us."" Many such arangements were made, of course, between members of individual families. Sometimes, I suppose, a deposit was paid by way of dowry, but whatever the procedure, the land and the movables were not owned outright. They had not been fully paid for by the applicant for a war service homes loan.

I conclude, Sir, by fitting the contribution August of last year, by sponsoring an appromade by this legislation into the general housing picture in Australia. It has been our unfortunate experience on three occasions under the Menzies Government to find, after horror budgets and credit squeezes, a catastrophic decline in the number of houses commenced or approved. The value of private housing which was approved in Australia in the calendar year 1960 was £303,770,000. In 1961, the value of new houses and flats approved dropped to £221,931,000. I am referring to nouses and flats financed from private sources. In these circumstances there is all the greater obligation to keep the building industry going, to promote the housing of all Australians, whether by birth or by immigration, by increasing the public contribution to housing. However, no significant increase has been made in this contribution. In 1960, the value of houses approved for construction from government sources was £39,558,000. In 1961, it was still only £42,504,000. In the public sector, Mr Deputy war service homes advances will increase. Speaker, it is obvious that there has been We all know that if the intention of the no significant increase in the amount of act were fulfilled-if everybody who is funds available. In the private sector the eligible for assistance were able to get itamount of funds available has declined by the number of people seeking advances from one quarter. This legislation makes no the War Service Homes Division would be, provision whatever for an increase in the not 70,000, but well over 100,000. funds overall. It makes provision for increased funds for individual applicants, and we believe, Sir, that it is more for a war service home would be longer important to cater for those whose need than it is now. is greatest than for the greatest number.

It will mean that many of the most deserving cases will now receive the benefits of the factor in housing in Australia is that the War Service Homes Act. Unfortunately, domestic building industry has deliberately not everybody who is eligible under the act will be able to get an advance. The Government saw to that in the Budget for the current financial year, which was presented in priation for war service homes of the same amount as had been appropriated in the previous four financial years. This inevitably ensured that the number of applicants receiving assistance thisfinancialyear would be reduced. of applicants be lower? cants has been lower for the reason that it has become increasingly difficult for applicants to accumulate the necessary deposit. That is the reason given by the Director of War Service Homes for the slight decline in the number of applicants. But the director estimates that 70,000 people are still waiting for advances under the act. This means that people who saw active service in Korea ten years ago or in the Second World War at least seventeen years ago will have to wait, on the director's own estimate, at least another five years. I have never known one of these estimates to be pessimistic.

In 1951-52; 1956-57 and 196061, this Government deliberately took measures relating to credit which cut off the sources of housing finance. It took measures which it knew would reduce the' construction of houses and the production of motor cars and which it intended to have that result. These represent the two biggest purchases which most people make throughout their lives. They are therefore the two purchases for which people have to borrow the greatest sum. I certainly do not underrate the difficulties in employment and production in the building industry. Those difficulties' have been due to the demoralization and disruption wrought in the industry by these three applications of the credit squeeze. -Order! I suggest that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has now spent sufficient time answering an interjection. Deputy Speaker. I propose to say no more than that this bill will afford a measure of justice to those ex-servicemen who need it most. Mr Deputy Speaker, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam), in his opening remarks, stated that in October last, during the second-reading debate on the War Service Homes Bill 1961, the honourable member for Lang( Mr Stewart) foreshadowed an amendment which Mr Speaker ruled could not be moved at that stage but could be moved only at the committee stage: The amendment was later proposed by the honourable member for Bass( Mr was built. The Menzies Government has Barnard) in committee. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition and other Opposition members have since chided honourable members on this side of the House for having voted against the amendment, which would have raised the maximum advance from £2,750 to £3,500 as is proposed in the bill now before us. Let us have a look at what was said on that occasion. As reported at page 2592. of "" Hansard "", I discussed the amendment foreshadowed by the .honourable member for Lang on that occasion and saidI have no fault to find with the contention that there is an argument for increasing the amount'of the loan'for a war service home. In fact, there have been many occasions on which ex-servicemen have had to withdraw their applications, because. . in the period between making the applications and. having the loans granted costs have increased to. such an extent that their ready cash has proved insufficient to make up the difference . '. . I went on to say.' . . any attempt to use a bill such as the one now before us, which simply seeks an administrative amendment, as a means for proposing the amendment that the honourable member has foreshadowed represents another political trick . . . For this reason I say that I cannot support the amendment that has been foreshadowed, although I may be in sympathy with the principles underlying it . . . I cannot go along with such tactics,and for that reason alone I will not support the amendment. I would agree that a recommendation could be made to the Government to consider raising the amount of the maximum loan next year. I would go .along with such a recommendation. So much for the accusations made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition! I sug-. gest that the Opposition is again guilty of a cheap political trick similar to that .which I branded as such in October last. I propose to mention just a few of the Leader of the Opposition. He suggested that the Menzies Government has a bad record with respect to war service homes and that the number of applications being processed has fallen under this Government's administration. If we have a look at the record, we see that from the inception of the scheme on 6th March, 1919, to 30th June, 1950-the nearest date after the Menzies Government had taken office for which I could get figures-only 29.3 per cent, of the total number of houses provided under the. scheme were built. Between 30th June, 1950, and 30th June, 1961, 70.7 per cent., of the total number of houses provided 145,806 homes under the scheme compared with 60,000 provided between 6th March, 1919, and 30th June, 1950. This is a striking indication of . the present Government's record. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition stated, also, that the cost of war service homes has not been reduced and that there is no stability in costs. I refer him to the last annual report-of the Director of War Service Homes. It is an excellent document .which presents all the facts concisely and extremely well.

In his report, the director said that only 16 percent, of First World Warex-servicemen who were eligible had applied for and obtained a home through the war service homes scheme.

He then said that if the estimate of 30 per cent, was correct, about 240,000 persons would be provided with homes under this scheme. He reported that at 30th June, 1961, about 170,000 persons had been granted assistance, leaving 70,000 homes to be provided before the full demand would be satisfied. He went on to sayI would expect that these 70,000 homes will be required to be provided at a progressively diminishinterest. Such men are at the time of life ing rate over the next twenty years with, perhaps, the bulk of these being provided within the next five years. I would suggest that the next five years is the time when additionalfinanceshould be provided by the Government to meet the expected demand. The director also pointed out that the waiting time would necessarily be extended because of the increase of the maximum advance. At present, we have a delay of twenty months in the granting of assistance for the purchase of an existing home. The director estimates that 40 per cent, of the outstanding applications will be for assistance to purchase an existing home. If we take into account the repayment of mortgages on existing homes, we could say that a little under 50 per cent, of the total applications are for assistance to purchase an existing home. If the delay is twenty months now and if fewer applications can be met because of the increase in the maximum advance, then it necessarily follows that the applications for assistance to purchase a home, which are estimated at 40 per cent, of the outstanding applications, will be pushed further back and will perhaps be delayed for 24 months. I cannot tolerate this at all. I feel that it amounts to discrimination against an ex-serviceman when he is not allowed to decide what home he will buy. I do not see why he' should-be forced to take a new home, why he should be"" forced to move out into an undeveloped suburb sans sewerage, sans roads, perhaps only with'electric light and water and located at some distance from the nearest transport centre, which means that he going to work, his wife going to do the shopping and his children going to school are all forced to pay high fares. He should not be compelled to live at a great distance from his place of employment or from the school his children attend. If a man chooses a home close to his work and close to a school, he should not be denied the right to buy that home and thereby save himself unnecessary expense in fares. Many men now buying homes are past middle age. They do not want to go pioneering in the new suburbs where the residents are mostly young, newly-married people rearing young families and with whom these men have no community of when they want their wives and themselves to enjoy the convenience of living in a built-up area close to the facilities they have learned to enjoy. I am afraid that this idea of restricting the non-waiting period to new homes only has not been based oa very sound premises. It is all very well to say that the reason behind it was to stimulate the building industry, but it seems quite factual to me that if I buy an existing home the man from whom I buy it has to find somewhere to live and must buy either a new home or an existing home somewhere else. At any rate, somewhere along the line a new home is purchased. Thus the private sector of the building industry must receive a stimulus because of the additional money being spent on war service homes. We must look at this matter again with a view to removing this discrimination against tbe purchase of existing homes. It seems to me to be something that has just developed. As the Director of War Service Homes estimates that in perhaps only five years we shall see the bulk of the remaining potential applications coming before the division to be processed, surely now is the time to straighten out some of these problems. It seems to me intolerable that as it is likely that the bulk of the applications will be attended to and processed within the next five years, we should now have twenty-odd months' delay in the purchase of an existing home or in the satisfying of 40 per cent, of the applications. In the words of the -director, the effect of this provision will be that waiting time will be further protracted. It is time we examined the position with a view to bringing about a balance between existing homes and new homes. I am afraid that there is some departmental feeling that sufficient homes are not being built by the division and if the waiting time on existing homes is eased some of the ex-servicemen who want a new home might not readily be able to get it. Do not let us get down to thinking of that kind. A man should be able to choose the home he wants and should not be directed to outlying areas simply because he is not able to get a new home closer to the city. There are several other matters which cause me a great deal of concern. It is hard to estimate the potential number of outstanding applications. I know that in the metropolitan area of Melbourne, because of the operation of the Landlord and Tenant Act, many landlords became sick and tired of being required to accept low, controlled rentals while their houses got out of repair. They could not afford to repair them, and so, .perforce, they sold the properties to their time when perhaps he cannot afford to pay tenants who, in many cases, were ex-servicemen. They sold their properties to these tenants on low deposits and rental terms. This was a god-send to many ex-servicemen as well as to many people who were not ex-servicemen. As these people obtain a greater equity in the homes or pay them off, they put them on the market; sell them and then say, "" Wewill now go for our war service home "". This is happening in quite a number of cases. There are people at present housed who still will claim their right, and properly so, to a war service home. So it is hard to estimate with any exactitude what the outstanding potential is. Nevertheless, when I examined the figures I found a remarkable difference between New South Wales and Victoria in this connection. The total advances made in New South Wales under the scheme since its inception amount to about £131,000,000 while advances in Victoria amount to about £125,000,000. In 1960-61, New South Wales had 6,896 applications for an expenditure of £16,000,000 while in Victoria there were only 3,827 applications involving an expenditure of £9,000,000. This bears out my argument that, from the inception of the scheme, about the same amount of money has been spent in each State, but, over the past year-in fact I think the pattern has remained constant over the last few yearsthere have been almost double the number of applications and almost double the amount of money spent in New South Wales because so many people in Victoria have been able to buy homes as tenants, and many of these people will ultimately apply for a war service-home. This could mean that in the next few years about 3,000 people per annum could be added to the back-log of 70,000 unsatisfied applicants mentioned by the director. Another point about the operation of the act which has always caused me a great deal of concern relates to what is known, perbaps wrongly, as second assistance. The act quite rightly lays it down that the home must be bought, but there is some misconception about what is the actual repatriation benefit to tbe ex-serviceman. Is it the home he buys, or is it the loan he gets? I may be wrong, but it is my opinion that the repatriation benefit is the loan. If he gets a loan on the property of his choice at a more and when he has one child, and if, as his family grows, he wishes to buy a larger house, or if he is transferred to another State and is compelled to buy another home, I feel that, provided the second security is acceptable to the division, he should be able to transfer the amount outstanding on the home which was first secured. In other words, he should be able to transfer the outstanding amount, and no more, of the first loan-the repatriation benefit-to the second security. that. it is a point that should be looked at. I emphasize that I am not asking that a second loan be granted; I am merely suggesting that the amount borrowed from the division as a repatriation benefit should be capable of being transferred in the exact amount granted less the amount repaid.",49,Pairs

141,Mr Barnard (Bass) [8.25],"I havemember will find no difficulty in convincing members of the Opposition on matters such as the advance that should be given for war service homes, the waiting period for a loan and similar problems associated with applications for war service homes. What concerns me and most members of the Opposition is whether the honourable member has been able to convince members of the Government he supports. It is they who have to be convinced. Nevertheless, it is pleasing to know that at least one supService Homes Division (Senator Spooner) porter of the Government is prepared to stand behind the Opposition on matters it has been raising in the Parliament for many years. The honourable member began his speech by saying that when I moved in this Parliament on behalf of the Opposition in October, 1961, an amendment designed to increase the maximum advance of £2,750 to £3,500, it was a mere political stunt. I assure supporters of the Government that 6uch a proposal was not merely something thought up by the Opposition. It had been supported by the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia and every other interested organization for many years. They recognized that the maximum advance allowed for ex-servicemen was not sufficient to enable them to buy the sort of home to which they were entitled under the War Service Homes Act. If the honourable member for Maribyrnong wants to join issue with me on that, point, I remind him that when I moved an amendment in the House for an increase in the advance to £3,500, he had an opportunity of voting with the Opposition, but with every other member on the Government side, he voted against our amendment. clear for the honourable member in vided with homes through the War Services"" Hansard "". The Opposition does not oppose tbe bill. from £2,750 to £3,500, this would require After all we have moved on a number of an increase of approximately £12,000,000 occasions, and as recently as October, 1961, in the overall Budget allowance. That for an increase in the maximum advance to would be an increase from £35,000,000 to the figure that is now proposed in this legis£47,000,000. The Minister said that if lation. We have advocated such an increase in Budget debates and particularly when measures affecting war service homes have been before the House. We are pleased that the Government has now acknowledged its responsibility and proposes to increase the advance for war service homes. A similar proposal was moved on 24th August, 1961, in another place. On that occasion, the Minister in charge of the War said that it was not possible to increase the maximum advance to £3,500, and he gave several reasons why it could not be done. Yet less than six months later, the Minister has moved in that direction. I have been amazed to find that the arguments raised earlier by the Minister in another place to explain why the maximum advance should not be increased are the very reasons why the Government has decided to increase the overall allocation as suggested by the honourable member for Maribyrnong. Certainly, that is not the complete answer. We agree that the maximum advance should be increased. It has. been, increased. But certainly the amount of £35,000,000 which is now available for war service homes will not be sufficient to meet the number of applications that will be made during this financial year. Simple arithmetic will indicate at once that if the maximum advance is increased by £750 and the overall allocation is left at £35,000,000,.the same number of homes cannot be acquired as previously. The Opposition believes, therefore, that as well as increasing the maximum advance, the Government should have moved to increase the overall Budget allocation for'the War Service Homes Division. Let'me return to the Minister's statement on this measure. As reported in "" Hansard"" in August, 1961, the Minister was adamant that the maximum advance should not be increased. He said that annually approxiHomes Division. The Minister argued that, if the maximum advance were increased",52,Pairs
142,Mr Stokes,I told you why.,53,Pairs
143,Mr Barnard,"The record is quite mately 14,150 applicants were being prothere were no increase in the Budget provision for the War Service Homes Division only 10,700 applicants could be assisted annually instead of the 14,150 applicants to whom I have just referred. Surely, Mr number of applications for war service Deputy Speaker, if that is the situation, the honourable member for Maribyrnong was quite-correct in saying that the Government should increase the overall allocation as well as increasing the maximum advance to £3,500. It is perfectly true, as the Minister has indicated, that the number of applications for war service homes dropped, particularly during the financial year, 1960-61. In 1959-60, 20,833 applications were received by the War Service Homes Division compared with 21,935 in 1958-59. In fact, Mr Homes in which the director indicated that Deputy Speaker, the number of applications had remained fairly constant at around the 20,000 mark but in 1960-61 the figure dropped to 16,040 applications. The Minister has now used the fall in the number of applications to suggest that the £35,000,000 now available for war service homes will be sufficient to enable the same number of applications to be satisfied each year. This is completely contrary to the point of view expressed by members of the Opposition. I believe that Government supporters should ask themselves whether the fall in applications in 1960-61 was due merely to a slackening of the demand for war. service homes. We do not believe that it was. We believe that other factors were involved. Those factors are closely related to the Government's economic measures of 1960. Not only was there a fall in the demand .for war-service homes in 1960-61 but there was a fall in demand for all types of homes throughout Australia. This was because insufficient finance was available to those who wished to purchase homes. I submit that, because the maximum advance has been increased to £3,500, there will be an immediate increase in the number of applications to the War Service Homes Division. I have no hesitation in saying that the finanunnecessary waiting period that had been cial year 1961-62 will again find the number of applications to the War Service Homes Division around the figure of 21,000. The reason, for the fall in applications for war service homes cannot have been merely a slackening in the demand for the homes as suggested by the Minister. The real reason was the economic measures inflicted by the Government on the people of this country. A second reason for the fall in the homes was probably the abnormally large deposit that was required. The Government has now moved to overcome that factor. That is one further reason why the number of applicants for war service homes will increase in the nextfinancialyear. It would be completely wrong' for the Minister to assume, as I believe he has assumed, that there has been a fall in applications because the demand for war service homes has been largely satisfied. The honourable member for Maribyrnong quoted to the House from the report of the Director of War Service 16 per cent, of ex-servicemen, from the First World War who were eligible for war service homes had made applications for assistance-from the division. The'percentage, of course, is much lower in respect of ex-servicemen from the Second World War. It is perfectly obvious, therefore, that if the maximum advance is to become more generous, as it will be under-the terms of this legislation, the number of applicants will be increased. I turn now, Mr Deputy Speaker, to another factor in relation to. war service homes which has been evident since the present Government assumed office. I refer to the waiting period. I believe that this factor, too, will be influenced by the fact that the Government, on the one hand, has increased the maximum advance, but, on the other, has taken no action at all to increase the overall amount that will be available during this financial year to the War Service Homes Division. Almost since the inception of this Government, there has been a waiting period for those who have applied for war service homes finance. In 1955, I moved for the adjournment of this House in order to draw attention to the enforced by the present Government. We are told by the Minister for National Development that there is no waiting period for 60 per cent, of applicants to the War Service Homes Division. On the other hand, there is a waiting period for 40 per cent, of applicants. Three types of assistance are available from the War Service Homes Division. Assistance may be obtained to purchase an existing home, which may have been erected for a number of years. The waiting period in respect of such, assistance varies from State to State. In Tasmania, it is approximately eighteen months. In New South Wales, I understand, it is approximately twenty months. I submit that, sixteen years having passed since the end of the last war, it is a serious indictment of this Government that applicants should have to wait twenty months to receive financial assistance to purchase a home to which they are entitled under the act. In recent years, because of the low maximum advance, more and more ex-servicemen have been obliged to turn to the purchase of an existing home as an alternative to building anew home. The value of an existing home purchased by an ex-serviceman would be much less than that of a new home. They have been forced to this course because of ministerial directions,. yet they have still been obliged to face a waiting period which varies from eighteen to twenty months. If it was possible in 1959 to show the faults in the implementation of the legislation and to show the hardships being imposed on ex-servicemen as a result of the long waiting period, these can be shown even more cogently to-day. I turn again to the subject of group homes. Here again the situation is much the same in that a long waiting period is involved. I have no desire to single out any particular section of the War Service Homes Division, because I wish to voice no criticism of the people there who, I believe, Another ministerial direction by the Minisdo their best under very difficult circumstances. I shall merely give an example of what has happened in the city of Launceston, in northern Tasmania, where no group homes have been built for three years or more, although there are now five under construction. In that situation, ex-serviceDivision because of a ministerial direction. men have to get homesby some other means, and the means that they have to use is the purchase of existing homes. An ex-serviceman forced by circumstances to accept that alternative should not be obliged supports that. We advocated it in 1960 to find the money to cover a waiting period of approximately twenty months before the :division .is prepared to discharge the mortgage. It is true that in respect of new homes the division has been somewhat more generous. Recently, the Minister for National Development issued a direction that a home newly erected which had not been lived in could be purchased immediately by an applicant. The same thing applies to an ex-serviceman who has an existing home and desires to build with the aid of the department. There is no waiting period in those cases, and neither should there be in the case of an ex-serviceman who is obliged to. purchase an existing home. NowI turn to the subject of existing mortgages. Unfortunately, when one deals with the war service homes legislation one realizes that there have been so many ministerial directions affecting the legislation that it is difficult to understand the legal provisions merely by examining the bill itself. The Minister for National Development frequently issues ministerial directions regarding war service homes. One of the directions he has issued is a regulation governing existing mortgages. Before this Government came to office it was possible for an ex-serviceman who qualified under the act to have his mortgage discharged by the War Service Homes Division. This Government changed that practice. The reason for its doing so has never, been given to this Parliament, and an ex-serviceman who was purchasing his home before he enlisted for active service, and later became qualified for a war service home under the act, is no longer able to have his mortgage transferred to the War Service Homes Division from such other lending institution as holds it. ter for National Development! The Opposition believes that the Government should seriously consider the position of the people to whom I have referred who, through no fault of their own, cannot transfer an existing mortgage to the War Service Homes The maximum advance under the legislation is being increased to £3,500. I have already acknowledged that the Opposition and 1961 and we believe it is long overdue. Let me point out at once, however, that because of the greatly, increased prices of existing and new homes even now the maximum advance will not be overgenerous. In New South Wales an ex-serviceman who purchases a home through the War Service Homes Division-and I quote the division's own figures-wil l have to find, according to the 1960-61 report of the Director of War Service Homes, a deposit of £1,003. An ex-serviceman in Victoria will have to find a deposit of £756 and an ex-serviceman in South Australia a deposit of £1,150. An ex-serviceman in the Australian Capital Territory, despite the increase in the maximum advance by £750, will be obliged to find a deposit of £2,875-and this in respect of the. house only, excluding the land. So we say that the new maximum advance is certainly not over-generous. If we compare it with thc generous treatment available to people who are not ex-servicemen, and therefore, not eligible persons under the legislation, who are seeking assistance from Government institutions, we see how harsh is the lot of the ex-servicemen. I point out that in such cases in New South Wales and Tasmania no deposit is required. Yet, I repeat, in the Australian Capital. Territory an ex-serviceman is obliged to find a deposit, of £2,875. We do not regard the increase in the maximum loan from £2,750 to £3,500 as overgenerous, but at least it . will assist ex-servicemen who have hitherto not been able to bridge the gap between' tbe maximum advance and the cost of a home. I want to refer once again to a matter already raised by the honourable member be a serious indictment of this Government if the number' of war service homes -completed by the division in this financial year falls because of failure to increase the Budget allocation to the War Service Homes Division. I am prepared to accept the argument advanced by the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr honourable member for Bass( Mr Barnard) McMahon), when he was trying to answer the Opposition's case for an increased maximum advance some time ago, that unless the Government increased the overall allocation to the division from £35,000,000 to £47,000,000 there would be a reduction to 10,700 in the number of homes constructed by the division in any one year. When the Deputy Leader of the Opposition -( Mr Whitlam) opened the debate to-day he pointed out that the Government is not making available £35,000,000 each year for war service homes. Any one who takes the trouble to study the annual report of the Director of War Service Homes will see at once that from its returns from interest, rent and other items outlined in the report the Government received from its war service homes transactions at least £12,000,000 during the last financial year. I have no doubt that that figure will be increased substantially during the present financial year; so if we reduce the £35,000,000 by approximately £12,000,000 we find that the Government is making available no more than£23,000,000 annually for the purpose of providing war service homes in this country. If that is factual, then obviously the Government should have taken the opportunity, as the Minister for National Development so rightly pointed out, to increase the overall allocation from £35,000,000 to at least £47,000,000, as his figures suggested. If the Government is prepared to accept the arguments advanced by thc honourable member for Maribyrnong as well as by honourable members on this side of the House with regard to the overall amount of £35,000,000, the waiting period, which is. a serious indictment of this Government, and the cost of the homes-in many parts of Australia the maximum deposit will even now be far too high in relation to the average income of the ex-serviceman who wishes to apply for a home through the -division-the Opposition will be prepared to agree that the Government is attempting in some way to honour the obligations contained in the original War Service Homes Act. On the other hand, we do not oppose the opportunity that is being taken at this stage to increase the maximum advance from £2,750 to £3,500. has spoken, as usual, with a very thorough knowledge of this subject, to which he has obviously given considerable studya knowledge which, in view of recent events, does not appear to have been shared by his party. There are other matters to which I will refer later, but at this point I wish to deal with the purposes of the bill, which are twofold: Firstly, to give additional financial assistance to ex-servicemen seeking",53,Pairs

The bill is a simple one and does not appear to require a great deal of debate. It was introduced in another place and passed, I think, with the minimum number of speeches required. Its passage through another place took only a few hours. I notice that clause 2 of the bill provides that the legislation shall come into operation on the day upon which it receives the Royal Assent. To my mind this is an important provision. It is one which was overlooked to-day by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam), who spoke for 35 minutes on this measure. He should not have required to speak for more than five minutes on it.

That is a position which often arises when we are debating subjects such as this. I recall that when the honourable member for Bass moved an amendment to the War Service Homes Bill 1961 before the committee last October he sought to raise the amount of the advance by £750, but I do not recollect that there was in his amendment provision for raising or budgeting for an increased amount of money to meet that increase in the advance. ment to decide. whole thing.

The services referred to may be the provision of sewerage, or road-making, or the amount may be used for the enlargement of an existing war service home when the applicant can satisfy the Director of War Service Homes that the additional accommodation is necessary in order to house his family adequately. We have here a bill which makes provisions that ex-servicemen have been seeking for a number of years. The Government has found that the number of applications has declined in recent months, and as a large part of the financial year has passed, the Government can see ahead and has decided that it can make these alterations, increasing the maximum amount of loan available in individual cases and reducWhy, Mr Speaker, we are advancing only ing the deposits that applicants are required to produce. I should have thought that the Opposition would not want to take up a great deal of time in discussing this legislation. I should have thought it would want to see this bill passed as quickly as possible. It was introduced in another place, and it has only to be passed in this House. As soon as it is passed in this chamber and receives the Royal Assent, the additional amounts will become available for those who require them. For that reason I am not going to take up any more of the time of the House. example. I merely say that none of the charges of negligence in the administration of the War Service Homes Division, which have been levelled at this Government, can be justified. I say also that the officers of the department have been most helpful, as all honourable members know, to those who have applied to the department for assistance. They have also been most helpful to members of this ParUament who have taken up specific cases with them when, perhaps, a particular applicant has been suffering from an incapacity which has prevented him from approaching the department in person. The department has given us an example of what a government department can do to help people who not only require assistance but are also entitled to it. We have nothing to be ashamed of in our administration, over the years, of the War Service Homes Division. Rather can we be proud of it, as the honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull) has said. Tbe total amount of advances that have been made by the division-admittedl y it has been in existence for many years-is £418,000,000. Some years ago we were able to claim that this Government had advanced more money for war service homes than all other governments put together. This, of course, holds good to-day, and we can now say that of the total amount of £418,000,000 advanced, this Government has provided £382,000,000. In other words, all other governments put together have advanced only £36,000,000. £1,000,000 short of that amount every year! For some years the amount provided each year in the various budgets for war service homes has been £35,000,000. I say, therefore-and I shall be as brief as possible-that this bill is one that should receive the ready approval of the whole House. It embodies the highest of ideals, increasing the maximum amount available for individual loans and reducing the amount of deposit required. Tbe extra money is provided not only for the building or purchase of a new home, but also for additions and necessary alterations to existing homes. In presenting this measure to the House, the Government is proud of its record of administration of the War Service Homes Act. Mr L. R. JOHNSON (Hughes) [9.4] The honourable member for Lawson( Mr Failes) can be quite sure that the Opposition will be no more desirous of delaying this measure now than it ever has been.

151,Mr Failes,"I intend to set ancan properly be laid at the door of honourable members opposite, including the honourable member'who has just resumed his seat. ' He and his colleagues strenuously opposed a' proposal along these lines when it was made in this House by the Opposition in October last. It was opposed also by Government supporters* in the other place in August of 1951. There is some kind of hypocrisy inherent in the honourable member's attitude this evening. . I agree with, the honourable member for Lawson that the War Service Homes. Division has done a most praiseworthy job over the years. The division was established in 1919, and many years have elapsed. since then. In theintervening period, about £400,000,000 has been expended on war service homes, about 200,000 homes having been provided for ex-servicemen. The war service homes scheme is a very good one,principally because' it provides money at rates of interest which are a good deal lower than those 'available from most other sources. It also provides for repayments over .extended periods,. and it allows the applicant in many cases a choice of locality, site and design of home. It is unfortunate that this excellent scheme has been marred by certain deficiencies which should have been put right by the Government some considerable time ago. The belated endeavour that is. now being made to correct some of these deficiencies and shortcomings is to be appreciated, but we claim that it does not go far. enough. --The 'deficiencies that have been most apparent in recent years have included the inadequate amount of the maximum loan available. Up' to now the maximum has been £2,750. Another glaring deficiency has been the long period of waiting between the time of making application and the time ofgranting a loan. In. many cases applicants have had to seek temporary finance, at high interest rates, to tide them over .this period. Another .cause for. complaint has been the Government's unwillingness to meet claims for second assistance. This has been referred to at some length this evening. ; It is interesting to read in a volume of "" Hansard"" for the year 1921 a speech by the honourable member for Bonython( Mr for homes to be provided by the .various Makin), who, fortunately for us all, is still in this place,-in which he. complained about. the high interest rates being charged at that time for housing finance and about the long waiting period before loans were granted by the War Service Homes Division His speech reads very much like the speeches that one hears in the Parliament at the present time Since 1949, when this Government came to office, we of the Opposition have been making complaints of the kind made by the honourable member for Bonython in 1921, but unfortunately our grievances have not been redressed as they should have been. The purpose of this bill ""is to overcome one of the main problems, by increasing the maximum amount of a loan from £2,750 to £3,500, and by reducing the amount of deposit by £750. The ""Minister for National Development (Senator Spooner), when introducing this bill in another place, said quite plainly that thelegislation is being introduced because -of the housing shortage. We on this side of the Parliament, while fully appreciating the value of the legislation, believe that there are other reasons for the Government's action. Thedisapproval shown by the people at the election in November is another cause of the Government's renewed interest in this matter. This is apparent when one considers the way in which the Government steadfastly refused to implement these proposals when they were put forward by the Opposition a short time before the election. The Government has suddenly come to appreciate the extent of the concern felt throughout Australia with, regard to its policies. On 21st February, the Minister said in another placeThe Government's recent review of the national economy showed that an increase in the homebuilding rate was desirable That is a most profound utterance by the Minister! We have been waiting ""for"" such a declaration of concern for a long time. No one can deny the truth of that statement. There.is indeed a great housing shortage in Australia. In fact, what the Minister said would constitute the understatement of the year. If any proof is needed of the fact that a serious housingshortage exists, I can say that 71,353 Australian families were waiting in June, 1961/ State housing commissions. In the year. 1960-61 .the. number of new applications received by the housing commissions totalled 42,637. -Order! I ask the honourable member not to stray too far from the subject before the Chair. We are discussing the War Service Homes Division and not the State housing commissions. Mr L. R. JOHNSON -It is quite true that the situation in regard to the War Service Homes Division is similar to that in which the building societies, the housing commissions and the other authorities and institutions providing housing finance now find themselves. There is a long waiting list of applicants for assistance under the War Service Homes Act. At 30th June last year 15,374 applicants were waiting. This was 16 long years after the war, and applications were still coming in, during that year, at the rate of 16,040 per annum. So we have quite some distance to go. I think that the Minister for National Development probably believes that he can raise the amount that an ex-serviceman may borrow and not increase the total allocation of funds because the number of applicants will very rapidly diminish. However, I am not sure that the number will diminish. The annual report of the Director of War Service Homes for 1960-61, at page 8, statesOf the total number who enlisted for service in the Second World War and in the' Korean and Malayan operations, it is thought that there would be about 800,000 ex-servicemen who could be eligible for War Service Homes benefits. Therefore, if the estimate that 30 per cent, will eventusolve one problem and, in the process, it ally seek and obtain assistance is correct, about 240,000 eligible persons will be provided with a borne under the Scheme. The report goes on to state that about 170,000 eligible ex-servicemen of the Second World War and the operations in Korea and. Malaya have been granted assistance and that the Commonwealth could be called on to provide a further 70,000 homes. That number of additional homes may be required over a long or a short period, and there is no room for placation on the part of the Government. There is no occasion for the apathetic attitude which it has exhibited by failing to make sufficient' funds available. There is no doubt, Sir, that the limitation of the loan has in fact been a deterpresent rent to many intending applicants. We is giving assistance to 14,150 applicants annually. 4 wonder why the Government has not taken action earlier to increase the amount that an ex-serviceman may borrow. The Minister for National Development, in his second-reading speech on this, bill in another place, saidIt is apparent that, to some extent, applications have declined because some ex-servicemen can no longer bridge the gap between the maximum amount of the war service homes loan and the prevailing costs of acquiring a home. In the Government's recent review of the national economy this was accepted as a factor whicb was preventing many ex-servicemen from taking advantage of the benefits offered by the war service homes scheme. We rjn this side of the House pointed out that position years and years ago, and so did the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia. We wonder why there has been so much delay. We wonder why the Government has quibbled in this regard. It is a matter for concern that no additional funds are being made available by increasing the appropriation for war service homes. The net effect of the Government's proposal, of course, is that some people will get bigger loans and others will have to wait longer for the money that they need. With no increase of the allocation of £35,000,000 made in the last Budget, we can reasonably assume that if some individual loans are increased there will undoubtedly be a corresponding decrease in the number of loans made. The Government, in effect, then, sets out to quite unnecessarily creates another very serious problem. This bill undoubtedly will result in longer waiting periods. Therefore, many ex-servicemen will be forced to seek temporary finance. This is not just my view; it is the view of the Minister for National Development. He is the authority for my statement. On 24th August, 1961, at the committee stage of the consideration of the War Service Homes Bill 1961 in another place, when the Opposition moved an amendment designed to have the maximum advance increased by the amount now proposed, the Minister, replying to the Opposition's arguments in support of the amendment, retortedUnder the existing arrangements, from the allocation of £35,000,000 the Government",58,Pairs
152,Mr Speaker (Hon. Sir John Mcleay).,"If the maximum loan were increased to £3,500, sion, find it necessary to seek the division's the servicing of the same number of applicants in a comparable manner would require an increase of expenditure from £35,000,000 to £47,000,000. That was the Minister's attitude as stated not so long ago in another place. Yet, on the present occasion, we find that no additional allocation of funds is to be made. The conclusions to be drawn from the Minister's comment are clear. I want to discuss, briefly, Mr Speaker, the point that the maximum limit of advance proposed is no more than is absolutely necessary. The annual report of the Director of War Service Homes for 1960-61 makes this quite clear. At page 22, it indicates that the average cost of a war service home, including both land and dwelling, in 1960-61 ranged from £3,708 in Tasmania to £6,375 in the Australian Capital Territory. In each case, the amount spent by an ex-serviceman is in excess of the maximum advance proposed in this bill. In New South Wales, where the largest number of war service homes applications was approved last financial year, and in quite a number of years before, for that matter, 6,189 applications were approved last financial year at an average cost of £4,503 for the dwelling and land. The proposed maximum advance of £3,500 was exceeded by the average cost in New South Wales and Victoria in 1956-57, in Queensland in 1960-61, in South Australia in 1955-56, in Western Australia in 1958-59, in Tasmania in 1959-60, and in the Northern Territory in 1956-57. As far back as the records go, the proposed maximum advance has been exceeded by the average cost in the Australian Capital Territory. So there is nothing unusually generous in the Government's proposal. In 1960-61, the average cost of dwelling house and land was £4,503 in New South Wales, £4,256 in Victoria, £3,739 in Queensland, £4,650 in South Australia, £3,762 in Western Australia, £3,708 in Tasmania, £6,375 in the Australian Capital Territory and £3,738 in the Northern Territory. I emphasize that these are only averages and that many ex-servicemen who want to borrow a good deal more than these amounts will not be assisted adequately under the terms of this bill. The fact that quite a number of ex-servicea men, as a result of inadequate funds availgroup of applicants-3 8 per cent, of them able through the War Service Homes Divi-see k to purchase an existing home. It permission to obtain finance from other sources is worth mentioning, Mr Speaker. This matter was the subject of a question on notice, the answer to which appears in the "" Hansard"" of this House, of 1st September, 1960, at page 771. It is interesting to see what is involved in the obtaining of temporary finance. A survey was made in June, 1960, and we were able to ascertain that many ex-servicemen had paid high rates of interest for tbe money which they had borrowed over short terms. In March, 1960, 70 applicants were given approval to raise temporaryfinanceat rates not exceeding 5 i per cent.; 246 at rates exceeding 5 i per cent, but not exceeding 7 per cent.; 96 at rates exceeding 7 per cent, but not exceeding 8 per cent.; 47 at rates exceeding8 per cent, but not exceeding 9 per cent.; 109 at rates exceeding 9 per cent, but not exceeding 10 per cent.; and four at rates above 10 per cent. A total of 572 applicants were given approval in that month to raise temporary finance. They were forced to seek temporary accommodation at these expensive rates. Only 70 of them were able to get their temporaryfinanceat rates not exceeding 5 i per cent. Banks accommodated 268 of the 572 applicants, or fewer than half. Private money-lenders assisted 261, and 43 obtained the money from finance companies and building societies. Honourable members can readily see the effect of temporary finance. Many of these people were not raising only the £2,750; they were raising the total cost of the home. We put it to the Government that the lucrative nature of the war service homes scheme is such that the need for temporary finance and long waiting periods can easily be eliminated. The honourable member for Lawson said that there were insuperable problems in this. We are able to say to him that we would not for one moment stand for a continuation of these deficiencies in the scheme. We would find a way to overcome the difficulties. The waiting period is still twenty months for' assistance to purchase an existing property and eighteen months for the extension of home. We must realize that the biggest is. quite clear that this bill does not contemplate reducing the waiting time or relieving these applicants of the expense of temporary finance. These problems are not to be solved by this legislation. I want to make some reference to the cost of borrowing from the War Service Homes Division. The principle of usury has come to prevail here to a far greater extent than is necessary. I shall give honourable members some figures and ask that they reflect on them. An ex-serviceman who borrows £2,750 over a period of 45 years, repaying at the rate of £10 l is . a month, finally pays no less than £5,625. A war widow could obtain a loan for a period of 50 years and repay it at £10 13s. l d . a month. For that £2,750, she would repay no less than £6,082. Thc interest on £2,000 is £6 5s. a month or 6s. 3d. for each £100. This is dead money. For every £16 owed, ls. a month interest is paid. The interest on £2,750 for one month is as high as £8 l is . l i d . Thus, an ex-serviceman's repayments are loaded with interest. ' The excess of revenue from interest charges over administrative expenses in any year is considerable. My colleague, the honourable member for Wills( Mr Bryant), Was the last honourable member to examine this question thoroughly. On 30th April, 1957, at page 913 of ""Hansard"", the honourable member obtained advice from the Minister to the effect that the excess of interest payments over administrative expenses from the beginning of the war service homes scheme in 1919 to 28th February, 1959, was £37,594,619. That is the profit that governments, Labour and Liberal, have derived from the war service homes scheme. This profit has resulted from the conduct of the business of providing homes for ex-servicemen. In the year 1960-61, interest payments amounted to honourable member is now going a little away from the purpose of the measure before the.Chair. I ask him to come back to the subject of the bill.

I ask him to be reasonable in making passing references and to come back to the measure before the Chair. MrL . R. JOHNSON I am talking about the measure precisely. At this moment, I am talking about the Government's proposal to increase the amount that ex-servicemen can borrow. I think that is an appropriate subject to talk about. able member would not have been interrupted if he had been in order. MrL . R. JOHNSON I was saying member will not argue. I ask him to proceed with his speech. MrL . R. JOHNSON I am proceeding as you suggest, Sir. The Government could be more generous and provide a larger loan for ex-servicemen than is provided even by this legislation. I have no doubt that a revolving fund technique would enable the Government to assist ex-servicemen much more than it has done so far, for instance, by directing the profits that I have mentioned to the acquisition of land. That would be a big help to ex-servicemen because they would be involved in a smaller outlay for the homes that they hope to acquire. I think it is appropriate for me to talk about second assistance.

158,Mr Speaker,"Order! The honorable members, including members of the Government parties, have done so in this debate at some considerable length. The honourable member for Maribyrnong took the view that it would be desirable in certain circumstances for an ex-serviceman to be able to dispose of his home and direct the proceeds and the unexpended amount of the war service loan to the acquisition of another home. I have always been at a loss to understand why the Minister has been reluctant to cooperate with ex-servicemen who have made such a request. An ex-serviceman may want to change from one home to another for many reasons. One reason may be sickness. I have had cases in which a family has developed an asthmatic condition and has wanted to move to a more suitable climate. An application to dispose of the home and to apply the proceeds and the unexpended amount of the loan-no t additional money-to the purchase of another home has not been approved. In other circumstances, ex-servicemen have moved from one place to another because of the requirements of their employment. For instance, ex-servicemen have come from the northern coal-fields where employment opportunities have terminated, to the southern fields in my electorate. The Government has taken the view that in circumstances such as these, the ex-servicemen should not be given the right to use the unexpended part of his war service loan. Serious consideration should be given to reversing this decision. The latest case to come under my notice in which such an application was made concerns an ex-serviceman who borrowed from a company building society. It was the S.T.C. Building Society. After he terminated his employment, the company building society told him that he must relinquish his loan. As an eligible ex-serviceman, he made application to the War Service Homes Division for a loan. I was surprised that in this case the decision was given not by the deputy director in a State, but by the director. The decision was that a war service loan could not be granted because the ex-serviceman now had assistance from a building society. We looked into this matter carefully and we were able order is involved. to ascertain that if the ex-serviceman was forced to dispose of his home and return of order on your decision. what he could to the building society, he then would be able to make application to the War Service Homes Division and repurchase the home he loved so dearly and was so reluctant to sell in the first place. This sort of bureaucratic control Mr L. R. JOHNSON -That is for Mr Speaker to decide. He does not need the advice of anybody else. I suggest that the Minister for Social Services( Mr Roberton), who is sitting at the table, and who has never shown a great deal of interest in these things, might take particular notice of the matters that I have raised to-night. I have received able member now bringing up an individual case? Mr L. R. JOHNSON-No, I have passed, that. honourable member to co-operate with the Chair, otherwise I shall have to ask him to resume his seat. 1 ask him to confine his remarks to the subject-matter before the Chair. If the honourable member will resume his seat for a moment I shall explain the position for the information of all honourable members. The second-reading debate on a bill is primarily an opportunity to consider the principles of the bill and should not deal with matters of detail which can be discussed at the committee stage. Debate is not strictly limited to the contents of the bill and may include reasonable reference to matters relevant to the bill, the necessity for the proposals, alternatives to the provisions, the recommendation of objects of the same or similar nature, and reasons opposed to the bill's progress, but discussion of these matters should not be allowed to supersede debate of the subject-matter of the bill.

Does not the honourable member for Hughes realize that the money that was made available for war service homes had to be borrowed from the people and that interest had to be paid on it? It would seem that he does not. The War Service Homes Division charges the very moderate interest rate of 3 i per cent, and I should be very surprised if the Government was able to borrow money anywhere at 3 i per cent. It is more than likely that it is paying 5 per cent, or more for the money. I am sure that the ex-servicemen would not expect something for nothing. They do expect to have to pay and, in fact they are getting a particularly good bargain with their war service homes. That is one of the reasons why the scheme has been so very popular and why we have run into some of the difficulties and anomalies that we have encountered. Because the ex-serviceman can get a loan from the War Service Homes Division at a rate of interest far lower than he would have to pay elsewhere, there has been a heavy demand for loans. Most of the applicants have built their homes. Some of them have been in their homes for some time and look upon these loans as a means of getting money at a lower rate of interest than they could get it from anywhere else. They regard the saving in interest as being as good as money in their pockets. your previous ruling, Mr Speaker, do you mum loan fixed at £2,750, an amount of £1,050 not think that the honourable member is £2,750)must be lodged as a deposit (i.e. all in excess of rather wide of the principles contained in the measure? member is in order.

That has not been who were eligible for homes have obtained necessary so far. posed to refer briefly to matters raised by decline may also be due to the improved the honourable member for Hughes, and I position in relation to loans for housing think I have done so. I have shown that because the Minister for National Developthe war service homes scheme is not a ment (Senator Spooner) stated recentlylucrative scheme but one that has cost the Government quite a considerable amount during of money. This bill proposes to increase by £750 the banks maximum loan that may be made available depositors in the banks concerned. Finance is to ex-servicemen for the purchase of a also generally available through building and war service home. It will be of great advantage to many ex-servicemen. Before bringing down this measure, the Government took into account the views of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia. One of the reasons for the fall-off in the demand for war service homes has been the fact that ex-servicemen have experienced great difficulty in bridging the gap between the cost of purchasing a home and the maximum amount they could borrow under the provision of the ""War Service Homes Act. We all know that the average cost of building a war service home in Australia to-day is about £4,050 and hitherto there has been a large gap between the maximum advance and the cost of a home, and some ex-servicemen could not bridge it. On the basis of the average cost of building a borne they would require a deposit of £550 in addition to the amount they could get from the War Service Homes Division. As the director said recentlyThe benefit to ex-servicemen from the increase in tbe maximum loan in relation to the deposit requirements is illustrated by the example of a home costing £3,800. When the amendments come into operation, a deposit of only £300 will be necessary where assistance is made available under the rent-purchase conditions provided in Part IV. of the act. Where assistance is made available by way of an advance on mortgage under Part V. of the act, the amount of deposit required will be £380. As the Act stands at present, with the maxiunder both Parts. As I have said, there has been a decline in the number of applications for war service a dwelling in one way or another.

The Government has assisted more people to buy homes because the £35,000,000 it has voted has covered more cases since there has been a fall in the number of applicants. First, the Government abolished the waiting period. This was of great advantage to ex-servicemen because in effect it saved them about £200 in interest by eliminating the cost of temporary finance. The measures introduced in November, 1960, with which some people disagreed, were responsible for reducing building costs. In Queensland, the cost of building a war service home was reduced by some £300. In New South Wales, the cost was reduced by £125. As the number of applications for loans has fallen, the Government has been able to accede to many requests made from both sides of the House and by ex-servicemen for an increase in the maximum loan. So we can be proud of the Government's record. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) tried to make capital out of the various measures that the Government has had to adopt to ration the money available; but let us pay credit where it is due and realize that the Government has a magnificent record. To-day, 10 per cent, of all homes built in Australia are built with war service loans. From the inception of the scheme in 1919 until lune, 1950, 29.3 per cent, of applicants were granted loans and 60,350 homes were built under the War Service Homes Division. In the life of this Government, there has been a tremendous increase in home-building. Between June, 1950, and June, 1961, 70.7 per cent, of applicants for war service home loans received advances and built 145,806 homes. In money terms, the record is even more striking. Out of a total of £418,000,000 made available from the inception of the war service homes scheme until to-day, £382,000,000 has been made available by this Government. That is an excellent record. What was the record of the previous Labour Government? In the four and a half years during w;hich a Labour Government was administering this scheme, provision was made for 17,570 homes. The Liberal-Country Party Government has been providing homes for ex-servicemen at the rate of 14,500 a year. [Quorum formed.] I have almost finished my remarks, but there are certain other matters I wish to raise. FirstI want to make some reference to the speech of the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Stokes). He delivered an interesting, thoughtful and reasoned speech, but he was in error on one point. I am surprised at this because the honourable member has obviously made a deep study of the war service homes scheme. He said that it was not possible to transfer a mortgage when an ex-serviceman sold his home to another ex-serviceman. That is not correct. If the honourable member studies the annual report of the Director of War Service Homes, he will find that there were 1,082 such transfers in 1959-60 and 1,014 in 1960-61. This involved an annual expenditure of some £2,000,000 over and above the £35,000,000 expended by the War Service Homes Division. Undoubtedly, there are difficulties and anomalies. I know that the War Service Homes Division does its best to make the money go as far as it can. As a country member of Parliament, I find that some people who live in areas remote from Sydney or Melbourne sometimes are badly advised by local organizations. They are told that they are eligible for war service home loans and to go ahead and raise finance. They are told that the War Service Homes Division will take up the loans for them. I have heard of persons who have not checked whether they were entitled to a loan and have started to build before the loan arrangements were completed. Then they have been refused loans. In some cases, the War Service Homes Division has been able to make the money available because the persons concerned obviously were ill-advised by those who did not know the correct procedure. I hope the time will come when such cases will not arise. I look forward to the time when the demand will taper off and the transfer of mortgages will be allowed. At present, the only way in which a person in a home with a mortgage can get a loan from the War Service Homes Division is to vacate the home and go into a new one. This seems to be an anomaly although the provision was introduced for a very sound reason. While we have had to limit the amount of money available, that was the only way the matter could be handled administratively. I do not intend to speak any longer because every one in the House is in agreement on the bill, and I congratulate the Government upon bringing it forward. follow the lead given by the honourable member for Farrer( Mr Fairbairn) and not delay the House unduly. I shall commence by referring to the second reading speech of the Minister for Social Services( Mr Roberton) who pointed out that this bill had a two-fold purpose-to increase the maximum loan and to reduce the deposit required to purchase a home. The Minister pointed out that although for several years, there had been a consistent demand for loans, in recent times, there has been a downward trend in applications. He seemed to be at a loss to understand what had caused the reduction. He saidHowever, it bas become increasingly evident House opposed? Why is it practicable, at that the decline in new applications was greater this stage, to increase the. maximum loan than might be expected from a natural fall in demand due to the passage of time and to the although in October of last year this was not satisfaction of a large part of that demand. It possible? As the honourable member for is apparent that, to some extent, applications have Hughes( Mr L. R. Johnson) and the declined because some ex-servicemen can no longer bridge the gap between the maximum Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr amount of the war service loan and the prevailing Whitlam) asked, how is it that the costs of constructing or of acquiring a home. Of course, we are all aware of that. Many service homes will be sufficient, in the ex-servicemen have been unable to obtain Government's view, to cope with an in the deposit necessary to purchase a home. creased demand for greater loans although The Minister went on to talk about the insufficient money was considered to be the Government's recent review of the national barrier when the Labour Opposition took economy which had showed that an this matter up last year? On that occasion, increase in the home building rate was the Minister for National Development desirable. He saidNaturally, when considering the ways and funds were not available to increase the means of increasing tbe building rate, the Government took into account the housing needs of amount of individual loans. Now, although ex-servicemen and particularly views placed before the Government does not propose to it by the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's increase the total available funds, it wishes Imperial League of Australia regarding the maxito have this measure passed. mum loan under the war service homes scheme. Then, in an interesting paragraph, he saidFamily life is the foundation of a vigorous, progressive and a happy community. If any other Minister had made that comment, one might have paid some attention to it. The sorry record of the Minister for Social Services, who is in charge of this bill, is that since he has occupied his present portfolio there has been no increase in child endowment. I make that passing reference, Mr Deputy Speaker, to show you that the comments of this Minister are not sincere. Surely if he meant what he said about family life he would have done something about child endowment which is his responsibility as Minister for Social Services. The Director of War Service Homes said that the reason for the reduction in the number of applications for loans could not be determined with certainty. He said that an analysis of the figures did not indicate any consistent pattern. He went on to sayThe economic measures taken in November, 1960, to check the domestic boom conditions appear to have decreased the rate of receipt of applications. I believe that we should endeavour to ascertain why this measure has been introduced. Why has there been a sudden change of front by the Government? Why is it that honourable members on the Government side are now supporting a proposal which, late last year, those of them who were in this £35,000,000 that is now available for war (Senator Spooner) who is Minister in charge of the war service homes, said that sufficient I suggest, Mr Deputy Speaker, that this bill has been introduced by the Government, not to honour its obligation to the ex-service men and women, but to attempt to adjust the economic conditions prevailing in this country to-day. The measure has become",65,Pairs
175,Mr Galvin (Kingston) [9.50],"I willnecessary because last December the people of Australia passed a vote of no confidence in the Government. The Government had deliberately depressed the building industry and had set about creating a man-made depression. Now it is looking for some way of picking up the slack. It has decided upon this move, not to assist ex-servicemen in need, but to bolster the building industry which it has deliberately depressed. The bill has been covered fairly widely by speakers on this side of the House, particularly the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. However, I think it worthwhile again asking what is going to happen when this sum of £35,000,000 has been used up as a result of the increased number of applications which I believe will be made for war service homes? Will the Government do anything? The Government has an obligation to supply homes to ex-service men and women. I believe that the increasing of the maximum loan will not make a great difference to a large section of the community. One of the main reasons why applications for loans have decreased is that during the two years since the 1960 blitz began, part-time work and unemployment have become a part of our economy. It has not been much good a man who is out of work applying for a loan. A loan twice as big as that proposed would not help him. Neither can people on part-time work avail themselves of loans. Where can the unemployed chap or the man on part-time work find the £1,000 or so which will still be required as a deposit on a make herself eligible for a war service homes home in many instances? Some people may be able to buy a home on a deposit of £500, but £1,000 is required to purchase certain homes from the Housing Trust in South Australia. I have no doubt that in Canberra many thousands of pounds are needed to bridge the gap between the purchase price of a home and the money that will be available under this bill. I should have liked to see something done either in legislation or administratively to correct the position regarding the discharge of existing mortgages. the bill either. you are not hr charge of the House. Other Minister was honest on that previous honourable members have dealt with this aspect of the matter to-night. I think , that the Government should revert to the practice of the Labour Government of allowing the War Service Homes Division to take over existing mortgages. I turn now to the problems of the applicant who has to find temporary finance while he is awaiting a loan from the War Service Homes Division. In such a case an applicant is advised to find finance elsewhere. We are indebted to an honourable member who furnished the House with details of the interest of from 8 per cent, to as high as 12 per cent, charged for such temporary accommodation. I can see no reason why, if the Government cannot make sufficient money available to provide for such people, it cannot arrange for the Commonwealth Bank to advance the necessary temporary finance instead of forcing ex-service men and women desperately in need of homes to go to hire-purchase companies and pay high interest rates for temporary loans. Early in his second-reading speech the Minister referred to eligibility under the act. I should like to see something done for single people such as nurses who are not eligible. I know of a case pf a nurse who applied for a war service home and was told that as she had no dependants she was not eligible for a loan. However, she was told, "" If you like to go and live with a de facto husband you will become eligible for a loan "". She could live with a former enemy of this country, in fact, and thereby loan. It is a sorry state of affairs when we are dealing with a measure to assist ex-service men and women that we cannot do something to correct the anomalies that consistently crop up in the implementation of the legislation. A measure almost identical to the present measure was proposed by the Labour Party during the last budget session, and the Government and the Minister in charge of war service homes said that the proposition was impracticable, and that the £35,000,000 available for war service homes would not proposal.

177,Mr Galvin,"Well, I am thankful that Labour Party proposed. Surely if theoccasion, and if the Government was sincere, their objections to the Labour Party's proposal are as valid to-day as they were then. If they are sincere in a desire to help eligible men and women they should be increasing the total amount of money available to people who need assistance. However, as I said earlier, I believe that this bill has been introduced mainly not to assist ex-service men and women but to try to help the building industry to get back on its feet. We are very glad about that, but do not forget that this Government is responsible for the present depressed condition of the building industry. There is a lot of leeway to be caught up in order to get ex-service men and women back in jobs and so able to take advantage of this legislation. I sincerely hope the measure wUl help all these people who are in need, but I do not think it goes far enough. I should like tbe Minister, perhaps at the committee stage, to give us some assurance that the Government will overcome any problem that arises if the total amount available is not large enough to deal with all the applications made. What is going to happen when the full amount of £35,000,000 provided for the year is used up? I am glad to see that there has been a change of mind among members oa the Government side, even if it took a general election result to bring that about. In the space of a very few months these members have suddenly found themselves prepared to put into operation a plan that first came from the Labour Party. 1 am glad to see that once again Labour Party policy has been taken up by honourable members opposite, because ultimately if they take up all ourselves in a position where we can inour policies security will come not only to ex-service men and women but to everybody in the community. regard to the ruling of Mr Speaker a few minutes ago, Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not intend to get too far away from the bill. Neither do I wish to comment at length on some of the speeches made by honourable members opposite. One thing to which I would like to refer is that during the debate some honourable members opposite have accused members on the Government side of not supporting an Opposition amendment which was moved last October. I think it can be taken for granted, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the people on the opposite benches do not think for one moment that we, as Government supporters, are going to fall into this trap of supporting their amendments on measures such as this. If we were weak enough to accept a thing like that we could not possibly govern. If they expect us to join them and vote in sympathy with some of their proposals they might find that if ever the day came when they were back in office some of their members might want to cross the floor and support us. Earlier to-day the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) said that the Returned Servicemen's League supported unanimously the principle of increasing the maximum loan from £2,750 to £3,500. In answer to that I should like, as a keen and active member of the RSL., to direct his attention to the fact that over the year the RSL. has not really been unanimous oa this issue. The unanimity has been conditional, and one of the conditions was that the £35,000,000 provided for war service homes would be increased so that the waiting period for a loan would not be increased. I can assure the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that he was a little bit off the beam in that regard. I think that the RSL. makes a closer study of those things than some honourable members opposite do. I suggest that the RSL. wants to see this legislation go as far as it can. In other words, it is a case of working out whether the waiting period for a loan will be increased if the loan made to individual applicants is increased. That is a fairly important factor. It is a case of a lot for a few or a little for a lot. To-day we find crease the £2,750 advance to £3,500. [Quorum formed.] It is interesting to note that when the Opposition is being found out on such issues one of its members decides to call a quorum. It is interesting also to see, when a quorum is called, that it is nearly always the Opposition benches which are empty. This proves, beyond doubt, that the hearts of members opposite are not in this legislation. If we examine page 5 of the report of the Director of the War Service Homes Division we find that since the inception of the division no fewer than 200,000 homes have been provided. At least",68,Pairs
178,Mr King (Wimmera) [10.7],"Having170,000 of these homes have been provided since 1950, that is, since this Government came into office. Ten per cent, of the homes built throughout Australia during this period have been built from war service homes funds. In this report it is estimated that there are 800,000 ex-servicemen of the Second World War eligible for war service homes grants. On pjtge 8 of the report we see that 16 per cent, of the eligible ex-serviceeach year since then. In 1954-55 the men from World WarI . have received assistance of various kinds and that at least 21 per cent, of the eligible ex-servicereached the stage where we could possibly men from World War II . have received some benefit. However, we cannot take these as the true figures, because we do not know how many ex-servicemen are desirous of securing war service homes. But it is estimated that 30 per cent, or 240,000 of the 800,000 ex-servicemen referred to will require homes. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition agrees with that estimate, and this calculation leaves 70,000 homes still to be provided. On the present basis of an advance of £3,500 for each home, and 70,000 applicants, we find that less than £250,000,000 is necessary to complete the war service homes project. We also see from the report that it is expected that most of these 70,000 applicants will be catered for in the next five or six years. If we regard that as likely to happen some two-thirds of these homes, totalling in cost about £165,000,000, will be financed with the amount which the Government has allocated. But all these things are contingent upon the time factor, and if that factor is reduced the money will be expended more rapidly. Knowing that it is desired to complete then purchasing another old home or the debate on this measure to-night I will second-hand home.

We have certain reservations, of minutes ago he would have been given the course, which have been outlined by preanswer earlier. I desire to direct attention vious speakers during the course of the to the expenditure on war service homes debate. We view the measure with delight over the years. It is interesting to note simply because it is a vindication of our that in 1946-47, when the present Opposition was in office, the expenditure of the War Service Homes Division was £2,000,000. In 1947-48 the figure had risen to £4,000,000 and in 1948-49, the last full year of the Opposition's term in government, the figure was £8,000,000. For the first full year of the present Government's term that figure jumped to £25,000,000 and it has increased gradually figure was £30,000,000, and in 1957-58 it was increased to £35,000,000. We have increase that amount and cut out the twenty months' delay. As I said, the number of ex-servicemen now desirous of securing war service homes is down to an estimated 70,000. I am sympathetic towards the suggestion of ploughing back into expenditure on war service homes some of the repayments of principal, rentals and so on. I think it was the honourable member for Bass( Mr Barnard) who made this suggestion. In view of the fact that the Government is receiving just on £10,000,000 a year for principal alone from this source I think it could give that suggestion consideration. I believe that there are many eligible ex-servicemen who, perhaps because they inherited homes with a mortgage on them, and have not been able to secure the necessary finance, have not received assistance in the purchase of their homes. If these men were given the opportunity to transfer their mortgages to the War Service Homes Division it would be of great help to them. But to-day the only way in which such a man can get assistance is by disposing of his present home and view of the fact that we are virtually over the hill, as it were, with the war service",69,Pairs

"" It is a matter of simple mathematics. The amount of £3,500 goes into £35 million fewer times than £2,750."" Then, according to the news item, Mr from tbe annual report to which I have Osmond went on to express perturbation at the possibility that the Government's policies might interfere with the group homes scheme operated by the War Service Homes Division. The Labour Party, of course, contends that the total amount provided for war service homes should be increased to an extent sufficient to satisfy the overall demand. Does the Government honestly believe that by increasing the maximum amount of individual loans without increasing the overall allocation it will make a worth-while contribution towards improving the housing position and assisting the housing industry, which has been depressed by the Government's economic policies? The Minister for National Development, who is in charge of the War Service Homes Division, has admitted that the increase in the maximum amount of individual loans, unaccompanied by an increase in the total amount allocated, will mean that the number of persons to be satisfied may be reduced from 14,150 to 10,700. How will this measure serve to stimulate home-building? The Government has contended that this measure will help the home-building industry to get back on its feet, but I invite honourable members to consider the annual report issued by the Director of War Service Homes for the year ended 30th June, 1951. On page 5 of the report we find the following statement:Developments of major interest during 1960-61 includedThe elimination of the waiting time for applicants requiring assistance in respect of a new home. If the waiting time in respect of new homes has already been abolished, what possible contribution can this new measure make towards stimulating the demand for new homes, since satisfaction in this field has already been attained and since the overall number of homes that can be built will be reduced because the total amount of money provided has not been increased although the maximum loan has been increased? We must also remember that the situation will be further aggravated by a rush of applications. This rush has already become evident in various States. In this connection I can give some relevant figures already referred. The report states that 600,000 people are eligible for assistance under the war service homes scheme. Of these, 176,000 were returned serviceman from World War U., the Korean and Malayan campaigns. I think it was an honourable member on the opposite side of the House who said that only 22 per cent, of those eligible have been granted assistance, which means that about 136,000 people still remain who have not yet applied. We must remember that there were 15,000 applications outstanding at the end of June, 1961, and the situation will become far worse when the expected applications flood in, as they are already flooding in. The answer is, obviously, that the Government should increase the overall allocation. We know that given sufficient time, and with perseverence by honourable members on this side of the House, the allocation will be increased, but we must keep hammering away at the Government on this matter if we wish to be successful. I think that one of the Government's main purposes in introducing this measure is to deceive the general public by suggesting that home-building generally will be stimulated by an increase in the maximum advance available under the war service homes scheme. The Federal Government at present is only too well aware of its tenuous position with its reduced majority, and it expects that it will be forced against a a . its will to go before the people at another general election rather prematurely. Therefore, it is trying to boost its stocks in every conceivable way. The restricting of the overall amount available under the war service homes scheme-that will be precisely the result of this measure-wil l force many people to place themselvss in the usurious hands of the money lenders, as has been pointed out in this House before. The War Service Homes Division charges interest on advances at a flat rate of 3$ per cent. But people who are unable to wait any longer for advances from the division and who are forced to go to the hire-purchase companies and the usurious money lenders will have to pay interest at rates up to 20 per cent, with repayments over long terms. This is the sort of thing that the Government is forcing people to undertake. We ought to remember that the hire-purchase companies, with their high rates of interest, are creating inflation to-day. Let us go back to the application of the credit squeeze in November, 1960, when the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) told the Australian people that damping down of the home-building industry throughout the Commonwealth was necessary, because the activity in the industry was contributing to the upward spiral of inflation. He claimed that speculation was rife. The people are forced into speculation, not by their own desire but by this Government's policies. One of the main causes of speculation in the building industry is the sub-dividers who obtain worthless land and inflate its value overnight by providing a few very inadequate facilities such as poorly tarred road surfaces. If the Government were to enforce a flat rate of interest at 3 per cent, for all the people, not only those borrowing from the War Services Homes Division, for what is possible for one section of the community Mackinnon) -Order! The honourable member is getting away from the bill and discussing a much wider subject. observation, as one of my colleagues has pointed out. I think that we should put the matter in its right perspective. We have heard much about what this Government has done in an endeavour to repudiate the record of the Australian Labour Party and bring it into disrepute. Government supporters may be interested to know that in 1948-49, the Labour Government undertook capital expenditure of £8,550,000 on war service homes and serviced 6,285 applicants. The latest figures available show that in 1960-61 the present Government allocated £35,000,000 to war service homes. Let us convert the amount allocated last year to 1949 values by applying the consumer price index, which shows that £100 to-day represents only £53 in 1949. If we do this, we find that, in terms of 1949 values, the £35,000,000 allocated for war service homes by this Government last financial year represented only £18,550,000, or an increase of 118.23 per cent, compared with the expenditure of £8,550,000 in 1948-49. The number of applicants serviced in 1960-61 was 14,150, an increase of 125.13 per cent, compared with the 6,285 serviced in 1948-49. In other words, the present Government has reduced the money allocated, compared to the number of applications serviced, by about 7 per cent. This shows that the financial support offered to the nation by this Government is slipping away compared with the support given by the Labour Government. It is very interesting, also, to note the manner in which the present Government is shirking its responsibilities. Every year, at Budget time, it tells the people, in general terms, how much money it will provide for war service homes, but, when the figures are analysed and dissected, one finds that the Government's claims are not correct and that every year it is reducing the amount which it actually provides for war service homes. The receipts from interest and rentals paid by people who have obtained homes under the scheme are ever increasing. Of course, we know that this Government's eventual aim is to make the scheme self-supporting. As the returns from the a year, this aim no doubt will eventually be achieved. In the meantime, many people are forced to remain on the waiting list, hoping for assistance by the War Service Homes Division. As I have pointed out, capital expenditure on war service homes totalled £8,550,000 in 1948-49-the last complete financial year for which the Labour Government held office. The net receipts from interest and repayments in 1948-49 amounted to £2,020,000. This means that the net government aid in that year amounted to £6,530,000. Net government aid was £14,020,000 in 1960-61, when capital expenditure totalled £35,040,000 and receipts £21,010,000. This rising trend in receipts has been evident throughout the years during which the present Government",71,Pairs

187,Mr Hayden,"I was just making anhas been in office. Receipts from interest and repayments have increased each year by nearly £2,000,000, and the net amount spent by the Government has been correspondingly reduced. In 1959-60, the net return from interest and repayments was £19,830,000, and the net amount spent by the Government was £15,230,000. But the Government told the people of Australia that in 1959-60 it provided £35,060,000. It claims that it provided £35,040,000 in 1960-61, but, as I have stated, it really proA transfer in the course of his service took vided only £14,020,000, because it received £21,010,000 in interest and repayments. Mr Deputy Speaker, if this Government were to pursue a policy of stimulating the building industry generally, as well as in the field of war service homes, by financially assisting the States, the community would benefit greatly. This benefit would not be restricted only to the timber industry. In the electorate of Oxley, which I have the honour to represent, a considerable number of very large timber-mills were operating at full capacity until the application of the credit squeeze, which caused many of them to close down, some permanently. Quite a number of those which have closed down permanently have been sold up and the plant and equipment have been either scrapped or put into use in other mills throughout the nation. The benefit of any stimulation of the building industry would, as I have said, be felt not only in the timber industry. A host of other industries are subsidiary to the building industry. The manufacturers of tools, nails and plumbing ware and a host of tradesmen, in addition to carpenters, who depend on the building industry for their livelihood all would benefit. An increase of the maximum advance obtainable from the War Service Homes Division, without any increase in the overall allocation of funds to the division, will result in fewer homes being provided under the war service homes scheme, and the building industry will be further depressed. We all know how seriously it has been depressed already by the Government's policies. As previous speakers on this side of the House have pointed out, Mr Deputy Speaker, the time is overripe for the Government seriously to consider giving second assistance to people under the war service homes scheme. There are very many worthy and needy cases in which second loans by the division would be justified, but all applications for second assistance are rejected. 1 do not criticize the officers of the division for this. They must accept the directions given by the Minister for National Development and the Government. One case which I call to mind is that of a man who is at present serving in the Royal Australian Air Force and who has an excellent war-time record. him to a State far distant from his home, which he had purchased with the assistance of the War Service Homes Division. He was forced to sell the home, and he subsequently moved to several parts of this country and also overseas before he finally settled near Ipswich, in my electorate. He has decided that this is the area in which he wishes finally to retire and in which he wants to provide his family with a home. honourable member is getting a little wide of the bill. It does not relate to second assistance. ficant statements in the Minister's second reading speech referred to the fall in applications for war service homes. He said. . . some fall off in applications might reasonably be expected in the normal course of events. However, it has become increasingly evident that the decline in new applications was greater than might be expected from a natural fall in demand due to the passage of time and to the satisfaction of a large part of that demand. It is apparent that, to some extent, applicauons have declined because some ex-servicemen can no longer bridge the gap between the maximum amount of war service homes loan and the prevailing costs of constructing or of acquiring a home. An honourable member opposite earlier pointed out that the cost of homes has been reduced by £400. Obviously, the statement of the Minister has a hollow ring. It is very significant that this huge fall in applications occurred at a time when the Government had inflicted a credit squeeze on the nation. Obviously, the Government, with its economic policies, is responsible for a decline in the demand for assistance from the War Service Homes Division. While we on this side of the House agree in principle with the proposal to increase the maximum loan available from the War",73,Speaker Mr Scheme Are Increasing By About £2 000 000

This defeats the whole purpose of the measure before us. As I said, an increase of the maximum loan without a corresponding increase of the total allocation will mean a reduction of the number of applications that will be satisfied.. This will the remember that those who seek assistance from the War Service Homes Division are the people who at the end of the war were told that nothing that could be done would be good enough for them. Already more than 15,000 people are on the waiting list and the short-sighted policy of the Government will ensure that this number is greatly increased.

The fall last year was not due to economic conditions or other similar circumstances, but to a factor which arises, from the age of ex-servicemen.

191,Mr Curtin,"Would you read those in "" Hansard "", where the honourable member will be able to read them to-morrow. Between January, 1950, and December, 1961, £365,000,000 or 87 per cent, of the £418,000,000 that has been spent on the scheme since 1919. This has resulted in 168,756 ex-servicemen and other eligible people becoming home-owners in eleven years compared with the 62,936 people assisted during the whole of the previous 30 years. That is a very substantial record indeed and one of which this Government can feel very proud. It refutes entirely the addition, the veterans' administration may arguments which we have just heard from my friend, the honourable member for Oxley( Mr Hayden). The war service homes scheme provides the most liberal housing finance in the Commonwealth. Homes may be obtained for deposits as low as 5 per cent., with an interest rate of only 3f per cent. As we all know, up to 45 years is allowed for repayment. But there is another very important item associated with war service homes. I refer to the insurance scheme. All war service homes are insured under the division's own insurance scheme, which provides cover at a cost less than one-quarter of the normal premium charged by private insurance companies. Another big advantage may be enjoyed by war widows under the scheme. I refer to the relief system which assists the widows of ex-servicemen in purchasing homes. Further, when they are in needy circumstances, their repayments and maintenance costs can be reduced to a level that they can afford. At present, applications for war service homes are coming in at the very substantial rate of approximately 13,000 a year. There is now no waiting time for loans for the purchase ot new homes. This means that 60 per cent, of the applicants for war service homes loans can obtain assistance without any waiting period. The war service homes scheme in Australia is considered to be the most comprehensive scheme of its type to be introduced by any nation which makes provision for homes for ex-servicemen and their dependants, as a very quick comparison will reveal very clearly. For instance, in the United Kingdom there is no scheme for the government to lend money to ex-servicethis Government provided men for the purchase of homes on special terms. Loans are available to ex-servicemen in the United Kingdom only from local authorities or building societies in the same way as rhey are available to any other person in the community. In the United States of America, the Government does not lend money to ex-servicemen for houses, but it does guarantee loans raised by them, at a specified interest rate. In make direct home loans where private lending facilities are not available or are inadequate. Also, when we compare our scheme with that of our near neighbour, New Zealand, we find that ex-servicemen in New Zealand can be given interest-bearing housing loans by the government. They may also be granted supplementary interest-free loans which are designed to assist them to meet the increase in housing values and building costs that took place during the war years. There is also a system of suspensory loans of amounts equal to no more than 10 per cent, of the value of the house, with a £200 maximum, which may be made to help compensate for building cost increases in recent years. In some circumstances, this is an interest-free loan. Including any supplementary and suspensory loans, the maximum housing loan ranges from £2,200 sterling for a married couple without children to £2,600 sterling for a married couple with four or more children. the bill? the bill because it illustrates quite clearly how favourably our scheme compares with the schemes operating in those countries where some form of financial assistance is provided to ex-servicemen to obtain homes. The Australian system shows up as the most favorable in the world to-day and I think that we in Australia, irrespective of the side of the House on which we sit, can well take a great deal of pride in the system that has been built over the years. Since the present Government took office in 1949, a number of major amendments have been made to the War Service Homes",76,Speaker Mr Scheme Are Increasing By About £2 000 000

194,Mr Swartz,"It has a lot to do withAct. In 1951, the act was extended to make people who served in operational areas in Korea and Malaya eligible for war service homes benefits. In that year, too, the maximum loan was increased from £2,000 to £2,750. In 1954, certain exceptions which had been contained in the act were eliminated and the maximum loan of £2,750 was extended to cover all classes of assistance. In that year also, the provisions of the act were extended to cover applicants from Norfolk Island and Papua and New Guinea. This bill further increases the maximum loan to £3,500 for all classes of assistance and also reduces the minimum deposit. I believe not only that the bill has the support of all honourable members of the House but also that it is a measure that deserves the support of all people in the Australian community. Mr J. R. FRASER (Australian Capital Territory) [10.58] I find it pleasing that the measures which have been introduced in an attempt to rehabilitate the fortunes of the Menzies Government included this measure to increase war service homes advances by an amount of £750. Despite what honourable members on the Government side have said, it is perfectly clear that in October, two months before the recent general election, the Government, with a majority of 32, rejected a proposed amendment which would have provided exactly this increase in war service homes advances. Two months after that election, when the Government had its majority reduced from 32 to two, the Government has introduced its own bill to provide the increase which it had rejected previously. Despite what the Minister and other speakers on the Government side have said in connection with this matter, it is perfectly clear should be denied the benefit of what is to the people of Australia that, had this Government been returned with a substantial majority on 9th December last, this bill would never have been introduced. The Government may prate as it might of what notice it takes of representations by the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia; it can talk about the falling off in the demand for war service homes; but surely it is patent to everybody that had this Government been returned with a substantial majority it would have treated those representations with contempt and this measure would not have been introduced until the time approaching another election. Let us have it on the record, let us have it straight, and let us have it honest. This measure amends two sections of the War Service Homes Act. Apart from the qualification of war service, an over-riding provision of the act is that an applicant for a loan must be married or about to marry oc has dependants for whom it is necessary for him to maintain a home. I want to suggest to the Government once again that the definition of a borrower should be widened to include single men and women who have served in a theatre of war. The measure is designed to give a recompense to those who served Australia overseas in time of war. It is purely a matter of financial assistance. If it be true, as the Minister for National Development (Senator Spooner) has said, that there is a downward trend in the number of applications for war service home loans in recent months, this may be the time to consider that there are people who served Australia in time of war and who would profit from the assistance provided in this measure. It is true that the single soldier was the cheapest soldier, and the Government could well extend assistance to those in that category. Many women served in various ways during the Second World War. No doubt many are known to honourable members, including women who served in the nursing services, for example. Many women who served in the war have had no desire to marry or have no prospect of marrying, but they want homes of their own. They could be given financial assistance to buy their homes under the War Service Homes Act. I can see no reason why such people purely a measure of financial assistance. Moreover, the benefits from this assistance begin to flow back to the Treasury immediately a loan is granted. Figures have been quoted to-night to show that on an advance of £35,000,000, there is a return approaching £23,000,000. SoI suggest to the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Swartz), who is at the table, and the Government, that they consider this proposition. The numbers of people concerned would be small but there are men and women who faced all the dangers and hardships that were to be faced in theatres of war. They would not value year under the War Service Homes Act and their services in terms of pounds, shillings builds about 10 per cent, of the homes that and pence but they cost the country less are constructed in Australia. as members of the services than did those who are entitled to the benefits provided It is the banker because it supplies the in this bill. It would not cost the Governcapital for the original outlay. It could ment much to give these single men and also be called the borrower because it women assistance to enable them to buy reduces the rate of interest payable by exhomes for their declining years. I myself have reason to be grateful to between what a man would have to pay for the War Service Homes Division. I will his home on the open market and what he be 94i years old when I finally own my has to repay to the War Service Homes house and I will reach the age of 143 years Division. The interest rate of 3 i per cent, before my lease is due for renewal. But is very fair. that is only by the way. I ask the Government to consider the extension of war servicemen who have had to obtain temservice homes provisions to single men and porary finance or other assistance and are women who are qualified in terms of war paying between 8 per cent, and 10 ner cent, service but are barred by the requirement and sometimes more. On an average, this that they must be married or about to would be approximately 5 per cent, higher marry. If the Government wants a precethan they would have to pay to the War dent, one can be found in the Australian Service Homes Division.

The bill that we are discussing assisted. now is a complete reversal of Government Despite the fact that the Minister said there policy. It is one of the greatest back-flips was a sufficient number of applicants who that any government has ever taken. I do not criticize the Minister for Social Services, who is now sitting at the table. I am certain that he was very pleased to get rid of the control of the War Service Homes Division which he had for a number of years, because he realized that the act was not being administered in the way Government was not giving due consideration to the demands of ex-servicemen for a greater allocation of money and for an increase of the maximum loan. Control of the War Service Homes Division was transferred to the Minister for National Development who is well known for his complete lack of interest in the division. Since he has been in charge, complaint after complaint has been levelled against the Government for its failure to increase the maximum loans available for war service homes and the allocation to Development has made no attempt to keep the maximum loan or the allocation of funds at a correct level in order to provide for the number of ex-servicemen who wish to obtain finance from the division. During the last twelve months the Government has reversed its policy with regard to the War Service Homes Division. It is interesting that members of the Government are now patting themselves on the back because they have increased the maximum loan from £2,750 to £3,500. On 3rd May, 1961, I received, through the Minister for Social Services, a reply to a question which I put on the notice-paper early last year. Part5 of my question read as follows:How far will the proportion of maximum loan to The answer provided by the Minister for It is not practicable to furnish an answer to this determined in the light of overall budgetary conbearing in mind that the division has on increase in the maximum loan would necessarily were anxious and willing to proceed on the basis of the existing loan, the Director of War Service Homes, at page 6 of his 1959-60 report, s a i d There was some evidence of a slackening in demand for War Service Homes finance, particularly over the last six months of the financial year. He went on to sayOf the total number of applications dealt with during the year, 36.3 per cent, of applications were should be granted or was it not merited withdrawn or refused because the applicants concerned were unable to comply with the requirements of the Act. There are certain reasons why applicants cannot comply with the requirements of the act. But I put it to the House that the essential reason why 36.3 per cent, of applicants were unable to go on with their applications was that they were unable to obtain sufficient deposit to purchase their homes. During the last Budget debate, both in this House and in another place, the Opposition moved amendments with the object of increasing the maximum war service home loan from £2,750 to £3,500. It is interesting that all Government supporters in this House and in the other chamber voted against the amendment proposed by the Opposition at that time. They refused to believe that the situation merited an increase in the maximum loan despite the fact that the Director of War Service Homes had indicated as far back as 1959-60 that 36.3 per cent, of applicants were unable to continue with their applications, mainly because they were unable to obtain the necessary deposit. It is interesting to examine reports of the debate which occurred in another place when the proposal to increase the maximum loan to £3,500 was made. The Minister for National Development, in answer to arguments advanced by Labour senators said, as reported at page 223 of "" Hansard"" of 24th August, 1961I wish to give some figures in order to show the effect of the proposal. Under the existing arrangements, from the present allocation of £3J,000,000 the Government is giving assistance to 14,150 applicants annually. If the maximum loan were increased to £3,500, the servicing of the same number of applicants in a comparable manner would require ah increase of expenditure from £35,000,000 to £47,000,000. So, at that stage the Minister rejected our proposal because he felt that if the loan were increased to £3,500 there would be a decline in the number of applicants who could be serviced. Now, when the maximum loan is increased to £3,500, the allocation to the War Service Homes Division is left exactly as it has been for the last five or six years. The Government has that inconsistency to explain away. Was the increase in the maximum loan merited when we moved in October, 1961, that it in October, 1961? If it was merited in October, 1961, and was rejected because the allocation would have had to be increased why has not some mention been made of an increased allocation in this instance? Amendments were moved by the Labour Party, both in another place and in this House, to have the maximum loan increased to £3,500, the exact amount that has now been proposed by the Government. I have already quoted the report of the Director of War Service Homes who said in his 1959-60 report that there had been evidence of a slackening in the demand for war service homes, particularly over the previous six months. In the 1960-61 report of the director there are two or three references to the same matter of demand. The 1959-60 report was presented to the Minister for National Development about October, 1960. The 1960-61 report was presented to the minister on 26th September, 1961. These reports are always compiled three or four months after the close of the financial year. But no one can tell me that the War Service Homes Director, from time to time, is not in close consultation with the Minister for National Development and does not point out to him developments with regard to the allocation of funds and the question of whether the maximum loan is sufficient or otherwise. Yet in May, 1961, only three months before the Budget was introduced, at the same time as the Government would have been considering its Budget proposals, the Minister gave me a reply to a question in which he said that a lot of ex-servicemen were willing and anxious to proceed on the present basis. Yet, in his report which would have been prepared at the end of the financial year, only six weeks after this question was answered, the War Service Homes Director said, at page 6In my last annual report I mentioned that as I have attempted to do to-night, to see tbere was some evidence of a slackening of that this proposal is a complete about-face demand for war service homesfinance,particuso far as the Government is concerned. larly over the last six months of the financial year. Since that report, the trend towards a reduction in applications has gathered momentum with the result that applications lodged declined from a total of 20,833for 1959-60 to 16,040 for 1960-61. On page 8 of his report he saidUndoubtedly the large number of homes already provided since the termination of the Second World War has been a very important factor making for a reduction, but it seems certain that there has been other influences at work. The economic measures taken in November, 1960, to check domestic boom conditions appear to have depressed the rate of receipt of applications. He went on to make this most interesting commentWhilst inquiries have been received from a large number of eligible persons, it is apparent that many are not in a position to provide the deposit necessary to finance the acquisition of a home. There we have a definite, categorical statement by the Director of War Service Homes in the report presented to this Parliament in September, 1.961, the text of which must have been indicated to the Minister for National Development many weeks before the report was presented. If the Director of War Service Homes saw fit to include in his report the statement that I have just read, surely it is reasonable to suppose that he had made many submissions to the Minister in charge of the division to do something about the matter. The Minister had received ample warning prior to the Budget being introduced, and even after it was introduced, because the Opposition had moved an amendment and had put forward strong and tangible arguments in support of its contention that the maximum amount of loan should be increased to £3,500. Yet the Minister and the Government refused to do anything about the matter. Had it not been for the fact that the Government went so close to losing its majority in this House on 9th December last I am absolutely certain that the demands of the Opposition would still not have been heeded. It was the fright which the Government received on 9th December that caused it to introduce this bill. We have only to trace the actions of the Government over the last twelve months, The honourable member for Wimmera( Mr King) took great credit from the fact that 16 per cent, of World WarI . diggers had applied for advances and had obtained loans through the War Service Homes Division and that, so far, 21 per cent, of those eligible for war service loans by virtue of . service in World War II . and in Korea had been granted assistance by the division. He. went on to applaud the fact that the Director of War Service Homes expected that 30 per cent, of eligible applicants would apply for and eventually obtain assistance from the division. But there are 800,000 ex-servicemen who could be eligible for such assistance. Thirty per cent, of that number would be 240,000: No one can tell me that the Government's administration of this legislation could cater for anything like that number. The Minister for National Development, during the debate in another place some six or seven months ago, made some comments which I think bear repeating in the light of the argument I am advancing at present. On 24th August, 1961, the Minister is reported at page 223 of the Senate"" Hansard"" as having saidThe amount of £2,750 is higher than the average amount made available by the Commonwealth Savings Bank and other savings banks. There is a low interest rate and there is ready access to the money. Nowhere else can any one wanting to purchase a new home get money without waiting. One has to wait his turn with savings banks, insurance companies, and other organizations, and he does not receive any more than £2,750. Advances for war service homes are' made at a very advantageous rate of interest and applicants are supported by afirst-classorganization in the division. I agree with the sentiments expressed by the Minister on that occasion, but at the same time. I cannot see how any member of the Government or any member of this House could be satisfied with the fact that only 16 per cent, of World WarI diggers and an expected 30 per cent, of World War II and Korean War ex-servicemen will obtain assistance under this act. The terms and conditions under which the loans are made are good. There are thousands of ex-servicemen who, because of the administration, or perhaps I should say maladministration, of this act by the GovernmentI do not blame the officers in the department at all-hav e had to go to other organizations to obtain loans. They have had to borrow money on worse conditions than those provided by the War Service Homes Division and are unable to have the division take over their mortgages. Many ex-servicemen have not been able to wait for loans from the division to purchase existing homes, because if they had done so they would have lost the chance to buy the homes they were intending to buy. This scheme is a good one provided it is administered properly, with efficiency and with sympathy towards the problems of ex-servicemen. I pause here, Mr Speaker, to remind you dwelling house at that time was as follows:of the promises that have been made to ex-servicemen by governments of various political complexions. Promises have been made that ex-servicemen would be able readily to obtainfinanceto purchase homes, but the honouring of such promises has been neglected by this Government since 1949. This is only the second occasion on which the maximum amount of loan has been inIt we take the lowest cost at that time, that creased. On 12th December, 1951, the Government increased the maximum of £3,708 in Tasmania, we se that it examount from f2,000 to £2,750, and now, at ceeded the maximum amount of loan by this stage, we are discussing a proposal to £958. The highest cost, that in the Ausincrease it from £2,750 to £3,500. The tralian Capital Territory, which does not Government has been completely neglectful include the cost of land because it is leaseof the wishes of ex-servicemen and of the hold land and the figure relates only to the promises it has made to them. The War capital cost of the construction of the home, Service Homes Act should be administered exceeds the maximum amount of loan by much more sympathetically and much more £3,625. Admittedly, there may be special leniently than has been the case to this circumstances in the Australian Capital point of time. We have to reach the stage Territory and the Northern Territory. where ex-servicemen can not only apply For the life of me, I cannot see why the for loans to build homes and obtain the cost in the Australian Capital Territory, money immediately, but also apply for where the land is leasehold, should be as loans to buy existing properties and get the high as it is. However, for this purpose money immediately. In passing, I say that let me leave out of consideration the every citizen of Australia should have the Northern Territory and the Australian same conditions made available to him. Capital Territory. The Northern Territory Whether or not he is an ex-serviceman he had the highest cost in 1951-52 and the should be able to obtain a loan to build or Australian Capital Territory had the highest buy a house at the best possible rate of cost in 1960-61. Dealing only with the interest and without any waiting time at all. States, the highest cost in 1951-52 was in A comparison of costs of war service other words, the loan exceeded the cost of a homes is well worth looking at. If we go house by £129. The highest cost in 1960-61 back to December, 1951, when the maxiwas in South Australia, where the cost of a mum loan was increased from £2,000 to house and land was £4,650. In other words, £2,750, we find that the average cost of a dwelling house and land was as follows:£ New South Wales .. 2,525 Victoria ..... 2,47.7 Queensland .. 2,393 South Australia .. 2,426 Western Australia .. 2,621 Tasmania .. 2,326 Australian Capital Territory .. 3,354 Northern Territory .. 3,397 If we take the lowest cost, that of £2,326 in Tasmania, we see that the maximum amount of loan exceeded it by £424. If we take the highest cost, that in the Northern Territory, we see that it exceeded the maximum amount of loan by £647. Let us now turn to 1960-61. The figures for that year are the latest that are available. We find that the average cost of land and £ New South Wales ... . . 4,503 Victoria .. .. . . 4,256 Queensland .. .. . . 3,739 South Australia . . .. . . 4,650 Western Australia .. . . 3,762 Tasmania .. .. . . 3,708 Australian Capital Territory . . 6,375 Northern Territory .. . . 3,738 Western Australia, and was £2,621. In the cost of a house and land exceeded the loan by £1,900. When the maximum loan was increased from £2,000 to £2,750, the lowest cost was £424 below the maximum loan, but last year we arrived at the stage, leaving aside the Australian Capital Territory, where the cost was £1,900 above the maximum loan available. No amount of double-talk, back-sliding or illogical reasoning by members of the Government can cover up the slipping back in regard to war service homes. I know that ex-servicemen in the Government parties are most uncomfortable about the Government's actions in relation to the rights of ex-servicemen under the War Service Homes Act. They feel uncomfortable, embarrassed and guilty, and they have every reason to be. The Labour Party has said on previous occasions that the allocation for war service homes should be increased. The argument has been advanced to-night that money received back by way of repayment of loans should be put into a revolving fund. The Labour Party has made demand after demand that the Government increase the maximum loan to the amount to which it is now being increased. I would like to make my protest against the implied insult directed to many ex-servicemen's organizations in the second-reading speech made by the Minister for Social Services( Mr Roberton). I do not blame the Minister for that speech, because it was almost an exact replica of that delivered by the Minister in another place. I feel that the responsibility for it belongs to the Minister in charge of war service homes. In the course of the second reading speech delivered in this House, the Minister saidThe Government took into account the housing needs of ex-servicemen and particularly the views placed before it by the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia regarding the maximum loan under the war service homes scheme. The insult implied there is that it was only the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia which had made a demand upon the Government to remedy the situation that had developed in the War Service Homes Division. The Australian Legion of Ex-Service Men and Women also bad made demands upon the Government. The Air Force Association had approached the Government on this problem, as had the Ex-Naval Men's Association. Members on this side of the House made repeated representations, both in correspondence and by way of speeches in this House. member's time has expired. Speaker, I wish to address myself briefly to this measure. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) and other members on this side of the House have said, it has been introduced only because of the result of the recent general election. This increase of the maximum advance made under the War Service Homes Act is being made only because of the effect on the Government of the almost overwhelming vote against it in that election. During this debate, much has been said about the increase of the maximum advance from £2,750 to £3,500. The Minister made great play of this matter during his speech, as though it was something which the Government has instituted. I think it is worth reminding the ex-servicemen opposite that an amendment to that effect was moved by the Opposition during thc last Budget session and that every member opposite, including that great and redoubtable fighter for ex-servicemen, the honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull), crossed the floor to vote against a proposal which to-night they commend. Is not this an indication that the Government is now prepared to do almost anything, even to exploit the ex-servicemen's vote, in order to retain the plums of office? Why do honourable members opposite support this measure to-night when, during the Budget deliberations last year, they stated that the proposal contained in it was not worthy of consideration? Why is it that members of the Government parties are now supporting this proposed increase from £2,750 to £3,500 although a few months ago they stated, not only that the Budget of that year could not afford it, but also that the allocation made to the department under consideration was not sufficient to permit the larger loans to be made? I intend to-night to show up the humbug and hypocrisy of the Government in relation to this measure. In the final passage of",80,Speaker Mr Scheme Are Increasing By About £2 000 000

This Government believes in the principle of home ownership and has always accepted the responsibilty of encouraging home ownership within its constitutional powers. Never in the history of any peace-time administration were war service homes more scarce, never was the demand greater and never was there a less efficient administration of this department. The Minister also saidThe increase in the Joan to £3,500 will enable the War Service Homes Division to continue making its vitally important contribution to the national welfare by the provision of homes for ex-servicemen and their families in all parts of Australia.

The mystery is all the deeper, Sir, when one remembers what the Minister for Spooner) had to say on this subject only some six months ago. He saidUnder the existing arrangements, from the pretheir applications. sent allocation of £35,000,000 the Government is giving assistance to 14,150 applicants annually. If the maximum loan were increased to £3,500, the servicing of the same number of applicants in a comparable manner would require an increase of expenditure from £35,000,000 to £47,000,000. I interpolate that that is this provision. He continuedIf. . . the maximum loan were increased to £3,500 and each applicant took the maximum loan, then the number of applicants who could be assisted would be reduced to 10,700. Under the present formula we assist 14,150 each year, but if the formula were changed That is, from £2,750 to £3,500. . . fall to 10,700. Now, Sir, in the terms of the appropriation as we still have it, the Minister for National Development said that the number of applicants assisted would drop very considerably. He said, in effect, that the rate of homebuilding, as far as this act is concerned, would be decreased. The Minister in charge of the bill in this chamber said only last week, in effect, that there would be an increase in home building if the maximum loan under this act were increased. How can these two conflicting statements be reconciled? How will there be an increase in home building under this act without an increase in the allocation? for Social Services) [11.58] -There is no need for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) to weep crocodik tears over what is alleged to have been said in some other place. Clause4 of the bill is not only simple; it is also specific. It statesSection twenty-one of the Principal Act is amended by omitting the words ""Two thousand seven hundred and fifty pounds "" (wherever occurring) and inserting in their stead the words "" Three thousand five hundred pounds "". Nothing could be more specific than that and, in all the explanations incidental to the introduction and the adoption of this proposal, it wasstated that the circumstances in this financial year, for a variety of reasons, had caused a falling off of the 1 number of applicants, and because this piece of legislation has been the subject of National Development (Senator public discussion for some time a great many of the current applicants are not anxious to reach conclusions with regard to So, Mr Chairman, there is a degree of urgency in the desire that this bill should be passed as rapidly as possible, and that royal assent should be received as rapidly as possible, in order that the current applicants may be encouraged to reach conclusions concerning their applications. Only a few weeks of the current financial year are left, and the Government is most anxious to make the increased benefits of this amending bill available to those who apply for assistance under the War Service Homes Act. the number of applicants assisted would In that connection, I should say that the principal act is a very old piece of legislation. Indeed, it is more than 40 years old. But this is the only government in that 40 years that has ever been able to bring that legislation to life. In the first 21 years of the operation of this-piece of humanitarian legislation only 37,000 houses were constructed. There were governments of a wide variety ef kinds, but I repeat that in 21 years, only 37,000 homes were constructed. In the next ten years 22,000 houses were built. Since the present Government has been in office the picture has been transformed. In the last ten years no fewer than 145,000 homes have been built. This is a record achievement for any government. It is a splendid achievement even for this Government, which has the welfare of ex-servicemen at heart. The provision we are now considering makes a substantial increase in the maximum amount of the loan. It deserves the approbation of members of both Houses of the Parliament.

213,Mr Failes,"No necessity for itiare so little concerned about the fundamentals of parliamentary appropriation, all right. This, as everybody knows, is one of the Government's measures to stimulate the economy. Everybody knows that for years there has been a long list of people waiting for assistance under the war service homes scheme. The money available has been insufficient to satisfy the demands of the applicants for assistance. The Government is increasing the amount of the loan, which suggests that the total expenditure will be increased. Despite what the Minister for Social Services( Mr Roberton), who is now at the table, may say there is still nearly one-third of thefinancialyear to go. There is certainly more than a quarter of the year to run. Calculated on the basis of a total appropriation of £35,000,000, a sum of £12,000,000 at least still remains unexpended. Seeing that the amount of the loan for each house is to be increased by approxiDrummond, D. H . mately one-quarter, if this measure is to mean anything there should be an additional appropriation of some £4,000,000. I suggest, particularly in view of the explanaFairhall, A. tion that was given in another place some months ago when a similar measure was bruited, that the Minister for Social Services, if he is competent, or the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt), if he knows, should at least indicate the overallfinancialdifference that this measure will involve. Mr Harold Holt -There will be no change in this year. from the Treasurer why there will be no change for the remainder of the year. Mr Harold Holt -It is because we have not altered the Budget appropriation. duced in another place, there was still more than one-third of the financial year to run. If this measure is designed to increase the rate of home building in the next four months, how can that objective be achieved when, if a greater sum is to be made available to each applicant, there is not an increase of the total appropriation for the year?

222,Mr Swartz,"The Minister for HealthSir Garfield Barwick -The following is the answer to the honourable member's question:The full text of the joint statement issued in Washington on 6th March by the Foreign Minister of Thailand, Thanat Khoman and the United States Secretary of State, Mr Dean Rusk, as received from the United States Embassy in Canberra, is as follows:The Foreign Minister for Thailand, Thanat Khoman, and the Secretary of State, Dean Rusk, met on several occasions during the past few days for discussions on the current situation in South-East Asia, the South-East Asia Collective Defence Treaty and the Security of Thailand. The Secretary of State reaffirmed that the United States regards the preservation of the independence and integrity of Thailand as vital to the national interest of the United States and to world peace. He expressed the firm intention of the United States to aid Thailand, its ally and historic friend, in resisting Communist aggression and subversion. The Foreign Minister and the Secretary ot State reviewed the close association of Thailand and the United States in the South-East Asia Collective Defence Treaty and agreed that such association is an effective deterrent to direct Communist aggression against Thailand. They agreed that the Treaty provides the basis for the signatories collectively to assist Thailand in case of Communist armed attack against that country. Secretary of State assured the Foreign Minister that in the event of such aggression, the United States intends to give full effect to its obligations under the Treaty to act to meet the common danger in accordance with its constitutional processes. The Secretary of State reaffirmed that this obligation of ths United States does not depend upon the prior agreement of all other parties to the Treaty, since this Treaty obligation is individual as well as collective. In reviewing measures to meet indirect aggression, the Secretary of State stated that the United States regards its commitments to Thailand under the South-East Asia Collective Defence Treaty and under its bilateral economic and military assistance agreements with Thailand as providing an important basis for United States actions to help Thailand meet indirect aggression. In this connection the secretary Minister the actions being taken by the United States to assist the Republic of Vietnam to meet the threat of indirect aggression. The Foreign Minister assured the Secretary of State of the determination of the Government of Thailand to meet the threat of indirect aggression by pursuing vigorously measures for the economic and social welfare and the safety of its people. The situation in Laos was reviewed in detail and full agreement was reached on the necessity for the stability of South-East Asia, by achieving a free, independent and truly neutral Laos. The Foreign Minister and the Secretary of State reviewed the mutual efforts of their governments to increase the capabilities and readiness of the Thai armed forces to defend the kingdom. They noted also that the United States is making a significant contribution to this effort and that the United States intends to accelerate deliveries to the greatest extent possible. The Secretary and the Foreign Minister also took note of the work of the joint ThaiUnited States committee which has been established in Bangkok to assure effective cooperation in social, economic and military measures to increase Thailand's national capabilities. They agreed that this joint committee and its sub-committees should continue to work toward the most effective utilization of Thailand's resources and those provided by the United States to promote Thailand's development and security. The Foreign Minister and the Secretary were in full agreement that continued economic and social progress is essential to the stability of Thailand. They reviewed Thailand's impressive economic and social progress and the Thai Government's plans to accelerate development, particularly Thailand's continuing determination fully to utilize its own resources in moving towards its development goals. The Foreign Minister and the Secretary of State discussed the desirability of an early conclusion of a treaty of friendship, commerce and navigation between the two Thc countries which would bring into accord with current conditions the existing treaty of 1937. 2. The Australian Government places the greatest importance on the security and integrity of the Seato area, of which Thailand is a vital part, and it therefore welcomes the declarations contained in the joint United States-Thai statement. The terms of my answer to the honourable member's question without notice on 8th March have been transmitted to the Governments of the United States and Thailand, as will be the terms of this. Those Governments will thus be informed of the Australian Government's attitude. 3. Although the Seato Treaty envisages collective resistance to aggression, each party agrees under Article IV (i) that, in the event of armed attack in the Treaty area against any of the Parties or against a State designated in the Protocol, it will act to meet the common danger in accordance with its constitutional processes. It reviewed with the Foreign is therefore plain, as the Secretary of State said, that "" the Treaty obligation is individual as well as collective"". The Treaty provides the basis for collective action by the signatories and much detailed planning bas been done in an effort to make such action effective. However, it is a matter for each of the partners individually to determine, in advance or at the time, the precise manner in which it carries out the obligations which it has accepted. Of course in making its decisions the Australian Government will take into account tbe consultation and planning within the Seato organization and the action which other members are prepared to take, collectively or individually, but at the appropriate time will decide itself how it will perform its obligations under the Treaty.",92,Answers To Questions
