Petition received and read. Commerce and Agriculture any information to give to the House in regard to the charges-which the honourable member for Wentworth made recently in this House.concerning the quantity of luggage that had been brought into Australia by public servants returning from abroad? the honourable member for Wentworth asked for information regarding public servants who, returning to Australia from America, had brought with them luggage exceeding 1 ton in weight. On the 13th May, the Minister for Trade and Customs replied that if the honourable member could furnish a reference to the case or cases which . he had in mind, he would obtain. and supply to bwn the details sought. Sneakinc on the motion for the adjournment of the House on the evening of the 13th May, the honourable member for Wentworth supplied some particulars of three instances in which public servants returning from America had brought with thorn personal luggage exceeding 1 ton in weight. The Minister for Trade and Customs has had inquiries made. With the aid of the information given by the honourable member for Wentworth. on that evening, he has been able to ascertain the circumstances in each case, and has asked me to inform the House accordingly. The first case mentioned apparently refers to Mr L. C. Scarborough, who was appointed to the Australian War Supplies Procurement staff in March, 1941. by the then Prime Minister( Mr Menzies). The conditions of his appointment provided that both he and his wife would be sent to New York and returned to Melbourne at public expense. Having been resident in America for about four years, they returned to Australia in Mirrdbooha, which arrived at Sydney on. luggage, consisting of ten oases and six barrels, was returned on Trevanian. These packages were entered at the Melbourne Customs House on Import EntryNo. 1650, dated the 23rd August, 1945*. A statutory declaration was -furnished at",7,Setup

4,Mr Pollard,"On the 8th May,the same time hy Mr Scarborough to the effect that-the luggage consisted of personal effects and second-hand household effects. The luggage was inspected by a customs officer, and found to be in accordance with the declaration. The second case to which the honourable member apparently refers is that of Mr Pollard) was nothing more or less than F. J. Marcusson, who, in June, 1945, was transferred to America. Before leaving Australia, Mr Marcusson sold all his furniture, and as it was intended that he should stay for three or four years in America, he and his wife and daughter set up home there. Due to the reduction in staff of Australian War Supplies Procurement in America, following the termination of the war, it later became necessary to transfer Mr Marcusson to Australia. The luggage for himself, his wife and daughter was sent to Australia on Whistler, and was landed at Sydney. It consisted of seven cases of household and personal effects, which were entered at the Customs House, Sydney, and a statutory declaration made regarding those goods which were entered as household effects. The third case seems to refer to Mr instead of tabling the reply, the Minister P. J. Winspur, who was appointed to the staff of Australian War Supplies Procurement in America. The then Minister for Trade and Customs, Senator Keane, and the Public Service Board approved of the removal to Australia, at public expense, of Mr Winspur, his wife and child when his services were no longer required in America. The luggage for the three of them was despatched to Australia on City of Capetown, and consigned to Melbourne. As the ship is not due in Melbourne until the 25th May, 1947, details regarding the luggage will not be available until that time. However, Mr Winspur has been living in America for six or seven years and, therefore, sixteen cases of household and personal effects do not, in the circumstances, appear to be an undue amount of luggage. It is regrettable that the honourable member for Wentworth, when asking these questions, should have, by innuendo -The Minister may not debate the they are I shall continue to administer matter. ceedings in this House are governed by the .Standing Orders, and by recognized precedents which you, Mr Speaker, have very rigorously and justly upheld.

Now, gets another honourable member to ask him a question relating to the same matter. Such a practice is entirely out of order, and should not be allowed. yesterday. For some years past, the practice has been growing of Ministers replying to questions some days after they were asked, when there were other methods by which.the information might be conveyed to the House. I stopped that practice, I thought, by ruling that, in these circumstances, a Minister should ask for leave of the House to reply. I pointed out yesterday when a similar instance occurred and an honourable member had asked directly on that day for information, that the Standing Orders do not prevent the Minister from giving an answer. A similar incident has happened again to-day. If the House wishes to remedy the position, the Standing Orders will have to be amended. While the Standing Orders remain as them.",11,Customs Charges On Public Servants Luggage

11,Mr Speaker,"This matter arosein the House on Wednesday last, the Attorney-General, in dealing with dismissals from the Prices Branch, is reported to have saidThe facts in the matter are that the Prices Branch recently commenced inquiries, in cooperation with the Commonwealth Investigation Branch, in relation to four officers of the to 60 and 75 per cent.? In view of that Prices Branch. These four officers subsequently tendered their resignations to the Prices Branch, and they were accepted. I have received a telegram from, one of the officers concerned, Mr Leslie R. Horsey, which reads as follows:Protest untrue statement by Dr. Evatt allegedly reported Sydney newspapers concerning resignation. In my possession notice of dismissal signed Herlihy, D.P.C. I. ask the Attorney-General to ascertain what are tbe facts in regard to this matter, whether these men tendered their resignations, or whether they were dismissed. If they were dismissed, will the right honourable gentleman make the necessary .amends to the men concerned in order to disabuse the minds of those who heard his statement of the impression that these men had resigned because an inquiry was being held? similar in terms from Mr Horsey complaining of what I ha4 said. During the debate I did not mention his name or the uames of any of the other men concerned. Mr Horsey's telegram indicated that his services had been terminated. I accept the position that there was a, termination of his services. That, however, had nothing to do with the point raised in the debate, which was that, when inquiries were approaching finality, the references to the inquiries made by the honourable member for Wentworth had tended to interfere with their completion. As to Mr Horsey's position, T accept the facts as staled in his telegram. The Minister fcr Trade and Customs informed me last night that fihere had been a termination of the services of these men. Thev were temporary and not permanent public servants. In each case there wap a termination of services and not resignation. I was in error, and I am glad that the honourable member has given me an opportunity to correct it. ister know .that earlier this year the then Acting Prices Commiissioner, MrH . E. Bishop, intimated that the increase of the basic wage would affect primary producers, requirements of such items as wire, nails, wire netting, and fencing wire, by, in some instances, up increase and other increases in the costs of the requirements of primary producers, will he consider .the appointment of an authoritative body to make a speedy report on what are reasonable prices, liaving regard to cost, profit, capital and other conditions ? If so, will he arrange that the body be constituted in such 'a way as to safeguard the interests of the States and to preserve the principles of producer representation in all its inquiries ? any particular statement by Mr Bishop. When the Prices Commissioner, Mr McCarthy, was ill , Mr Bishop temporarily replaced him. The sub-committee of the Cabinet that reviewed the position at the time of the increase of the basic wage by 7s. a week gave a general indication of policy to Mr Bishop. ThatI received a telegram was the proper thing to do in all the economic circumstances. After :the meeting, Mr Bishop issued a statement. The policy intimated to Mr Bishop has been carried out. I will not delay the business of the House by covering everything dealt with or the general principles laid down. It is known by honourable members that the Prices Commissioner operates under powers given to him by regulations. Some of the information supplied to him in the course of his operations is not even available to the Minister for Trade and Customs, who is ministerial head of the Prices Branch of the Department of Trade and Customs, or, indeed, to me. . It is thought desirable that that should be so. No one should be in 'a position to use in any argument information about purely private business affairs supplied by business men.

I shall ask the Secretary-General of the ANZAC agency, whose head office is in Melbourne, to obtain from the Imperial War Graves Commission the information which the honourable member requires. ister aware that modern developments in acoustics enable hearing aids to be provided for deaf children ? Is he also aware subject of long consideration by a special that the British Government proposes to supply portable hearing aids to all deaf children in that country? Will he make a sympathetic examination of this matter for the purpose of ascertaining whether we in Australia can follow that example ? don I discussed briefly with the responsible authorities their proposals for providing hearing aids not only for deaf children, but also for deaf adults. I understand that the British Minister for Health, Mr Aneurin Bevin, intends to make provision, in the general health scheme for Great Britain, for deaf persons to receive hearing aids at a cost of approximately £10 sterling. The existing price is considerably in excess of that figure. I am not aware that any special provision is being made in Great Britain for deaf children. Officers of the Commonwealth Department of Social Services are now in London discussing the matter of reciprocal benefits between countries constituting the British Empire, and I shall ask the Minister for Social Services to give sympathetic consideration to the honourable member's questions. ister whether it is a fact, as stated in a report from London in this morning's Sydney Morning Herald, and attributed to the Geneva correspondent of the London Daily Telegraph, that Australia's attitude towards its own protective tariffs has contributed.towards the."" comand plete impasse"" in discussions with the United States delegation at the international trade talks. Can the right honourable gentleman give an assurance to the House that Australia is not delaying the trade talks by refusing to lower its tariffs on manufactured goods of the United States of America and other nations? trade negotiations at Geneva, including requests from Australia to other countries and from other countries to Australia, in regard to tariffs have been the Cabinet sub-committee, which had advising it an important inter-departmental committee. This matter has been the subject of many meetings during the last twelve months. At some periods two meetings a week have been held. It would not be possible, in answering the question, to cover all the ground, for the subject is most complex. The Cabinet sub-committee has conveyed information to our trade delegation at Geneva regarding the maximum concessions that Australia can make not only to the United States of America, but also to the United Kingdom and the fourteen other countries associated in the discussion. The determination of the maximum length to which Australia can go in these matters, having regard to its own economy, involves many complex considerations in regard to what we can give to other countries and what other countries can give to us. The Government is not prepared to make concessions without getting some reciprocal benefit. Australia has not been responsible for delaying the general discussions and negotiations at Geneva. A difficult problem has arisen in regard to wool, and I shall not go into it at length now. We regard wool as very important. It is, of course, our most important exportable primary commodity and, in our view, it is essential that there should be a freer use of wool throughout the world. The United States of America, and some other countries, allow the cheaper types of wool, the poorer grades and long staple wools free entry.

What guarantee will tlie taxpayers have that if another line of steamers is acquired the ships may not later be practically given away? noon the Minister for Supply and Shipping and I received a deputation of representatives of the shipowners.

I did not give them a direct answer on that matter, because it is the subject of a special inquiry. TheyI t is true of a conalso asked whether it was likely that the Government would engage in interstate seaborne trade with its own vessels. I replied that possibly it was, but I should not be able to announce the policy of the Government unti l it had been finally determined, and I was merely giving my impression of what might happen. I believe that other matters also were raised. My reply to the latter portion of the question is that nobody can guarantee what a future Parliament w ill do. That matter w ill be governed by the views that are held by those whom the people elect to the Parliament as the Government of the country. I notice a report in M!r.

Bill presented, and read a first time. Minister and Treasurer) [11.11] -by leave I move That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to give authority to the Treasurer to issue Australian silver coins containing a reduced silver content. At present, our silver coinage contains 92£ per cent, fine silver. Thebalance of 7 i per cent, consists of alloy, a mixture of copper, zinc and tin This, bill provides, in lieu of the present provisions of the Coinage Act, for the issue of silver coinage of 50 per cent, fine silver, thebalance being, alloy. The reason for; the alteration is the increase of the price of silver. The Australian price of silver is based on the London price. Before the war, the London price was 2s. l^d. sterling per fine oz., the equivalent Australian price being 2s: 7£d. In September, 1945, a rise of price in the United States of America -forced the London price to 3s. Sd. sterling per fine oz., which was. equal to 4s. 7£d. per fine oz. in Australian currency. A further increase, of price' in the United States' of America in August, 1946; sent: the London price tocurrency, and we were paying this price for our silver bullion until early in February, when the price fell to 4s: 7d. Australian. Towards the end of February, the-Australian price rose again to 4s. 9^d. Since then, the price has fluctuated, and the present Australian price isabout 4s.. 8id. The increase was due to action taken to raisethe price of silver' in the United States of America. This action was influenced no doubt by the "" silver bloc "" States, which desired to l if t the priceeventually to over a dollar per oz. But the increased price brought repercussions, notably from the United Kingdom and India, which caused a halt, followed by a decrease of the price. The Government of the United Kingdom began to use cupro-nicol instead of silver for making coins. Some action is now necessary to adjust the silver content of our coinage and the Government has decided to adopt 50 per cent, silver as the basis of the new silver coinage. This basis is the same as that currently adopted in New Zealand, and is the same as that which was adopted in the United Kingdom for many years. I believe that coinage with a silver .xmtent of 50 per cent, should give us adequate protection, particularly as the price of silver has steadied somewhat. Moreover, a reduction of the silver content of our coinage will assist us to build up the stock bf 11,000,000' oz. which we obtained from the United States for coinage pu-rposes during the war. This quantity must be returned within a period of five years from the date when the President of the United States declares the war emergency to have ended. We are buyingpractically the whole of our local production which is available after allowingfor demands of industry. This is roughly 6,000,000' oz. per annum, and any amount not required for coinage will be used to build up a reserve to meet our obligation to the United States. For a time, of course, the new silver coins will circulate with the old ones, but the latter will gradually be withdrawn and melted down to provide bullion for the new issue-.

The use of stamps showing denominations in gallons would obviate the need for surcharging stocks of unsold stamps on hand when changes in the duty are made, and would f u l l y meet the requirements in collecting the duty and safeguarding the revenue. It is proposed, therefore, to amend section 26 of the Beer Excise Act to provide for the stamps to be purchased for an amount equal to the duty payable, at the rate of duty in force at the time of purchase, on the number of gallons shown on the stamps, and thus permit of the omission from the stamps of a monetary denomination. The next matter with which the bill deals concerns the exportation of beer. The Beer Excise Act as it now stands provides that the duty must be paid before the removal of beer from a brewery or from a delivery store connected with a brewery. As a result, when beer is exported, the brewer must first pay the duty and subsequently claim drawback for the amount involved. As w ill be realized, this-is a cumbersome procedure, involving the outlay of money by brewers and a considerable amount of superfluous work for both the exporter and the Department of Trade and Customsi n dealing with drawback claims. Provision exists in the relative acts for all other excisable goods to be exported under bond by means of export entries, and there is no reason why the procedure should not apply to beer also. Honourable members will note that the drawback provisions of the act remain in force and can be availed of by any exporter who so desires, but the additional avenue for exportation under bond w ill facilitate the business of the exporter, and, in no small measure, assist in the administration of the act. A further matter dealt with in the bill is the delivery of beer for consumption in Australia, which is non-dutiable in accordance with the provisions of the Excise Tariff. The Excise Tariff makes provision for the delivery of beer free of duty for certain purposes, but the act in its present for m makes no similar provision. This creates an anomalous position, and the amendment provides clear legislation by which the Excise Tariff can be implemented. There is also the question of dilution of beer. It is an offence under section 60 of the Beer Excise Act for any person to add any liquid to beer after its removal from a brewery with fraudulent intent to increase its bulk. The maximum penalty prescribed for such an offence is £20. The watering of beer constitutes a fraud against the revenue and against the consumer, and it is considered that the penalty provided is inadequate, particularly as such offences are extremely difficult to detect. In order to protect the revenue against frauds of this kind and, incidentally, to protect the public as well, the maximum penalty provided should not, it is considered, be less than £100, and it is proposed to raise the maximum penalty to that sum. I commend the bill to honourable members as a most desirable measure, as it w ill overcome difficulties of administration, provide additional facilities to exporters of beerj and make it unprofitable for a person to defraud the revenue by diluting beer. adjourned. Ministerf or Labour and National Service) [11.25] I move That tlie bill be now read a second time. The object of this bill is to amend the Quarantine Act 1908-24 in several particulars, which, for convenience, may be grouped into two parts, one dealing with human, and the other with animal quarantine. Clause6 of the bil l refers to quarantine of humans, and is designed to confer on quarantine officers additional power to control the movements of travellers from overseas, who may be a menace to health, u n t i l it is established that they are not infected w i th any serious communicable disease.

The act empowers quarantine officers to vaccinate or inoculate oversea travellers only whilst they are "" subject to quarantine "". Travellers who refuse to submit to this process may be prosecuted; conviction involve) only a monetary penalty. Immediately aftsr arrival of an aircraft at a first port, of entry in Australia a quarantine officer enters the aircraft and examines each person on board. If no one presents any evidence of disease, if there are no suspicious circumstances, and each traveller has a certificate of successful vaccination against smallpox, pratique is granted to the aircraft, and travellers are then free to land and go where they will. There may, however, be a passenger who has spent the previous week in, say, Calcutta, where small-pox is rife, and who cannot satisfy the quarantine officer that he is protected against small-pox. actually be incubating the disease, but shows no evidence of it and may not do -so until several days later. The present law stipulates that he shall be vaccinated, but it does not provide for him to be kept in quarantine or under surveillance unless pratique is withheld from the aircraft. The quarantine officer may, therefore, be faced with a decision as to whether he should withhold .pratique, to the great inconvenience of all travellers on board, or grant pratique and risk the entry into Australia of a person about whose freedom from quarantinable disease he may have a doubt. The amendment proposed by the bill will remove this difficulty by enabling him to grant pratique but place in quarantine or under .surveillance a traveller about whose freedom from disease he may have doubts. I mention at this point that section 84 of the act states that a quarantine officer who maliciously, and without reasonable cause, orders any vessel, person, goods, animal or plants into quarantine is guilty of an indictable offence, for which a penalty of two years imprisonment is provided. increase of air traffic from overseas into Australia has drawn attention _ to the necessity for this amendment, which will strengthen the hands of those who are Mr Holloicay. entrusted with the responsibility of guarding Australia against the introduction of diseases which do not exist in this country. The bulk of overseas air traffic originates in, or traverses, the very countries, in Asia especially, where smallpox, cholera, plague and typhus are so prevalent. Because Australia is an island, and far from other lands, it is in a unique position to provide an effective quarantine guard against importation of disease. The effectiveness of this barrier may be gauged by our freedom down the years from the major quarantinable diseases. On rare occasions some of them have gained a foothold here, but they have always been eradicated. For about a quarter of a century none of these diseases has passed our quarantine barrier, although on many occasions they have been detected on vessels arriving at our seaboard. Australia and New Zealand are This person may the only countries of considerable area in the world completely free of small-pox, cholera, plague and epidemic typhus, diseases which cause tremendous loss of life and efficiency in other lands. Sir Andrew Balfour, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, a foremost authority on public health, referred to Australia's quarantine service as ""possibly the most advanced and efficient in the world "", and no less an authority than Sir William Macgregor, physician, colonial administrator, explorer, author and former Governor of Queensland, stated that "" In Australia, quarantine safeguards are established on a firm and scientific basis"". Australia may take pride in this international reputation, but the greatest satisfaction of those responsible for our happy position is to know that their efforts have helped to keep our country free from these scourges. Until comparatively recent years our quarantine defences have had to operate only with respect to comparatively slow moving maritime traffic. The advent of The vast air traffic has introduced a new factor into the problem. No longer can we rely on the lapse of time, involved in a sea passage from port to port to assist us in our efforts. A traveller may be in Calcutta to-day and in Sydney within a few days and even this speed of travel may be soon eclipsed. Air travel has speeded interbeing the commonest. This disease does national communication to such a degree that it is possible for a person infected with small-pox or other exotic disease to arrive in Australia during the incubation period and, unless adequate precautions existed, to traverse the length and breadth of the land before the disease becomes manifest. Such a happening could cause a major disaster in this country. Medical, science has provided, in prophylactic vaccination and inoculations, a means of protecting individuals against infection with certain diseases. The most important bulwark in Australia's protection against the eventuality I have indicated is strict insistence on travellers themselves being protected against these diseases by proven prophylactic measures. Clauses' 3, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9 of this bill dealing with cases in which this prohibirelate to animal quarantine, and, in the tion was flouted. main, are designed to embody in the Quarantine Act, powers which it was found necessary to grant under National and various birds are required by regulaSecurity (Control of Animal Diseases) tions to be kept in confinement while a Regulations during the war years, and ship is in Australian ports.

Both are highly infectious and are spread by animal contact and by animal products and contaminated materials. In 1923, Western Australia had an experience of rinderpest, fortunately confined to a small area and eventually eradicated.

47,Debate (On Motion By Mr Fba,"WGIS)Repatriation) [11.38] I move That the bill be now read a second time. The bill is to amend the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act at various points, mainly in consequence of the decision of the Government to increase the pensions of certain classes of members of the forces, and widows of members who have died as a result of war service. The increase w ill be, in each case, 5s. a week, similar to the amount, of the increase to age and invalid pensioners, and widows within the scope of the Commonwealth scheme for widows under the bill to consolidate the social services legislation. Membersi n receipt of service pension will participate in the increase. Service pensions are really a scheme of age and invalid pensions for members of the forces. The .provisions are more liberal, in certain respects, than those of the civilian scheme, but generally the provisions of both must necessarily conform lo each other, .and the provisions of the Repatriation Act relating to service pensions contain both direct and indirect references to the In v a l i d and Old-age Pensions Act. That, act is to be repealed and replaced by suitable provisions in Part III . of tbe Social Services Consolidation B ill , and therefore, apart from the increase of service pensions, it is necessary to effect other amendments to the Repatriation Act to bring the references into conformity w i th the new legislation relating to age and invalid pensions. The increases will apply, of course, to the same classes of pensioners of both World WarI . , and World War II . , as the pension provisions are common to both wars, including the material alterations which were made by the amending net of 1943. Except for the amendment made last August whereby modifications were made to the provisions relating to income and property of service pensioners, the act has not been before Parliament since the general revision in 1943. Now that the demobilization of the forces is practically completed, it w ill be fitting to give honourable members a resume of the activities of the Repatriation Department arising out of the war. My purpose is mainly to show what has been done for those engaged since 2939, but I ask honourable members to keep in mind that, all through, the welfare of members and dependants of members of World WarI . has been attended to, with but little dislocation, by the Repatriation Commission along with the heavy task of administering the responsibilities which were assigned to the commission in respect of World War II . in the way of re-establishment, pensions, medical treatment, and other measures for the welfare of members and their dependants. The act, was amended in 1940 to extend the pension provisions and the existing genera] benefits to the forces of World War II . , and in 1941, regulations were made for the purpose of assisting members back into employment. These regulations were the first direct re-establishment measure; they provided for unemployment sustenance, the granting of tools of trade and payment of fares when the member was placed. In 1942, a parliamentary committee consisting of members of both Houses and of all political parties gave exhaustive consideration to the existing repatriation legislation and as to what further measures should be adopted by the Government, and undertaken by the commission in the way of re-establishment of members of the forces. As the result of the committee's report, the act was substantially revised, and the regulations were completely re-written so as to include new benefits and to effect general improvement of existing provisions. The main alterations effected to the act were a. general increase in all classes of pensions; a widening of the grounds relating to eligibility for pension; a generous interpretation of the provisions in the case of a doubt as to entitlement to pension; the inclusion, as pension, of certain allowances previously payable under regulation; and modification of conditions attaching to pensions. The new benefits provided in the regulations were as follows:(1) Loans of up to £250 to enable certain classes of members, or widows with children, to establish themselves in business.",22,Quarantinebill 1947 Second Readin G
48,Mr Barnard (Bass,"Minister for<2) Gifts of £75 for furniture to married members who were totally and permanently incapacitated, or blinded; also to widows with children. {3) Medical treatment was extended to cover, for certain classes of members, disabilities which were not due to service. {4) Free passages to Australia of wives, widows, or children of members who married abroad. (5) Free passages from Australia to abroad of incapacitated members, wives and children, or widows and children, where it was to their interest to join relatives and friends. (6) Transportation expenses to meet War II . and their dependants.

(7) Vocational training for disabled members, pending the institution of a general scheme of vocational training. Plans for a general scheme of re-establishment were commenced at about this time, and were eventually laid down in the Re-establishment and Employment Act 1945. Under that measure, the commission was charged with the administration of business loans, re-employment allowances, and allowances to apprentices during the completion of apprenticeship-al l of which were previously covered in the repatriation regulations. occupations, previously administered by the commission, were continued for a little longer, until the director of War Service Land Settlement was in a position to undertake them under the new act.

Eurther increases since then are being made as the commission takes over the military .'hospitals in each State. matters when we speak on the second reading of the bill. member for Balaclava ( Mr White) has frequently criticized the Department of Repatriation, and when he is supplied with factual data he appears to question the wisdom of providing it. The taking over of the military hospitals, being a transition from 'war to a state of peace, i.s a most interesting stage of the Commonwealth's responsibilities. It is also a difficult stage. .Nevertheless, the arrange-, nients are proceeding satisfactorily and, with the formal taking over last Monday of Concord Hospital, New South Wales, and Heidelberg Hospital, Victoria, the task is, in effect, completed, although many matters of detail will require attention for some time to .come by the departments concerned. By the transition, 3,5S0 .beds additional to those in other institutions controlled by the commission have become available. As to these other institutions, to cope with the additional numbers of members requiring treatment after discharge during the war years, some new institutions, and extension and rebuilding of existing institutions were necessary, and in this way the maximum bed strength was increased from 1890 to 2914. New sanatoriums for the treatment of patients were provided at Kenmore, Queensland, and Belair, South Australia. Additions were made to repatriation sanatoriums at Turramurra, New Victoria, and still further accommodation is being planned. Additional segregated accommodation .for patients suffering from mental disorders, whose condition is such as to necessitate their being kept under restraint, has been provided in New South Wales, Victoria,, ,and South Australia, and segregated accommodation for such patients is nearing completion at Wacol in Queensland and similar accommodation is being planned in Tasmania. [Quorum formed]. Additions, alterations and improvements have also been made to repatriation artificial limb factories to meet the increased demands on such facilities. These include the entire re-building of the factory in South Melbourne, Victoria. Additional accommodation, both for patients and staff, also the remodelling of the other services, has been carried out honourable at the Repatriation General Hospital, PTobart. The increased accommodation for patients of repatriation medical institutions has, of course, necessitated in many cases additional accommodation for .staffs and the provision of greater ancillary services. Honourable members will know at least one, and .some may know all, of the excellent hospitals that have been taken over from the Army. These institutions are 'familiar to the servicemen and to the 'community generally under their popular names of Greenslopes, Queensland; Concord, New South Wales; Heidelberg, Victoria; Springbank, South Australia; and Hollywood, Western Australia. The commission is now more advantageously placed than ever before for the purpose of providing high-degree medical treatment. In the course of time, certain existing institutions will be dispensed with, but the present position is as follows"" The older repatriation general hospitals in Queensland, Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia cannot yet be entirely dispensed with. In Queensland and South Australia, for instance, out-patients' facilities 'are being retained at Rosemount and Keswick respectively, whilst at the Prince of Wales Hospital, Randwick, New South Wales, it has been found necessary to retain accommodation for in-patients and also the out-patients' department.

A well-known ear, nose and throat specialist of Melbourne, who haB teen one of the visiting staff of repatriation institutions in that city for some years, was sent by the .commission to the United States of America to study the methods used in various clinics in the treatment and rehabilitation of the deaf, with particular reference to the fenestration operation of otosclerosis. Already a number of army and repatriation patients -requiring this latter operation have undergone the necessary surgical treatment. A survey relating to the efficiency of paludrine to the suppression of recurrences of malaria has been in train since August, 1946, with encouraging results. To sum up, it will be seen that from this account of the activities added as a result of this war, the Repatriation Department has an appreciable task. I have not mentioned some of the general benefits which apply to pensioners and beneficiaries of both wars, although earlier 1 asked' honourable members to keep in mind the fact that this work has proceeded steadily. Some idea of the overall task, however, will be realized when I say that the total annual liability on war pensions is at present £15,000,000.

The Seamen's Compensation Act, as honourable members are no doubt aware, deals with a. shipowner's liability for accident to a seaman in the course of his employment. While employed on the .high seas a seaman is outside the scope of any of the various State workers' compensation acts, unless he is employed on -a ship engaged only in intra-state trade. This explains the necessity for Commonwealth legislation in this field. A Commonwealth 'Seamen's Compensation Act was passed by this Parliament in 1909, but it was challenged in the High Court, which held that one section was invalid -because it purported to cover seamen",25,Analysis Of Pensions In Force As

57,Mr Dedman (Corio,"Minister foremployed on all Australian ships-intra state as well as interstate. The section in able to dependants when the injury susquestion referred to "" ships engaged in the coasting trade "" ; but, as is now well known, the Commonwealth power as to trade and commerce, including navigation and shipping, is limited. It does not follows the Commonwealth Employees' extend to intra-state trade and commerce. As the court decided that the particular section could not be severed from the rest of the act, the whole measure was held to be invalid. The case, Owners of SS. Kalibia v. Wilson, was heard in 1910, and is reported in 11 C.L.R., page 689. The 1909 act was, therefore, replaced by another in 1911. It was supported by all parties, and I hope that the present bill will receive the same general acceptance. It was 27 years before any amendment was made to the 1911 act. By 1938 it was agreed that the act had become out of date in a number of respects, chiefly in regard to the amounts of compensation payable, and an amending bill was then passed. Now, after another nine years, the Government has decided that further amendments should be made. The Commonwealth Government, of course, has workers' compensation legislacover will be provided against injury by tion in regard to its own employees, and it has a number of ordinances fixing employers' liability in its territories. The Commonwealth Employees' Compensation Act was substantially amended in 1944, and the intention of the present bill is to prescribe for seamen the principles then introduced. The more important provisions prescribed in 1944 were (1) Greater benefits to dependants in case of death; (2) greater benefits for the family of an injured employee; (3) increase in maximum aggregate total of weekly payments; (4) compensation for injury sustained while travelling to or from employment; (5) widening of the scope covered by industrial diseases; (6) injuries. When the 1944 act was passed, seamen I egarded the new provisions as representmonwealth Employees' Compensation ing the Commonwealth view of what was equitable compensation for injuries. The Government considers that a reasonable point of view, and by the bill it is proposed to amend the Seamen's Compensation Act on very much the same lines. llr. Dedman. For instance, the maximum amount paytained by a seaman results in his death is being increased from £750 to £S00, plus a payment of £25 for each dependent child under sixteen years of age. This Compensation Act. Weekly payments during incapacity will be two-thirds of the seamen's weekly pay, with a maximum of £3. In addition, £1 will be payable for a wife or a housekeeper dependent on the seaman, and Ss. Gd. for each dependent child under sixteen years of age. The total payment, of course, will not exceed the seaman's pay at the time of the a coi dentConsequent, upon the increase of the weekly benefits, it is necessary that an increase shall be made in the maximum which a seaman who is not totally and permanently incapacitated may receive in weekly payments. This maximum is therefore being increased from £750 to £1,000. Otherwise, weekly payments in some instances could not continue for so long a period as under the existing act. Again, following the 1944 Commonwealth Employees' Compensation Act, accident while the seaman is travelling to or from his place of employment. This feature of workers' compensation is also embodied in some State acts. The list of specified injuries in the Third Schedule, in respect of which lump sums are payable, is to be expanded, and the appropriate sums increased. They are based on a maximum of £800 in case of death, instead of £750 as previously. The list of industrial diseases in the Fourth Schedule is to be added to, by providing that compensation shall be payable in respect of any infectious disease contracted as the result of employment involving contact with the infectious greater benefits for specified sources of the disease. There are two provisions in the bill which have not been based on the ComAct. The first is a provision taken from the English and New South Wales acts that where a dependant dies before a claim under the act has been made, or, if a claim has been made, before an agreement has been arrived, at. or award made, tbe legal personal representative of tbe deceased dependant shall have no right to payment of compensation, and the amount of compensation shall be calculated and apportioned as if that dependant had died before tbe seaman. The second provision relates to the procedure for recording whether a seaman is righthanded or left-handed. This is because higher compensation can be claimed for the limb, the loss of which causes the greater injury. There are necessarily some provisions in the Commonwealth Employees' Compensation Act which are not applicable to seamen and have not been included in the bill. For example, there is a great variety of occupations under the Commonwealth, and this results in a longer list of industrial diseases than is necessary in the case of seamen; and, of course, the machinery clauses vary. In the main, however, the present amendments will bring the Seamen's Compensation Act into harmony with the Commonwealth Employees' Compensation Act. I shall be glad to explain all of these amendments in detail during the committee stage of the bill. I am sure that the bill will have general acceptance in the House. It will give t,o seamen a compensation law not inferior to that covering Commonwealth employees, and generally in line with State acts on the same subject. The Government has not attempted to take the highest rates of compensation payable in Australia, and incorporate them in the bill. ""Workers' compensation legislation throughout the States, the Commonwealth and the territories, is very irregular. This is receiving consideration, however, and already there have been discussions with a view to achieving uniformity. It may, therefore, be necessary later to submit further legislation. adjourned. Bill received from the Senate and (on countries a recognition of the fact that time. Minister for Labour and National Service) [1.2.7] -by leave I move That the bill be now read a second time. All honourable members will be pleased that it is now possible to introduce to 7 the Parliament a social services consolidating measure, although it is also in many important ways a creative one. As a consolidating measure, it repeals the whole of 43 acts, and portions of seven others. The 50 acts affected are listed in the schedule. The bill consolidates the law in relation to social service benefits under five well-known headings:-In valid and old-age pensions, widows' pensions, maternity allowances, child endowment, unemployment and sickness benefits. With the passage of time, certain portions of the existing legislation have become obsolete, making their repeal desirable whilst differing provisions in sections of a somewhat similar character in the acts relating to the various benefits have produced confusion and anomalies. Even departmental officers find them complicated, whilst to members of the public and overseas administrations they are highly perplexing. Without detailed explanations, they might easily be misunderstood and misinterpreted. The main objectives in the consolidation are to eliminate obsolete sections, remove anomalies, simplify drafting, amalgamate certain sections of the administration, modernize the legislation, and present it as a part of a well-defined pattern of social security. At the samo time, the Government is providing for substantial increases of the rates of invalid and old-age pensions, wives' allowances and widows' pensions, and is improving many of the existing provisions. In all except very few cases, the substantive alterations of the present law constitute improvements to and extensions of the various services that arp embraced in the scope of the bill.

60,Mr Holloway (Melbourne P O R T S,"that cannot properly be left to individuals and to organizations that are set up for charitable purposes. It is now an' accepted principle that the matter is one of community responsibility and that it must be implemented and administered at the governmental level. When the Constitution of the. Commonwealth of Australia became operative on the 1st January, 1901, it contained only one direct power in relation to the provision of social services, namely, the power to make laws with respect to the provision of invalid and old-age pensions. However, section 96 of the Constitution, which authorized the making of grants to the States, cither with or without conditions, enabled the Commonwealth to provide indirectly through the instrumentality of the several States, various benefits of a social service nature. The power that is contained in section 81 of the 1941, and was provided at the rate of Constitution, permitting the Australian 5s. a week. The cost to the CommonParliament to appropriate moneys from wealth of this benefit for the twelve the Consolidated Revenue Eund for the months ended the 30th June, 1942, was purposes of the Commonwealth, has also £11,302,863. That was the position when been used from time to time to achieve the Labour assumed office in October, 1941, same result in a more direct and comon the eve of the outbreak of war with prehensive way. Doubts as to the valiJapan. Since that date there has been dity of the legislation several of these benefits were raised by services by the Commonwealth. The rate the decision of the High Court of Au3<of invalid and old-age pensions has been tralia towards the end of 1945, in what is increased by successive alterations from now commonly known as the Pharmaceu21s. 6d. a week to the present-day maxitical Benefits case. This decision threw mum rate of 32s. 6d. a week. The bill grave doubt on the validity of child enproposes that there shall be a further dowment, funeral benefits, wives' allowincrease of 5s. a week, to operate from ances, child allowance and widows' penthe 3rd July next, thus bringing the rate sions, as well as other aspects of social of invalid and old-age pensions to 37s. 6d. service legislation. Following a referena week, representing an increase of more dum which was conducted by the Comthan 70 per cent, since October, 1941. monwealth on the 28th September last, there became embedded in the Constitution as from the 19th December, 1946, the date upon which the Royal Assent was time. These pensions were available to given to the Constitution (Social Services) Bill, a new and direct the rate of £1 10s. a week for a widow of power in relation to social services. This any age who had one or more dependent new power conferred upon the Australian children; a pension at the rate of £1 5s.

Several increases have already Mr Holloway. This alteration of the Constitution not 1 only confirmed the Commonwealth .power to provide social service benefits of a type already in existence, but also has given to it almost unlimited power in new and important fields of social service. When war broke out in September, 1939, the Commonwealth provided only two forms of social benefits, namely, invalid and old-age pensions and maternity allowances. At that time, the maximum rate of the invalid and old-age pension wa3 21s. 6d. a week, whilst the maternity allowance had a rangeof from £5 to£7 10s., the amount varying according to the number of other children in a family unit. The total cost to the Commonwealth of providing these two services during the twelve months ended the 30th June, 1939, was £16,428,396. Child endowment was introduced in implementing a truly remarkable development of social In 1942, widows' pensions were introduced by the Commonwealth for the first Alteration three classes of widows:A pension at been made. The present pension rates are 37s. Gd. a week and 27s. a week respectively, whilst the al'owance payable in respect of a widow in necessitous circuit stances is 32s. 6d. a week. These rates will each be increased by 5s. a week by the bill now before the House, the increases being operative from the Sth July, 1947. The bill also proposes to provide a benefit for a new class, namely, the wives of men undergoing sentences of imprisonment. . Pension in this case will be at the rate of 32s. a week. In 1943, allowances at the rate of 15s. a week were provided for the wives of invalid pensioners. The bill proposes that the rate shall be increased to £1 a week as from the 3rd July next. In the same year, also, child allowance at the rate of 5s. a week was instituted for the child of an invalid pensioner. A funeral benefit not exceeding £10 was also introduced to provide for the burial of an invalid or old-age pensioner. Maternity allowances, which then had a range of £5 to £7 10s., were increased to a range of £15 to £17 10s. In 1945, the rate of child endowment was increased from 5s. a week to 7s. 6d. a week. In 1945 a major advance towards social security was made when unemployment and sickness benefits were, for the first time, provided. important steps were taken in relation to invalid and old-age pensions-by raising the permissible income to £1, by lifting the property bar from £400 to £650, and by the introduction of a graduated scale between the sums of £400 and £650. The total annual cost of social services in recent years is indicative of the extensive growth that has taken place. The figures are as follow:£ 193839 193940 194041 .. 17.783,329 194142 194243 194344 194445 194540 1940-47 .. 57,556,300 It is expected that the total expenditure nature, will be brought together in conby the Commonwealth on social services venient legislative form. Ultimately, one during the coming year, 1947-48, will measure covering all the social service amount to £72,060,000. L100] In July, 1941, when Sir Frederick Stewart was Minister for Health and Social Services, the Government of which he was a member appointed a social security committee. This committee has presented a series of valuable reports on this subject. During the course of its investigations, the committee commented upon the intermittent and unrelated development' of social services in the Commonwealth, stressed the value of a truly national scheme, and suggested that the method of combining planned social security in codified legislation of the type adopted in some other countries could, with considerable, advantage, be followed in Australia. The Government acknowledged the advantages of the principle, and announced that it would be given effect as soon as practicable. Since then, the Government has, from time to time, introduced many major cocial reforms recommended by the committee, such as pensions for widows, unemployment and sickness benefits, and prepared a national scheme of social security in its widest sense. The bill now before the House represents the latest important instalment of the Government's plan. The acceptance of so many recommendations must be pleasing to those who In August, 1946, devoted much time, thought and energy to the committee's work. Turning now to the bill, I have circulated for the information of honourable members a list of the main alterations proposed to the existing law. This will, I trust, facilitate the examination of the measure. With the concurrence of the HouseI shall incorporate the memorandum, in Hansard at the end of my speech. The bill does not cover other social .. 16,428.390 service benefits such as hospital benefits, .. 10,870,209 allowances for sufferers from tuberculosis .. 19,004,559 and their dependants, and matters such .. .. 30,592,511 as national fitness grants. When the .. 39,149,114 Government's plans for pharmaceutical 39,409,015 benefits and a national medical service .. 52,050,316 have been developed, these, and other aspects of a purely medical or health activities of the Commonwealth in a scheme of national welfare may eventuate. The Government recognizes that all the social service benefits are merely aspects of health administration which, in its widest sense, makes for the mental, physical and social well-being of our people. The total cost of the increased pension rates, and the other improvements effected to the existing legislation, is estimated at fit, the two benefits costing, at present £6,185,000 per annum, made up as under:£ Invalid pensions Widows' pensions .. 570,000 Wives' and children allowances Sundry improvements For very many years, the old-age pension was regarded by some as being somewhat in the nature of a charitable grant. However, with increased rates and a higher permissible income, the age pension is now generally and properly regarded as a retiring allowance, based upon age, to persons who have made contributions over a long period to the economic life of Australia. Increases of the pension rate, and modification of the means test, have created many anomalies, and have induced many representations from superannuated persons and from others with independent incomes. The Government recognizes the strength of many of these representations, and intends further to ease the means test with a view to its ultimate abolition. The Government is also exploring the possibility of setting up a national superannuation scheme. A brief statistical statement will conper annum. Perhaps an even more imvey to honourable members an idea of the vast growth of social services in recent years. During the financial year ended the 30th June, 1939, the department dealt with only two kinds of benefits, invalid and old-age pensions, and maternity allowances. 327,000 pensioners, the cost of their penplete justification of the scheme. sions being approximately £16,160,000; during the same period, 81,000 maternity allowances were paid, totalling £437,000. At the present time there are approximately 358,000 pensioners, the annual cost of whose pensions amount to £29,500,000. This year, it is expected that there will be more than 197,000 Mr Holloway. maternity allowances, costing very nearly £3,000,000. Child endowment is paid in respect of nearly 1,000,000 children, and the cost is approximately £20,000,000 per anum. There are about 43,500 widows drawing pensions at a yearly cost of £3,300,000.' There are fewer than 10,000 people receiving unemployment benefit, and about 9,000 receiving sickness benerates, approximately £1,750,000 per annum. This year, it is estimated there will be more than 22,500 funeral benefits, and old-age involving the expenditure of about .. .. 5,200,000 £220,000. Honourable members will notice that a .. .. 140,000 new part has been included in the Con. . 275,000 solidation, namely, Part VIII . , "" Training and Physical Rehabilitation of Pensioners and Beneficiaries"". The provisions contained under that part are not new, but appear in the existing Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act, and in the Unemployment and Sickness Benefits Act. These provisions were inserted originally on the recommendation of the Social Security Committee. The training, rehabilitation and reconditioning of those who suffer some incapacity is of considerable consequence both to the individual and to the nation. In spite of the limited facilities available during recent years, since the 1st July, 1944, about 500 invalid pensioners have been trained and placed in employment, while 364 are in course of training. The rehabilitation of the 500 invalid pensioners cost the Commonwealth about £6,000, and resulted in a saving in invalid pensions of approximately £40,000 portant feature is the fact that former pensioners are now earning their own living. They are important units in the economic structure. They are putting into the Commonwealth revenue, and not taking out of it. They have a new psychoIn 1939j there were logical approach to life, and are a comAs honourable members know, reciprocity has been established between Australia and New Zealand in the matter of invalid and old-age pensions. Agreement has been reached with New Zealand for reciprocal arrangements regarding widows' pensions, unemployment and sickness benefits and child endowment We are now awaiting acceptance of draft acts and agreements which have been submitted to the dominion. At the moment, a conference of officers from all parts of the British Empire, including Australia, is meeting in London to explore the possibility of providing reciprocal benefits in social services throughout the British Empire. I propose now to deal with the more important new clauses of the bill. In the committee stage, there will be ample opportunity for detailed discussion. Perhaps the most important effect of the bill to individual beneficiaries is that the maximum rate of invalid and old-age pensions is to be increased by 5s. a week to £1 17s. 6d. a week. The first payment at the increased rate will be effected on the 3rd July next. Pensioner inmates of benevolent institutions will receive an extra Is. 6d. a week, and an extra 33. 6d. weekly will be paid to the management of the institution towards the cost of maintenance. The additional cost of the increased rates of invalid and old-age pensions is estimated to be £5,200,000 per annum. The conditions under which absences from Australia shall count as residence have been relaxed considerably. The permissible income has been increased by 10s. a week in respect of each dependent child under sixteen years of age-les s any amount received by, or in respect of, the child. For the purpose of the act, it will in future be permissible to regard a claimant for invalid pension as having become permanently incapacitated or permanently blind if the incapacity or blindness occurred during temporary absence from the Commonwealth. In this connection, too, the provision accepting permanent incapacity or permanent blindness occurring outside of Australia as the result of a congenital defect, if the claimant arrived in Australia under the age of three years, or has resided here for at least twenty years, has been extended to cover similar cases where the disability was not of a congenital nature. At present, the child's allowance is payable only to the wife of an invalid pensioner or to a male invalid pensioner who is married, or to a widower. It is now provided that a female invalid pensioner who has the custody, care and control of a child under sixteen years of age will get this benefit. Similarly, a child's allowance may be granted to an unmarried man who has the custody, care and control of a child. The time limitation of six months for lodging claims for funeral benefit may, under the bill, be extended where there are reasonable grounds for failing to lodge the claim within that period. It is intended also that the funeral benefit may be paid in respect of a deceased person who was a claimant for invalid or old age pension, and who, but for bis death, would have been granted a pension. An increase of 5s. a week will be paid to widows of all classes. The. first instalments at the new rates will be paid on the 8th July next. The total cost involved in this increase is estimated to be £570,000 per annum. An important new provision in the hill is that which qualifies a woman for a class A widows' pension subject, of course, to the means test, if she has the custody, care and control of one or more children under sixteen years of age. The act at present requires that she must be maintaining one or more such children. The Government has taken the view that from a practical point of view the person who has the actual care of the child, and who is responsible for its food, clothing, education and general attention, is usually the proper person to whom payment should be made. An innovation of importance is that the permissible income has been increased by 5s. a week in respect of tbe widow's first child and by 10s. a week in respect of each additional child, less in each case any payments received on account of that child. The bill provides that from July next widows' pensions will be paid fortnightly instead of each four weeks as at present. This will be a great convenience to tbe tens of thousands of widows who are to-day in receipt of pensions. The bill also confers a discretionary power upon the administration to continue the pension of a widow for a period not exceeding two years beyond the date on which her youngest or only child attains the age of sixteen years, provided Abe ebild is underthe maintaining of children, has been going full-time education, and is dependent on tbe mother. It is provided that when the bill becomes operative pensions will be payable to the wives of men imprisoned for six months or more. I now turn to a consideration of the new provisions relating to maternity allowances. Discretionary power has been given to extend the period of six weeks during which payment should be collected; payment of the higher amounts of maternity allowances will, in future, depend on the number of children under sixteen years of whom the claimant has the custody, care and control. A t present it is possible for the same child to be reckoned twice in different families, and the Government considers that this should be altered. In future it is intended to grant the maternity allowance to an alien mother provided either she or her husband has resided in Australia for at least a year, and payment in respect of a birth which occurs within twelve months after the mother's arrival here may be made on the expiration of a year from the date of her arrival. The times for payment of maternity allowance have also oeen altered so that £5 may be paid at any time within a period of four weeks prior to the expected date of the child's birth, and the balance of the total benefit, namely, £15, £16 or £17 10s., or more, as the case may be, will be payable immediately after the birth upon lodgement of a claim. This will operate in lieu of the present provision which stipulates deferment of the sum of £5 until the expiration of four weeks after the birth of the child. The provision under which payment of a maternity allowance in respect of the birth of a still-born child or a child which lives for has been used twice in restricting the less than twelve hours may be made only on satisfactory evidence that the child was viable has been altered to provide that the amount may be paid where the period of intra-uterine life of the child was at least five and a half calendar months. In reviewing the act as a whole, the Government decided to make certain changes in the child endowment system. Those of major importance are that here too, custody, care and control, instead of Mr Holloway. adopted as the criterion of entitlement. A new provision is that the requirement of twelve months' residence in Australia may be waived where there is satisfactory evidence that the claimant and the children concerned are likely to remain permanently in the Commonwealth. The restriction on the payment of endowment in respect of the children of alien parents has been removed where it is established that the children are likely to be permanent residents in Australia. The review of the legislation directed the Government's attention to certain anomalies in the present Unemployment and Sickness Benefits Act, and some amendments are being effected by the bill. An important one is that the requirement of twelve months' residence may be disregarded if the claimant is remaining 'permanently in Australia. The provisions governing the period during which a sickness benefit may be paid have been liberalized considerably. In future, payment will be made from the seventh day after the date of the incapacity, if a claim is made within six weeks after that date, or in special circumstances, within such further time as the Director General of Social Services permits. It has been decided to vary the present procedure in applying the means test for unemployment benefit where the claimant's spouse is in receipt of a pension. This will correct an anomaly which has given rise to some dissatisfaction, because at present the spouse's pension of 32s. 6d. a week, not only prevents any additional benefit from being granted in respect of the spouse, but also causes a reduction of 12s. 6d. a week in the benefit of 25s. which would otherwise be payable to the claimant. In effect, £1 of the pension amount of benefit payable. Provision is also being made for additional benefit in respect of a housekeeper where no such additional benefit is payable in respect of a wife, and provided there are one or more children under sixteen years of age, and the housekeeper is substantially dependent on the claimant but is not regarded as his employee. In future, the only payments in respect of the incapacity for which sickness benefit is claimed which will be deducted from the a m o u n t of benefit otherwise payable, w ill be amounts in the n a t u r e of compensat i o n , damages or other amounts payable by law , b u t not in c l u d in g any such payments for w h i c h the c l a i m a n t has made contributions. Othe r substantial alterations of the l a w are noted in the m e m o r a n d u m w h i c h has been c i r c u l a t e d to honourable members, In a d d it i o n , there has been considerable rearrangement and r e d r a f t i ng of the present acts to s i m p l if y b o t h in t e r p r e t a t i o n and i m p l e m e n t a t i o n . The o p e r a t i on of the b ill has been postponed to the 1st J u l y , 1947, to allow t i m e for necessary d e p a r t m e n t a l arrangements to be made and to ' p e r m it of the issue of f r e s h in s t r u c tions. I suggest t h a t the b ill constitutes an instalment of social justice, and is a further step towards the goal of social security which our people deserve and require. I feel sure that the broader approach to the question of social services, which is the basis of this measure, will have the general approval of the House. Following is the memorandum to which T referred earlier in my speech:BILL 1947. PART 1. Title. (Clauses1 and 3.) Social Services Consolidation Act. All existing Social Services Acts detailed in the Schedule are repealed. 2. Definition. (Clause 6.)

Existing approvals w ill not be affected. 41. Definition of income. (Clause 106.)

(Clauses 107, 108 and 109.) The requirement of twelve months' residence can be waived if the claimant intends to remain permanently in Australia. Provisions relating to absences have been deleted but any period of absence due to a war w ill be treated as residence. 43. Persons qualified for "" pension "". (Clauses 107 and 108.) Under the present act a person "" in receipt of, or qualified to receive"" an invalid or age pension, a widow's pension or a service pension is disqualified for unemployment, sickness or special benefit. The words "" qualified to receive"" have been omitted to permit the payment of benefit to an eligible person who, though possessing the qualifications for a pension, is not a claimant. 44. Loss of income. (Clauses 108 (2.).) The provisions under which payments made to certain specified relatives who act as a claimant's excluded in determining loss of income have Mr Holloway. been broadened. Bona fide payments to any substitute may now be accepted as a loss of income if made during a period of sickness. 45. Married women. (Clause 110.) Provision has been made for payment of benefit at such rate (within the maximum) as is deemed reasonable where a woman's husband is only able to maintain her partially. A married woman legally separated from her husband or living apart from him in circumstances which amount to a permanent separation is eligible for benefit. 46. Additional benefit in respect of partially dependent spouse. (Clause 112 (2.).) of endowment during temporary The provision undeT which additional benefit of £1 per week may be paid to a claimant in respect of a dependent spouse has been amended(a) to enable additional benefit to be paid at such rate (not exceeding £1 per UNEMPLOYMENT AND SICKNESS week) as is deemed reasonable where the spouse is partially dependent on the claimant; (b) to restrict the amount of additional benefit to the amount of the claimant's contributions where the parties are living apart and to permit payment of the additional benefit direct to the spouse. 47. A dditional benefit in respect of housekeeper. (Clause 112 (3.).) Provision has been made for the payment of additional benefit (not exceeding £1 per week) in respect of a claimant's housekeeper, where no such additional benefit is payable in respect of his wife, provided there are one or more children under sixteen years of age and the woman is substantially dependent on the claimant but is not an employee. 48.

(Clause 114 (4.).) Where the claimant's spouse is in receipt"" of a pension, £1 per week of the pension is to be excluded from income. This has been necessary to correct an anomaly. A t present the spouse's pension of 32s. 6d. per week not only prevents any additional benefit from being granted in respect of the spouse but it also causes a reduction of 12s. 6d. in the benefit substitute during sickness were of 25s. which would otherwise be payable to the claimant. SO. Compensation, damages, do. (Clause 115.)

Claimsf o r inappropriate pensions. (Clause 145.)

Bill received from tbe Senate and (on BILL 1947. Debate resumed from tbe 22nd May {vide page 2826), on motion by Mr That the bill be now read a second time. [12.38] -The bill before the House isone which, in my opinion, is most peculiarly worded, and which has a history that has not been disclosed by the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) who presented it to the House. If I am any judge of the political weather in international affairs , 1 this bill arises out of certain discussions which have taken place between the Government of the United Kingdom and the Government of the United States of America in relation to financial matters. I believe it is fair to assume that those in authority in. Washington have intimated to the Government of the United Kingdom that, in their opinion, it is high time that the dominions shouldered some responsibility in respect of financial commitments arising out of the war, and, in particular, certain theatres of war. There are two clauses in the bill, clause 2, which is the vital one, reading as IX -MISCELLANEOUS . follows:There shall be payable out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund, which is hereby appropriated accordingly, for the purpose of a grant to His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, the sum of £25,000,000 as a contribution towards war expenditure of that Government incurred by it in respect of operations and in and around the Pacific. We are entitled to very much more information than was given by the Treasurer as to the reasons for the inclusion of that restriction in the bill. The Australian Commonwealth was engaged in war in theatres other than the Pacific. We were engaged in the Middle East, our air and naval forces were engaged in the United Kingdom and in the Atlantic, and we were engaged in a training capacity in Rhodesia, and in Canada, where we were fairly heavily committed. The full effects of the benefits that Australia",28,Second Reading

63,Mr Archie Cameron (Barker),"has received from other dominions have not been stated to the Parliament by the Treasurer. Only a few days ago, the Sydney Morning Herald published the following statement under the heading, "" Canada's aid to Britain"" : The Canadian Government, under an agreement made with Britain last year, cancelled a debt of £A130.7 million owing by Britain for the British Commonwealth air training plan. This was mentioned in the British House of Commons by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, JDr. Dalton', in reply to a question about monetary gifts from the Dominions to Britain between August ""1, 1045, and April 1, 1947. Dr. Dalton said that mutual aid from Canada continued to September 1, 1945. The total from April1 to September 1, 1945, was £A206.1 million. Britain for the most part, he added, received munitions and military supplies, foodstuffs and farm products. Australia had made a gift <A £A25 million to Britain this year and New Zealand has given £A12.5 million. I am sure that the opinion of Dr. Dalton, a good Labour man, will be accepted by the Government and its supporters. That is an interesting statement. According to it, the aid granted by Canada to the United Kingdom, for a period of only five months, was valued at no less than £206,100,000. However, Canada has not stopped at that. I refer honourable members to the Auditor-General's report for 1945-46, paragraph 125 of which is as follows:Reference was made in previous reports to the financial arrangements between the Commonwealth and Canadian Governments regarding the training of Royal Australian Air Force air crews in Canada. In paragraph 113 of last year's report the total liability of Ausconnexion with Royal Navy construction. This tralia to Canada under the two-year agreement which expired on 31st March,'1945, was shown as $30,247,000 (£A8,560,311), which amount, less certain credits to Australia, it was stated, was being met by the Canadian Mutual Aid Board. The amount actually paid by the board to the Canadian Department of National Defence, Air Force Services, was the dollar equivalent of £7.909,754, the reduction of £050,557 in Australia's liability representing payments by the Commonwealth in Australia under the Air Training Scheme. It is anticipated that this expenditure by Australia reached on the division of costs of hospital will be slightly increased when certain intransit vouchers have been received and analysed. I presume that the statements will not be challenged or qualiWar fied by the Government. him, the Commonwealth one item from the Canadian Mr Archie Cameron. almost £8,000,000 in respect of moneys which were due by it to the Canadian Government under the EmpireA ir Training Scheme. I have examined the Auditor-General's report closely, but I have not found reference to any liabilities that we may have contracted, or any benefits that we may have received, from the air training depots in Rhodesia, where many Australians were sent. The £8,000,000 that Canada has given to us is almost one-third of the amount which we propose to give to the United Kingdom. After the suspension of the sitting, I intend to cite certain other figures from Government documents, every one of which has been laid on the table of this House. Sitting suspended from 12.4-5 to 2.85 p.m. to the section of the Auditor-General's report headed, ""Department of the Navy"", I take naval shipbuilding. According to the Auditor-GeneralAlthough final financial adjustment has not been effected with the Governments of the United Kingdom and India in respect of minesweeping vessels built on their behalf during the war, a further progress payment ol £274,999 was made by the British Government in March, 1940. Total progress payments received by the Commonwealth to 30th June, 1940, were£ United Kingdom. . 4,172,908 India .. .. .. 802,400 In addition, a sum of £80,000 was received from the British Government in respect of technical supervision and other services performed by the Department of tbe Navy in amount has been credited to Division 190oCredits arising from War Expenditure. That is a nice little item. Then we get the ""Allocation of Hospital Ships' Expenses *'. Paragraph 114 of the report statesAs reported in paragraph 105 of last year's report, agreement between Great Britain, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa was ships operated by those countries and employed in the Middle East Hospital Ship Pool. Since the date of agreement, the use of hospital ships has been extended beyond the scheme Auditor-General's then envisaged and the British Ministry of Transport has suggested a revision of the original agreement, and proposes that According to liability be assessed on the basis of a capitahas received in tion rate for personnel carried. Negotiations Government are proceeding.",38,Chifley
64,Mr Archie Cameron,"Coming,No sums are mentioned; but what I read into that is that the agreement under which we operated the hospital ship pool was unduly favorable to the Commonwealth of Australia and that the British Ministry of War Transport has therefore asked for a revision. Until we get a statement from the British Ministry about the hospital ship position we shall not know what our income may be-if I may use that term-fro m that source. I come now to"" Fleet bases and works for the British Pacific fleet."" The vital paragraph isTo 30th Juiie, 1940, expenditure on fleet the financial position in regard to our bases and other works amounted to £10,200,059, troop, A i r Force and Navy arrangements of which £ 10,095,000 has been reimbursed by in the United Kingdom.

This does not meet the obligations of Australia towards the United Kingdom, but merely touches on the fringe of them.. Those obligations extend to other parts of the world, on land, in the air and on the sea, where Australian forces were engaged throughout the war. We cannot pass over those obligations by saying that we confined ourselves to the war in and around the Pacific. To the Pacific area, towards the end of the war, were, sent some of the heaviest units of the British Navy. To the Pacific area, if the war had continued, there would have been directed, in addition to naval and air forces, many big land forces of the United Kingdom. able member is now admitting that he is out of order by saying that, if the war had continued, something would have happened, and proposing to elaborate on that.

According to statements which I have heard, the amount was £10,000,000.

But New Zealand, per capita, in potential resources, manufacturing output and primary production, does not rank so high as does Australia.

99,Mr Archie Cameron,"This billthe forerunner of other bills which will deal with other theatres of war. I shall not deal with the agricultural position of the United Kingdom because that was ably explained last night by the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page). I trust that after three Ministers visit the United Kingdom before next September, Australia's appreciation of its obligations to the country which saved civilization will be keener than is disclosed in this bill. measure before the House is a piecemeal measure. It is trifling with a problem that should be tackled in a realistic way, and on a realistic basis. The very title of the bill introduced a wrong note into the relationship which should exist between Australia and the United Kingdom. The approach has been that the United Kingdom is in sore financial difficulties, and that the only way in which we can help is to make a grant of eA.25,000,000. That is reducing the United Kingdom to the status of a mendicant. How is the £25,000,000 to be paid to Britain? Had the Australian Government decided to send to Britain food valued at £25,000,000 there might have been some merit in the proposal, but all that is proposed is that a bookkeeping entry shall be made. Our balances in London are to be reduced by £20,000,000 sterling. How much better off will the people of Britain be for that bookkeeping entry? Britain's external liabilities were increased by £3,500,000,000 during the war. £20,000,000 sterling is almost an infinitesimal amount; it represents about 2 per cent, of the recent loan to Britain from the United States of America, and it will not provide any real substance to Britain. According to the Government, Australia is already sending to Britain the maximum quantity of food that can be sent, and so this measure will not assist the people there by so much as one mouthful of food a day. Thus, the measure fails to satisfy the only test that would justify the use of the word "" grant"" in the title of the bill. The real problem, therefore, is one affecting the financial relations between Australia and Great Britain. The Prime Minister( Mr raising this argument the Government Chifley) told the Parliament that Australia has in London balances amounting to £170,000,000 sterling, but he did not tell us that Australia's public debt to Britain is £487,27.1,000 sterling. When on a former occasion a partial scaling down of Britain's debt in favour of Australia was proposed, there was an immediate howl of "" repudiation "" throughout the length and breadth of the land. The Prime Minister did not tell us that the British Chancellor of the Exchequer had requested this action, and therefore (Reid) [3.4] -The we are entitled to ask what is the background of the proposal. Let us examine the true position. It is suggested that because American servicemen spent a lot of. money in Australia during the war, and as we made those dollars available to the sterling bloc, we now have large credits in London. But even if we agree to wipe out £25,000,000 Australian of Britain's indebtedness, we shall still not improve Britain's position in relation to the dollar pool. Britain's need to-day is dollar currency, .not Australian currency. Britain would prefer to sell to Australia goods to the value of £25,000,000 than have Australia wipe that amount off the slate, because in that way Britain would be helping to re-establish its own overseas markets, which is that country's most urgent need if it is to survive as a major industrial power. The next argument that has been advanced is that Britain expended a lot of money in fighting the war in the Pacific. That statement places a very Compared with that sum sordid interpretation on the responsibilities of partners in a total war. It would be just as logical to suggest that Britain should recoup this country for the total expenditure in connection with Australian forces which participated in the Battle for Britain or in the North African campaign. That argument, is not fair to Great Britain, and it should never have been allowed to intrude itself in this discussion. The Prime Minister said that it is proposed to make this contribution towards the war costs . incurred by the British Government in and around the Pacific. That is as much as to say that the Pacific campaign was.of no real concern to the British Government. By reduces Australia's war effort to a materialistic basis. Surely, it is possible",43,Cameron Of Pressing My Views Whether The Figure
100,Mr Lang,"to approach this problem on a practical basis. Instead of thinking in terms of £25,000,000 Australian, it should be possible to review the entire incidence of the financial relationships between the two countries. Although we have a temporary liquid balance in London to-day, experience shows that such balances can vanish as quickly as they are created. A fall in wool prices, an increase of imports from Britain, or a drought, would wipe out the whole of our London balances. But there should be nothing to prevent an overall adjustment of the debt structure. At the present time Australia owes £487,000,000 in London and £40,000,000 in New York. On the other hand, we have £170,000,000 available in London, in balances that are held as liquid assets. only real basis is an exchange of goods The average rate of interest we are paying in London is £3 12s. Id. per cent., whilst the average rate in Australia is only £2 15s. 8d. per cent. At the present time we have to find over £16,000,000 sterling each year for our interest payment's to London and New York on government debts. Is not the practical approach to this problem, then, a twoway funding of the two debts ? Instead of Australia retaining the whole of its £170,000,000 in the form of liquid balances in London, why not use the major portion of it to reduce the long term debt? That would reduce our interest payments abroad, and would also lessen the drain on the sterling balance each year. That means that the London debt would, perhaps, have to be replaced by loans raised in Australia. Instead of the interest having to be paid in London, it would have to be found in Australia. That some such arrangement could be made was demonstrated by the Funding Arrangements Act of 1921, under which the total Australian war debt to Britain arising out of World War I. was funded. Again, during the depression a moratorium was granted in respect of the payment of interest on war debts. Britain stopped paying to the United States of America, and we stopped paying to Britain. Even so, we are still paying interest on the* war debts in connection with World TTar I. which were funded with the British public. So there is both precedent and sound common sense in favour of tackling the entire problem, Mr Lavg. not in this piecemeal way, but on a nation to nation basis. Let us forget all this most unfortunate talk about making a grant to Britain. It sounds too much like a hand-out, or charity. It cannot help Britain with its major financial problem. Can the Treasurer tell us how much interest Britain must find if we main* tain the whole of our £170,000,000 sterling intact ? Let us tackle something more than this, which is an empty book-: keeping entry. Let us survey the finan-* cial and economic relations between our two countries on a long-term basis. I said in this building many years ago, and I now say it again to this Parliament because I sincerely believe it, that the between the United Kingdom and Australia. We must buy more of each other's products. If our credits in London are too large, or our debt is too great, those positions are barriers to trade. I ask honourable members to consider that. Every £1 that we have to divert for interest means £1 less spent on British goods. Every £1 held in London is £1 that we could have spent. That, to my mind, is the crux of the problem. This bill, at its best, is an empty gesture. Let us make a substantial contribution towards the establishment of a sound basis for trade between our two countries. Let us overhaul the debt structure. Let usI put this seriously to the Treasurer, who is also the Prime Minister-repat riate as much as possible of our overseas loans. That would be in accordance with Labour's financial policy.

Later, I received from the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley), an answer to a question which I ashed upon notice, in which he stated that there were about 350,000 taxpayers awaiting refunds, and that refunds would be paid within a few days after personal, or written, application had been made. I have since received from one taxpayer a volume of correspondence dealing with his claim for a refund of tax. He paid his tax on the 3rd June, 1946, and the amount overpaid was £4 3s. Since that date nothing has been done. The latest letter he received is dated the 17th May, in which he was informed that the department was still dealing with his claim. If departmental officers can sit down and write letters over a period of twelve months, it might be easier for them to write out a cheque for the amount which is clearly owing. This is the kind of treatment which exasperates taxpayers. It is all very well Pollard) saying that. I maintain, howfor the Treasurer to say they can make personal application for refunds; but any one who visits a taxation office in any of the capital cities and sees the queues of claimants will get a fairly correct idea of their chance of having their claims dealt with. I assure the Treasurer that these cases are serious. As I said earlier, whilst a few pounds may not seem much to the department which handles hundreds of millions, it may represent an important consideration to a taxpayer who is overcharged that amount. Some time ago I asked the Attorney General (Dr. Evatt) if he would table the papers in connection with the prosecution of a man named Rudkin in Western Australia in 1940. I again ask the Attorney-General to attend to this matter. Possibly he will tell me next Tuesday whether he will comply with my request. I take this opportunity to protest against the reimposition of the levy on rabbit skins which was reimposed last Saturday at the rate of Is. 6d. per lb I bring to the notice of the Acting The Government's policy with regard to this matter is short-sighted. According to press reports, the United States of America, which in 1945-46 imported 13,000,000 lb. of Australian rabbit skins, worth approximately £5,000,000, is hoping to c»-operat e with Australia in a campaign for the promotion of an increased demand for rabbit skin coats, in which case America would double its present imports of rabbit skins. The point I emphasized is that the rabbit is the most serious menace to primary production, because it destroys grass, which is the most valuable of all crops. In addition, it destroys young crops. The rabbit is also responsible for much of our soil erosion, because its burrows give a start to wind and water to set up erosion. Ten million pounds sounds a lot of money, but no one can estimate the number of millions of pounds lost to Australia through the damage caused by rabbits. It may be argued that the price of rabbit skins is -high, and that it will not affect the matter much if a levy of Is. 6d. per lb. is imposed. I can imagine hearing the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr ever, that we should encourage the price nf skins to remain as high as possible so as to induce persons who ordinarily do not bother about rabbits at all to go out trapping them, especially now when labour is short and rabbit-proof fencing is scarce and dear. This pest must be eradicated of at least restricted if we are to obtain the full benefits of our fertile soil, and to derive benefit from irrigation projects. The effect of neglecting the control of rabbits will be felt not to-day or to-morrow but in ten or twenty years time. It is argued that by re-imposing the levy it will be possible to reduce the price of hats by 10s; each, but those hats are worn chiefly by people in the cities. The policy of the Government will have the effect of preventing the destruction of rabbits in the country so that people in the cities may have cheaper hats. If we weigh the benefits and disadvantages of this proposal it will be seen that no sound grounds exist for re-imposing the levy.

There must be some medical officers with members of the Royal Australian A i r Force in the occupation forces, and doctors are needed to staff hospitals and permanent establishments. However, I have been informed that permanent establishments controlled by the A r m y are staffed largely by civilian doctors. There are about ten Royal Australian A i r Force stations on the mainland where flying takes place, and I recognize that medical officers must be attached to those stations. A t the present time it is very rare for any medical man to apply for a permanent commission in the Royal Australian A i r Force, and it is not difficult to believe this when one knows the circumstances of the service. The pay is very poor-abou t £500 a year, which is the same as is earned by many skilled and semi-skilled tradesmen. no inducement for married medical men to join the service, because suitable living quarters are not provided. officers transferred from one State to another find it very difficult to obtain accommodation for their wives and families. This discourages the recruitment of medical officers, and, in turn, prevents the release of those officers who are already serving. The Repatriation Department pays £862 a year to medical officers, whilst the Commonwealth Medical Service pays about £1,000 a year. This is in marked contrast to the £500 a year paid in the air force.

Commerce and Agriculture) [3.45] The honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Turnbull) has voiced some objections to the imposition of a levy on rabbit skins exported from Australia. I think I should tell the honourable member the history of that levy. It was imposed in 1941 hy the Menzies Government, and was supported by the party to which the honourable member for Wimmera belongs. Its purpose was to ensure the stabilization of the price of hats for the Australian civil community, and for members of the defence forces. There is some logic and common sense in this levy. If Australia were to submit to the impositionupon its population of prices ruling in other parts of the world, our own internal economy, as it affects both city and country dwellers, would crash. In these circumslances, the Government has decided to continue the levy to which it is committed under legisThere is lation introduced by ihe Menzies Government. The levy operates in this manner: Rabbit skins are sold by auction, and the Medical sales are attended by both export buyers and local hat manufacturers who compete for the skins which are available. A f t e r a sale, the skins purchased for export at prices related to the internal economy of the countries represented by the buyers, are subjected to a levy which is determined by the Commonwealth Government fro m time to time. A t present it is Is. 6d. per lb. There is then a readjustment between the price of the export skins and the price of skins bought by Australian hat manufacturers, who are subsidized by the amount by which the view expressed by the honourable member",47,Refunds Rabbit Skins Royal Australian Air Force Medical Personnel

If we were to allow the prices of all other products to go to the extreme limits ruling in the United States of America, Great Britain or France, the Australian economy would be ruined, and our own stabilization schemes would go "" haywire "". The first sufferers would be the Australian primary producers and other members of the community dependent upon primary production. In these circumstances, there is no legitimate case for the removal of the levy. The honourable member's argument, in effect, is that the imposition of this tax of Is. 6d. per lb. on exported skins makes trapping unattractive. The fact is, however, that at the rabbit skin sales recently held in Sydney, a price of 9Sd. per lb. was realized. At eight skins to the lb..that is Is. a skin. When I was a youth, the price of rabbit skins was 6d. per lb.

Yes. 2. The application was refused because our tinned plate supply position is such that this commodity cannot be made available for the manufacture of small-sized containers for the packing of honey. 3. The application -which was made by the Queensland Country Women's Association for the release of tinned plate for the manufacture of small tins for the packing of honey for distribution to homes in Great Britain and refused by my department has been reviewed. Our tinned plate supply position is very short and difficulty w ill be experienced in providing sufficient to pack those more important foodunderstand that the British Ministry of Food desires that honey sent to the United Kingdom should be shipped in bulk containers not less L as t year, A u s t r a l i a exported than 4-gallon capacity. I appreciate that the distribution .proposed by the Queensland Women's Association is possibly something apart from the activities of the Ministry of Food, but at the same time in the light of our present shortage of tinned plate, the Queensland organization might perhaps review its proposed distribution with a view to utilizing the 4-gallon size container with a capacity of some 60 lb. and consigning them to an approfollowing papers were pre^ priate body in the United Kingdom which could possibly lepack into smaller jars for local distribution. senting the M in is t e r for S u p p l y and S h i p p in g , u p o n not i c e1.

If the cost has increased, what are the reasons for the increase? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. On the 7th May there was a shortage of 2,733 wharf labourers, comprising 534 day and 2,190 night requirements. 2. See answer to No. I . 3. To date the Waterside Workers Federation has admitted 444 new members, of whom 65 were reservists already working on the wharfs. No indication can be given as to the number of men likely to he deregistered, as there is no fixed number marked down foi deregister. Registrations are cancelled from day to day if circumstances warrant Buch action having regard to the regulations under which the Stevedoring Industry Commission operates. 4. The cost per ton of handling cargo in the port of Sydney in 1939 is understood to have been in the region of 3s. 6d. per ton. As at February last the latest date for which figures are available the cost was l is . 8.80d. per ton. This is the total cost and includes ordinary work, overtime, delayB, &c. 5. In common with most other industries, the Stevedoring Industry Commission must meet increases arising from many different causes. Enhanced costs in this industry ore part of the general problem of rising costs. Judge Foster's report on the stevedoring industry deals at length with this matter and in a manner not capable of being summarized as a' reply to a parliamentary question. Possibly tbe honourable member could .consult this report, which has been circulated to members of this House. for the Interior, upon notice1. Isi t a fact that in 1941 a ministerial ruling was given that, because of the war, no further pastoral leases would be allocated to new settlers in the Northern Territory until after the cessation of hostilities? 2. If so, will he explain why, in 1942, pastoTal leases of the delayed resumption due in 1935 were allocated back to the large holdings and, in some cases, to the original holdings? 3. Which Minister signed the lease instruments thereby releasing these .arease until 1984 to the large holdings on the Barkly Tableland ? 4. What are the names of the stations on the Barkly Tableland and in the Wave Hill district which were due for quarter resumption in 1935 and on which the Crown has not yet exercised its resumptive rights for 1985 and/or 1945 quarter resumption? 5. In view of the fact that the Alexandria Station lease (11,000 square miles) fell, due in totality in 1942, will he explain why no . resumption whatever from' this station is advertised in the recent announcement oT resumption? 6. Has this lease been . renewed ? 7. ' If so, is the renewal depriving returned soldiers of land they believed was reserved for them in 1941? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. No. 2. There was no demand for pastoral lands b> outside persons or companies when the lands were resumed in 1935. In order that the lands should not remain idle, and loss of revenue thereby incurred, the former lessees were given an opportunity of leasing the resumed lands for a period expiring on the 30th June, 1945. These leases have now expired and tlie land is now Crown lands. 3. See answer to No. 2. As stated therein, these leases were issued up to the 30th Jane, 1845. 4. This information is being scheduled and will be supplied as early as possible. 5. The lands comprising Alexandria Station were made available for application as four pastoral leases in Commonwealth Gazette, No. 152, dated the 28th May, 1942. Pastoral leases Nos. 427, 428, 429 and 430 were granted to the North Australian Pastoral Company Limited. The leases contain a condition that, if necessary, one-half of the total area of each lease may be resumed on the 30th June, 1965. No resumption for pastoral purposes may be made before that date. 6.

I am now able to in for m the honourable member that the Department of Trade and Customs has no knowledge of any cotton and silk textiles having been sent from Japan to America before being imported into Australia. An y Japanese goods required by Australia are purchased in Japan by Australian Government representatives who have been sent there for that purpose. The goods are shipped direct to this country and payment is made in dollars to the Supreme Commander, Allied powers, from whom dollars are received in payment for wool exported to Japan. Payment is thus being made in the same currency as that received in exchange for our wool. D EFAKTMENT OF TRADEAND CUSTOMS: the honourable mem her for Wentworth ( MrH a r r is o n) asked a question concerning the delay in the refunding to the Melanesian Mission of a deposit of duty of £200, lodged with the Department of Trade and Customsi n respect of a launch which arrived at Sydneyi n September, 1D46, for transshipment to the New Hebrides. Ministerf o r Trade and Customs has supplied the following information: Although the launch was shipped from Sydney in December, 1940, the agent for the mission at that port did not apply for refund of the deposit until the 14th March, 1947, that is, three months after the launch had been shipped. This was the principal cause of the delay in the refunding of the deposit; but a further delay resulted because the claim, through pressure of work in the department, had not been dealt with by the end of March and the deposit was automatically transferred to -revenue, thus involving a complication in dealing with the refund. The claim was ultimately forwarded, duly certified, to the SubTreasury, Sydney, on the 12th May and was paid to the mission on the 16th May. The",50,Banking
