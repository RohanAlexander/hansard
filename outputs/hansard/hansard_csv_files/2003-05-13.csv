The following answers to questions were circulated: Taxation: Australian Business Number (Question No. 94) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 13 February 2002: (1) Does a landlord require an Australian business number (ABN). (2) Does a tenant require an ABN. (3) Is a tenant who is operating a business from their rented accommodation required to supply an ABN to the landlord. (4) Does Taxation Ruling MT 2000/2 state that ‘If you let out residential premises where the whole of the premises is to be used predominantly for residential accommodation purposes you are entitled to get an ABN, but you do not need one for pay as you go (PAYG) withholding purposes?’; If so, what is the definition of ‘whole’ and ‘predominantly’ and how is the determination arrived at. (5) If a taxpayer rents a residential flat and uses one of the three bedrooms to run a web publishing business is he or she required to provide an ABN to the landlord. (6) How does a landlord determine (a) the use of the premises and (b) whether or not they should require the presentation of an ABN. (1) There is no legislative requirement for a landlord supplying accommodation to a tenant to have an ABN. Landlords supplying commercial premises to businesses may need an ABN to avoid the ABN withholding provisions and may also need an ABN for goods and services tax (GST) registration. (2) A tenant does not need an ABN just because he or she is a tenant, but may need an ABN because of his or her other activities. (3) The tenant is under no legislative requirement to provide an ABN, regardless of whether the tenant is registered for GST or not. (4) Yes. The terms ‘whole’ and ‘predominantly’ take their ordinary meaning and a landlord determines the matter on the basis of the facts of the particular case. The Australian Taxation Office would be able to provide advice to the landlord. (5) No. See (3) above. (6) (a) See (4) above. (b) See (3) above. Taxation: Anderson Consulting (Question No. 98) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 13 February 2002: (1) Was Andersen Consulting appointed to conduct a wide-ranging overhaul of the Australian Taxation Office’s (ATO) client relations, including dealings with taxpayers. (2) What was the estimated cost of this overhaul. (3) Was Minter Research awarded a $90 000 contract to review ATO relations with non-business clients. (4) Was the purpose of these taxpayer funded reviews to find out why the ATO (a) mishandled the transition to GST and (b) took so long to appreciate the difficulties small business was having due to GST paperwork; if not, what is the purpose of the reviews.",82,Appropriation Bill No 2 2003 I Commend The Bill To The House
192,Mr Costello,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) and (2) The ATO has not appointed Andersen Consulting to conduct any overhaul. (3) Yes. (4) (a) and (b) No. The contract was awarded to Minter Research to review and benchmark the quality of advice provided to the ATO’s individual client market. Local Government: Program Funding (Question No. 710 and 713) Ms Burke asked the Minister for Trade and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 19 August 2002: (1) Are there any programs administered by the Minister’s Department that provide, or have provided, funding to local government authorities in (a) 1996-97, (b) 1997-98, (c) 1998-99, (d) 1999-2000, (e) 2000-2001 and (f) 2001-2002. (2) If so, for each program for each of the years that funding was granted to local government authorities, (a) what was the level of funding provided to each local government authority, (b) what was the purpose for which the grant was made and (c) in which federal electoral division or divisions does this local government authority fall.

These programs include Residential Aged Care, Community Aged Care Packages, Rural and Remote General Practice, Regional Health Services and Multipurpose Services. The table below provides, for each of these programs, the purpose of the program, the direct funding provided to local government authorities from 1996-97 to 2001-02, and the federal electoral division/s in which the local government authority is located. Grant funding is also provided to local government authorities through the Home and Community Care Program (HACC) and information on HACC funding is readily available from 1999-2000 to 2001-02 (but not for 1996-97 to 1998-99). All funding figures are for direct funding to local government authorities. It is not possible to identify indirect commonwealth funding to local government authorities made through grants to State and Territory Governments. It is important to note that funding provided direct to local government authorities makes up only a small portion (the maximum being 19.7 per cent for the Rural and Remote General Practice Program) of the funding provided by each program that is covered in the table.",120,Questions On Notice

Under the HACC Amending Agreement, the Commonwealth does not require the level of detail above as part of its ongoing administrative data collection and thus information for earlier years is not readily available. HACC funding is distributed on a HACC Regional basis. As HACC Regions do not directly align with federal electoral divisions, projects are shown in the electoral division of their street address. This is, therefore, only an approximation of the HACC services/funding provided in each electoral division. The funding amounts are estimates only (and the funding amounts for the Victorian local government organisations also contain a small component of State-only funding.) Only those organisations/projects clearly identified as local government authorities have been included (from the organisation names provided by the States and Territories). There may be some other local government organisations not identified in this way.

(2) Will farmers receive millions of dollars in compensation for losing access to valuable water resources under a breakthrough property rights agreement to be endorsed by Federal Cabinet. (3) What sum will the decision cost. (4) What sum has been allocated in the Federal Budget to fund this decision and under which departmental program does it appear. (1) to (4) Arrangements governing farmers’ access to water resources are the responsibility of the States and Territories. On6 December 2002 the Council of Australian Governments reaffirmed its commitment to the water reform process agreed as part of the National Competition Policy Agreement in 1995, and to the release of a report for public consultation that addresses issues including the provision of adjustment assistance for changes in water entitlements. At that meeting I indicated to the Premiers and Chief Ministers that the Commonwealth considers that States and Territories should provide adequate adjustment assistance to individuals affected by the transition to sustainable water regimes, and that the National Competition Policy payments available to States and Territories until 2005-06 provide a substantial source of funds for such assistance.

201,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:commence on 1 July 2003. These reforms will include a more extensive role for the Director of Aviation Safety (Director), who will also be designated as Chief Executive Officer (CEO). The Bill contains transitional provisions which provide for the continuation of Mr Toller as the Director. The Director will have continued responsibility for CASA’s safety regulatory functions and as the single director for the purposes of the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 will have additional responsibilities. This new role will include the preparation of CASA’s Corporate Plan and the setting of terms and conditions for CASA’s staff. The position of Director will be paid the remuneration that is determined by the Remuneration Tribunal. (6) Yes. Aviation: Airservices Australia (Question No. 1218) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 10 December 2002: (1) Further to the advice given in Senate Estimates on 20 November 2002 that Air Marshal Houston and Airservices Australia have agreed to work towards the provision by Airservices Australia of air traffic control services at Townsville and Darwin airports, when will the consultation phase (a) commence and (b) conclude and which agencies and organisations will be included in that consultation. (2) Will the proposal involve Airservices Australia providing defence and civilian air traffic control services. (3) Does the decision relate to previous reports of a Defence shortage of air traffic controllers; if so, can the Minister assure the public that sufficient Defence resources exist to safely cover the functions until the proposed changes occur; in not, will interim measures be put in place. (4) Is the decision to transfer functions from Defence to Airservices Australia a ministerial or agency level decision. (5) Will any other airport or aviation functions be involved in a transfer of functions at (a) Darwin, (b) Townsville or (c) other airports; if so, which services and locations. Mrs Vale-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) The decision on which organisation will provide air traffic control services at Darwin and Townsville is still to be made. Government is reviewing the feasibility of integrating military and civil air traffic management systems to reduce duplication and costs. (a) January 2003. (b) July 2003. Department of Transport and Regional Services, Civil Aviation Safety Authority, Regional Airspace Users Advisory Committee, local aviation groups. (2) Possibly. The review is to determine whether integration would cut duplication and costs. (3) Sufficient Defence resources exist to safely cover existing functions. (4) The decision to conduct the study was made by the Minister for Defence and the Deputy Prime Minister, the Hon John Anderson MP, taking into account advice from their respective departments. (5) The review will focus on integrating civil and military air traffic management systems at Darwin and Townsville. This focus could broaden in time. Australian Defence Industries: Sale (Question No. 1254) Mr Murphy the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 12 December 2002: Further to the answers to question No. 679 (Hansard, 23 October 2002, page 8570) and to part (4) of question No. 394 (Hansard, 19 August 2002, page 4964), if his portfolio does not maintain current information on the shareholdings of these entities, (a) does this amount to an absence of control in ascertaining what vested interests have a controlling interest in the strategic assets referred to and (b) what security risks flow from this situation. Mrs Vale-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (a) Defence keeps informed on the current shareholding of contractors, including for the purpose of assessing the security implications of ownership arrangements. Control over shareholding arrangements can be exercised through such provisions as change of control provisions in contracts, where contracts would be at risk if Defence does not assent to changes in ownership. Changes of control may also trigger the provisions of the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975, where Defence is able to ensure any national interest issues are taken into account. In the case of ADI, changes in the controlling interest would likely trigger one or both of these provisions. (b) In addition to the above, the Defence Industrial Security Program provides for a comprehensive classified information and technology security regime and, within that, particular arrangements apply to companies which are partly or wholly foreign owned. Taken together, these measures ensure an appropriate level of security, both for the industrial capability and for classified information. Foreign Affairs: Hashem Aghajari (Question No. 1265) Mr Danby asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 12 December 2002: (1) Has his attention been drawn to the death sentence imposed on Iranian academic Hashem Aghajari for blasphemy? (2) Has his sentence led to the latest in widespread student demonstrations against the regime? (3) Is he able to say whether 83 reformist publications have been shut down by the judiciary in the past two years? (4) Is the Australian Government monitoring the status of Hashem Aghajari; if so what is his current status? (5) Has the Australian Government made any approaches to the Iranian Government about either of these matters; if so, what were the contents of these approaches? (1) Yes. (2) Yes. (3) No. When a publication has been shut down by the courts it often reopens under a new name. This makes it difficult to keep track of the exact number of publications which have been shut down. (4) Yes. Although his death sentence has reportedly been lifted, his situation remains unclear as the original sentence also included a term of internal banishment, 74 lashes and a 10 year prohibition on teaching. There have also been reports that his case may be referred back to the court that applied the original sentence. (5) Yes. Both cases have been raised with the Iranian Government in the context of concerns about human rights abuses.",207,Questions On Notice
202,Mr Downer,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Foreign Affairs: Indonesia (Question No. 1297) Mr Rudd asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 4 February 2003: (1) Did the Defence Minister suggest that Australian SAS forces could work with Indonesian Kopassus forces. (2) Since then, has Indonesia on a number of occasions ruled out the possibility of such cooperation, including comments by the Indonesian Foreign Ministry that Indonesia would not accept the presence of foreign military on its soil and the Indonesian Chargé d’Affaires’ statement that it is not possible. (3) During Senate Estimates, did the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade advise of reported links between the Islamic terrorist organisation Laskar Jihad and Kopassus. (4) How can the Government still be considering joint Kopassus/SAS operations in Indonesia when the Government of Indonesia is demonstrably opposed to such a proposal. (1) Senator Hill has said publicly that the government was considering the possibility of cooperation with Kopassus in the counter-terrorism context. The Defence Update 2003 also notes on pages 1920 that the Government is “considering limited cooperation with the Indonesian military forces on hostage recovery and hijack resolution – an area where, in an environment of heightened terrorist threat, Australian lives could rest on effective Indonesian capabilities and cooperation between the two defence forces.” (2) The Indonesian government has not made any official representations opposing cooperation with Kopassus on hijack recovery and hostage resolution issues. (3) I am advised that Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade officials said on 22 November that there are some indications that some elements of TNI may have links with Laskar Jihad. (4) See (2) above. Iraq (Question No. 1298) Mr Rudd asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 4 February 2003: (1) Is the Government aware of a report by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences that predicts that the costs of a war on Iraq could be as much as US$1.9 trillion. (2) Has the Government done assessments of the likely impact on the Australian and global economies of a conflict with Iraq; if so, what are the details of these assessments. (1) Yes. (2) Yes. Assessments have prepared as part of prudent contingency planning, in the event of a military conflict in Iraq.

Environment: Envirofund (Question No. 1324) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 4 February 2003: Will he provide a breakdown of the 1324 Envirofund projects by (a) type, including water quality, protection of native vegetation, salinity, coastal erosion, (b) electoral division and (c) amount. A list of the current 1317 Australian Government Envirofund projects which have been approved, including electoral division and approved amount is at Attachment A. As the Envirofund program seeks projects with integrated, multiple outcomes, it is not possible to list the projects by type to the level of detail requested by Mr Thomson. The projects have been listed within the four programs under the Natural Heritage Trust. The four programs funded through the Trust are: Landcare– reversing land degradation and promoting sustainable agriculture; Bushcare– conserving and restoring habitat for our unique native flora and fauna which underpins the health of our landscapes; Rivercare – improving water quality and environmental flows in our river systems and wetlands; and Coastcare – protecting our coastal catchments, ecosystems and the marine environment.

216,Mr Vaile,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows :(4) Yes. The Australia-US FTA features regularly in bilateral discussions with our partners in the region. (5) The Government is actively engaged in the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations, currently taking place in the World Trade Organization (WTO). The Doha Round offers WTO Members the opportunity to negotiate better market access for their exports in all sectors. (6) In addition to pursuing a free trade agreement with the United States, the Government is pursuing better market access and lower costs of trade in the Asia-Pacific region. We are pursuing this through regional fora such as APEC and the AFTA-CER Closer Economic Partner Partnership involving New Zealand and the ten ASEAN countries. We have finalised a Free Trade Agreement with Singapore. We are negotiating a free trade agreement with Thailand and we are pursuing Trade and Economic Agreements with China and Japan. We also pursue active bilateral trade diplomacy aimed at improving market opportunities for Australian exporters. Our success is well demonstrated by the recently signed LNG gas deals with China and South Korea– worth $25 billion over 25 years and $1 billion over seven years respectively. Australia has a major economic stake in Asia, with Asian markets accounting for about 56 per cent ($67 billion) of Australia’s total merchandise exports in 2002. Seven of Australia’s top 10 export markets are in Asia.

(1) Over 7000 participants in employee benefit arrangements have been issued with amended assessments.",281,Questions On Notice
217,Mr Williams,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,282,Questions On Notice
218,Mr Costello,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(2) Prior to issuing an amended assessment the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) sends the participant a letter entitled a ‘Notice of Intention to Audit’ in which the ATO asks for information from the participant. Once this has been returned, and depending on what information has been received an amended assessment is raised. (3) There is usually no way of knowing from particular tax returns whether a deduction has been claimed which relates to a specific activity, such as participation in an Employee Benefit Arrangement. As a result where participants do not respond to the above mentioned ‘Notice of Intention to Audit’ and subsequent reminders, an amended assessment has sometimes been raised which subsequently is found to have been unnecessary. This has only happened in a small number of cases and the amended assessments have been withdrawn or corrected as soon as the facts are known. Taxation: Tobacco Excise (Question No. 1365) Ms Jann McFarlane asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 5 February 2003: (1) Is the Minister able to say what sum the Commonwealth raised from excise on tobacco in (a) 1996, (b) 1997, (c) 1998, (d) 1999, (f) 2001 and (g) 2002.

(4) What direct action is the Federal Government taking to promote an anti-smoking message. the honourable member’s question: (1) The Commonwealth collects tobacco revenue from locally produced and imported tobacco products (including cigarettes) via excise duty and customs duty, respectively. In August 1997, at the unanimous request of the States, the Commonwealth announced an increase in the rate of Commonwealth excise and customs duty on tobacco, which were passed to the States as Revenue Replacement Payments (RRPs). RRPs were abolished on 1 July 2000. The table below shows total Commonwealth tobacco revenue and excludes RRPs. Amounts shown have been rounded to the nearest $10 million.

In subsequent booster stages, the following was spent: 1998-99 $2.66 million; 1999-2000 $2.84 million; 200001 $2.656 million; 2001-02 $2.625 million. (3) The Commonwealth does not provide any specific funding to the State and Territory Governments for tobacco campaigns. (4) As at March 2003, the Commonwealth has spent $19.5 million on the National Tobacco Campaign. The National Tobacco Campaign aims to reduce the prevalence of tobacco smoking in people aged 16-40 years. The Campaign is designed to elevate quitting on smokers’ personal agendas by",282,Questions On Notice

(11) Has China and the UNHCR signed a bilateral treaty in 1995 that guarantees the right to call for expeditious arbitration over differences in refugee policy. (12) Has the UNCHR submitted the treatment of North Korean refugees to arbitration. (13) Has Australia asked the UNHCR for such arbitration; if not, is the Government contemplating such a request; if not, why not.

(3) Pharmacists record the supply of PBS and RPBS items on a patient’s Prescription Record Form (ie. private prescriptions do not count towards the Safety Net). It is the patient’s responsibility to maintain a record of their spending and ask their pharmacist for a Safety Net Entitlement Card when they reach the threshold. HIC does not maintain a record of individuals and families spending for safety net purposes, as HIC has no record of PBS/RPBS items under the patient contribution amount because they are not claimed from HIC (although it is noted this can count towards the safety net threshold). (4) The information provided for question (3) is also applicable to this question.

(2) Why has Capital Jet Charter been the most frequent offender in relation to breaches of the Sydney Airport curfew. (1) Once my Department becomes aware of an alleged breach of the Sydney Airport curfew it writes to the airline operator requesting advice on the circumstances relating to the operation of the particular aircraft. (2) The aircraft used by Capital Jet Charter was a Cessna 525, which was a new aircraft type at the time. A designator code for this new aircraft type had not been programmed into Airservices Australia’s Noise and Flight Path Monitoring System (NFPMS) and the System was identifying the aircraft as a Cessna 500. The Cessna 500 aircraft is an aircraft type that is permitted to operate during the curfew. As the System was not able to correctly identify the Cessna 525, Air Traffic Control did not inform the operator that operating the aircraft was in breach of the curfew. My Department was not made aware of the alleged breaches until June 1999 once Airservices had the relevant information from the reprogrammed System available. Aviation: Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport (Question No. 1414) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 6 February 2003: Further to his reply to question No. 980 (Hansard, 4 February 2003, page 97) where was the Government’s aircraft noise policy stated at the time of the airport’s sale. At the time of the sale of Sydney Airport, a joint media release issued by myself and the Minister for Finance and Administration, Senator Nick Minchin, clearly stated that the sale of the airport would not change the Government’s noise management policies in any way, affirming that Sydney Airport would continue to be subject to the 80 aircraft movements per hour planning cap, the curfew from 11pm to 6am and the noise sharing policy implemented through LTOP. Defence: Weapons of Mass Destruction (Question No. 1425) Ms Vamvakinou asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 6 February 2003: (1) Further to reports of the potential use by the US armed forces of the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP) weapon in the proposed war in Iraq and in the ongoing War on Terrorism, (a) is the Government aware of the new nuclear weapons that the US is funding and (b) does the Government support the use of the RNEP or similar weapons in any military action led by the US. (2) Has the Government conducted investigations into the probable radiation contamination that Australian servicemen and women may be exposed to in any military action in Iraq. (3) Has the Government sought legal advice on the international constitutional law of engaging in armed conflict with Iraq without the endorsement of the UN; if so, what was the content of that advice. Mrs Vale-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) (a) The Government is aware that the United States (US) Administration is looking at a wide range of options to address the possible contingencies of a changed strategic environment, including the Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) threat. The US Administration has said that it will examine the option of modifying some of its existing nuclear weapons to make them more effective, but that there is no requirement for new weapons at this time. Having signed the Strategic Offensive Weapons Reduction Treaty with Russia in May 2002, the US has undertaken",303,Questions On Notice
233,Mr Anderson,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,305,Questions On Notice
234,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s questions is as follows:to make significant reductions to its operationally deployed strategic nuclear warheads – a two thirds reduction by the year 2012. (b) The Australian Defence Force, with Government authorisation, has been participating in US contingency planning for some time, and we are not aware of any indications that the US is considering the use of nuclear weapons in any military operations in Iraq. US Defense Secretary Rumsfeld told the Senate Armed Services Committee on 13 February that the US had every confidence that, in the event that force was to be used in Iraq, the US could do what needed to be done using conventional capabilities. US Deputy Defense Secretary Wolfowitz has also said publicly that, in relation to Iraq, the US has every capability it requires with its conventional forces, and sees no need to consider using nuclear weapons (2) Before agreeing to any military deployment, the Government carefully considers the range of potential risks and threats in the Area of Operations (AO), including environmental hazards, and ensures that all personnel deploying are properly trained and equipped for this environment. Coalition force environmental surveillance and monitoring of the AO would also be implemented during any possible military operation to ensure that the potential for exposure to environmental hazards was minimised for coalition forces as part of any operations in Iraq. (3) It is not the Government’s practice to comment on requests it may make for legal advice or details of any legal advice provided. Communications: Ethnic Community Broadcasting (Question No. 1427) Ms Vamvakinou asked the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 6 February 2003: (1) Further to his January 2003 letter to ethnic community broadcasters, “Message to Ethnic and Multicultural Broadcasters”, how many complaints has he or his representatives received concerning allegations of ethnic broadcasters or their programs inciting hatred or violence, if so, what was the number and nature of these allegations. (2) In the past 40 years of ethnic community broadcasting, how many complaints alleging incitement to hatred or violence by ethnic community broadcasters have been received by the Australian Broadcasting Authority or other relevant regulatory authorities. (3) Has he written a similar letter for distribution to commercial media broadcasters and outlets to ensure that they are aware of their responsibility not to incite hatred or violence. (4) What was the process of consultation and distribution for this letter with representatives from the ethnic community broadcaster sector. (5) Has he received letters of concern from ethnic community broadcasters or their representatives since the distribution of the “Message to Ethnic and Multicultural Broadcasters”, if so, how many. (1) My Department is aware of one documented allegation of a broadcaster being disloyal to Australia. (2) The code of practice for community radio broadcasting was first registered on 1 January 1996 and amended in October 2002. The Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) has investigated nine (9) complaints for breaches of the code concerning vilification or perpetuating hatred against individuals or groups. Prior to 1996, the ABA received twelve (12) vilification complaints concerning ethnic community programs on generalist community stations and investigated eight (8). (3) It was not necessary to write a similar letter for distribution to commercial media broadcasters and outlets as I regularly engage them on just this issue.",305,Questions On Notice
235,Mr Hardgrave,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Mainstream media also have a wider audience than narrow-casters. Narrow-casters offering a Languages Other Than English (LOTE) language service have a greater responsibility to their audience who do not have access to the ‘range of voices’ that multiple mainstream media outlets offer to their audience. Narrow-casters have limited windows of access to airwaves compared to mainstream broadcasters. For many narrow-cast listeners, there is only one source for news and information so Australian editorial standards promoting pluralistic debates rather than one-sided commentary are critical. (4) In a speech to the National Ethnic and Multicultural Broadcasters' Council (NEMBC) Conference on 17 November 2002, I stressed the importance of abiding by community radio broadcasting’s Code of Practice. At the same conference, the Labor Multicultural Affairs spokesperson echoed these sentiments. His media statement of 17 November 2002 expressed concern about the “increasing ability of overseas media to easily penetrate niche ethnic and religious markets in Australia”. I share Mr Ferguson’s concern. I had also discussed the letter and arranged for its distribution to members of NEMBC with its president, Mr George Zangalis. (5) As at 14 February 2003, I have received one letter from ethnic community broadcasters expressing concern about my communication. There has also been considerable positive feedback about it from ethnic broadcasters who are aware of the occasional problems in the sector and have endorsed my efforts to encourage Australian Editorial decision making for program content. Medicare: Bulk-billing (Question No. 1435) Ms Jackson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 11 February 2003: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 505 (Hansard, 19 August 2002, page 5072), is the Minister aware that residents of Gosnells, Thornlie, Maddington, Forrestfield and High Wycombe in the electoral division of Hasluck wishing to access a local bulk billing general practitioner are being told by the practices that they have either ceased taking new patients, or have up to 3-day waiting lists for appointments; if not, why not. (2) Is the Minister aware that 35% of general practitioner services in the electoral division of Hasluck no longer provide an ongoing bulk billing service to patients; if not, why not. (3) For each broad type of service categorised in the Medicare statistics, what percentage of services were (a) directly billed and (b) billed at or below Medicare schedule fees in the electoral division of Hasluck during (i) 1996, (ii) 1997, (iii) 1998, (iv) 1999, (v) 2000, (vi) 2001 and (vii) 2002. (4) For each broad type of service categorised in the Medicare statistics, what percentage of services were (a) directly billed and (b) billed at or below Medicare schedule fees in Western Australia during (i) 1996, (ii) 1997, (iii) 1998, (iv) 1999, (v) 2000, (vi) 2001 and (vii) 2002. (5) What was the total number of Medicare services provided during (a) 1996 (b) 1997 (c) 1998 (d) 1999 (e) 2000 (f) 2001 and (g) 2002 in (i) Western Australia and (ii) the electoral division of Hasluck. (6) How many services were provided per capita during (a) 1996, (b) 1997, (c) 1998, (d) 1999, (e) 2000, (f) 2001 and (g) 2002 in (i) Western Australia and (ii) the electoral division of Hasluck. (7) What percentage of Medicare services were provided at or below the scheduled fee during (a) 1996, (b) 1997, (c) 1998, (d) 1999, (e) 2000, (f) 2001 and (g) 2002 in (i) Western Australia and (ii) the electoral division of Hasluck. the honourable member’s question: (1) The Minister has advised that she has not received any correspondence in relation to the Hasluck electoral division or more specifically from the residents of Gosnells, Thornlie, Maddington, Forrestfield and High Wycombe during the period April 2001 to February 2003. (2) The Minister is not aware that 35 per cent of general practitioner services in the electoral division of Hasluck no longer provide an ongoing bulk billing service to patients. The Minister notes that the bulk billing rate for general practitioner services in 2002 for the electoral division of Hasluck was 76.3 per cent. The Commonwealth does not have statistics on the level of bulk billing by specific medical practices. However, in the electoral division of Hasluck in 2002, only six general practitioners out of 99 failed to bulk bill for a Medicare service and 42 of the 99 bulk billed for at least 80 per cent of their services. (3) The following table shows the percentage of services (a) bulk billed and (b) billed at or below Medicare schedule fees in the electoral division of Hasluck during (i) 1996, (ii) 1997, (iii) 1998, (iv) 1999, (v) 2000, (vi) 2001 and (vii) 2002, for each broad type of service categorised in the Medicare statistics: Electoral Division of Hasluck% Billed at or Below Year Broad Type of Service% Bulk Billed Schedule Fee 1996 Non-Referred Attendances – Recognised GPs 82.8 87.2 Other 89.2 90.0 Total 83.5 87.5 Specialist Attendances 46.2 54.9 Obstetrics 27.7 52.9 Anaesthetics 75.1 87.2 Pathology n.a. n.a.

Excluded are details of services to public patients in hospital, to Department of Veterans’ Affairs patients and some compensation cases. The Medicare statistics included in the answers to questions (3) and (5) to (7) were based on data captured at the servicing provider postcode level. In compiling statistics for the Federal electoral division of Hasluck, since some postcodes overlap Federal electoral division boundaries, statistics by servicing provider postcode were mapped to electorate using data from the Census of Population and Housing showing the proportion of the population of each postcode in each Federal electoral division. Since the statistics included in the above answers were based on servicing provider postcode, significant variations in statistics over time can be influenced by changes in the location from which services were provided. The provider counts included in the answer to question (2) were based on major practice postcode in the December quarter 2002. However, the bulk billing ranges were compiled having regard to activity over the whole year. In general terms, any practitioner with more than 50 per cent of Medicare Schedule fee income from non-referred attendances, based on claims processed in the December quarter 2002, was regarded as a general practitioner. Where a postcode overlapped boundaries for the electoral division of Hasluck, the provider count, the number of services and the number of services bulk billed were apportioned having regard to Census data.. Foreign Affairs: Zimbabwe (Question No. 1439) Mr Danby asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 11 February 2003 : (1) Is he able to say whether the Zimbabwean Home Affairs Minister, Kembo Mohadi, operates a policy by which state marketing of grain, the main subsistence foodstuff, is used as a mechanism to punish President Mugabe’s political opponents. (2) Is he able to say whether Didymus Mutusa, organising Secretary of Zanu-PF and member of the Mugabe politburo, spoke in August 2002 of ethnic cleansing stating that Zimbabwe would be better off with only 6 million people, and that it did not need these extra people. (3) Did the Troika of Government Leaders, set up to consider the Zimbabwe election at the recent Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Brisbane and of which the Prime Minister was a member, note its disapproval of Zimbabwe and that Australia has applied the policy of Smart Sanctions, restricting the movements of senior members of the Mugabe Government and their families. (4) Is he also able to say whether Mr Mohadi’s daughter is being educated at a private school in Australia; if so, given the Home Affairs Minister’s complicity in the regime of Mr Mugabe and Australia’s opposition to that regime, are there any plans to send Mr Mohadi’s daughter back to Zimbabwe; if not, why not. (1) I am aware of widespread and authoritative reports that the Zimbabwean Government’s Grain Marketing Board, which maintains a monopoly on the importation and domestic sale of maize, is distributing maize on a preferential basis towards perceived supporters of the ruling Zanu-PF party. I am not aware of the complicity in this practice of specific Zimbabwean Ministers. (2) I am aware of the reported comments by Mr Mutasa. (3) The Commonwealth Chairpersons’ Committee on Zimbabwe, chaired by the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and also comprising President Mbeki of South Africa and President Obasanjo of Nigeria, met to consider developments in Zimbabwe on 19 March 2002 and 23 September 2002. At its first meeting, the Committee decided to suspend Zimbabwe from the Councils of the Commonwealth for one year with immediate effect, on the basis of the Commonwealth Observer Group’s report which found that the Zimbabwe presidential elections of March 2002 were not free and fair. At its second meeting, the Committee expressed disappointment with the Government of Zimbabwe’s failure to engage with the program of action set out by the Committee at its first meeting, aimed at facilitating Zimbabwe’s return to Commonwealth values of democracy and good governance. The Committee has not commented on Australia’s imposition of bilateral targeted sanctions on Zimbabwe, which were announced on 13 October 2002. The sanctions restrict travel to Australia",308,Questions On Notice

(6) What are the costs, scope and schedules of all current projects compared with that originally approved. (7) What are the current limitations on deploying F-111 in battle air defence environments and how will these projects address these limitations. (8) What studies have been undertaken on the sustainability of the F-111 fleet out to its planned withdrawal date and what further studies are planned. (9) What has been the trend in the cost of operating the F-111 fleet over the last decade and what is the projected operating cost to its withdrawal date. (10) What is the current estimate of the annual cost growth due to aircraft ageing for the F-111 fleet. (11) What are the risk factors which might impede the retention of the F-111 fleet out to the planned withdrawal date.

(2) Reduced aircraft availability has affected the ability to maintain core skills across all operational roles and has limited the initial aircrew-training program, however, increased use of the simulator reduced the impact. Preparedness levels to meet military response options have been maintained where possible with some reduction in availability for various periods.

Difficulties with the integration, in particular problems with the facility required to develop and certify software, have caused delays to that schedule. Current schedule is to achieve operational capability in 2004. (7) While there are no limitations to planned operations, the equipment fitment under the Electronic Warfare Self Protection project and the introduction of improved stand-off weapons will reduce the risk associated with operating in higher threat environments and increase interoperability with coalition forces. (8) The Defence Science and Technology Organisation , Defence Intelligence Organisation, Air Force Headquarters and Capability Systems have previously conducted a number of studies into the sustainability of the F-111 in all of its roles. These studies have resulted in the instigation of a number of major capital equipment projects, as outlined in the Defence Capability Plan, which seek to sustain the F-111 capability until its planned withdrawal date. (9) Operating costs over the last decade for F-111 indicates an upwards trend of 6%. The future trend in F-111 operating costs can be expected to remain steady at around 5%, out to its PWD of 2020. The increased operating costs reflect major upgrades and routine repair and maintenance activities associated with ageing aircraft. (10) 5%. (11) The main risk factors are unforeseen ageing aircraft issues and logistics funding shortfalls. Immigration: Humanitarian Program (Question No. 1454) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 12 February 2003: (1) How many applications have been made under the Government’s refugee and humanitarian program in 2000-2001 and 2001-2002 through the embassies in Amman and Beirut, and how many of those applications have been granted. (2) What is the average waiting period for applicants under the refugee and humanitarian program who have applied in Amman and Beirut. (1) 2000-2001 program year: During the 2000-2001 program year, 1781 applications for visas were lodged at the Australian Embassy in Beirut under the offshore humanitarian program, and 5 applications were lodged at the Australian Embassy in Amman. Amman was not a designated processing post for humanitarian applications during the 2000-2001 or 2001-2002 program years. During this time, all applications lodged in Amman were transferred to Beirut for processing. During the 2000-2001 program year, the Embassy in Beirut finalised 2079 applications under the offshore humanitarian program. Of these finalisations, 507 were granted visas (comprising 251 refugee and 256 Special Humanitarian Program (SHP) visas). Applications finalised during this program year include applications that were lodged during previous program years. 2001-2002 program year: During the 2001-2002 program year, a total of 1919 applications for visas were lodged at the Australian Embassy in Beirut, and 16 at the Australian Embassy in Amman under the offshore humanitarian program. Amman’s applications were transferred to Beirut for processing. During the program year, the Embassy in Beirut finalised 2273 applications under the offshore humanitarian program. Of these, 500 were granted visas (comprising 245 refugee and 255 SHP visas). Again, applications finalised during this program year include applications that were lodged during previous program years. (2) Processing times for Beirut for the current program year to 31 January 2003 show that 50% of cases are finalised within 27 weeks with 75% of cases finalised within 66 weeks. This is the processing time from registration to finalisation, and includes rejections. The finalisation of approved cases shows that 50% of all grants are made within 38 weeks, with 75% of grants being made within 102 weeks. The additional time taken to finalise cases for approval is due to the processing of health and character checks, some of which may take more than six months to clear. Generally speaking refugee cases are finalised within shorter timeframes; SHP cases may take longer. Processing times for Amman (which became a designated humanitarian processing post this program year) are 50% of cases finalised within 17 weeks and 75% of cases within 18 weeks. These figures comprise only refused cases, as Amman has not granted any humanitarian visas this program year.

238,Mr Ruddock,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,322,Questions On Notice
239,"Mr Mcclelland Asked The Minister For The Environment And Heritage, Upon Notice, On 12","(1) Was the oil tanker Prestige that recently broke up and sank off the Spanish coast a single hull tanker. (2) Are there any incidents involving damage to single hull oil tankers in the region of the Great Barrier Reef. (3) Is he able to say whether the European Parliament is considering passing legislation banning these ships from European ports. (4) What is the Australian Government’s position in respect to single hull oil tankers sailing in the vicinity of the Great Barrier Reef and other world heritage listed areas. (1) Yes. (2) No. (3) I am unaware of any consideration in the European Parliament. However, the European Commission is proposing regulations to accelerate the phasing-out out of single hull tankers by 2010 and to prohibit the transport of heavy fuel oil in single-hull tankers to or from European ports. (4) The Government seeks to provide the highest possible level of environmental protection from shipping activities for the Great Barrier Reef that is available under international law and maritime conventions. The declaration of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park as a Particularly Sensitive Sea Area by the International Maritime Organization recognises the areas vulnerability to damage by international shipping by providing a range of special management measures to protect the area. These measures are being further strengthened through the current implementation of the recommendations from the July 2001 Review of Great Barrier Reef Ship Safety and Pollutions Prevention Measures. In December 2002, Australia also upgraded its ship inspection program so that all single-hull tankers are targeted for inspection when visiting Australian ports. Foreign Affairs: Abdi, Mr Abbas (Question No. 1471) Mr Danby asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 12 February 2003: (1) Is he able to say whether a leading Iranian reform strategist, Abbas Abdi, was sentenced in Tehran to seven years imprisonment in January 2003? (2) Was the crime for which Abbas Abdi was jailed for publishing an opinion poll showing that three out of four Iranians favour relations with Washington?

This brings the total sentence to eight years. (2) No. Mr Abdi was jailed for espionage. (3) Yes. (4) No. (5) Yes. (6) The Government has been concerned about this and other attempts by some elements in Iran to restrict the freedom of the press and continues to follow the case closely. (7) President Khatami was democratically re-elected in 2001 with a significant majority of the vote. (8) The Government deplores the jailing of Mr Abdi as part of a concerted attack on the freedom of the press by some conservative elements in Iran and will continue to urge the Government of Iran to initiate a program of judicial reform to address this problem.

It is the patient’s responsibility to maintain a record of their spending and ask their pharmacist for a Safety Net Entitlement Card when they reach the threshold. HIC does not maintain a record of individuals and families spending for safety net purposes, as HIC has no record of PBS/RPBS items under the patient contribution amount because they are not claimed from HIC (although it is noted they can count towards the safety net threshold).

Civil Aviation Safety Authority: Specialist Vacancies (Question No. 1506) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 13 February 2003: (1) Further to the reference in Senate Estimates in May 2002 to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority’s (CASA) problems filling specialist vacancies such as in the area of aircraft certification, what employment classifications in CASA are affected by this skill shortage and what type of qualifications, training and experience is required for these positions. (2) How many of these positions in CASA are filled and what is CASA’s optimum number for these positions. (3) What is the salary range for these positions. (4) Given Qantas, Virgin Blue and Rex are bringing in new aircraft, will this skill shortage impact on these airlines timeframes for obtaining the CASA certifications required. (5) Is CASA taking any remedial action to develop this skill set in Australia; if so, what; if not, why not. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) has provided the following advice. (1) Since the time that this issue was discussed in May 2002, CASA has not experienced any significant difficulty in attracting suitably qualified and experienced staff to fill vacancies in the area of aircraft certification, or in any other specialist area of the Authority. The employment classifications within the Area of Aircraft certification includes Airworthiness Officers, Airworthiness Inspectors and Airworthiness Engineers. The required qualifications and experience for Airworthiness Officers and Inspectors are: Have held an Australian Aircraft Maintenance Engineer’s Licence for a period of at least 8 years; OR An equivalent overseas Aircraft Maintenance Engineer’s Licence for a period of at least 8 years and the successful completion of the “overseas recognition examinations” conducted by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority; OR Australian Defence Force maintenance or maintenance training qualifications which, in the opinion of the Director of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, are appropriate to the duties of the office; OR Have held an airworthiness inspector’s position within a National Airworthiness Regulatory Authority. The required qualifications and experience for Airworthiness Engineers are: A minimum of a Bachelor Degree in Engineering, preferably Aeronautical or Mechanical, or equivalent providing eligibility for the Corporate Membership of the Institution of Engineers Australia, (mandatory); Experience working as an engineer in the aviation industry is desirable, including some exposure to regulatory control processes related to design and/or aircraft operations (including load control and aircraft performance), (desirable); Successful completion of an accredited quality system auditor course and/or practical experience in system auditing, (desirable). (2) The current organisational establishment for Airworthiness staff within CASA is 134. As at 4 March 2003, 122 of these positions are filled, with selection processes currently underway to permanently fill another three positions. (3) The current salary range for an Airworthiness Officer/Inspector/Engineer is $72,442 to $99,788. (4) As detailed in response to question 1, since the time that this issue was discussed in May 2002, CASA has not experienced any significant difficulty in attracting suitably qualified and experienced staff to fill vacancies in the area of aircraft certification. (5) CASA is not taking any action to develop this skill set in Australia specifically for its own staffing requirements. However, CASA makes a major contribution to the development of licensed aircraft maintenance engineers through the setting of training syllabi, conduct of examinations and conferring of licences.",352,Questions On Notice
252,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Civil Aviation Safety Authority: Audit (Question No. 1507) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 13 February 2003: Will he provide a list of recommendations arising from the most recent International Civil Aviation Organisation audit of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority’s operations, including the Governments proposed response to each recommendation and timeframe for concluding that action. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) has provided the following advice: A list of recommendations arising from the most recent ICAO audit of CASA’s operations together with status of actions as a result was provided in response to Parliamentary Question no 1185 asked on 4 December 2002. As advised in that response, all 16 of the ICAO recommendations were accepted by Australia. Civil Aviation Safety Authority: National Competency Standards (Question No. 1508) Mr Martin Ferguson the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 13 February 2003: Is the Civil Aviation Safety Authority developing new regulations for maintenance and manufacturing organisations; if so, (a) will these regulations harmonise with skill requirements for workers between Australia and other aviation nations; if not, why not and (b) has the issue of portability of skills for this industry internationally been given any consideration; if so, how and what was the outcome; if not, why not. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) has provided the following advice. Yes. (a) The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) is working in partnership with the Australian aircraft maintenance and repair industry to develop appropriate National Competency Standards. Some standards are already developed and endorsed by the Australian National Training Authority (ANTA). When fully developed, the suite of standards will form the legislated qualifications that CASA specify for certifying staff in component workshops under the new Civil Aviation Safety Regulation Part 145 and the qualifications CASA specify for the grant of an Aircraft Maintenance Engineer Licence to enable the certification and return to service for aircraft maintained in a CASR Part 145 (new regulation) Approved Maintenance Organisation. ANTA endorsed the first set of competency standards for aerospace manufacturing in 1997. (b) Yes. CASA is striving to ensure that qualifications specified in the new regulations for the maintenance of components and aircraft are fully transportable within Australia. However, it is harder to achieve international transportability. CASA, in conjunction with other Commonwealth Departments and Agencies is negotiating Bilateral Aviation Safety Agreements (BASAs) and other forms of mutual recognition agreements with a number of countries at the moment. Depending on the scope of individual agreements, there is potential for these to include provision for the acceptance of recognised qualifications.",357,Questions On Notice

254,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has recently commenced a project to investigate competency based training standards on an internationally harmonised basis. CASA understands that when this research is completed ICAO intends to incorporate competency training standards into the ICAO Annex 1. Civil Aviation Safety Authority: Regulatory Service Fees (Question No. 1509) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 13 February 2003: (1) With respect to the increase in Regulatory Service Fees listed on page 91 of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) 2001-2002 annual report, will he provide a breakdown of which services generated the additional $300 000 increase in revenue. (2) Which fees increased, by what sum, when was each fee first applied and to which part of the aviation industry is the fee paid. (3) What was the fee for each of these services in each year since the establishment of CASA in 1995. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) has provided the following advice: (1) The increase in revenue from Regulatory Service Fees last financial year is largely due to some large-scale tasks associated with Air Operator Certificate (AOC) applications and Certificate of Approval (COA) applications. Significant AOC applications assessed last financial year included: The assessment of Tesna’s AOC application following its initial interest in purchasing Ansett Airlines. The assessment of the first of type A330 application by Qantas. Australian Airlines’ application for the issue of its AOC. (2) The answer to this question was provided in answer to Parliamentary Question no 1186 asked on 4 December 2002.

(2) What additional steps will she take to ensure that Gold Card recipients are getting adequate medical treatment. Mrs Vale-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) The Department of Veterans’ Affairs has been advised of a small number of medical practitioners who no longer provide services or who intend to withdraw or restrict services under the Department’s arrangements. The overwhelming number of doctors are continuing to treat veteran patients. (2) The Department’s State Offices are available to assist veterans with queries relating to the provision of medical treatment. Any veteran who is unable to gain medical treatment because of a refusal to accept the Gold Card should contact the nearest State Office to gain assistance in finding an alternative doctor who will treat them under these arrangements. Defence: RAAF Aircraft (Question No. 1539) Mr Danby asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 3 March 2003: (1) How many RAAF aircraft will be used in the fly-overs during the Australian Grand Prix to be held in Melbourne in March 2003. (2) What is the overall cost of this exercise. (3) What is the fuel cost for the exercise. (4) Does the exercise conform to RAAF standard operating procedures, particularly with regard to safety and civilian areas. (5) What has been the cost of the fly-overs over the years that Melbourne has had the Grand Prix. (6) Did the Minister’s Department or office receive complaints from the public regarding this practice in 2002. (7) Can the expenditure of this amount of money on fly-overs for the Australian Formula One Grand Prix be justified in the context of the financial situation of the Minister’s Department. (8) Should the Grand Prix Corporation pay for the fly-overs. Mrs Vale-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) Ten. Two F/A-l8s (one display, one standby), seven PC-9s (six display, one standby) and one RAAF balloon. (2) The direct cost was $697,969. (3) $23,201. (4) Yes. (5) Prior to 1998 costs were determined using full costs. In 1998 and succeeding years, the cost basis changed and costs for Public Events of Significance such as the Melbourne Grand Prix were determined using direct costs. Also, over the period the direct and full cost hourly rates for aircraft types have been updated, so rates are not equal across years. The following costs are based upon cost waivers provided, using the cost basis and rates for the year the support occurred: 1996-2000 refer to answer given to question no. 1404 (Hansard, 14 May 1997, page 3682). 2001 refer to answer given to question no. 2451 (Hansard, 4 April 2001, page 26513). 2002 $106,637 (direct cost). 2003 $697,969 (direct cost). (6) Yes, six complaints. (7) Yes, refer to answer given to question no. 1567 (Hansard, 21 June 2000, page 18023). (8) No, refer to answer given to question no. 1567 (Hansard, 21 June 2000, page 18023). Centrelink: Overpayments (Question No. 1540) Mr Danby asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, upon notice, on 3 March 2003: (1) What is the procedure for raising and recovering a debt against Centrelink clients. (2) What is stated in any letter informing clients of the debt. (3) At what stage do payments start to be reduced in order to repay the debt. (4) What happens to repayments or reduced payments when appeals to an Authorised Review Officer, Social Security Appeals Tribunal, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or the courts are pending. (5) What happens to repayments or reduced payments in the time allowed for an appeal following an adverse decision. ing answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Where a person has received more than they are entitled, and the amount is lawfully recoverable, Centrelink calculates the amount owing and sends an advice of debt notice to the customer requesting repayment of the debt within 28 days. If a customer has not paid the debt, or made an arrangement to repay the debt, by the due date and the customer is receiving a Centrelink or Family Assistance Office payment, deductions are made from their payment at a standard rate. If a customer has not paid the debt, or made an arrangement to repay the debt, by the due date and the customer is no longer receiving a Centrelink or Family Assistance Office payment, Centrelink attempts to contact the customer to negotiate repayment of the debt. If the customer does not repay the debt, or make an acceptable repayment arrangement, Centrelink may take other recovery action, including referring the debt to a mercantile agent. (2) The advice of debt letter sent to a customer contains the following information: the date on which the letter was issued; the reason for the debt; a brief explanation of the circumstances that led to the debt; the period to which the debt relates; the amount of the debt; the day the debt is due and payable (the debt is due and payable on the 28th day after the date of the advice of debt letter); the range of payment options available;",365,Questions On Notice
259,Mr Anthony,"The Minister for Family and Community Services has provided the followcontact details for inquiries; and the customer’s review and appeal rights. (3) If the customer does not repay the debt by the due date, deductions from a customer’s Centrelink or Family Assistance Office payment commence from the customer’s next available payment. (4) Recovery action will normally continue during this period, except where a stay is ordered by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT). Any repayments made while a review is in process will not be taken to indicate the customer agrees with the debt and will not affect the review process. (5) Where the decision is in the customer’s favour, any repayments in excess of the total amount owed are refunded to the customer. Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (Question No. 1557) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 4 March 2003: (1) Will he provide a list of all activities undertaken by the Department of Defence since January 2001, in particular troop deployments and training exercises, which required exemptions under the EPBC Act. (2) Where activities were undertaken without exemptions, can he provide an explanation as to why no exemption was required. (1) Under subsection 28(3) of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) declarations have been made in the interest of Australia’s defence and security that, for approvals purposes, section 28 of the EPBC Act does not apply in relation to: (a) actions undertaken outside of the Australian jurisdiction that are directly related to the deployment and operation of Australian Defence Force elements in Central Asia in support of the international efforts against terrorism; and (b) actions, as deemed appropriate by the Commonwealth Government, undertaken outside the Australian jurisdiction in relation to the training, deployment and operation of members of the Australian Defence Force in the Persian Gulf region in support of any military action against Iraq. (2) Where relevant the Department of Defence has sought necessary approvals under the EPBC Act for its other activities. Foreign Affairs: China (Question No. 1561) Mr Danby asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 4 March 2003: (1) Is he aware of the recent efforts of the World Psychiatric Association (WA) to investigate psychiatric mal-treatment of political dissidents by the Chinese authorities. (2) Is he aware of Mr Robin Munro’s book Dangerous Minds, which details these abuses by the Chinese authorities. (3) Does he know (a) how many political dissidents are being held in psychiatric facilities, (b) how they are being treated, (c) if Munro’s book accurately describes their treatment, and (d) if concerns expressed at the WA conference in Japan are warranted. (4) What, if any, representations have been made to the Chinese government about these abuses of psychiatry.",373,Questions On Notice
260,Dr Kemp,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(5) Has this matter been brought up in the Australia-China Human Rights Dialogue. (1) Yes. (2) I am aware of a report titled Dangerous Minds which details alleged human rights abuses against political prisoners in China. (3) (a) No, I am not aware of reliable information about the inmates of psychiatric facilities in China; (b) I have no reliable information on how they are treated; (c) I can neither accept nor reject the accuracy of Mr Munro’s report. I look forward to learning the results of the World Psychiatric Association’s delegation; (d) I see no reason why the WA should not be concerned by what it believes to be credible reports of psychiatric abuse. (4) Australia regularly raises the issue of human rights abuses against political prisoners with the Chinese authorities. (5) Human rights abuses against political prisoners has been raised at each round of the Human Rights Dialogue. Fuel: Imports (Question No. 1569) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, upon notice, on 4 March 2003: (1) What has been the cost of the APEC project performed under the direction of his Department to assess the outlook of gasoline supply stability in Australia to date. (2) Have any findings been presented to government and what is the expected completion date of the project. (3) Were scenarios involving the use of MTBE in the APEC region included in the scope of the study. (4) Has his Department done any forward estimates on the demand for gasoline in Australia; if so, what are they. (5) Has his Department done any assessment of gasoline refinery capacity in Australia and the future; if so, what are they. (6) Is it the case that domestic refineries on current projections will be unable to keep pace with demand, thereby increasing our dependence on imports. (7) Does his Department accept that given the specifications on the future use of MTBE in production, importation of gasoline from the APEC region would be unsuitable for Australia and what cost implications would that have for domestic consumption. (8) Will the findings of the APEC study be released for public consideration; if so, when and if not, why not. Mr Ian Macfarlane-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) The total cost of the project is US$130,250, funded from the APEC Central Fund. (2) No. Preliminary findings have been made available to my Department and consequently to some industry members, however as the study is not complete, the final conclusions are not known, and no formal presentation has been made to the Government. At this stage it is expected that the project will be complete by the end of April 2003. (3) Yes. Based on known and projected fuel quality goals and policies in APEC member economies, and the capacity of refineries in the region, the consultants are modelling Base Case scenarios for the supply/demand situation in 2002, 2006 and 2012. From these Base Cases, they are then",374,Questions On Notice
261,Mr Downer,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:conducting further modelling to reflect differing product quality shifts. This work includes some assumptions about the use of MTBE. (4) An explicit objective of the APEC Study is to “match supply and demand and forecast supply security up to 2012”. The project methodology includes forecasting demand for transportation fuels for each member economy. As the Study is incomplete, information on projected demand for Australia is not available. (5) An explicit objective of the APEC Study is to “study supply capabilities of refineries in region”. To this extent, it is expected the final report will contain a quantitative assessment of refinery capacity in Australia, as well as other APEC member economies. However, until the Study is finalised, this information is not available. (6) Currently, imports constitute seven per cent of total fuel sales in Australia. The APEC Study methodology includes assessing supply/demand balances under a variety of conventional fuel specification scenarios. Until that work is completed it is not possible to draw any conclusion about Australia’s future dependence on imported crude and finished product. (7) The preliminary findings of the Study show that MTBE will become an important product to consider as an octane enhancer as fuel specifications throughout the region become more stringent. This however does not allow the Department to make projections about the likely future availability of MTBE-free fuel nor any assumptions about the costs of such fuel. (8) Yes. All APEC reports become available for public information. For this project the Department is proposing to conduct some peer review workshops, involving industry stakeholders, before the Study is released. Medicare: Services (Question No. 1570) Ms Hoare asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 5 March 2003: (1) How many Medicare shopfronts have been closed or amalgamated during (a) 1999-2000, (b) 20002001, (c) 2001-2002, and (d) 2002-2003. (2) How many staff reductions occurred due to closures or amalgamation of Medicare offices during (a) 1999-2000, (b) 2000-2001, (c) 2001-2002, and (d) 2002-2003. (3) Is it the case that some clients are experiencing waiting periods of more than 30 minutes when attempting to access the Medicare enquiry line, if so, why. (4) Is the Minister aware that some Medicare clients, particularly those with sight impairments, experience difficulty locating refurbished or relocated Medicare offices due to the minimised and vertical signage. (5) Has there been a decline in the number of claims lodged in person at refurbished or relocated Medicare shopfronts; if so, of what magnitude. (6) Has there been a rise in the number of complaints from clients experiencing difficulty in accessing these same locations; if so, of what magnitude. (7) How many complaints were registered by clients experiencing difficulty accessing Medicare offices as a result of (a) distance, (b) location, and (c) restricted opening hours during (i) 1999-2000, (ii) 2000-2001, (iii) 2001-2002, and (iv) 2002-2003. the honourable member’s question:",375,Questions On Notice
262,Mr Andrews,"The Minister for Health and Ageing has provided the following answer to(1) There have been no Medicare shopfronts closed or amalgamated during (a) 1999-2000, (b) 20002001, (c) 2001-2002, or (d) 2002-21 March 2003. (2) There have been no staff reductions due to closures or amalgamation of Medicare offices during (a) 1999-2000, (b) 2000-2001, (c) 2001-2002, or (d) 2002-21 March 2003. (3) It is not the case that some clients are experiencing waiting periods of more than 30 minutes when attempting to access the Medicare enquiry line. HIC Medicare enquiry lines received 310,241 calls over the months of January and February 2003. Extensive data analysis has been conducted and no record of any 30 minute wait has been found. The longest wait on record is 3 minutes and 6 seconds. HIC has answered 95% of calls in less than 30 seconds, well above its service level target of 90% in less than 30 seconds. (4) When relocating or refurbishing a Medicare office, HIC follows a corporate design standard which has been evaluated against disability standards. The signage used to display the word ‘Medicare’ is gold in colour on a green background. The sign contains the required degree of luminous contrast. The location of the signage can vary depending on the site and the requirements of the landlord. Shopping Centres are generally more restrictive in their ability to provide awning type signage. Awning type signage is common in the ‘strip’ type of Shopping Centre. When HIC is alerted to signage difficulties, it attempts to rectify this in the most practical way possible. (5) HIC has analysed data on relocated Medicare offices only. No analysis has been undertaken for refurbished Medicare offices as all Medicare offices have been subjected to some degree of refurbishment since 1999. Analysis of relocated Medicare offices shows that there has not been a decline in the number of claims lodged in person in those Medicare offices that have been relocated. The workload data of 42 Medicare offices that have been relocated indicates an overall increase of 8.96% in client visits for cash claiming. (6) There has been no increase in the number of complaints from clients experiencing difficulty in accessing these same locations. (7) The number of complaints registered by clients experiencing difficulty accessing Medicare Offices as a result of (a) distance, (b) location,and (c) restricted opening hours during (i) 1999-2000, (ii) 2000-2001, (iii) 2001-2002, and (iv) 2002-21 March 2003 are shown in the following table: Distance Location Restricted Opening Hours 1999-2000 0 5 4 2000-2001 1 0 4 2001-2002 0 0 3 2002-21/03/03 0 1 1 Foreign Affairs: International Court of Justice (Question No. 1573) (1) What are the (a) names, (b) nationalities and (c) principal qualifications of the five Members of the International Court of Justice who were elected on 21 October 2002 for a term of nine years beginning on 6 February 2003.

269,Mr Anthony,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Foreign Affairs: International Court of Justice (Question No. 1603) (1) On 17 March 1975 did Australia substitute a new form of acceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice. (2) On 22 March 2002 did Australia amend its acceptance. (3) Why were the amendments made. (4) Will he bring up to date the information he gave in answer to paragraph 4 of question No. 2744 (Hansard, 9 August 2001, page 29670). (1) Yes. (2) Yes. (3) Under the amended declaration of 22 March 2002, Australia continues to accept the jurisdiction of the Court, subject to the following exceptions: where the parties have agreed to other peaceful means of dispute resolution; where disputes involve maritime boundary delimitation or disputes concerning the exploitation of an area in dispute or adjacent to an area in dispute; and where a country has only accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the court for a particular purpose or has accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the court for a period of less than one year. The first exception is identical to that in Australia’s 1975 declaration. The second reflects the Government’s view that maritime boundaries are best settled for the long term by negotiation, not litigation. A negotiated boundary is one that by definition is acceptable to both sides, whereas litigation can lead to an outcome satisfactory to neither. The third underpins Australia’s view that actions relying on the compulsory jurisdiction of the ICJ should be undertaken on the basis of a long-term commitment to acceptance of that jurisdiction.
