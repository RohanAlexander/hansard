That is quite superannuation and it also pays women up to extraordinary especially when you realise a threshold the equivalent of their earnings that Australian women have access to, and prior to taking their paid parental leave. are accessing and excelling in, formal Because the superannuation system is education qualifications.

I think that there is a women in Australia has increased perception out in the community that significantly over the last 30 years, from just Australia does a lot better on measures like 43.4 per cent in 1978 to 58.7 per cent in equal opportunity for women than we 2009. Obviously that represents a big step actually do. Part of that is probably forward in women's financial security and attributable to our treasured view of independence as well as an increase in ourselves as the country of the fair go for women's ability to participate in our society everyone.

Looking at When I read those results I do not assume the ASX 200 as a guide, there are more than that means women are better employees per 10 male directors to every female director se.

Those figures and workforce participation could boost gross international comparisons have a useful domestic product by 13 per cent. In the purpose to the extent that they remind us that context of some of the debates we have been challenges remain and that our responses to having in this place in recent days about the those challenges must be as relevant and pressure to find people to fill jobs in Australia, that is a figure that is very the things that companies would have cause important to consider. So clearly there are to complain about in the previous system good reasons for us to support improved was that the reporting guidelines were a bit gender equality outcomes in Australian vague and woolly; companies had an workplaces. This bill seeks to do that by obligation to report but it was not entirely putting the focus of our efforts more on clear what they were reporting about or what outcomes and indicators of business progress the purpose of the reporting was other than towards equality rather than simply requiring simply meeting that legislative requirement. them to report for the sake of reporting. It The reporting requirements now go much also strives for balance between the need to more to indicators, so they are outcomesmeaningfully assess performance and focused rather than simply describing compliance by businesses and simplifying program or policies that might be in place their reporting process. I turn to some of the within the business. Businesses will now be specific points about the bill. I said at the required, over time, to report against start that one of the things it does is to indicators such as the gender breakdown of change the name of the act and also to their employees and the kind of consultation change the objects of the act. The name of that goes on within the workplace around the act and the agency will be changed to gender equality. Importantly, it is only focus more on gender equality rather than applicable to companies with over 100 exclusively the equality of women. That is in employees, so we are not requiring this recognition that gender equality has to be at obligation of smaller businesses. We are the heart of what we are trying to achieve, talking about medium to large companies whether that is gender equality of who are caught in the legislation. remuneration or, importantly, recognising Very importantly, that new reporting is the caring roles of both men and women much more straightforward. There is a set of when they seek to balance their family indicators that we require companies to responsibilities with their working life. That report against, and that will now be able to is now expressly included in the new be done online. This specifically addresses a legislation. point raised by representatives of industry, One of the things that has obviously and makes it much simpler to do. The other caught the attention of opposition members, point to make is that by reporting against and I believe forms the basis of some of their those indicators it is actually giving the amendments, goes to the reporting government and industry meaningful datarequirements. One of the important points to useful data. We are not just asking, 'Tell us make is that this legislation has been the what you do so everyone can feel good about subject of extensive consultation.

This is not something that is being With that data the government is then in a rushed through or dropped on anyone out of position to look at what is happening the blue; this is a result of consultation with industry by industry and to see where those people with the biggest stake in it. The support needs to be targeted the most to new reporting requirements on companies assist companies to meet their obligations are to be phased in over time. In fact, one of under this legislation; again, all working that confirm our position with regard to towards those objectives of greater equality gender equality and our interest in preserving in the workplace.

It is this sort of creative solution In the brief time available to me, I want to to stimulate innovation and the diversified make three points. The first is that the economy that this nation must have and rationale for this measure-the reason the which is long overdue. It will provide us House is considering it-has nothing to do with a potent sword to complement the with policy; it is pure politics. It is because shield of other measures we have introduced of a promise that a desperate Prime Minister to slay our carbon emissions dragon. It will Gillard made to the Greens. The second help us to provide the energy security, point I want to make is that, to fund this prosperity and rewarding jobs that our promise, the Gillard government is spending children have the right to expect. And it is $10 billion that it does not have. All of this is within the gift of this generation of borrowed money, and they have resorted to Australians to deliver. I commend the bill to dodgy accounting to try to hide that fact. The the House. third point I want to make is that this is going to be a dud investment for the Australian taxpayer. Any taxpayer who am pleased to rise to speak on the Clean thinks that we are likely to get back all or Energy Legislation Amendment Bill 2012, even some of the $10 billion is, I fear, going the Clean Energy Finance Corporation Bill to be facing a very disappointing outcome 2012 and the related bills.

It is curious Christine Milne in July 2011 as she that on the one hand the government thinks ecstatically claimed victory in securing this this is a good idea but on the other hand it is $10 billion commitment of borrowed desperate to find a way to disguise the true taxpayers' money to go into this illaccounting and financial impact of this conceived venture. It is noteworthy that key measure. To achieve the disguising of the policy elements of what is coming before the true financial impact of this measure, the House this evening are elements that were Treasurer and the Minister for Finance and specifically insisted upon by the Greens. Deregulation have resorted to an accounting AgainI go to the statement issued by Senator trick which they have resorted to several Milne: times already in the life of the Rudd-Gillard government. That accounting trick is to Let me turn to the third point I want to pretend that the money which is being spent make. I predict that this investment of $10 is an equity investment in a vehicle which is billion of taxpayers' money is going to turn going to generate a commercial return. That out very, very badly. I predict that taxpayers is the accounting trick which has been used are not going to see a good return on the $10 for the National Broadband Network billion which this government has presumed company, which is going to see some $20 to invest on their behalf in a range of billion, $30 billion or $40 billion-it could speculative and unproven technologiesbe $50 billion or more-of taxpayers' money technologies so speculative and unproven squandered on an ill-conceived venture. That that they are ones that the private sector has is the same accounting trick which this declined to invest in. government is now using in relation to the Let us be clear here, because there were Clean Energy Finance Corporation, which is some points made earlier by the member for again going to squander billions of dollars of Eden-Monaro which seemed designed to taxpayers' money. give a misleading impression.

The coalition has no objection to Deputy Speaker Symon-is that, by treating people putting money at risk in innovation, the money as an equity investment, it is not green energy or any other area of new included in what is called the underlying technology. We say good luck to people who cash balance. The underlying cash balance is do that, and, if you make money out of it, we the number which is colloquially referred to congratulate you. But what we also say is: as the budget bottom line. The Treasurer that is not a proper function of governments, proudly produced a budget bottom line this to put taxpayers' money at risk doing it.

That is the understatement of the century. Let us just understand that point because, That is code for saying, 'It is extremely if you look through the expert committee unlikely this organisation is ever going to report, it refers to a financial target of make a buck.' achieving a return equal to the government When officials of the Treasury department bond rate. In other words, the grand financial appeared before the House Standing scheme here is: the government can borrow Committee on Economics yesterday, I had money at the government bond rate and the opportunity to ask them if they thought therefore it can accept a commercial return this was going to turn out to be a good which is only equal to the government bond investment for taxpayers. I took that rate and no higher. Given that the opportunity to ask the question, but they government bond rate is, by definition, lower declined to answer. They said it was a policy than the cost of finance which the private decision. AndI can understand why an sector has to pay, then, if you took that logic official facing that question would duck it, to its extreme, government would carry out because anybody who has had any every activity in our economy because it has experience in this area and who has seen the a lower cost of financing.

Let us focus on his very positive and optimistic contribution what this particular official was really saying to this evening's debate. That is the kind of positivity and optimism you might expect I mentioned optimism earlier on, and it is from Thomas Hardy or from Dickensdisappointing once again to come into this something of that nature-though not really place and have the opposition merely say 'no' unexpected from those opposite. It is to a well thought-through, well crafted policy interesting to me that in summary the proposal by this government. It is not simply member for Bradfield's contribution to this a policy proposal of this government. I was evening's debate is all about the inelegance reminded of that this week when I met some and the inappropriateness of government of the young people who came in to see me intervention into a marketplace. It is curious from the 100% Renewable Campaign, which therefore that his side of politics is in fact is a community campaign working with over opposing one of the most significant market 100 local groups right around Australia, mechanisms that this country has seen, some of which are in my own electorate of through the introduction of a carbon price La Trobe. They are groups that have been mechanism. It is extraordinary that his side out polling community members right of politics is this evening so vehemently around the country; they have polled around objecting to intervention in the market 8,000 people face-to-face and around 4,000 through the Clean Energy Finance people online, they tell me, about their views Corporation by government and yet seeks to on the solar industry and for government impose a $1,300 impost on each household investment in the renewables sector as a to fund what their side of politics has called a whole. They tell me that those results show Direct Action Plan, which has been that 94 per cent of people they surveyed described as a tree in every lounge room. It support building large scale solar, for is a most extraordinary proposition to put instance, in Australia and that 95 per cent forward and then come into this place this support the government's new proposal for evening and oppose the proposition to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. It is support the development of renewables in compelling to me that there are people who this country through the establishment of an have by their own resources and by their appropriately thought-through mechanism, own means-some of them very limited developed in consultation with experts and means, I would expect-come to Canberra to as part of an overall clean energy package. It speak to members of parliament about their is extraordinary that the opposition come in vision for clean energy in this country. The here this evening, having opposed household member for Bradfield and I am sure many assistance, having opposed things like the other opposition members throughout the Carbon Farming Initiative-which indeed course of this debate and the broader debate will help some to the National Party's within our community have asked: 'Well, constituents, some of their farmers. They what we do we get back for this investment oppose that and they manage to oppose that is being made in the Clean Energy household measures and tax cuts. They have Finance Corporation, which in turn will presented us with a crude so-called Direct support renewables?' What we get back is the Action Plan to address one of the most opportunity to establish new industries, the significant problems facing not only our opportunity to establish new jobs for country but our globe. It is amateurish that Australians in a country and a globe which is they come in here and present us with these going through economic transition. We get thoroughly inadequate responses to the opportunity to support new industries for significant policy problems across the globe. Australians. It is not surprising that this is the next step in the government's clean energy its broad expectations of how that package of measures, because our corporation might invest and how it might go commitment to a clean energy future is about its work. In April this year we released absolutely apparent and has been apparent the expert review panel's report on the design for some time.

It has purport to support farmers in this country taken appropriate advice in a timely way in and who purport to support people who accordance with the range of measures could well derive an income stream by which we have implemented to respond to means of the Carbon Farming Initiative-or the clean energy needs of our country and is whether it is through the establishment of implementing this measure through this bill. renewables targets or whether it is through The Clean Energy Finance Corporation the establishment of the Clean Energy will make investments for the development Finance Corporation this evening, it is of Australian-based renewable energy simply part of the sequence of events that technologies-low emission technologies, this government is going through to build a energy efficiency projects and businesses new future for our country, one which is not that supply the required inputs. I might say reliant on old energy and which is not reliant as someone who not so long ago was in on carbon polluting technologies. commercial practice and acting in relation to This evening's bill, which contemplates clean energy opportunities that other the establishment of a Clean Energy Finance countries' businesses had taken on, it was Corporation, is important because it ensures disappointing for me to see that the same that new renewables technologies get the opportunities were not being taken up by financial support that they need to become Australian companies. It is a great source of larger operations and to ensure that we have pride to me this evening to be participating increasing numbers of employees engaged in in a debate that will try to support those new industries. We know that clean Australian-based renewables businesses. The energy technologies face a range of obstacles bill before us requires the Clean Energy in attracting financing: current global Finance Corporation to have at least half of financial conditions, the cost of renewable the corporation's investments in renewable energy, the complex nature of Australia's energy technologies by June 2018.

But why have a present. It is appropriate that we establish a Clean Energy Finance Corporation? The mechanism to counteract that. investment of $10 billion in the corporation The Clean Energy Finance Corporation will mean that we can unlock new and very will make individual decisions about substantial private investment in clean investment which are independent of energy projects and the supply chain that government.

It will mean that the is now meaningfully being taken by Clean Energy Finance Corporation can make Australia to respond to climate change-that investments and encourage private sector action is not being taken in a piecemeal way investment in clean energy technologies.

It is for this opportunities in new technologies industries, reason that we are taking steps to not only and ultimately to respond to the challenge of provide incentives for high-polluting climate change which affects Australia and business to alter its practices so that it which affects the globe.

It is is that the government does not actually disappointing in the context of so many know what to spend the money on, beyond young people in my electorate and right such broad and nebulous directions as 'the around the country who have made their corporation is a mechanism to help mobilise voices clearly known to me not simply investment in renewable energy, lowthrough this week but through the course of emissions and energy-efficiency projects and my term as an MP and far beyond that period technologies in Australia' and 'the about the kind of future they want to see, corporation will finance Australia's clean about the clean energy economy that they energy sector using financial products and want to see, about the opportunities that they structures to address the barriers that are want to see for our future.

So, for all the speeches one way or the other, the bottom line is it will pass. In my view, the budget is just one arm of the broader story of the moment and the question of the moment for all of us in public policy and throughout Australia. It is therefore a budget that I respond to in the broader context of what is going on in this parliament and throughout Australia right now. I believe Australia is at a crossroads. We as a country need to conduct a budget-like audit of ourselves and ask ourselves whether we are still the brave reforming nation of our history, or have we succumbed to the risk averse, the timid and the anonymous critics of new media? Are we still the nation that spits in the eye of those who say, 'You can't, you won't, you shouldn't'? Or are we to now believe the pathetic, cult-like culture of the new radical conservatives in Australia, who want to kill this opportunity for reform within Australia right now via a campaign of vitriol and so-called death by adjectives? We as a nation are at the crossroads. We are on the lip of the cliff of losing trust in our history, a history that has been shaped by taking chances and risks. We have a history of confidence against the odds and a history where we chose to do it our way-the Australian way and a way that so often has led the world in governance, sport, arts, science, innovation and business. Eighteen months ago as an Independent MP in his third year of representing his community, I never thought the stakes were higher than forming government for three years, while locking in some local and national reforms through agreements reached. I was wrong. The stakes are much higher. At the crossroads as a nation, we are now in a fight for",169,Notices Devastation And

178,Mr Oakeshott (Lyne) (12:01,"Whilst this is certainly a tight budget in a tightourselves-a fight for the heart of Australia; a fight for what it means to be Australian. We are in danger of introducing something new into Australian public policy: fear. We are in danger of becoming a nation where fear wins over all else. We are in danger of creating a model of government and policy development that is risk averse and where the perception of the best government is in reality a government that does nothing at all just to avoid controversy. In political terms, we are seeing more and more evidence of this. The Australian community is in grave danger of being 'astroturfed' into submission, where new organised, vested and issues-based interests control the chaos and the dissent for their own direct personal benefit and, as a consequence, governments cower from reform due to the newfound power of fear and dissent in Australia, leaving voters absolutely exhausted by the noise of the loudest and the richest. The crossroads we are at as a nation is whether we are a nation that still plays front-foot cricket and whether we are the great innovators who stare down opponents and prove them wrong time and time again, or whether we as a nation now play back-foot cricket and defend, whinge and complain. The question I have is: when and, more importantly, why did our Ian Chappell mentality turn into a Geoffrey Boycott mentality? As a personal contribution on this, I accept my failure so far in these 18 months of this parliament. I sought consensus within the parliament itself, and I have found the toxic. I sought agreement on key issues across the major parties in the national interest, and I have found manufactured division. I might be too harsh on myself, as we have achieved much in this parliament: the ETS, some tax reform, the National Disability Insurance Scheme, aged care and 55 new Regional Development offices in a network. But as I seek more from the next 18 months-not for some personal reason but clearly because there is so much more to do-I feel frustrated by the moment. I provide three examples of this right now. The first is recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in Australia's Constitution. A full round of consultation and an extensive report were done last year, for which I was one of 22 very diverse members of a panel across party lines, working through the legal and moral complexities at stake. It delivered. It delivered a comprehensive report in January. It captured the 200 consultations throughout Australia and what was being sought by many Australians. It made the obvious and convincing point that the absolute key to success for any referendum in Australia is bipartisanship; our eight-from-44 record proves that. That is an example of this much soughtafter consensus. But right now, over four months since the report was delivered, we are still stuck in the toxic muck. It is my understanding that neither Tony Abbott nor Julia Gillard has picked up the phone, walked down the corridor or leant across to the other at some joint function and said the simple words, 'Let's talk about that referendum question.' I take ownership of this failure as much as anyone, but all I can do is continue to seek more from our leadership on both sides of parliament and push and push and push where I can to seek more from both the MP for Lalor and the MP for Warringah, both of whom have extraordinary power right now and even more power together for the good of the nation. To now have good people like Tom Calma, Mark Leibler, Mick Gooda and the Liberal MP for Hasluck, Ken Wyatt, starting to say that toxic politics is now changing the strategy of policy-of when and how we promote a referendum in Australia-should cut to the absolute heart of anyone who cares about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians and anyone who cares about Australia being the island nation of brave reformers. We are stuck in the toxic muck of our own making, and we lose nation-building opportunities unless we find a way out or a way through that muck. A second example is electoral funding reform. In January the Australian Electoral Commission released donation records from 2010-11, and the figures should frighten everyone. The LNP revealed $110 million in political donations in the one year alone, and the ALP revealed $90 million in political donations in this same year. These are extraordinary figures that, if sustained, make a consensus on anything impossible and make the parliament itself a wholly owned subsidiary of major donors to the major parties. Again, because of the toxic, we look like heading into the 44th Parliament election season with no commitment from either side to electoral funding reform when it is so bleedingly obvious that the money now coming into the political parties is either unsustainable or dangerous for the nation. A consensus agreement is desperately needed by both major parties, as much in their own interests as in the interests of the nation. But the toxic moment is removing the opportunity for even a conversation, let alone a joint strategy. These are two governance examples, and this is before we get into the policy questions of where consensus right now would be in the national interest on policy. Take the Gonski review on education. What a difference a joint working group across party lines would make on that right now. Take comprehensive tax reform. What a difference a joint working group across party lines would make on that right now. Once again I plead and push. I plead with ordinary Australians, with commentators and with the major parties to put Australia's reform agenda first and push for consensus on policy first, because those that seek to divide do not act in Australia's interest. They act in their own interest, whether political or some other sectional interest. I will not today nor ever support the dividers in Australia. I will always, today and in the future, support those whose focus is policy. In rugby terms, I will support those that play the ball of policy, not the man of politics. Today, in an era when we are seeing the conservative politics behave more radically than at any time since my distant cousin Michael Oakeshott wrote his conservative thoughts, I yearn for a day when these same conservative politicians and conservative cheerleaders try and win the day on policy and policy alone. Australia does suffer while we wait. As a final point on this, I purposely single out three media leaders from the Australian newspaper, Chris Mitchell, Matthew Franklin and Dennis Shanahan-not to run some hate media argument on them and not to square up on any editorial position from them last year but because, out of a perverse mark of respect, I think these three shape the broader media position on what it is to be an opposition leader more than anyone else. I single them out as leaders who can make change for Australia. If these three continue to believe and to argue that an opposition's role is only to oppose-that their role and power as parliamentarians is to be denied right now and that there is no worth at all in the lion lying down with the lamb-then Australia suffers. I accept division makes great copy and sells newspapers, but consensus right now is what builds Australia and builds a nation. Consensus right now is what will answer the unanswered on constitutional reform, on tax reform, on productivity reform, on education reform and on electoral donation reform. If this challenge is denied, I can read the editorial now. The Australian will argue that it reflects community views only and the opposition is doing its job to oppose. If that is what it is then so be it. But, if we all want more, no three people can push for national outcomes on some key issues better than these three. Rest assured that I know the LNP, the opposition, are playing to that audience. Whilst ever they are allowed to have the position of all care and no responsibility, they will take it. I would take it. We would all take it, and reform in Australia grinds to a toxic halt. Having said that, I think there is plenty of reform that has been achieved so far and that does deserve to be talked about. It is significant that the three major rating agencies have given a AAA rating to Australia right now. It is significant that the unemployment rate is under five per cent, inflation is in hand and the cash rate is below five per cent. Whilst there will be a debate about the debt ceiling-I am a reluctant partner in that whole process-now is not the time for a US-style debt ceiling fight. I will-and I understand the coalition will as well-allow that issue to pass this parliament right now. The big issue next week in New South Wales is the Pacific Highway funding. I know, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, that from the Bruce Highway's perspective you are watching closely. New South Wales can take the opportunity of finishing the project of the Pacific Highway by 2016, as promised and agreed by state and federal governments and by all political parties. The construction works were released through questions in this parliament over the past six months. There is no construction impediment to completing the final 400 kilometres of works. It is now down to nothing other than the money. I all but pushed all political chips across the table to get $3.56 billion allocated in the federal budget. As people can see in the budget papers, it is one of the standout roads items, if not the standout roads item. We can finish the job if the state commits to do its part and enter a partnership along the lines of what John Howard argued in 2007 and what Mark Vaile argued, and through all transport ministers going back to the start of this project with Laurie Brereton and Michael Knight. Everyone has argued the case for a fifty-fifty project. It is disappointing that the company line out of New South Wales in the last 12 months seems to have changed. I hope for a celebration next week, not a further cynical argument and political fight. But that is for the New South Wales budget, which we will all watch closely. I acknowledge, as I mentioned before, the National Disability Insurance Scheme and agedcare reform. Both are significant steps forward through this budget, and I would hope that continued work sees both of those having very practical outcomes on the ground. It would be remiss not to mention the emissions trading scheme, something I took to both the 2007 and 2010 elections. We now will see that happen in Australia. It is recognising the place of both science and economics. I accept the science and the economics, and I accept my role in trying to get the policy process to deliver on both. I also would be remiss not to mention the Regional Development Australia network and the fact that we now have 55 regions identified in Australia and that all have an office working with local communities and trying to build the concept of place based and local based thinking in Australia. The budget will pass, but I do urge and encourage both Julia Gillard and Tony Abbott to lead, lead together, and lead together right now. 1) 2011-2012 and related bills-in relation to what the government is doing. Each year I rise and ask the same question, and I do so again this year: what is the biggest item of expenditure in the federal budget? Of course, once again we find in this year's budget that the biggest single item is welfare. Some people would say welfare is a legitimate activity of government,",171,Bills
179,Mr Hawke (Mitchell) (12:16,"I rise to talk about this budget-Appropriation Bill (No.but for it to be the No. 1 item of expenditure for a federal government-and this year it increased quite substantially when you look at the figures-I think is of great concern to Australia and the whole economy and how we operate our budgets. This government seems hell-bent on over-regulating and putting the government at the centre of everything in the national economy. It is correct, as the member for Lyne has identified, that Australia is at a crossroads in this regard when you consider that, in relation to small and medium enterprises, this government has brought in a whopping 20,000 new regulations for small and medium enterprises and has removed fewer than 200. There are 20,000 new regulations. When you look at this massive increase in the welfare budget and at what this government is doing to produce a smoke-and-mirrors surplus, I think you get a kind of feel for and flavour of what is really going on with this government's mismanagement of the economy. The biggest ticket item in terms of expenditure cuts is, of course, the $5 billion worth of defence cuts, translated almost exactly into $5 billion of welfare increases. I think that $5 billion of cuts to our defence forces is one of the most short-sighted policy decisions that we will make in the coming decade. I say that because defence is the first priority of a national government. It is the most legitimate activity of a federal government. It is why we have a federal government, indeed. It is partly why we federated: to form a defence force to protect our national interests. A $5 billion cut, I think, represents a grave danger to the future operational capacity of the ADF and, indeed, will undermine its ability to upgrade many of the capital and other requirements for major projects that we all know are so necessary. The government at the moment is lamenting in so many ways the loss of manufacturing workers, the loss of jobs in the economy and the loss of the capacity of Australia to manufacture its own things. There is no more legitimate activity of government in this space than manufacturing in defence industry. Defence industry in Australia is of vital concern for our nation's economic well-being. We could certainly sustain manufacturing jobs and other capacity in defence industry production, and yet we have a $5 billion cut in this regard. While we are subsidising a lazy and indolent car industry that is producing cars that consumers do not want at a price they cannot afford, and we are paying hundreds of thousands of dollars per job in that sector, we are ignoring a vital and successful component of our manufacturing that is the Australian defence industry. I am a well-known opponent of protection in industries, and I do not count defence as protection. The Prime Minister and I even had a Twitter fight about the car industry and her much vaunted policy, and I do not believe she came off best in that regard, because it is undeniable that the No. 1 reason why we need to subsidise this industry is because the top-selling car in Australia is a foreign car. Why? Because it is cheaper. People can buy a better-made car, at a cheaper price, that is smaller, more efficient and more environmentally friendly. That is the No. 1 reason that people are not choosing Australian cars. How is a subsidy going to produce a better outcome in relation to that? It flies in the face of the other policy that the government is vaunting in this budget and the economic debacle that is the so-called surplus, and that is the carbon tax. The entire economy is now built on the carbon tax coming into operation on 1 July. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, the opposition is firmly committed to the removal of this toxic tax from the Australian economy, for good reason. You do not need a $5 billion increase in welfare-which the government calls 'compensation'-if you do not have a major tax going into the economy, taxing all of the productive sectors of the economy, ripping money out and increasing prices of basic goods and services. The government often says, 'You're going to rip away money from pensioners. You're going to rip away money from families.' I do not see Australian families and Australian pensioners as welfare cases. They are capable of working for themselves, earning their own living, sustaining themselves into retirement and building their own financial footing. They do not need government. Every single family in this country does not need government to be a constant drip of money for them. They can do it themselves, and that is what the role of government is-not to get involved but to get uninvolved, to leave people alone to prosper, to build the businesses they want to build, to innovate and create wealth and jobs and look after themselves and their families. Government is there to step in when people cannot do it for themselves, when they will not do it for themselves and they are unable to or they come across other issues in life. That is the legitimate role of government. Now we have got to the point in our society today where we are, through the carbon tax, basically becoming a welfare state of epic proportions, where everybody has an entitlement to compensation for prices that are deliberately ratcheted up by this government. Why are we ratcheting up the prices of goods and services and basics like electricity? The government says that it is 'to save the climate of the planet.' TodayI noticed that Tim Flannery is on the bandwagon again. I heard the member for Lyne saying once again that he is a believer in the science. Today Tim Flannery has come forward to say that we need to remove the fillings from the teeth of dead people, if they have mercury in them, because we do not want that going back into the environment. Last week he was in Western Sydney-I know the member for Chifley will be very interested in this-and he was saying that people will die in Western Sydney because of the heatwaves that are coming through climate change. This is the kind of taxpayer-funded drivel that we are hearing every day, that is justifying an economy-wide carbon tax that will punish every business and industry and will push up the cost of goods and services. It will cause us to go further down the path of becoming a welfare state, because of people like Professor Tim Flannery who propose that we need to use a wrench to pull out teeth that have mercury in them. It is in the Daily Telegraph today. That is what he is proposing. He is paid $300,000 a year by the taxpayer. This is becoming an absolute travesty. The science is hardly what is driving this policy from this government. Concern for the climate seems to be backmost of what they are doing. This budget is of great concern in my own electorate of Mitchell, which has one of the highest proportions of families of any electorate in the country. The cost of living, of goods and services and of electricity prices in particular resonates across Western Sydney. You would not find a door to knock on in Western Sydney that would not raise electricity prices as one of their No. 1 concerns, and they are concerned about the outcome of this budget and the carbon tax. In particular, once again we see in relation to the minister for transport and the much vaunted Infrastructure Australia policy, which from this government was meant to be the saving grace of infrastructure in Australia today, another complete abandonment of the nation's biggest city, Sydney. Not only is there not a single dollar in the budget for infrastructure in Sydney; there has not been in four years. There was $100 million for a study for a metro for the last state government, which we know was probably the worse government and the most incompetent government of any single government in the nation's history. That money had to be handed back to the federal government because of the incompetence of that state government. I know the member for Chifley knows all about that, so I will not lecture him anymore on that. The failing of this government in particular is that there is no infrastructure funding for the biggest economic generator in the country. I follow the model of infrastructure provision that it should be economical where possible. Of course there are times where government has to go out and build a rail line or a road where it may not be so economical. But primarily we must be putting money into the economic and infrastructure drivers that will build and be sustainable in our major cities, in our major ports, in our major areas of economic activity. That is the best way to fund the infrastructure so that we can continue generating jobs and prosperity and keep the economy ticking over. This federal government says not a single road, not a single rail line, not a single driver of economic activity is needed in our nation's biggest city, with its biggest economic generator, with its massive population, with its ability to draw all of our migrants-most migrants still go to Sydney. It says, 'You don't have any infrastructure pressures or priorities.' I think it is an absolute failing of Infrastructure Australia and the policy of this government to have what it describes as non-political bodies deciding on infrastructure. The north-west rail line in particular has been earmarked as the No. 1 priority of the New South Wales state government, funded with an additional $2.1 billion from the federal government, earmarked in the MYEFO 2010-11 year. The federal government right before the last election came forward with a promise, written on the back of a coaster, to build a Parramatta to Epping rail line to try and win the seat of Bennelong and retain the seat of Parramatta, realising how much political trouble they were in. The Prime Minister made the announcement. We all saw in Sydney what Labor had done over 16 years playing politics with rail lines in metropolitan Sydney. It was an absolute disaster. It was an absolute disaster for the state government at the last election and it was an absolute disgrace for the Prime Minister to attempt to play politics with the rail line. This $2.1 billion in MYEFO in 2010-11 that is earmarked, allegedly, for the EppingParramatta rail line is not going to be brought on or brought forward. No plans are in train to build the Epping-Parramatta rail link. There is no construction timetable and no priority. Nothing will be done. No money will actually come forward until, as this government says, the state government contribute some money. The state government have made it clear that they will not be doing that. So that money could be earmarked to that state government right now in New South Wales to get infrastructure moving in Sydney, which is vital for the development of our city. It must be brought forward. But you will not see any action from this government. I would argue that until this government is removed there will be this continual political gain in relation to infrastructure funding in Sydney, which I think is to the detriment of every resident in Western Sydney, in my electorate of Mitchell. We have heard much about this government spreading the benefits of the boom to all sectors of the economy. I think the other great betrayal of our nation's enterprise and business community in this budget was the absolute and utter shameful backflip on cutting the corporate tax rate. We know why it did that. All these small and medium enterprises around the nation who are struggling to pay their bills at the moment were looking for the cut in the company tax rate which was promised, promised and promised. We know what the promises of this government are worth. But those businesses were expecting this company tax cut. How is it right for a government to, on the one hand, outline its national policy so that businesses can make decisions and so that small and medium businesses can say, 'Look, we are under pressure but there is some prospect of us getting some relief in the next budget so we can make decisions and struggle on with our business enterprise,' and then, on the other hand, in the budget without warning pull the company tax cuts for all those small to medium enterprises around the country? That was supposed to be spreading the benefits of the boom to every corner, as the Treasurer is fond of saying of our economy-but not the corner that is the small and medium enterprises. Not that corner. That is not where the boom will be spread to, because small and medium enterprises are one of the lowest priorities of the government. They have no regard for the family owned or small business that is struggling under the current economic conditions and they are not spreading any part of the boom to those hard working mums and dads and families who own businesses around the country. That is perhaps one of the greatest betrayals out of this budget that I think will have a very negative impact in confidence and in the ability of people to get ahead in their businesses. Another problem that we have in relation to what is coming out of this budget is the constant increases of taxation and the constant uncertainty about whether something will or will not happen. We have seen it this week in relation to the enterprise migration agreements. Who is in support of it? Will it happen? Will it not happen? Is it okay by the unions? Is it not okay by the unions? Australia is becoming a sovereign risk in so many ways because of the uncertainty coming out of this government. This budget certainly reinforces the uncertainty that is coming out. The uncertainty of this budget is: does anybody believe that we will achieve a $1.5 billion surplus next year based on, perhaps, the best increases in economic conditions in 20 years that are modelled here? Mr Husic: Read the Fin Review! name to that? MYEFO is coming up at the end of this year and then of course we will have next year's budget. And in next year's budget I do not think it is too cavalier to predict that these great conditions predicted in the budget may not come forward, and we may not share that $1.5 billion surplus. So if I have one overarching criticism it is the absolute lack of certainty that is coming out of the government. Their economic policy is just unfathomable to business and to people looking to invest in this country, and really they ought to hang their heads in shame at the way they are treating economic policy in Australia today. Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2012-2013 and cognate bills, for the 2012-2013 budget. I am very pleased to do so because the first thing that comes to mind when we are talking about the budget and the delivery of the budget is that you need to do it on the back of a very strong economy. Without a strong economy you will not be able to implement the very good things that are currently happening. We know that from when this government first came into government, back in 2007, until today 800,000 new jobs have been created, with another 300,000 on track by the end of 2013.",174,Bills
180,Mr Hawke,Does the member for Chifley really want to come forward and put his,178,Bills
181,Mr Georganas (Hindmarsh) (12:31,"I am very pleased to speak in support of theWe know that these jobs were not just created by the click of a finger or by sitting back and doing nothing; these jobs were created through good initiatives by this government and through the strong economy that we have built. We bulletproofed the Australian economy and kept it out of recession, which was very important to get us to the stage where we are today. If you look around the world you see what is happening in Europe-in Greece, in Portugal, in Italy, in Spain and in Ireland-and in other parts of the world. Look at what the US has been through since 2008-its economy is just starting to pick up now. Our economy has been going strong all through that period. It was strong because we took decisive action when the global financial crisis hit. Again, I reiterate in this place as I have done many, many times before; there was a lot of criticism about our infrastructure packages from the opposition and a lot of criticism about the BER. These were projects that kept us out of the doldrums when the rest of the world was suffering. For example, when I visit a BER project, one of the questions I always ask is: how many people did it employ? And the answer always comes back that it was anything between 50 to 200 people. When you multiply 26,000 projects, just like the BERs that I visit in my electorate, across the country and you see the number of people who were employed, you can see why we got out of that financial crisis. We did not sit back and fold our arms, as we were told to by the opposition-we actually took decisive action. That has assisted us to build this strong economy, to bulletproof the Australian economy and, as I said, to keep it out of that recession. At the same time it has spread those good benefits of the mining boom, helping families on modest incomes and small businesses. Only last week we heard the announcement of 8,000 new jobs in WA-8,000 new jobs! What a great announcement. What a great announcement to be able to say that we are creating 8,000 new jobs and, at the same time, ensuring that the mining boom is spread evenly across the country. That is great news. Most governments around the world would fall over backwards to make an announcement like that. There are obviously things that we have to do to get those 8,000 jobs up and running-for example, ensuring that we have the skills to be able to fulfil those positions. I am very pleased that there will be training positions along with new apprentices and of course positions for Indigenous and Aboriginal people in mining. That is a terrific story, and I think it is something that we should not fear or run away from. This is a very important announcement. At the same time we are delivering the new schoolkids bonus: $1.3 billion-$410 a year for primary schoolchildren and $820 a year for high school children. This is on top of delivering Australia's first national paid parental leave scheme, increasing family payments for teenagers and raising the childcare rebate to 50 per cent of out-of-pocket costs. These are good things we have done because, as I have said, we have a good economy in place to be able to bring these projects to fruition and ensure that we deliver and spread the benefits of the economy across the nation. Many good things are happening, and I support this budget because it will deliver big time for my electorate: for pensioners doing it tough; for families working long days, doing it tough and struggling to make ends meet; and for the vulnerable in our community. The measures in this budget reflect those true Labor values of our government: fairness, jobs and opportunity for all. They are the things that we see from this government. It is absolutely paramount that we deliver for those people. I will take the opportunity to highlight some of the measures in this particular budget, the 2012-13 budget, and what it means on the ground for thousands and thousands of people in my electorate of Hindmarsh. We on this side of the House understand the pressures of families who work long days, living pay to pay and spending what little they have on themselves after paying the bills for the kids' school fees, the groceries, the electricity bill, petrol, mortgages et cetera. That is why we are easing the pressure through tax cuts and increasing payments. In the electorate of Hindmarsh, thousands of people, as I said, are now benefiting from these initiatives. We also have boosted the assistance for older people to support them in their retirement or while still working. We have introduced new initiatives to help younger people support themselves while studying or learning a trade. Paid parental leave is a very positive initiative, and I am delighted that 906 local families in my electorate of Hindmarsh are benefiting from Australia's first paid parental leave scheme. Just this week I spoke in the chamber in favour of the Dad and Partner Pay scheme, which will see dads get two weeks paid leave to be with mum and the baby when it is born. I cannot tell you what a difference that would make on the ground. I spoke, as I said earlier, last week about what a difference it would have made to me when my boys were born if I could have spent those two weeks at home. I know there are many people today in the situation I was in back then. I actually had to change my shifts to be able to stay at home and assist my wife and do what I could to help in the first two to three weeks. At the time, as I have said before, I was driving taxis full time and I changed my shift from six at night to six in the morning so I could get home and give my wife some respite and look after the newborn babies when they came home. It was absolutely exhausting, and a bonus like the one that has just been announced would have been a godsend for my family back then. I know that there are thousands of people out there in exactly the same position that I was in 28 years ago for the first and 24 years ago with the second one. The baby bonus is another great initiative. In my electorate, 710 local families benefited from the baby bonus last year and many of these families received $500 more of their payment upfront to help pay for the initial costs of setting up the baby's room, buying prams, clothes and all the added expenses that come up when a newborn comes home. Family tax benefit A is another initiative of this Labor government. The families of about 2,600 Hindmarsh teenagers turning 16 over the next five years will now receive up to $4,200 extra in family payments if their child stays at school. That is under our boost for teenagers as part of family tax benefit A. Another great initiative is the advance payment of the FTB A. We have 6,351 local FTB recipients who may be eligible for an advance payment of up to $1,000 to help them meet unexpected family expenses. We all know that life is not always predictable. We know that things happen-the car might break down, you might have a medical emergency and, when you are living on a low income, it can be very hard to find extra money when you need it. So this will go a long way to easing stress on families who are already overloaded trying to balance work, family, study and sport commitments, which as the dad of two boys myself I know is not an easy job and does not slow down as they get older. We have 4,261 local families who will be receiving the childcare rebate in the electorate of Hindmarsh, and they are now benefiting from Labor increasing the childcare rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent of parents' out-of-pocket costs and the increase in the maximum payment to $7,500 per child per year. There are 4,261 local families in my electorate who now have the option of claiming their childcare rebate payment fortnightly rather than having to wait to the end of the year, so it is easier to make ends meet. Twenty-nine thousand local pensioners are now benefiting from Labor's historic pension reforms, including the biggest increase to the pension in 100 years. Single pensioners on the maximum rate are receiving an extra $154 per fortnight, and couples on the maximum rate are receiving an extra $156 a fortnight combined. I have 3,275 local families in Hindmarsh who have received an annual $600 carer's supplement boost to assist with the financial pressures associated with caring for a loved one. In addition, those who care for a child with a disability now receive an extra $1,000 per year. Also, 29,000 local age pensioners in my electorate can now keep more of their pension if still working. After changes by this Labor government, pensioners can earn up to $250 a fortnight without it being taken into account as income under the pension income test. These are all good measures. We have also realised that we need to support apprentices and the skilled labour workforce. Six hundred and sixty-three local apprentices training in skill shortage areas are being supported with $5,500 in total government support to help them complete their qualifications in my electorate. I turn next to the household assistance package. From May, more than 8,000 local families in Hindmarsh will receive extra money through family assistance payments. A typical family in my electorate will get $529 through both tax cuts and family assistance payments. With regard to family tax benefit A and B, 7,500 FTB A recipients in Hindmarsh will receive up to $110 extra a year per child and 6,000 FTB B recipients will receive up to $69 extra a year per child as of this month. More than 1,300 families will receive an extra $289 per year in increased income support, as well as assistance through increased family payments. I mentioned pensioners earlier. I have 29,000 local pensioners in my electorate who will receive an extra $338 a year for singles and $510 for couples combined in their pensions. Payments have started to go out this week. I have more than 2,200 local self-funded retirees, and they will receive an extra $338 a year for singles and $510 for couples combined from May. More than 3,700 local job seekers will receive an extra $218 a year for singles and $390 for couples combined as of this month. I have over 2,200 students in my electorate who will get an extra $177 per year. The amount they get will depend on their rate and type of payment-for example, Austudy, Abstudy or youth allowance. Many people will benefit from the tax cuts. Approximately 53,000 local taxpayers in my electorate will receive a tax cut on 1 July. Around 44,000 taxpayers will receive a tax cut of at least $300, and 4,000 local residents in Hindmarsh will pay no tax at all due to the tripling of the tax-free threshold. The average wage earner in Hindmarsh now pays approximately $1,200 less tax than in 2007-08 as a result of Labor's tax cuts for lowand middle-income families. From July, Labor will put up to $500 into the superannuation accounts of 22,000 local workers who are earning up to $37,000. These are low-paid workers and this will be a big benefit for them. As I said earlier, importantly, dads in my electorate will be able to apply for Labor's new dad and partner pay scheme, which begins on 1 January 2013. These are all very good benefits. There are also nation-building programs taking place in my electorate. We have seen a rollout of the biggest road and rail program in the nation's history, with work beginning, progressing or being completed on a long list of large and smaller scale projects. For example, in my electorate, I have been proud to secure $4.5 million funding for the new King Street bridge, which opened on time and on budget at the end of last year and has been much welcomed by local residents, businesses and tourism operators. Ms O'DWYER (Higgins) (12:46): I was very pleased to be in the chamber to listen to the contribution from the member for Hindmarsh about the cash splash of taxpayer dollars. But he failed to talk about those other aspects of the budget which should be of concern to every Australian-the question, firstly, as to how this cash splash should be paid for and, secondly, why it is that the government feel the need for modest payments to people in electorates like his. It is because people know that the cost of living is going up and up and will go up even further as a result of the government's carbon tax, to be brought in on 1 July. Never more true than they are today are the words first espoused by President Clinton two decades ago: 'It's the economy, stupid!' That is very true. It is right to consider these words when we consider the Appropriations Bill (No. 1) 2012-13 and related bills this afternoon. Let us look at the current domestic situation. The retail sector is hurting. We have a twospeed economy, which is very different in the east and in the west. Housing approvals for new constructions are down, growth is going backwards, multifactor productivity has flatlined and is now heading in the wrong direction, and business confidence is at an all-time low. Against this backdrop we consider the international situation, which should concern us greatly. Financial turmoil in Europe shows no signs of abating. The situation in Greece and in France is not just a financial crisis but has snowballed into something even more significant-a social crisis with far-reaching consequences. We see high levels of US debt and a significant crisis of confidence in the US, and we see signs that China's growth is slowing. This is all relevant for us here in Australia. The budget that was announced by Treasurer Wayne Swan the foundation stone on which its economic narrative is based, so it deserves very close and very careful consideration. We cannot simply rely on the glib mantra of the Treasurer that the fundamentals of the economy are strong. He seems to think that with this mantra he can somehow avert any further scrutiny. But today we scrutinise in the time available the budget bills that have been brought before us, and there are a number of elements that we should consider very carefully. The first of them is this size of government debt, the second is the size of government expenditure, the third is how this expenditure is to be funded and the fourth is the believability of the government's claims of a budget surplus. The budget announced by Treasurer Wayne Swan is the fifth budget he has delivered. Let us go back to the budgets since the last coalition budget. The coalition had a surplus of $20 billion, we had no net debt and we had $70 billion in net government assets. Where are we today? It was announced that we have a deficit of $44 billion. This deficit was predicted by this Treasurer just over 12 months ago to be closer $12 billion. It has gone up from $12 billion to $23 billion to $37 billion and was finally announced by the Treasurer in his budget at $44 billion. If you go back and look at the four budgets that he delivered before this one, you will see that the accumulation of deficit hit in this budget a record of $174 billion. These were the four largest budget deficits in our history. I want that to sink in for the people who are listening to this speech. There has been a combined deficit of 174 thousand million dollars in just four years. We have gone from a position of no net debt to a position where our net debt will peak at $145 billion. Judging by previous forecasts, I think we can anticipate that that figure will blow out even further. We should also consider the government's gross debt ceiling. The gross debt ceiling started at around $75 billion. The government had to increase it to $200 billion, then to $250 billion, and in this latest budget the government has sought to increase the gross debt ceiling to a record $300 billion. All Australians are rightly concerned by this. Why has the government needed to increase the net debt and the gross debt ceiling? It has needed to do so because it has increased the amount it is spending. The government has claimed that it is reducing expenditure, yet we see from this budget an increase in aggregate expenditure of more than $100 billion since the last coalition budget. That is a 40 per cent increase. How does the government propose to pay for all this? Through their 26 new or increased taxes. It will be paid for not only by this generation but also by future generations of Australian taxpayers. On what will all this money be spent? There was, of course, $2.4 billion spent on a pink batts scheme. That $2.4 billion, if you consider the opportunity costs of the same amount of money, could have been spent on 12 much-needed grade separations on train lines throughout Victoria. The interest payments that will be made in 2015-16 of $8 billion would equate to about 32 railway crossings. Why are railway crossings significant? In my state of Victoria there are still over 172 level crossings; Sydney has just eight. Quite a number of these crossings are located on the Dandenong railway line, which currently serves over a million people and is considered a key area for future population growth. The railway line is a major east-west artery for both people and freight stretching through my electorate and Melbourne's south-eastern suburbs and its industrial parks to the significant commercial hub of Dandenong and the growing residential developments and proposed deepwater port of Hastings. The Victorian government made a submission to Infrastructure Australia. It asked for increased funding to get rid of these railway crossings, noting that the railway corridor contributed $92 billion to GDP in 2007-08, which accounted for roughly half of Melbourne's GDP or nine per cent nationally. The railway line is already operating at or above capacity, resulting in very significant closures of the level crossings. Within my electorate of Higgins there are three crossings in close proximity to each other: Koornang Road, Carnegie; Murrumbeena Road, Murrumbeena; and Poath Road, Murrumbeena. Their frequent and lengthy closures are severely impacting on pedestrians, car traffic and road freight and having negative consequences for local business, schools, shops and community life. But these are not the only railway crossings in my electorate. Another significant railway crossing that causes concerns for so many of my constituents is the Burke Road crossing, another very significant problem. The economic benefits of removing these traffic impediments are self-evident. That is why I am helping to promote the RACV's Redspot campaign. Critical infrastructure spending is essential to the nation's productivity growth. This is where the government should be focusing its attention, yet in this budget we see no money for Victoria for these railway crossings. Not one cent was provided of the $16 million which the Victorian government requested in its submission for railway crossing removals in Victoria. Yet in the budget we see that the government found $36 million in extra funding for carbon tax as. This brings to a total $69.5 million that the government is spending on spinning to the Australian people the benefits of the increased cost of living that will be applied to each and every Australian as a result of their carbon tax from 1 July this year. The government has its priorities all wrong. We also see from this budget that there has been no security of funding for the school sector. The Gonski review recommended that the government spend an extra $5.5 billion on school funding initiatives in order to revamp the way that school funding is delivered. This was being considered by the government. We see the results of that consideration in this budget. The more than $5 billion in additional funding for schools recommended in the review is not in the budget; there is not even $1 billion for it in the budget. In fact, over two years this government has apportioned an extra $5.8 million to schools funding. There is no security of funding, particularly for those schools in my electorate of Higgins which are concerned about the impact if the government does not continue with the indexation of funding for independent schools. In Higgins, $29 million will be lost to schools, and I have 39 schools in my electorate, all of which will be impacted by the loss of security of school funding if the government does not heed their call-and, of course, it has not. In this budget these schools have been completely ignored. We can only assume from that that the government has a different plan for school funding; a different plan for the quadrennium of school funding that it will apply beyond the next election. It will involve a hit list on independent schools which, as we know, they have proposed in the past. As an opposition we will strongly oppose this. In this budget the government has made good on its threats to cut the private health insurance rebate. Again this will increase the cost of living to so many Australian families and so many people in my electorate of Higgins. Seventy-seven per cent of people in my electorate of Higgins have private health insurance funding. This is one of the significant costs in their budget, and the government will be increasing the cost just as it has increased the cost of so many other things-including things as essential as child care. Thanks to the government's changes in regulation, childcare costs-instead of going up by 57c a week as the minister has claimed-have gone up by between $50 and $70 a week. Again, I can only reiterate the point that, on 1 July, with the carbon tax being brought into effect, this will hit not only every Australian but also every Australian business. According to the government's own modelling alone, there will be a 10 per cent increase in electricity costs, which will flow throughout the economy. Of course, the people of Higgins expect more, and the people of Higgins deserve more. Australians deserve hope, reward and opportunity-which is the coalition's plan. We will not simply talk about delivering a surplus; we have in the past delivered surpluses. This is something that we will do; it is not something we will just talk of doing. The government's claim to deliver a $1.5 billion surplus simply does not add up, particularly when you consider that they have been pulling funding into this year and spending into this year and pushing it out into other years to try to create fictional surplus for 2012-13. The Australian people will not be spun on this. The Australian people have clearly made a decision on this Prime Minister, on her broken promises and on her budget that was delivered only a number of weeks ago-a budget that has sunk without a trace, and for good reason. It is a budget that the Labor Party do not wish to talk about because it is a budget that highlights their failure in government. We can do better. We will do better. That is why we look forward to the opportunity of governing. We hope that the leadership issues of the government will be resolved and we look forward to the government calling an election at the earliest opportunity. Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs) (13:02): The 2012-13 budget is a budget which has delivered a surplus on time, as promised. It is a budget which sets up our country for the future, building a stronger economy and at the same time creating a much fairer community. It is a budget which will spread the wonderful benefits that this country is getting through the mining boom to all Australians-noting that we do have a patchwork economy, where many, particularly in the south-east corner of our country, are not enjoying the benefits of the mining boom to the extent that others are. So this is a budget that will deliver for them. It is a budget that protects lowand middle-income Australians. It does this by providing more money to families and small businesses and supporting the most vulnerable members of our community, through tax cuts, so that all taxpayers earning up to $80,000 will get a tax cut, including the tripling of the tax-free threshold and increases in the pension for more than 3.4 million pensioners. It is a budget which provides for an increase to family payments. It is a budget which provides the Schoolkids Bonus, which helps families with the costs of their children's education. It is a budget which will help support people who are living on allowances and it will also help people through the parenting payment. It is a budget which will introduce for the first time the historic National Disability Insurance Scheme, which, in the fullness of time, will represent just about the biggest advance in social policy in this country since Medicare. It is a budget which will see a blitz on public dental waiting lists. I want to talk a little bit about how that broad picture of the budget will apply specifically in my electorate of Corio. In my electorate, 8,550 local families who have school kids will receive $410 in the case of primary school children and $820 in the case of high school children. That adds up to nearly $9 million worth of assistance for families in the electorate of Corio. More than 11,000 local families will receive an increase of up to $600 through family tax benefit A, from 1 July 2013. Through the minerals resource rent tax we are seeing an increase in superannuation for 42,500 local workers in the Corio electorate. They will see their superannuation increase from nine per cent to 12 per cent. That is going to add almost $108,000 to the projected retirement income of an average 30-year-old worker. From July, Labor will put up to $500 into the superannuation accounts of 23,500 local workers earning up to $37,000. For 14,600 small businesses in Corio, Labor is giving an instant tax write-off for each purchase of an asset below $6,500-which, again, is one of the many benefits that flow from the minerals resource rent tax. In addition to that, the first $5,000 spent on a new motor vehicle will also be able to be written off. In addition to those measures, there is also being rolled out as we speak the household assistance package, which will support families with any modest increases in prices which occur as a result of putting a price on carbon. More than 11,300 families in the Corio electorate will receive additional money as a result of the assistance payments. A typical family in my electorate will get $529 through both tax cuts and family assistance payments. In excess of 10,800 family tax benefit recipients in the electorate will receive up to $110 extra a year per child, and 9,200 family tax benefit B recipients will receive up to $69 a year per child.",178,Bills
182,Mr Marles (Corio,"Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs andMore than 26,700 local pensioners will receive-with the rollout beginning yesterday-an increase in their pension. There will be a lump sum of $250 for singles and $380 for couples. From March next year, pensioners will receive another increase in their fortnightly payments which will see in total an increase of $338 a year for singles and $510 for couples. More than 1,000 local self-funded retirees will receive an extra $338 a year for singles and $510 for couples. More than 5,000 local job seekers will receive an extra $218 a year for singles and $390 for couples. More than 2,500 students in Corio will get up to $177 extra per year. That amount will depend on the rate and type of payment they get at the moment in terms of supporting their studies, be it Austudy, Abstudy or Youth Allowance. About 46,000 local taxpayers will receive as a result of the household assistance package a tax cut from 1 July. Around 38,000 taxpayers will receive a tax cut of at least $300, and 4,000 local residents will pay no tax at all due to the tripling of the tax-free threshold. All of that represents a concerted effort on the part of this government to tackle two of the great economic challenges facing our nation. The first is to make sure that the enormous benefits which flow to us through the resources boom are there for all Australians, because the essential product of that resources boom-the resources which lie underneath our ground-is owned by all Australians. The second great challenge is placing a price on carbon so that we can develop an industrial base going forward which is much less dependent upon carbon, in a future world where dependency upon carbon is going to be penalised, and doing that in a way which does not have an impact on lowand middle-income households. They will get through this a package of assistance that will cover, and in some cases more than cover, any increase in costs associated with putting a price on carbon. This budget and the work that has been done on that comes on the back of a very significant record of achievement on the part of Labor in power since 2007 in relation to the Corio electorate. We have seen an unprecedented level of federal government support and engagement in the electorate of Corio. I want to take a moment to describe some of those. It is a very impressive record of achievement, which is unprecedented in terms of the way federal governments have impacted upon the Corio electorate in the past. As a result of the Labor government we will see the $3.2 billion regional rail link, which separates regional and metropolitan trains as they enter Melbourne. The City of Geelong has a vital connection with Melbourne, with a growing number of those living in Geelong working in Melbourne. This will see an infinitely more reliable and faster rail service to Melbourne, a service that does not see trains from Geelong and Ballarat caught up in the metropolitan, transit traffic jam that occurs every morning. This is a significant piece of infrastructure that will change the daily lives of working people in Geelong. There has been $50 million spent on the rail upgrades at Geelong Port, which will make it an easier port to access from both directions and will put a focus on the significance of the port for Geelong's economic future-and that equals jobs. Deakin University's Australian Future Fibres Research and Innovation Centre has had $37 million dollars spent on it. This is a collaboration between Deakin University, CSIRO and the Victorian Centre for Advanced Materials Manufacturing. We often talk of the old economy and the new economy, and the high-tech manufacturing jobs of the future-making carbon fibre and working with carbon fibre is the high-tech manufacturing of the future. This research centre will have a world's best research furnace for carbon fibre production, which will set up Geelong and our region to be the centre of carbon fibre research, manufacturing and production. This is an investment in future manufacturing jobs. We have seen $26 million spent on an integrated cancer care service at Barwon Health. This acknowledges the extent to which Geelong is, in a sense, a regional capital of Victoria's south-west and a really important centre for making sure that health outcomes of those living in regional Australia are the same as those living in our capital cities. We have seen the construction of a fantastic new Australian Taxation Office building in Little Ryrie Street, which is now also the centre for the Department of Human Services in Geelong. This brings together, in one building, all the federal services that the people of Geelong rely on-in a state-of-the-art green building-and employs hundreds of local people. We have a trade training centre, which I had the pleasure of visiting on its second day of operation, at Northern Bay College. It is a fantastic facility. It provides vocational training in the north of Geelong, where it is so badly needed. Another $4.2 million has been committed to the trade training centres at St Joseph's, Sacred Heart, Clonard and McKillop colleges, the next cluster to receive that benefit. We have seen $62 million provided in assistance to support manufacturing industries across 20 programs. Importantly, we have seen $10 million provided to Simonds Stadium, the home of the Geelong Football Club. It is part of a $46 million build on what is the southern-most stand of that stadium, setting the stadium up to be the most important piece of regional sporting infrastructure in the country. We have seen $10 million spent on the Geelong Library and the Heritage Centre, which is a really important spend. It develops the Geelong Library and protects our city's most important and valuable records. Both were funded out of the first round of funding from the Regional Development Australia Fund. Millions of dollars have been spent on road improvements. This includes an announcement made a couple of weeks ago of $390,000 to fix four black spots in our city. Expenditure of $2.8 million has been made on five stormwater harvesting projects so that we can be much smarter in the way we use our water. A legacy of the drought is that we are now using our water in a much cleverer way. This will set us up for the next time we go through a dry patch. There has been $3.1 million spent on the renovation of the iconic Eastern Beach complex in Geelong, which is really one of the most important historical venues that we have in Geelong. It is a place which, to this day, is a gathering spot, particularly in the summer, for so many of our citizens to enjoy Corio Bay. A smaller amount of money but just as important, $391,000, has been spent on the Kardinia Park netball complex upgrade. Looking forward, there will potentially be an upgrade of the Point Wilson Waterside Infrastructure Project. Point Wilson pier is the only major ordnance pier that we have in Australia. Remediating Point Wilson is a high priority of this government. The wharf there is the sole Defence facility in the country which is capable of receiving strategic imports of explosive ordnance. This project is a long-term strategic investment that will extend the life of the wharf through to 2055. Our government has faced the global financial crisis and steered our country through it such that we have the best economy in the developed world. Our government has faced the patchwork economy, an enormous challenge, and is spreading the benefits of the mining boom to all parts of Australia. We have a plan to do both. We have done that in the face of relentless negativity on the part of the opposition, which does nothing other than appeal to the darker angels of our nature and deny any innate optimism that exists amongst Australians to see a bright future ahead. This is not what Australians will respond to. What the Labor government is providing is a sense of hope and a sense of strategy about taking our country forward. 2012-2013 representing the people of Macarthur on what can only be described as a bad budget. The people of Macarthur are honest, hard working people who want nothing but the best for their children and future generations of our community. They have high hopes for a strong economy which will provide more jobs and opportunities for all Australians. While they are working hard to pay off their mortgages and balance the family budget, they are becoming fed up with a government that continues with its wasteful spending and incompetence. While the people of Macarthur are trying to decrease their debt and reduce their credit limits, this government has increased the nation's credit card by $50 billion-from $250 billion to $300 billion. It has been only five short years since Labor came to office in 2007 inheriting a debt of zero. It is no wonder the people of Macarthur are fed up with a government which has continued to borrow more than $100 million a day. In 18 months, the government's estimated deficit for 2011-12 has blown out from $12 billion to $44 billionand the year is not even over yet. This is the fourth Labor deficit in four years. Together, Labor's deficits total $174 billion. Interest payments on Labor's debt are set to reach an alarming $8 billion per year-that is $22 million a day on interest payments alone. Who do they think is going to pay off this debt? The debt will be there for our children and future generations of Australians to pay off. It is just not good enough. The people of Macarthur can see through the spin surrounding this budget-a budget which includes the world's biggest carbon tax, cynical bribes to soften the impact of a tax, broken promises on corporate tax cuts, higher unemployment, blow-outs in the cost of border protection, an underfunded NDIS, and equity funding for the NBN which has been kept off budget. In headline cash terms, the Gillard government will spend $8.7 billion more than it earns in 2012-13. The government continues to spend on projects such as the NBN, which has been taken off budget. If this government was honest and included the NBN expenditure, the budget would show deficits over the next three years. To put it simply, there would be no surplus if the NBN was on the books. In fact, by bringing forward just two programs-the back-to-school payment and the Commonwealth grants to local government-the government artificially saves more than $1.5 billion in 2012-13. Honest budget treatment of these two programs alone would wipe out the Treasurer's wafer-thin surplus. When will this government learn that cooking the books is no substitute for good, solid economic management? Let us face it, the Treasurer lives in 'Wayne's world'. His forecast of a $1.5 billion surplus is a mirage. The harder you look at it, the more you realise it just does not exist. Even if the Treasurer does deliver on his razor-thin surplus, Australia will need more than 93 years of the Treasurer's surpluses to repay all the waste and mismanagement created by this Treasurer. It is the families in my electorate who",185,Bills
183,Mr Matheson (Macarthur) (13:17,"I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1)are feeling the pinch from this government's waste and mismanagement. The rising cost of living is a major factor affecting families, pensioners, self-funded retirees, small businesses and homeowners in Macarthur. Many have contacted my office concerned about the impacts of the carbon tax on electricity and grocery bills. Things will only get worse with the world's biggest carbon tax set to hit families, jobs and investment very soon. The budget papers confirm that, despite falling international prices, the carbon tax will go up to $29 a tonne in just three years, and an additional $36 million will be spent on taxpayer funded carbon tax advertising over the next two years. This tax will affect the entire economy. The price of everything will go up and up. Families will be hit hard. Small businesses, which are the engine room of our economy, will receive no compensation for the carbon tax. The people of Macarthur are against this tax. They are unsure and anxious about its effect on their weekly bills, and they are angry after being misled by the Prime Minister, who said days before the last election that there would be no carbon tax under a government she led. The Treasurer did not mention the carbon tax once in his budget speech or indeed in the budget papers. He makes a glib passing reference to a carbon price but tells people not to worry about it, that it is no big deal-a tax with the single greatest impost on the family budget of every household in Macarthur. Even the Prime Minister's initial compensation package did not make a dent in the angst felt by the community. Families in Macarthur are already paying for the highest electricity prices in the world. Now that we are heading into winter, this government will be forcing older residents on fixed incomes to spend their evenings in the dark and cold because they will not be able to afford to use their heaters or to turn on the lights. What would the Treasurer say to 60-year-old Mrs Schuit, who contacted my office last week? Mrs Schuit survives week to week by eating once a day, cooking once a week and showering every second day to keep her electricity and water bills down. Come1 July, Mrs Schuit will be hit by the carbon tax, stretching what little finances she has even further. I would like to know: when did electricity become a luxury in this country, and when did having hot water suddenly become aspirational? People on fixed incomes, such as pensioners like Mrs Schuit, self-funded retirees, single mothers and people with a disability will be the hardest hit of all by the carbon tax. The base carbon price will continue to rise, but their compensation will not. Now the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have resorted to desperately buying back votes from mums and dads with their schoolkids bonus sugar hit, a vain attempt to hide the true effects of the carbon tax. The Treasurer has pushed this payment into the 2011-12 financial year to protect his wafer-thin surplus. This is treating Australian families with contemptthrowing cash to them with one hand and taking away even more with the other. All seniors, students, couples and pensioners will miss out on this new cash splash, and families are not the only ones who will do it tough as a result of this budget. This budget offers nothing more to 800 small businesses in Macarthur who will also be hit with the world's biggest carbon tax. The government has offered nothing new in this budget to provide immediate relief to struggling businesses. The sector is seeing a 48 per cent increase in insolvencies. I have met with many small-business owners in Macarthur recently who are fed up with all the broken promises, because every one of the government's broken promises will affect their livelihoods. First there was the broken promise not to introduce a carbon tax, and now there is a broken promise to cut the company tax rate. Carbon tax related sweeteners in the form of accelerated depreciation allowances are not fooling anyone. These allowances are going to rely on small businesses having ready cash to spend on new capital items. The government's abolition of the entrepreneurs tax offset has increased tax for nearly 370,000 of our smallest businesses, including micro, home based, independent contractor and start-up businesses with incomes of less than $70,000 or $80,000 year. The local corner shop in Macarthur is not only going to have to deal with an increase in the cost of supplies and electricity but also going to have pressure from consumers looking for a bargain as the cost of living increases and unemployment rises, as forecast at in the budget. Last year's budget promised 500,000 new jobs over two years, but the government now expects to miss its target by 300,000 jobs. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate is forecast to increase to 5.5 per cent while the government is cutting $200 million of job services programs. Even the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said: The decision to abandon the company tax cut is dripping with politics and a low blow to the business sector … The chamber also said that this budget lacks vision for the broader economy. I hold grave concerns for the future of small business in Macarthur. These local mums and dads will be hit the hardest because their costs will go up and up when the carbon price goes up and up. They will not receive a single cent in compensation. The coalition has a clear roadmap to restore hope, reward and opportunity for small business by scrapping the carbon tax and getting out of the way of business by slashing $1 billion worth of red tape. We believe in a hand up, not a hand out and in rewarding those who work hard to earn a living and support their families. While the much needed infrastructure projects in Macarthur do not rate a mention in this budget, the Treasurer does manage to promise preliminary economic, social and environmental studies into the sustainability of Wilton as a site for a second Sydney airport. The prospect of a second Sydney airport has been brewing in the background of Australian politics for well over 30 years, and the people of Badgerys Creek and Wilton have fought against it time and time again, and for good reason. The member for Throsby has been quoted in the Illawarra Mercury as saying: While… there are environmental challengesand that is a huge understatementwith the Wilton site, I can also see enormous economic benefits for our region. It sounds like code for 'I support an airport at Wilton' to me. I dare say that any economic benefits would be entirely negated by the massive cost for both the federal and New South Wales governments if Sydney's water supply were contaminated. The 1985 Kinhill Stearns report clearly ruled out Wilton as a possible site for an airport because of the highly sensitive nature of the water catchment area. The development of an airport at Wilton would pose an extremely serious threat to the long-term quality and integrity of Sydney's drinking water supply. As the New South Wales state member for Wollondilly, Jai Rowell, said, what is spilt on the ground in Wilton ends up in our water supplies. The March 2012 Joint study on aviation capacity for the Sydney region identified that: … the Wilton site … appears to have a partial overlap with a designated Mine Subsidence District and all these sites are underlain by coal measures which are actively being mined … So questions need to be asked: why would the infrastructure minister decide to place an airport on land affected by mine subsidence, and where will Sydney get its drinking water if Warragamba Dam, Nepean Dam, Avon Dam and Cordeaux Dam are compromised? The people of Macarthur have also been short-changed when it comes to the promised National Disability Insurance Scheme. While I understand that progress has been made with the NDIS, the government has allocated only $1 billion over four years when the Productivity Commission has said that in that time frame $3.9 billion is needed. That is $2.9 billion less than what is needed for the start-up years of the NDIS. I find it concerning and disappointing, and I think a lot of people living with a disability in Macarthur and their families will be feeling short-changed. The Productivity Commission also proposed that the NDIS would cover 400,000 Australians. The government's budget announced that it would only extend to 20,000 Australians. Based on the budget figures, full implementation of the scheme by the Productivity Commission's target date of 2018 will not happen. This budget has let down the residents of Macarthur who are living with a disability, and their families and carers. The government will be spending more each financial year-$8 billion-on debt and interest costs than it will spend in total over the next four years on the NDIS. The government has already rejected the coalition's offer to develop a joint parliamentary committee chaired by both the coalition and Labor Party spokespeople on disabilities. This would ensure that the NDIS is kept above politics so it can survive through the three election cycles it will take to be fully implemented. I would also like to talk about the seniors in my electorate, who are forgotten in this budget. In this budget self-funded retirees will not receive a single cent of compensation to assist with the imposed damage of the carbon tax. In fact, this budget makes life much more difficult for self-funded retirees by reducing the higher tax concessions for super contributions of higher income earners. It also defers a higher concessional contributions cap for over-50s with less than $500,000 in superannuation. This government has also made it difficult for self-funded retirees to meet their medical costs by introducing means testing of the medical expenses tax offset. The incentive for mature age workers to remain in the workforce has also been removed by phasing out the $500 mature age worker tax offset. Of the $66.9 million allocated to the new Economic Potential of Senior Australians program, only $10 million is set aside to assist mature age workers to gain employment in the workforce. This program pays $1,000 to an employer who takes on a mature age worker for three months, compared to the coalition's policy, which would pay $3,250 to an employer who takes on a mature age worker from the welfare system and employs them for a minimum of six months. The remaining $56.9 million has been allocated to talking about the problem of discrimination, not fixing it, with things like an advisory panel to discuss legislation for positive ageing. This is just another example of this government's waste and mismanagement, but the waste is nothing new to this government. A local newspaper in my electorate has labelled the National Broadband Network a 'flop' for the people of Macarthur. The NBN, which the Treasurer has left off the books this year, has become the laughing-stock of the developed world. People will be paying three times as much for their internet to use speeds that a majority of the population are not going to need, and no thought has been given to prioritising areas that either do not have broadband or have inadequate services. On top of this, the government will spend $20 million on a propaganda campaign about the NBN to paint over the waste and mismanagement of the $50 billion project-that is, if it does cost $50 billion to complete. Some are estimating that it could cost between $60 billion and $80 billion. To make matters worse, this week the Australian newspaper reported that foreign controlled companies have been awarded 82c in every dollar's worth of contracts struck for Labor's National Broadband Network, sparking warnings that local industry is being bypassed in Australia's biggest infrastructure project. Shame. The coalition will continue to hold the government to account on the NBN. We will also continue to develop our alternative broadband policy, which will improve the quality and availability of broadband for all Australians. The coalition also has great plans for Australian school students and will revive foreign languages in schools to help unlock the potential offered by the Asian century. Within a decade, we want to see 40 per cent of all year 12 students in Macarthur and across Australia studying a foreign language. The proportion of year 12 students studying a foreign language has dropped from about 40 per cent in the 1960s to around 12 per cent today. Knowing the language of our major trading partners-China, Japan, Korea and India-is essential to unlocking the potential of the Asian century for Australia. We believe that, starting in preschool, every student should have an exposure to foreign languages. This is part of the coalition's positive plan for our economy, and I am looking forward to working with students and schools in Macarthur to ensure that this plan to revitalise foreign languages in schools becomes a reality. I am proud to be part of a coalition that has an alternative to this Labor incompetency. We will restore hope, reward and opportunity for all Australians, we will restore good economic management and we will end the waste. We will repeal the carbon tax and stop Labor's attack on the family budget. Only in a growing economy is it possible to have lower taxes, better services and a stronger budget bottom line, as Australians discovered during the Howard era. Under a coalition government, there will be tax cuts without a carbon tax but we will find the savings to pay for them. From an economic perspective, the worse aspect of this budget is that there is no plan for economic growth, and nothing whatsoever to promote investment or employment. The coalition will ensure Australia has a vigorous five-pillar economy, strong manufacturing, vibrant agriculture, growing knowledge based industries and resilient service sectors as well as a mining industry. We will restore Australia to its rightful place in the world. I join my colleagues here today who are disappointed in this government and its budget. Like the people of Macarthur, I am frustrated because I know there is a better way. I have seen it before-a strong economy which supports all Australians. But to achieve this we need an election so that a coalition government can put policy in place that will see our country and its peoples prosper. The coalition will reward innovation, not punish those Australians who contribute so greatly to our nation. We will restore opportunity for all Australians, young and old, and we will restore hope in our nation's future. The people of Macarthur have a bright future ahead of them under a coalition government. That is something I am very sure of. (Time expired) 2012-2013 and related bills, I would like to focus on the critical failure of governance associated with the influence of the union movement and union officials on Australia's $1.35 trillion superannuation sector. I want to make three points. Firstly, we have seen a governance",188,Bills
184,Mr Fletcher (Bradfield) (13:32,"In speaking today on the Appropriation Bill (No.1)scandal at the Health Services Union, and that has clearly spilled over into governance in the superannuation sector. Secondly, the problem is broader than just the Health Services Union. Thirdly, I want to note that the recent Cooper review into superannuation recommended substantial reforms to superannuation governance but the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation, Bill Shorten, has done nothing about it. Let me turn, firstly, to the governance scandal at the Health Services Union. The former national secretary of that union is the subject of an 1,100-page report by Fair Work Australia detailing multiple breaches of the union rules. Another senior Health Services union official, Michael Williamson, has been the subject of serious corruption allegations. The partner of the current Health Services Union National Secretary, Kathy Jackson, has written to police complaining about what is happening at the Health Services Union. The most obvious victims of the mismanagement and poor governance at the Health Services Union are the unfortunate members of that union. Another group of Australians should be very concerned: those whose retirement savings are in the hands of Health Services Union officials appointed as directors of superannuation funds. Thanks to deeply flawed governance arrangements put in place by the Keating government, union officials have a privileged place in running superannuation funds. Health Services Union boss, Michael Williamson, was until recently a director of First State Super, a fund with $30 billion under management for some 70,000 current and former New South Wales public servants. He was appointed to that position by Unions New South Wales. Last month, the Chairman of First State Super complained that he had no power to remove Williamson as a trustee. Three other current Health Services Union officials are directors of superannuation funds. Peter Mylan, who is the assistant secretary of the New South Wales Health Services Union and a man recently described in the Australian as 'a long time Williamson loyalist', is also on the board of First State Super, appointed by Unions NSW. the health industry, has two Health Services Union officials appointed by that union to the board of HESTA: Rosemary Kelly and Lloyd Williams. Then we could look at former directors of superannuation funds appointed by the Health Services Union. Until recently there was another superannuation fund called Health Super and, before it recently merged into First State Super, Health Services Union official David Langmead served on its board. Until last year, Kathy Jackson, National Secretary of the Health Services Union, was a director of HESTA, and Craig Thomson, the former National Secretary of the Health Services Union and the current member for Dobell, is also a former director of HESTA. Let us just remind ourselves of what the current member for Dobell had to say about Kathy Jackson's appointment as a director of HESTA. He said: She sat on the board of HESTA, collecting board fees for many years, rarely attending meetings. But when the union decided the board fee should go to the union, she left the board. I do not know whether or not that allegation is correct. But I do think it is instructive as an insight into the mindset of one former union official, the current member for Dobell, about the status of board appointments to superannuation funds. It is deeply troubling that so many officials of a union whose affairs have become a byword for corruption, mismanagement and failure of governance are able to be appointed by that union to roles as directors of superannuation funds where they have the responsibility to oversee the retirement savings of tens of thousands of Australians, many of whom are not members of the Health Services Union or any other union. The Health Services Union scandal shows what happens when union officials are more interested in looking after themselves than in serving their members. I want to come to the second proposition put before the House this afternoon: that this is a broader problem, which extends beyond the Health Services Union. There are dozens of superannuation funds that have up to half of their directors directly appointed by a union and hence there is the real risk that, if a union is infected by a 'look after your mates' culture, this in turn can infect governance in the superannuation sector. One troubling indicator is the number of superannuation funds that do not disclose the fees they pay to their directors. Of the 16 funds which brand themselves as 'industry super', fewer than half of them disclose the fees paid to individual directors in their most recent annual reports. Another indicator that something is wrong here is the number of current or former union officials doing very nicely from serving on the boards of multiple superannuation funds. Michael Williamson of the Health Services Union, whom I mentioned before, was recently reported in the Sydney Morning Herald to earn a $330,000 a year salary, in addition to $150,000 from his various board positions, such as First State Super. Mr Williamson is not the only follower of this particular career strategy. Consider, for example, Mr Bob Henricks, a former Queensland secretary of the Electrical Trades Union and CEO of Energy Super, a Queensland based fund with net assets of $3.8 billion. He was also Chairman of SPEC Super, until it recently merged into Energy Super, and he is also Chairperson of AUST(Q) Super. None of these funds in their annual reports disclose the fees paid to Mr Henricks as a director but, when you add up those fees across multiple funds, they are likely to be significant. Another interesting case study is that of Mr Bernie Riordan, until recently the head of the Electrical Trades Union in New South Wales. Last year the Sunday Telegraph reported that he earns nearly $400,000 a year from a combination of his union job and directorships of three superannuation funds and businesses: Energy Industries Superannuation Scheme, FuturePlus Financial Services, and Chifley Financial Services, and one other company. Let us look at another fund where there has been a profound governance problem. Vision Super in Victoria, formerly known as Local Government Super, was supposed to be merging with Equip Super, the fund which covers employees in the Victorian electricity and power sector. It has recently been announced that the merger is off. The difficulty seems to have been that it ran smack bang into the politics of the Australian Services Union, which dominates Vision Super. Equipsuper has elected member representatives, which is a good thing, but Vision Super has its four so-called member representatives directly appointed by the Australian Services Union. The merged entity was supposed to have elected member representatives, but it seems that ASU officials were very unhappy when a member of the Equipsuper fund-somebody who happened to be a senior manager at a power company, somebody who had formerly been an employer-appointed director of Equipsuper-chose to seek election as a board member of the merged super fund. A letter was circulated to ASU members by ASU state secretary Brian Parkinson. Let me read from some of what he had to say. He said: Voting has now commenced for the election of two member elected directors to serve on the Equipsuper board. As expected, employers are seeking election to workers' positions. Indeed, one such individual, John Azaris (General Manager-Operations and Services at SP Ausnet), has exploited his senior management role to frustrate the election chances of ASU candidates. To illustrate this point, I wish to bring this one incident to your attention. SP Ausnet management allowed Azaris, a current employer director at Equipsuper, to use it's email system to promote his candidacy as a member director. When an endorsed ASU candidate employed there (with almost 40 years of service to the company) sought to use the same service, he was refused on the most flimsy of pretexts. Management will pull out all the stops to see one of their own elected at the expense of workers. These are the sort of unfair tricks we can expect from management. It is a disgrace. Workers such as yourself need to send a clear message to management to keep their hands off Equipsuper. It seems that Mr Parkinson, who, as well as being ASU state secretary is also a director of Vision Super, was unhappy that the Australian Services Union was not going to have a guaranteed number of union appointed directors to the board of the merged entity. But his letter reveals that he has fundamentally misconceived his duties as a director of Vision Super. The selection of directors of a superannuation fund, to take on the vital task of stewarding the collective retirement wealth of members of the fund, has nothing to do with outdated classwar rhetoric about workers and bosses. We could look at reported difficulties in the Meat Industry Employees Superannuation Fund. According to a recent report in the Australian this union invested some $30 million in a property company called Austcorp, before the company collapsed in May 2009 with almost all of the $30 million being lost. According to the Australian, Austcorp paid tens of thousands of dollars to a Mr Wally Curran, described as 'a legendary unionist, former long-time secretary of the Meatworkers Union and a long-serving trustee director of the Meat Industry Employees Superannuation Fund.' If you look at the most recent annual report of that fund, you will see that he was listed as a director. According to the article, Mr Curran is 80 years old and a former communist. It is an obvious question: is Mr Curran a suitable person to be managing a superannuation fund which has $550 million of assets? Does he have the qualifications, skills and ability to separate what is in his personal interests from what is in the interests of members of the fund? whom I have earlier spoken-how many other union officials on superannuation fund boards can it be asked of? If you take the 67 funds listed by the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority as industry or public sector funds, there are 170 directors appointed directly by a union or a union peak body such as the ACTU. The majority of these people have as their day job that of being a union official. For example, the four union appointed directors on TWUSuper are the national secretary and the three state secretaries of the Transport Workers Union. Let me turn to the third point I wish to make, which is that the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and the Gillard government have failed to implement the reforms recommended in the Cooper review to address the governance problems that I have spoken of. The minister, Bill Shorten, has done some window-dressing recently, announcing a package of measures that will, amongst other things, require funds to disclose the",192,Bills
185,But If This Question Can Be Asked About Mr Curran Or Mr Parkinson,"or Mr Williamson, ofremuneration of directors. That is a good thing, but in both his reform package and in the legislation dealing with the obligations of directors of trustee companies of superannuation funds, which went through this House last week, the minister made no attempt to deal with key recommendations from the recent Cooper review dealing with the governance of superannuation funds. Those recommendations include that disclosure of conflict of interest should be mandatory; that directors must properly disclose their remuneration in line with the provisions that apply to publicly listed companies; that the so-called equal representation model-which is code for the unions having a privileged role in the governance of superannuation funds-should no longer be mandatory; that where equal representation does apply there should be at least one third of the directors on the board who are independent; and that directors who want to sit on multiple boards must demonstrate to APRA that they do not have any foreseeable conflicts of interest. As I have demonstrated, there is plenty of evidence that union officials regard being on the board of a superannuation fund as a nice little extra benefit that comes as part of the package of being an official. There is troubling evidence that some do not understand their fiduciary obligations to members of the superannuation fund-obligations which have nothing to do with their position as a union official and which are quite separate and which are legally binding. Unfortunately, Minister Shorten has done nothing to solve this problem. He is, I note, himself a former union official and a former director of an industry superannuation fund-one of the predecessors of AustralianSuper-as are two other Labor parliamentarians former directors of AustralianSuper, Greg Combet and Senator Doug Cameron, and as was Labor's failed candidate for Melbourne in the 2010 elections, Cath Bowtell. The current arrangements suit the union movement and individual union officials very well. They are not, however, in the interests of the millions of Australians who are members of superannuation funds which have union officials appointed to the board, because those fund members get no say in that appointment and, in many cases, those fund members are not members of the union. The evidence is very clear: there is a profound governance problem in superannuation. Last week the minister said that he was 'appalled' about the HSU scandal. I could not help being reminded of Captain Reynaud in Casablanca, who was 'shocked' to discover that there was gambling going on, and promised to 'round up the usual suspects'. It is time to end the window-dressing. It is time for Minister Shorten to deal with this serious problem. (Time expired) Debate adjourned. Sitting suspended from 13:47 to 16:01 Telecommunications Interception and Other Legislation Amendment (State Bodies) Bill 2012 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. and Other Legislation Amendment (State Bodies) Bill 2012 in relation to some changes to the anticorruption infrastructure in the state of Victoria. The bill proposes to amend the principal act, the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979, to provide for the removal of the Victorian Office of Police Integrity, the OPI, which has been abolished, and the substitution of the Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission-which strikes me as a very literal name-as an authority eligible to intercept telecommunications. In order for an agency to be declared, the Attorney-General must be satisfied that the law of the requesting state makes provision for the agency to comply with the original Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act's record-keeping, reporting and inspection obligations. The state must also enter into an agreement to pay all expenses associated with the issues of warrants issued to the agency. The bill provides for Victoria to legislate for a public interest monitor which will be given specific oversight functions. These include the power to question officers of agencies and to make submissions on any application for a warrant by a declared agency. The bill also makes consequential provisions to the Taxation Administration Act 1953, the Privacy Act 1998 and the Crimes Act 1914 to substitute the Independent Broad-Based Anti-Corruption Commission for the Office of Police Integrity in those statutes. Clearly, the Victorian government supports these particular measures. As the bill's explanatory memorandum states, Victoria's parliament has recently passed the Victorian Inspectorate Act 2011 and the Victorian Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission Act 2011 to establish these two new oversight bodies. The Independent Broadbased Anti-corruption Commission will have a broad jurisdiction, as the name implies, responsible for investigating, exposing and suppressing corruption involving or affecting all public officials in Victoria. Section 16 of the Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission Amendment (Investigative Functions) Act will repeal the Police Integrity Act 2008 of Victoria, abolishing the Office of Police Integrity and enabling the Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission to exercise its functions in relation to all Victorian public officials, including the police. I want to point out the hard work that Australian security agencies do at the moment in protecting our freedoms and the outcomes they achieve in making Australia a safer place. I certainly get the impression that not all Australians are aware of the threats that have been faced by our country over the last few years and the seriousness of the plots that have been foiled by our intelligence and law and order agencies. I will not go into all the details, but members in this place would be very familiar with some of the very serious plots that members of our community have made against government infrastructure and military infrastructure, and clearly our law enforcement and intelligence agencies are having a great deal of success in disrupting this sort of activity. However, there are some dark clouds on the horizon. The Labor Party has consistently targeted our national security agencies and our border protection agencies with both funding cuts and personnel cuts. These agencies seem to have become an easy target at every budget for the savings the government believes it needs. Labor's response to escalating violence on our streets and chaos at our borders is to significantly cut the resources that are available to the agencies the Australian people expect to police these things. Customs and Border Protection, our front-line border protection",195,Hesta Which Is A Fund With $18 3 Billion Of Superannuation Savings For People Working In
186,Mr Keenan (Stirling) (16:01,"I rise to speak on the Telecommunications Interceptionagency, has had a total of almost $26 million cut from its overall budget, and 750 staff have been cut from Customs since Labor came to office. Labor has also made cuts to the Australian Federal Police. They have had a budget cut of $133 million, meaning they are going to have to stretch their existing resources significantly further. In the last two budgets alone Labor has cut 97 staff and stripped a massive $264 million in funding from the Australian Federal Police, making it even harder for them to protect our communities and enforce national security. Labor has also attacked the Australian Crime Commission, which has seen their budget cut by $4.5 million, and 36 staff in total have been taken from the agency since the Labor Party came to power. In the context of the Australian Crime Commission, that is a very significant percentage of their resources. In fact, that is 30 per cent of their workforce. Clearly the Australian Crime Commission are under siege from these cuts and they are going to find it very difficult to do the job entrusted to them in the face of these very significant resource setbacks. I make those points in relation to this bill dealing with law and order and our intelligence agencies in the context of noting what a good job they do. But they are doing that job in defiance of the very difficult circumstances the Labor Party have put them in. In relation to the bill itself, the coalition is satisfied that it does balance access to communications with appropriate independent oversight. I know that the Victorian Liberal government was very keen to get that balance right and has made sure that the privacy of individuals is respected under its new broad based anti-corruption body. Therefore, we support this bill going through the House. Legislation Amendment (State Bodies) Bill 2012 makes amendments to four Commonwealth acts to facilitate telecommunications interception and access powers for the Victorian Independent Broad-Based Anti-Corruption Commission. I will not canvass that aspect of what the shadow minister said but it was correct. Telecommunications interception is a very, very powerful weapon for contemporary law enforcement. I know first hand its importance in protecting the community from not only terrorism threats but also on a day-to-day basis the ravages of serious and organised crime. In delegating authority to state and territory law enforcement bodies the Commonwealth must be assured of the integrity regimes that apply there to supervise the conduct of those interception powers and the approval of those interception powers. The Victorian government has established an Independent Broad-Based Anti-Corruption Commission with similar powers to ICAC in New South Wales and similar bodies in other states. I do not know why they did not call it ICAC like everybody else did; they have chosen a slightly different name. This body has the ability to investigate and disrupt issues of corruption within broad based areas in the state of Victoria, including the Victoria Police. As I said, interception is very strictly regulated and, as a consequence, the Commonwealth must be assured. Under the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979, an agency is not able to be declared an interception agency unless the minister is satisfied that, firstly, the agency is an eligible authority for the purposes of the act; secondly, the state law meets the prescribed oversight arrangements; and, thirdly, that the state has entered into an agreement to pay for interception",197,Hesta Which Is A Fund With $18 3 Billion Of Superannuation Savings For People Working In
187,Mr Hayes (Fowler) (16:07,"The Telecommunications Interception and Othercosts. I also know first hand how wide ranging those costs can be, particularly in respect of targeted operations. Much has just been said by the shadow minister about constraints on our law enforcement agencies. I do admire his capacity to politicise anything, including when we are trying to do something with a mutually-beneficial objective, such as increasing the strength of our law enforcement agencies to protect our communities. He knows as well as I do that, in terms of contemporary law enforcement, this is not just about police on the street. This is about having a regime which is very much intelligence based in pursuing serious and organised crime, which has the technology to combat and compete with that deployed by organised criminals, and which can ensure that the act and regulations support the use of those technologies to defeat criminal enterprise. Possibly very similar to our modern-day military, we are moving more and more towards greater use of technology in combating serious and organised crime. My friend failed to mention the 500 additional police in the Australian Federal Police since 2007. This is not just people who are employed under the Australian Federal Police Act; this commitment is based on 500 sworn police officers-people who actually carry a badge and a gun. These are real police, not security guards or office staff. When it comes to law enforcement, I think it behoves us not to try to politicise these issues but to concentrate on what is necessary to ensure that our police officers-who are charged with the very serious responsibility of protecting our community-have the necessary resources, tools, equipment and regulatory support to allow them to do their job-which is to protect our community. I for one believe that it takes a very special sort of person with a very special sort of courage to wear the police uniform and discharge their duty on behalf of our community. They do a fantastic job and I think we need to work very closely with them to ensure that they have the resources, tools and equipment they need to do the job and protect our communities. The interception ability is something which I know is absolutely key to addressing serious and organised crime. Increasingly it is only through interception that issues of planning are uncovered so that the police can be in a position to disrupt and, in doing so, prevent criminal enterprise in respect of a particular operation. If you can deter or prevent a crime, you are also protecting those who are potential victims of a crime, because for every crime there must be a victim. So, to some extent, modern-day policing is about preventing criminal enterprise as opposed to do what the criminal lawyers might want to lecture us on, which is: wait for the crime to be committed, then collect the evidence. If you have got enough evidence you make a prosecution. Mr Simpkins: Lawyers: what would they know? take up this line as well. Ms Hall: A military police officer. absolutely crucial for combating serious and organised crime. It is great to see that the Victorians have now come on board with their new organisation, the Independent BroadBased Anti-Corruption Commission, with the same or similar powers to the Independent",198,Hesta Which Is A Fund With $18 3 Billion Of Superannuation Savings For People Working In

189,Mr Hayes,"Former AFP, I think, too. This is part of a suite of technologies that isCommission Against Corruption. They will be able to delegate, to authorise and to supervise conduct of telecommunication intercepts. In leaving this debate, one of the points I think must be understood by all of our state and territory jurisdictions is that, whilst we refer to criminals as being a bunch of crooks, the truth of the matter is that they are businesspeople. They will, like any business, pursue a window of opportunity to make a profit. They are profit-based organisations. We need to ensure that we disrupt their profits and their enterprise, and one of the ways we do that is through using modern techniques-particularly, in this case, telephone intercepts. The bill is an important step in ensuring that state bodies responsible for the detection, investigation and prosecution of serious and organised crime have the ability to access investigative tools which are contemporary in nature and certainly have an absolutely proven track record through most of our police jurisdictions of being the vehicle by which prosecutions have been made. I do not think I need to go on. I think my friend is about to take over and probably continue that line, hopefully supporting our police. I commend the bill to the House. and then later the military police as well, I do look for these sorts of opportunities to comment upon these sorts of bills. Some of my best days in the Federal Police were those great moments of driving around, conducting surveillance on people and conducting the searches of people involved with drug crimes. These were some of the great days. I particularly remember once being fully and legitimately authorised to drive across the Harbour Bridge at 130 kilometres an hour. Those were entertaining days. Obviously it was so long ago when you could actually do that in the early afternoon and be able to continue with those sort of speeds, but it is more of a struggle these days with the traffic. But they were all good times. At the reality end, I draw upon that quote from, I think, Greg Norman, who said that you drive for show and you putt for dough. The reality is that with all the really fun stuff in the Federal Police-the driving tasks and the searches and stuff like that-sometimes you actually have to get down to the point of a highly technical analysis and collection of information. I think that is where telecommunications interceptions really come into it. On behalf of my peers at the time in the Australian Federal Police, I will say that we certainly did not appreciate those shifts that we had to pull. I remember spending a couple of weeks of shifts in an observation post in Randwick in Sydney, listening to people of Chinese origin who were conducting their discussions to do with their drug trade in Cantonese, I believe. It was not really that entertaining listening to people speaking Chinese and just having to record when they were in and when they were out on the sheet of paper. But the reality is that we have moved on. This country has moved on. The technical realities have moved on. As I said before, as a former member of the Federal Police and now a member of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, I am very much interested in matters to do with telecommunications interception and the integrity and safeguarding of information generated through interception practices. I therefore welcome the opportunity to speak on the Telecommunications Interception and Other Legislation Amendment (State Bodies) Bill 2012. I confirm, as I believe the shadow minister did, that the coalition supports the bill. When we consider matters such as this, to do with",199,Hesta Which Is A Fund With $18 3 Billion Of Superannuation Savings For People Working In
190,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (16:16,"As a former member of the Australian Federal Policeinterceptions and surveillance, we must remember the basic principle about such laws and what they are designed to do. In many ways, it is about the fundamental reason for the existence of government. By this I mean the protection of the people and safeguarding the safety of the public. Every Australian should feel safe in this country knowing that, if required, phone calls, emails and SMSs may be intercepted-of course, with due cause and appropriate controls. In its many forms, interception surveillance also goes to the detection and action before, during or after the event against terrorism, murder, other violent crimes or crimes against property and stealing. It is about arrests and it is about the collection of evidence. It is about stopping crime, reducing the harm of crime to people in society and the acknowledgement that a little bit of privacy may need to be given up for a greater good. Deep down, we know that this is a trade-off that we must accept, and that is why we provide the powers not only to the state agencies covered in this bill but also to the federal agencies that also deal with the telecommunications interceptions. It is well understood how important it is that agencies that deal with security and safety of Australians should be well supported-agencies such as ASIS, ASIO, ONA, the AFP and Customs. These are the agencies that, through the collection of intelligence and their activities, stand on the front line of keeping the people of our nation safe. We must arm them not only with laws such as the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act but with the resources in terms of money, facilities, equipment and, of course, staff that they require. However, the risks that we run by not providing such resources may not always be apparent or immediately obvious. Emerging problems may get missed either overseas or in our communities. Sometimes those problems may not translate into being a scary threat, but every piece of the puzzle needs to be collected to ensure that Australians are not at risk of violent or property crimes. Sometimes the lack of resources may be apparent in the reduction of services or less efficient services being delivered. By way of example, the $10.4 million cut by the government to Customs for airport passenger facilitation and processing results in extending cues for incoming arrivals, such as at Perth International Airport. As I said before, this bill is about the regime and processes for telecommunication interceptions and related privacy requirements in the agencies in need of being declared under the act. As has already been stated by previous speakers, this bill provides for the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act to be amended in order to remove the Victorian Office of Police Integrity, an organisation being abolished, and to substitute as a declared agency the Victorian Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission, or IBAC. It also provides the mechanism for the IBAC's overseeing organisation, the Victorian Inspectorate, to also receive and use intercepted communications. In addition to these two agencies, the establishment of the Victorian Public Interest Monitor is supported by this bill. Its purpose is to represent public interests during applications for a range of covert warrants by Victorian agencies. The purpose of the primary act is absolutely to regulate the way in which declared agencies receive intercepted information and then how that information can be used and then communicated, all with regard to emphasis on privacy and integrity considerations. When we speak of the Victorian Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission, the Victorian Inspectorate and the establishment of a Victorian Public Interest Monitor, they are state agencies and they are funded by the Victorian taxpayers. Federal agencies are funded collectively by Australian taxpayers, but with the allocation of funds and therefore the accountability for resources determined by this government. So a $42 million cut from ASIO's budget is a case where the government must accept responsibility for possible shortcomings of that agency's working future. As I said earlier, this is an area of great interest for me as a person that has in the past worked with monitoring interception equipment in a law enforcement setting. Now, through the Joint Committee, I am concerned with how integrity matters are dealt with given the value and the breadth of information that can be obtained from the equipment. It is right that such legislation is passed in order to ensure that state agencies such as the IBAC, the Victorian Inspectorate and the Victorian Public Interest Monitor can make use of the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act or oversee the application of their powers. It is good that the states are putting in place bodies such as IBAC to ensure that the people of Victoria can have confidence in the institutions that administer the applications of government and the public sector in the state of Victoria. To conclude, I will say that I endorse and support this bill but, as someone that has always believed wholeheartedly in the safety of this nation and above all its people, I do not endorse the cuts to Customs, the AFP or ASIO that potentially place Australians at risk from criminals and terrorists, as well as the creation of inefficiency and stovepipes through cutbacks in passenger and cargo security handling and entry points about this nation. Forestry) (16:24): It gives me great pleasure to represent the Attorney-General in presenting this bill. I thank all members-the members for Stirling, Fowler and Cowan-for their contributions to the debate and also for their strong support for the agencies that help keep this country and our community safe. Most especially, I thank them for their contribution to this debate on the Telecommunications Interception and other Legislation Amendment (State Bodies) Bill 2012. The bill makes amendments to four Commonwealth acts to facilitate telecommunications interception and access powers for the Victorian Independent Broad-based Anti-Corruption Commission, now called the IBACC. The Victorian government has announced that it is abolishing the existing Office of Police Integrity and is establishing the IBACC. The IBACC will become the body responsible for overseeing the Victoria Police and other public officials. The newly established Victorian Inspectorate will oversee the IBACC. The bill also makes amendments to support the establishment of a Victorian Public Interest Monitor, or PIM. The Public Interest Monitor body has been established to represent the public interest during applications for a range of covert warrants by Victorian agencies. Other states, such as New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia have already established anticorruption commissions which can access these interception act investigative powers. It is intended that the Victorian IBACC will be given access to the same investigative interception act powers that are available to corresponding bodies in the other states. I commend the legislation. Question agreed to.",200,Hesta Which Is A Fund With $18 3 Billion Of Superannuation Savings For People Working In

194,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Bc Scott) (16:29,"The original question was that this2012-13 and associated bills. I was reading something recently that hit the nail on the head with regard to this government and how it believes it always knows best. Friedrich von Hayek in his book The Road to Serfdom noted the profound truth: … man does not and cannot know everything, and when he acts as if he does, disaster follows. … would be planners arrogantly ignore traditions that embody the wisdom of generations; impetuously disregard customs whose purpose they do not understand; and blithely confuse the law written on the hearts of men-which they cannot change-with administrative rules that they can alter at whim. I rise to speak on this package of appropriation bills that underpin the 2012-13 'fudge-it'. I strongly agree with the comment made by my colleague earlier in this debate, the member for Curtin, when she said that this is a budget that seeks to divide. This Labor government 'scare them by' budget or 'get a vote' budget has been strategically aimed at targeting the underprivileged. It is worthwhile noting that some 70 years ago Sir Robert Menzies delivered his forgotten people speech. Sir Robert's commitment to the forgotten people became the foundation of the coalition and the strength of modern Australia. He believed that it was through hard work, aspiration and the individual hopes of Australia's forgotten people that a dynamic democracy would prosper and thrive. He believed it was a broad, growing middle class that would be the backbone of this country. Sir Robert rejected the politics of class saying, 'In a country like Australia the class war must always be a false war.' Today we continue to reject the politics of class war and the policies that seek to penalise Australia's forgotten families. We reject the carbon tax, because it will harm the families and small business people who are the pillars of our national life. We believe that Australians who work hard should be encouraged not penalised. But what do those who work hard, are entrepreneurial and have a vision get from this budget? I would suggest very little, because this government seeks to divide this nation between rich and poor. It is worthwhile to consider at this point the words of Professor Wolfgang Kasper who in his book The Merits of Western Civilisation commented: 'It is only when successful entrepreneurs are widely respected for their success, and their well-deserved wealth is not attacked as illegitimate can modern development take off.' He went on to say: 'If envy of high achievers, the valuation of material achievement versus the conservation of nature or hatred of all tradition become community norms, modern civilisation, higher living standards and material comforts will over the long term be unsustainable.' This is a budget that creates the illusion of providing tax cuts for everyday Australians, when in fact the reality is that individual Australians have faced and are facing tax hikes as a result of the introduction of the carbon tax and some 26 other increased or new taxes since this government came to power in 2007. In a desperate bid to try and hold on to power Labor have targeted parents of schoolchildren with handouts in a blatant attempt to win them over. As I have mentioned before in this place, over the past four years more damage has been done to the people that Labor purport to seek to assist than they have done to the rich. Under this Labor government electricity prices have increased by some 66 per cent, gas prices are up by some 39 per cent, food prices are up by 11 per cent, the petrol price is up by 11 per cent and education and health costs are up over 25 per cent. Sadly, families will soon realise that the sugar-hit that they are receiving through the two instalments under the schoolkids bonus",205,Hesta Which Is A Fund With $18 3 Billion Of Superannuation Savings For People Working In
195,Mr Van Manen (Forde) (16:29,"I rise to speak today on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1)will in no way keep pace with the increases in the cost of living that continue to climb under this government. Furthermore, these handouts are being paid for from borrowed money which incurs interest that will need to be paid back. Ironically it will be the children in school now that will be paying back the borrowed money plus interest for these handouts through the taxes they will pay during their working lives. The government is spending money it does not have, attempting to increase the national credit card at the same time as promising to deliver a surplus. Surpluses are supposed to pay down debt, but what is $1.5 billion going to do to our debt levels, which are set to reach $145 billion in 2013-14? As the government give out these stimulus payments and handouts with one hand, they are taking back with the other in a desperate bid to reach their two main objectives: to return to surplus and to keep their jobs. With one hand they give out a schoolkids bonus-which is really carbon tax compensationand with the other hand they impose the world's biggest carbon tax to drive up the cost of everything. The media reported that in my electorate some $3.2 million cleverly designed as a household assistance package would be paid to families over the next few weeks to cushion the blow of the carbon tax. But, as we all well know, there is no such thing as a free lunch; there is no such thing as a free handout from this government. Every time there is a handout we are plunged further into debt and, as the Treasurer has acknowledged, the government's handouts will continue to put pressure on interest rates. With this 'free' lunch comes an expensive side of 26 new or increased taxes. Is that really what you thought you ordered? Also, on the topic of handouts, will families actually spend the schoolkids bonus on their children's schooling? This is a question I have been asked on a number of occasions since the announcement of these payments. In my electorate there are a number of organisations, such as the Twin Rivers co-op, which assist some of the most underprivileged families. It is interesting to note that the manager of the co-op has had conversations with families who have in the last little while spent handouts on-for example-plasma TVs and then turned up the next week desperate for food and support. Community organisations such as Twin Rivers co-op bring me to my next point, which I touched on earlier this week. Great communities are not created by governments; they are created by individuals in our community working together. I will use the Twin Rivers co-op here to demonstrate my point. Briefly, the background is that the Twin Rivers co-op assists some 2,000 families and pensioners by providing low-cost groceries. The co-op differs from many other support organisations in this field, who normally provide packaged hampers, by giving these families and pensioners the opportunity to select their own items. Being able to select these items gives these people a sense of independence, and many of those registered at the co-op say that they could not survive financially without its help. Community organisations such as the Twin Rivers co-op are the pillars of strength of our local community in Forde. Wouldn't it be nice to see more support for organisations such as these and less money spent on waste and increasing the size of government? The co-op functions without any subsidies, and, in a cruel twist, the co-op will soon bear the burden of the carbon tax not only on its electricity costs but also, as we are discovering, on the cost of maintaining its fridges and freezers. As for the items sold by the co-op, the compounding nature throughout the supply chain of the carbon tax will not be known until after 1 July this year. How much more expensive will basic necessities be for these people? The government say that the impact on inflation is going to be 0.7 per cent, but, if inflation is 2.8 per cent, this impact would mean nearly a 28 per cent increase in the inflation rate. The people in this community are not receiving a 28 per cent increase in their various payments. One thing is for sure: the compounded costs in the supply chain will be passed on to the underprivileged families and pensioners who rely on the Twin Rivers co-op, and any compensation they receive will be transferred like a hot potato from their hands to the suppliers of the goods and services. It is interesting to note that, due to demand from the community, the co-op will soon be seeking to locate to larger premises and that it is expected that this move will cost around $100,000. As the co-op point out, given the wonderful work they do in our community it would be handy if the co-op could receive funding and assistance to help fund the cost of this move. The most significant part of these bills is that they seek to increase the limit of the Commonwealth's debt from $250 billion to $300 million-and this at a time when the government says it wants to run a surplus of $1½ billion. It is just the old pea-and-thimble trick: when this government struggles to pay for its waste it introduces a bill to increase its credit card limit, whilst the community organisations which are the pillars of strength for struggling parents, families and pensioners are left scratching their heads wondering where they will find the money to expand their services for the people in genuine need whom they seek to help. This grassroots approach benefits struggling families, yet the government seeks to take credit for it. I know for a fact that struggling families will benefit from being able to access such things as low-cost groceries on a regular basis. In comparison to the compensation payments in handouts, the grassroots approach is a long-term solution to financial hardship-it is not a short-term sugar hit-as it gives people a hand up, not just a handout. It has been very frustrating to watch as this government continues to destroy our nation's wealth through cost blowouts in border protection, pink batts, set-top boxes and the NBN-and the list goes on. We cannot look on as this government sets out to make room for more debt and more waste by increasing the limit of the Commonwealth's credit card, and we as a coalition will strongly oppose it. It is instructive to note that the debt ceiling inherited by this government when it came to office in 2007 was zero-nil. This government, despite its desperate attempt to appear otherwise, is addicted to debt, deficit and wasteful spending. Only a coalition government has the capacity to provide a positive future for the Australian economy. The problem we have today is that this Labor government believes in big government and small communities, whereas the goal should be smaller government and big communities. That is what we as a coalition stand for, and I cannot stress enough the importance of the way organisations within my local community-not just the Twin Rivers co-op but also many others-are enriching the lives of others. Where the government fails to support people, the community provides for them. As there has been no change to the budget outcomes this year, I am able to conclude my contribution with the same words with which I concluded my contribution last year: This government is a wasteful and reckless government that continues to treat Australians with contempt and as fools by counting new or higher taxes as savings, continuing to deliver policies that lead only to a higher cost of living for all Australians and doing nothing for the future prosperity of our nation by leaving a legacy marred by debt, the interest on which will rob future generations of their wealth. Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2012-2013, Appropriation Bill (No. 5) 2011-2012, Appropriation Bill (No. 6) 2011-2012 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 20122013. In my contribution today I will, of course, speak about the broader economic situation that the nation finds itself in. My electorate of Swan is a disproportionate loser from this budget, and the decisions and measures contained within it are going to have a significant local impact. The budget is almost suspiciously targeted at Swan councils, ratepayers and single parents and at jobs and businesses in my electorate, and I cannot support it. There has been a significant deterioration in the nation's finances over the course of the last four Labor budgets. There have been four Labor budgets and four massive deficits-in fact, the four biggest deficits in the history of the Commonwealth have preceded this budget. The total cumulative debt of these budgets is $174 billion. This government has beaten Paul Keating's net debt record of $96 billion. I and many Australians thought that this record could never be beaten. Four years ago, long after the Howard government had successfully paid off Labor's debt through successive surpluses and left the country with cash in the bank, who would have thought that we would be in this position? But perhaps we should not be surprised, for the Labor Party has a track record on economic management that has seen it fail to deliver a surplus for well over 20 years. It is little wonder that we in the coalition have sincere doubts that this wafer-thin paper surplus can be ever be delivered. The Labor Party wants to blame others for its deficits and poor fiscal discipline, but the facts are that Labor has not managed to deliver a surplus in 20 years and that our government presided over the fastest growth in revenue in real terms since the mid-1980s. It is spending $100 billion a year more than the amount spent in the last year of the coalition government. That is a 40 per cent increase over four years excluding the stimulus, the pink batts and the school halls. The shadow finance minister hit the nail on the head the other day when he said that, if Australian households decided to increase their household spending by 10 per cent a year, most would go broke pretty quickly. The people in Victoria Park and Cannington in my electorate cannot afford such luxuries, but this government thinks that it can-and it is doing so at the expense of people who pay taxes across this country. I have to give you some examples of the wasteful spending which my electorate needs to know about, and in doing so I will follow the shadow Treasurer's MPI speech last week. Labor's digital set-top box installation program cost an average of $350 per installation per box; Harvey Norman is offering the same thing for $168. The Australian reports that the average installation cost of the set-top boxes has now risen to $700 per unit. You could buy a whole TV for that. Labor's bungling of the Australia Network tender has cost at least $2 million. The net result is that compensation is now being paid to Sky News for winning the tender but not getting it. The Australian Research Council is spending millions of dollars on",206,Hesta Which Is A Fund With $18 3 Billion Of Superannuation Savings For People Working In
196,Mr Irons (Swan) (16:43,"I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2012-2013,questionable research projects, such as a study of climate change emotion and a study of ancient economic life in Italy. There is a grant of $578,792 to UWA for a study of 'an ignored credit instrument in Florentine economic, social and religious life from 1570 to 1790'. There is $197,302 for a study called 'Sending and responding to messages about climate change: the role of emotion and morality'. There is $314,000 for a study to determine if birds are shrinking. There is $145,000 for a study of sleeping snails to determine 'factors that aid life extension'. There is $210,000 to study the early history of the moon. I am sure there are plenty of charities in my electorate who would love to have had just a slice of some of that wasteful spending by this government. There can be no excuse for the size of the government's deficits and the dreadful financial position of the nation; there can be no excuse or justification for the six new taxes in this budget; and there can be no excuse for the way the Treasurer has cooked the books. This government and its economic skills remind me of the movie Margin Call, and I dare say that Australian taxpayers will feel the full brunt of this economic bungling. There is an alternative: we in the coalition have a strong economic plan for Australia's future to get the economy growing again. Our plan is about hope, reward for effort and opportunity for all. We will build a bigger and stronger five-pillar pro-growth economy based around a strong manufacturing industry, a growing knowledge economy and a sophisticated services sector, as well as our world-leading resources and agricultural industries. We will release households and businesses from the burdens of carbon and mining taxes to promote jobs and growth for Australia. I spoke at length in the grievance debate last night about the bungling involved in the potential refrigeration loading, where the government implemented with their carbon tax a wrecking ball for the HVACR industry without satisfactory consultation with all stakeholders. There is no dispute that the Treasurer's political goals were heavily skewed in this budget as he tried to produce a paper surplus. All sorts of accounting tricks have been used to cook the books, one of the most obvious being the shifting of funding commitments for the 201213 financial year to fractionally outside the budget period. For example, by bringing forward just two programs-the back-to-school payment and the Commonwealth grants to local government-the government has managed to artificially save $1.5 billion in the 2012-13 budget. Honest budget treatment of these two programs alone would have led to an overall deficit. As we move on to some of the underpinning budget assumptions, the scale of the accounting deception becomes apparent. One of the championed assumptions is that tax receipts, which normally grow at a rate of eight per cent per annum due to fiscal drag, will inexplicably jump to 11 per cent in the forthcoming financial year when, on the government's own figures, the unemployment rate is expected to also rise to 5.5 per cent. These are heroic assumptions by the Treasurer, which leads to the question: why would the Treasurer be sticking his neck on the line and making these predictions? Is it because he knows that the outcome of the budget year will not be known until November 2013-in other words, after the next federal election? I think he does not believe he can make this surplus, and neither do many Australians. The Treasurer knows it is a grand charade. This suspicion is confirmed by one simple fact that is buried deep within part five of Appropriation Bill (No. 2), in relation to the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act 2011: a provision to increase Australia's debt ceiling outwards to $300 billion. Madam Deputy Speaker O'Neill, if you or I were planning to go on an austerity drive and cut costs from our personal budgets or from our business budgets-because I know you have business experience-would the first thing we would do be to ask our bank for an increase in overdraft capacity? The Treasurer has no confidence in the surplus and we should have no confidence in the Treasurer. The coalition plans to move a second reading amendment seeking that the terms of the debate be varied so that substantive amendments can be moved and debated in relation to Appropriation Bill (No. 2). This is the first carbon tax budget, and it has proved to be particularly bad news for the constituents in my electorate of Swan, who have recently learned that they will be disproportionately hit by the carbon tax in their local council areas. In addition to residents having to pay more for electricity, food, groceries and basic living expenses, it was revealed in Senate estimates last week that the federal government's carbon tax policemen have written to two councils in my electorate warning them of an expected hit from the carbon tax. These councils, the Town of Victoria Park and the City of Canning, are the only councils in the inner metropolitan region of Perth that have been sent these letters. This is a ludicrous situation, where ratepayers in these two council areas have been targeted and no other councils in inner metropolitan Perth have been sent a similar letter. The government cannot explain why, and targeted councils across the country have come out and said they have been given insufficient guidance from the federal government on how to factor this in. This is one of a number of contradictions involved in the carbon tax that cannot be explained and are frankly perverse, chief among these being that it will not reduce Australian emissions. Australian emissions will rise under the tax and Australia will only meet its targets by purchasing carbon credits from overseas. However, the contradiction that takes the cake is that involving the EMRC and the City of Belmont in my electorate of Swan. On 26 March, the member for Hasluck and I visited the Red Hill Waste Management Facility, which is run by the EMRC. The idea is that the site is operated as a joint site for six councils, costs are saved and in the process carbon emissions are reduced through the shared waste management strategy. It has been extremely successful, with great savings on emissions, and both the member for Hasluck and I have spoken on the great results from this particular waste management program. However, the economies of scale are where the carbon tax problem arises. The site is big enough to qualify for the carbon tax and will be targeted. Because the councils have grouped together, they are big enough to be liable. So, while there are going to be many major broad impacts on the electorate of Swan and Australia from the carbon tax, it is clear that it is going to have a very disproportionately big local impact on my electorate of Swan. As we often hear and are reminded, Prime Minister Gillard said there would no carbon tax under the government she led. I want to talk in more detail about the unemployment statistics in the budget, particularly in relation to the solar industry in my electorate of Swan. The government's decision to suddenly suspend the solar hot water rebate-a decision that was clearly taken to achieve the paper surplus-has been estimated by the Clean Energy Council as putting 1,200 manufacturing jobs and 6,000 jobs in installation, sales and administration at risk. This decision is a broken promise. Many of these jobs at risk are in my electorate of Swan, at the Rheem factory in Welshpool, in the transport and industrial hub of Perth. Last week, the member for Flinders and I fulfilled a promise that we made to the workers on the factory floor on 7 March to introduce a private member's bill to force the government to keep its commitments. I want to turn my attention briefly to small businesses, which are of particular importance to my electorate of Swan, on account of nearly 20,000 businesses operating locally, making it one of the small business hubs in Australia. First and foremost, there is the broken promise of a one per cent tax cut, which is quite extraordinary given the amount time and effort the Prime Minister put into talking about this on the airwaves. Second, there are the updated figures obtained last week that over 18,000 regulations have now been brought in by the government, with only 86 having been repealed. This is despite a promise by Labor that when they were elected they would introduce one in, one out, meaning that new regulations would be matched by repealing others-another broken promise, but one with serious consequences for business confidence. That is not to mention the six new taxes in this budget. This budget is a poor outcome for small business. Border protection is also a key issue for the constituents in my electorate of Swan, and it goes without saying that the budget showed that there have been massive blow-outs in the cost of managing this issue. It is really just incredible what the Labor Party have done to our border protection laws, and I do not think anyone out there in the electorate can really understand why they did it and why they will not re-introduce the policies that actually worked. They are soft on protecting our national borders, a key obligation of government, which is inexcusable. At the 2010 election we heard the Prime Minister, and in my electorate of Swan we heard the Labor candidate, talking tough, saying, 'We must stop the people-smuggling trade.' Two years on, the government have the solutions from the previous government, which they changed, and all they have to do is re-implement them. Australia needs to have a strong resolve when it comes to people smuggling, and I think most people in Australia recognise that the only way now to stop the boats is to elect a Liberal government that will re-introduce the suite of policy measures that worked so effectively in the past. Interest payments on net debt for the financial year 2012-13 are projected to be $7 billion. This was one figure that was not leaked prior to the budget. That $7 billion in interest payments that the government is throwing away next year could be spent on vital infrastructure for projects across the nation and across my electorate of Swan. It is because of this crippling debt the government has built up that it cannot and will not fund these important community initiatives that would benefit the people of my electorate, whether they are related to roads, aircraft noise amelioration or community facilities. Instead, the people of Australia will for years to come have to pay back the debt accumulated by this government by paying new taxes. No Gillard election commitments for Swan were delivered in this budget. I must conclude that I have not seen a more damaging budget for the people of my electorate of Swan in this place before. It has, as I said before, almost suspiciously targeted councils, ratepayers, single parents, jobs and businesses in my electorate and across Australia. Ms LEY (Farrer) (16:57): I am pleased to speak to the Appropriation Bill (No.1) 2012-13 and related bills in the Federation Chamber today from my perspective as local member for the electorate of Farrer-some 30 per cent of western New South Wales, ranging from Albury along the Murray River, up the South Australian border to Broken Hill, taking in a large part of the Darling River and finishing at the junction of Queensland, New South Wales and South Australia. I also want to talk about the budget from the perspective of my role as the opposition spokesperson on employment participation and child care. From that perspective, the budget has been a real disappointment. We have seen $200 million ripped from Job Services Australia and, in the same budget, the forecast of an increase in unemployment to 5.5 per cent. Youth unemployment is currently more than three times the national average, with the unemployment rate for 15to 19-yearolds averaging 15.7 per cent. But in certain parts of Australia-the Northern Suburbs of Melbourne, the Western Suburbs of Sydney and some of the west of New South Walesyouth unemployment is between 25 and 40 per cent. Labor has entirely given up on this sector of our community and I do not believe it has any real understanding of what is needed to assist people into a job. Currently, 8,085 stream 1 job seekers are classified as very long term unemployed. Stream1 means that job service agencies receive a little funding support to help them into work, and that they are, if you like, the least worse category of job seekers. This category has been languishing on welfare for more than two years, yet the government has heartlessly taken away $162.6 million from these stream 1 services. It is clearly failing to assist job seekers when they fall out of work and, often, fall off a cliff. That is the time to intervene early to get them back into a job. In addition, the government is saving $44 million over four years from changes to the funding for the providers of those job services. The reason I raise this is that this measure supposedly came about to address some compliance issues with providers claiming a higher fee than they were entitled to. We on the side of the House do not condone this. However, the government would have you believe that this was not about saving money, but a $44 million saving does seem to be a rather convenient outcome. I would like to use this opportunity to remind the government of a commitment made by the Treasurer in last year's budget. Last year the Treasurer waxed lyrical about how his budget was going to create 500,000 jobs. That figure has well and truly fallen by the wayside, and the government looks set to preside over an increase of well less than half that figure. So far it has achieved just 60,600 jobs, with a decrease in the participation rate since May 2011 of 0.4 per cent to 65.2 per cent. Quite frankly, I can understand job seekers becoming demoralised in this environment with government showing no real commitment to getting them into jobs. Changes to apprenticeship incentives will see employers only receiving the assistance they used to receive after having employed an apprentice for six months. This government has failed to recognise the financial strain that employers are under-looming is the world's biggest carbon tax, further exacerbating cost-of-living pressures. I talk about apprenticeships because all of us in this place love talking about apprentices: we love visiting apprentices and seeing the environment where apprentices are getting into work, kids are leaving school, finding the right pathways and so on. But the government has not got it right. In 2007, then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd talked up skills, training and apprentices. He would have had us believe that things were going to change dramatically for the better. How many apprentices could have been trained in the trades since 2007? Clearly not enough, given the agreements now being struck to bring in workers on 457 visas. I am not saying that fundamentally that is a bad thing. I am saying it is an admission of failure by the government, because the training that could and should have happened since Kevin Rudd made these grand announcements obviously has not happened. Child care has been a huge loser in this budget. We have a government, right here right now, that has ripped money from parents by decreasing the childcare rebate from $8,179that is what it should be this year-to $7,500 capped at that level, and the only assistance being offered is not to the parents struggling to find care that fits in with their working hours, but just free child care for the unemployed. Again, this is an admission of failure. Yes, struggling families looking for work in difficult circumstances need childcare support. But to allocate the places just to those who may not use them in the best possible way is another admission of failure. Whilst we agree that those who are searching for work or in study need childcare assistance, so too do families. Trade training cadetships have been placed on hold, something that this government previously was proud of and talked up everywhere members went. This has fallen flat, and nothing is being said. We know the government snuck through some bills straight after the budget announcement that increased the debt ceiling to $300 billion, another admission of failure. 'Oops, if we don't realise our $1.5 billion surplus we're going to need this as a safety net.' It is a bit like saying, 'I'm investing $350 and I expect to make a profit at the end of $1.50.' No-one takes that seriously; no-one takes this government's forecast budget surplus seriously. Net government debt has increased almost $40 billion since the last budget, and by 2015-16 the government will be spending around $22 million a day, or over $8 billion a year, on interest payments alone. I now turn to circumstances affecting my electorate of Farrer. I last briefly spoke about the budget on 9 May, but I did not have time to elaborate on the disappointing news for my electorate in relation to government spending on the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. In the words of the Murray Group of Concerned Communities, a local community focussed group of businesses and individuals in the New South Wales Murray region that has worked incredibly hard to get its message across: 'The budget raises questions about the delivery and implementation of the basin plan and leaves you wondering if the government knows something that we don't. Department funding to support reform in the Murray-Darling Basin will be reduced in the two years 2015-16 and 2016-17, just as the Murray-Darling Basin Authority is due to be conducting a review into the implementation of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan.' It is almost as if the government knows that less money will be needed. In fact, it has allocated less money to the very important works and measures that we need to enable farmers to survive a future with less water. No-one is arguing that there will be a future with less water, but today in question time, instead of telling us how he proposed to deal with a very complex set of issues and competing requirements by state governments, all the minister for the environment did was point to those of us in the opposition and say, 'Oh, you haven't asked me anything about this.' But as a minister of the Crown, as a minister in the executive of the current government charged with responsibility for the Basin Plan, it was a childish and disappointing intervention by him. It was a breathtakingly disappointing intervention by him to not even give us one, tiny indication of the direction in which he is heading. But he has acknowledged that the authority have not got it right. Well, they have pretty much thrown their hands up in the air. All of the state governments have different views-as of course they would and as of course they should, because they are all interested in protecting the citizens of their state, just as all local members have a view. No-one ever suggested that this would be easy. I will refer to the work done by the Windsor committee, chaired by the member for New England. This cross-party committee did in fact come up with some recommendations that everyone on the committee could live with. It is disappointing that the minister completely ignored those as well. I want to touch on defence budget cuts. Close to my electorate is the Bandiana Army base in Wodonga, in the electorate of Indi. I also have an important facility in Mulwala, managed previously by ADI but now managed by Thales. We have concerns that, with the biggest cuts in military spending since the Vietnam War, the 'she'll be right' attitude for the next four years probably is not the best one from this government. I remind members that the immediate concern locally is the ongoing production of the Commonwealth's propellant manufacturing at the Thales Mulwala facility. Local jobs are currently 300 as we lead up to commissioning the new factory. If less propellant is to be manufactured, that puts our capability at risk, it puts the jobs at risk and it puts at risk the really good work that was done by the then parliamentary secretary, Brendan Nelson, when he committed and convinced the Howard government cabinet to maintain a domestic propellant manufacturing facility in Australia. I shall be watching that very closely. On ANZAC Day, both I and the member for Riverina noted that there was a new, unwritten rule that the ADF could not send out members to officially represent the force, because of a cost-cutting measure. It is disappointing when you see the effort that small communities go to put on local ANZAC Day services, only to be told that the resources are not there to send the catafalque party. The issue of free flights has been in the news recently. About 22,000 unmarried military personnel over 21 years of age will lose their annual free flight home due to budget cuts aimed at boosting the government's surplus. How disappointing is that! I will just go back to the issue of local government-an issue so close to the people in rural Australia-and talk about Albury City Council. Last night, the world's biggest carbon tax hit Albury ratepayers with a triple whammy, starting with an increase to general rates by half a per cent more than necessary. This was on top of the annual charge for domestic waste increasing by 10 per cent, or $18 per household, and entry charges at the landfill leaping from 35 per cent to 82 per cent. What that means is that an average load of rubbish, loaded up on the back of my six-by-four trailer, instead of costing me $18 a load will now cost me $27.50. Yes, I can afford it, Deputy Speaker, but I know a lot of my constituents cannot. From day one, year one, they will be hit-and that is before they even leave their houses. And, when we do leave our houses, we cannot even fly here to Canberra to watch the government at work. I will quote from an email from the chief operating officer of Brindabella Airlines: The imposition of the carbon tax from 1st July 2012 was a major factor and the final nail in the coffin for us in the decision making process. The removal of the en route rebate scheme, the addition of the carbon tax, and the introduction of increased passenger screening charges, all to take effect on 1st July 2012, have created the perfect storm for regional aviation. To see the Leader of the House jumping and jiving in question time to try to avoid this fact was quite extraordinary. Of course we are not suggesting that the single, sole factor is the carbon tax. Mr Perrett interjectingMs LEY: I just did read an excerpt from the email. We all know that, when it comes to a business under pressure, the pressures build up and you can pick on any of those final pressures as being the straw that breaks the camel's back. But the chief operating officer of Brindabella certainly did name the carbon tax. Yes, there are other factors putting the business under stress. I know Brindabella very well. They have tried very hard to provide a really good service. They have tried in an environment where, let's face it, the route probably was not making any money. They have done their best but they finally had to acknowledge that the carbon tax is just a bridge too far. This is the closest that the NBN will get to my electorate of Farrer. I am not sure what portion of the $50 billion allocation was to provide these little trucksnot allowed. Ms LEY: Madam Deputy Speaker, I could not resist the prop! I know that there are rules, and I apologise. Broken Hill, a community of 20,000 people in the far west of New South Wales, was told by the NBN that, because of the location of the points of interconnect-of which there are some 125 across Australia, the nearest one being Dubbo-the fibre backhaul goes straight past Broken Hill and straight back to points east. Actually, it is one of the few things the government has done in telecommunications that I think is pretty good. There was a long and complicated explanation about why Broken Hill could not hook onto it. Mr Quigley said it is a bit like having a fast freeway going past your house: you cannot get an off-ramp just where you want it. Well, it is not quite like that. The facility is there, the point of interconnect is there. All it takes is a decision by NBN Co. that the community of Broken Hill be serviced. The answers that we got on notice as members of the NBN joint committee were not convincing at all. I do not usually raise the charge of political interference in this place. I only do so in this case because I believe there cannot be any other reason why we are simply being put on the backburner so badly. But the NBN truck is coming to Broken Hill and the as are in the Broken Hill paper! A senator for New South Wales talked about the NBN in Albury to the people of Broken Hill, perhaps thinking that they may be only an hour apart. Obviously this senator for New South Wales is not travelling out of Sydney and seeing the vast distances that we have to deal with. I look forward to the day when we are in government and we can prioritise fast broadband for the regions I represent so that they can get the communications that they absolutely deserve. wide-ranging debate and members should be heard in silence.

199,Mr Billson (Dunkley) (17:12,"Sadly, this budget contained nothing to help smallcourage of and risks taken by those who gain employment through their own enterprise rather than looking to an employer to provide them with work. And, frankly, there was nothing in it to deal with the funk, the sense of despair, in many sections of the small business community about just where the government is taking them and the sense that they have been driven into a ditch by government policy. There was nothing in the budget to bring about a change in fortune and a sense that more prosperity may be in reach if they continue to apply themselves. Insolvency rates are up 48 per cent on last year and the number of small business start-ups is down 95 per cent on the previous year, reflecting both the difficulties faced by people currently involved in small business and, frankly, an attack on entrepreneurship which is turning so many people off making the decision to set up their own business. In these very difficult circumstances, there is nothing in the budget to bring about a change. But there is something to make a difficult situation even harder, and that is the world's largest carbon tax. Sadly, while the government boasts about its compensation and its carveouts-they are borrowing money today to offer a sugar pill in advance of the very sour and enduring taste that the carbon tax will leave in many people's lives-there was no direct support for small business. Yet the small business community of Australia will be the meat in the sandwich. They are faced with increased costs for their own businesses. The government conservatively estimates that there will be a 10 per cent increase in their electricity costs and a nine per cent increase in the cost of gas. These estimates have been challenged by the energy user associations and organisations, who say this is a gross underestimate of the price impact. They are also faced with all the increased input costs they will incur as a result of those in the supply chain also having to carry the cost of the carbon tax. Small businesses are faced with all of those input cost pressures and increased costs of doing business and then they need to face the customers-customers who at this time are not looking to be paying more for anything. Small businesses will be the meat in the sandwich, left at the pointy end of this carbon tax con to explain this to their customers. Whilst the government says 'It'll be fineonly the big 500 will be paying,' small businesses will have to explain to their customers that that is not right. The carbon tax will drive a wrecking ball through the economy. It will cascade and compound all the way through every step of the production process and the supply chain, which will incur additional costs that they will have to pass on to their customers, and customers are not looking for price increases. So many small businesses I speak with are having to operate on ever-narrowing margins to keep some activity going through their business at a time when so many Australians are choosing to defer expenditure they need not incur right now or are going in with a very strong discount motive as they engage small businesses across Australia. This is what is so frustrating about these changes. In addition to that, on 13 July the Prime Minister, in Brisbane, set a price rise maximum decree. She said that if a small business puts up prices by more than one per cent they will be price gouging and the carbon cop, the ACCC, will be after them with fines of up to $1.1 million. Small businesses shuddered at this threat, at this intimidation from the bully pulpit of the Prime Minister's office. She said: 'You must not put your prices up by more than one per cent,' when the government has done precisely no examination, no modelling and no research on the impact of the carbon tax on any particular kind of business or size of business. We need to recognise that, unlike the GST, which was a numeric calculation that was applied to the final point of consumption, the carbon tax will land differently for different businesses structured in different ways with different supply chains and different modes of operation. The impact will be different, yet the Prime Minister decreed a one per cent cap on price rises. She was in no position to do that-none whatsoever. There was no legal basis for her to make that claim. The ACCC in recent days has walked away as fast as it could from the Prime Minister's declaration of this one per cent cap on price increases arising from the carbon tax, under threat of a $1.1 million fine administered by the ACCC. The commission itself has said, 'No, there is no such legal obstacle to price movements of that kind.' What it has said is that, if you are moving your prices and you are attributing those price movements or part thereof to the carbon tax, make sure you have a basis on which to support that claim. That is what the law says. The law relates to false and misleading conduct. It relates to representations a business makes to its customers as to the reasons or the rationale for price movements. There is no legal requirement to explain to your customers why your prices are moving, but if a small business does offer an explanation that is linked to the carbon tax it is obliged to make sure that those representations are well founded and can be justified. That is a world away from the decree of the Prime Minister. That is nothing like the one per cent cap on price movements that the Prime Minister asserted in her 13 July statement. The Prime Minister and the commission cannot both be right. I know who is right; it is the commission. The Prime Minister's representation itself was false and misleading, because there is no legal basis on which to substantiate the statement she made in Brisbane. It is way past time for her to correct that false and misleading representation to the Australian small business community so that they know precisely the footing on which they stand when the carbon tax comes in, in little over one month. We have one month before the world's largest carbon tax comes in, and yet the only information that has been put out to the small business community by the Prime Minister and her declarations is false and misleading. When is the government going to be open and accountable, to be frank? To quote Bill Kelty, the truth will usually do. When is that going to be invoked as a basis on which to communicate effectively and reliably to the small business community? Right now they know they are the meat in the sandwich, and the Australian public know the government's and the Prime Minister's assurances are not founded on any basis of analysis and that small businesses, already doing it tough, will face an even tougher time ahead. It is not surprising that the findings of a recent Sensis small business survey were quite revealing: 92 per cent of the small businesses surveyed did not think government policies were helping them. That is a well-founded assessment, because they are actually correct. When confronted by that in the question, 'Will the budget turn that around?'-and I quote from a Lateline Business interview that was less than 24 hours before the Treasurer delivered the budget speech-the Minister for Housing, Homelessness and Small Business, Minister O'Connor, a minister who boasts about his influence because he is on the Expenditure Review Committee, said: I think we've done some recent things already by announcing the cut in the small business company tax rate from 30 to 29 cents … Less than 24 hours before the government announced that it is walking away from yet another promise, the minister put that to Ticky Fullerton on Lateline Business as the antidote to 92 per cent of small businesses feeling that government policies were not helping them. What was that about? Was that yet another episode of false and misleading representations to the small business community? I think so. The member for Deakin, perhaps inspired by the small business minister's representations, has written to his electorate, to the small business community, boasting about the one per cent company tax cut for small business. Has that been corrected? Has there been a subsequent mail-out? No there has not. This is just part of the fiction that the government seeks to provide around its record on small business. The government continues to talk about having a small business minister in cabinet-not bad. He is the fourth small business minister I have faced, and finally one that is being put at the adults table, not at the kids table. Now the claim is that it is the first time in history. This ignores Peter Reith's important contribution in that portfolio and the many achievements he implemented around appointing a small business commissioner to the ACCC and introducing unconscionable conduct provisions, as well as a budget to help the commission get test cases that would help small business understand the competition law protections available to them and workplace relations arrangements that were nimble and that accommodated the needs of the small business community. That was what a cabinet level minister did-not the one that claims to be the first but the one that was actually there. It is interesting to link the two. There is the Small Business Commissioner-the real one. We actually have one of them already in the ACCC. Yet the government comes out claiming it is going to appoint the first small business commissioner. Well, here is a memo to the minister: there already is one. They were appointed by the coalition in 1999. What the small business minister was trying to do was mimic the coalition's commitment to a small business and family enterprise ombudsman, but he did not want to make it so obvious that it was a policy lifted from the coalition that he gave it a name-a name which already applies to an existing role in the ACCC. So what you find is this effort by the government to mimic coalition policy but then trying to make it look like it was not a direct lift by changing the title and then coming up with a title that already exists for an existing role with some powers in the ACCC. To rub insult into injury, the government has not given this new role that has already got a name somewhere else powers of any great note to improve the tool kit available to the small business community in getting a fair go in their dealings with government and in matters relating to competition. This was the big announcement in the government's budget relating to small business. It was a lift of a coalition policy, a shingle that had already been used, and then there were no new tools or powers to bring about better outcomes for the constituency it aims to represent. There is that and the broken promise about the company tax. Perhaps the government realised that it was overstating those benefits, because less than a third of small businesses are structured as companies and about half of those are profitable and fewer still pay company tax. So the boast that a company tax cut of the kind the government had been waving around as a great achievement was going to be the outstanding tonic to help the small business community was again a false and misleading statement. We see this over and over again. Instead, there is now the loss carry-back measure. That measure is interesting. It is a measure the coalition advocated as part of a considered package to deal with the GFC. Why? Because we saw cases of companies that were profitable leading up to and immediately prior to the GFC whose businesses effectively fell off a cliff with the GFC. Therefore, there was a profitable trading period that businesses could reach back to and then carry forward the tax that they had paid on their profits to supplement, hopefully, their cash flow from this extraordinary and abrupt change in trading conditions. That was a measure that the government ridiculed-it said it was not necessary. But now, years after the GFC and after years of very flat and poor trading conditions for small business where many do not actually have the profits against which a subsequent loss could be laid off against and where one in three are actually structured as companies, the government thinks this is the time to bring forward this measure. Now that the time that it could have been most useful has long passed, the government has now brought in this measure. Maybe it knows something that other people have not heard from the government, and that is: if you thought the GFC was bad, the carbon tax is going to be worse. That could be the only argument. Why turn your back on a measure designed to respond to the GFC and say it is unnecessary and now bring it in to coincide with the carbon tax? That action amounts to an admission that the carbon tax is going to be more of an assault on many Australian small businesses than the GFC. There can be no other explanation for it, other than it is another effort to make it look like the government is doing something when it is actually not in the name of the small business community. In the time that is available, I would like to make one other point, if I may. I will come back to the tax changes and how limited the benefits are from those at another time, recognising that, to get asset write-off advantages, you need all the cash up-front to actually make that purchase and then be able to get some smaller percentage cash flow benefit down the track. I want to talk about the LPG industry. Right now it is on its knees. This is a time when those who bring in the fuel or produce the fuel, that wholesale it, that retail it, that are involved in original equipment manufacturing of LPG vehicles or in the installations really need to get together. Here is a fuel that is cleaner, is green and is here now. This should be the sexy fuel of our time. People should be leaping on LPG as a cost-effective and environmentally and air quality responsible measure to power the transport systems of Australia. Not enough is being done in this area. I hope the industry comes together to promote this fuel that is in abundance in our country now and show the Australian motorist that it is something they should get on to. It is a clean, green fuel and it is here now. People should embrace it. (Time expired) minister for small business and his outstanding remarks. It is such a pity that he was restricted to 15 minutes, because I am sure we would have been entertained for a lot longer on his intimate knowledge of his sector. I appreciate his contribution and I support his remarks when it comes to the challenges that small businesses face. My seat of Mayo is a seat, as the member well knows, that is largely a small business focussed seat. Whether it be Mount Barker, Nairn, Strathalbyn, Victor Harbor, Goolwa, Kingscote or Yankalilla, there are thousands of small businesses in my electorate who are doing it tough at the moment. They were eagerly anticipating a budget and a session of parliament where they would see some real commitment to budgetary reform to ensure that their tax burden would be reduced so that they could have money freed up to allow them to get on with their business, employ more Australians and to see the rigid changes made through the Fair Work Australia system-and aren't they proud of that system now-change so that they could employ more Australians and give more Australians a chance at work. But, of course, they were left utterly despondent by what the Treasurer delivered on budget night.",216,Hesta Which Is A Fund With $18 3 Billion Of Superannuation Savings For People Working In
200,Mr Briggs (Mayo) (17:27,"I rise to follow the member for Dunkley and shadowIt is perfectly understandable why they were so despondent. We saw a budget which was a budget of cooked books and very ambitious forecasts-where this government who, over the last four budgets, have delivered massive record deficits are now expecting the Australian people to somehow believe that in this financial year they will be able to turn that around and deliver a massive four per cent reduction in federal government expenditure. No-one accepts that to be true. A budget that has gone from $270 billion expenditure when the current government came to power to some $370 billion or around that mark shows that this government is a government that is spending more money than it takes. It is living beyond its means, which will cause us a problem in the future. You often hear the government say that our debt compared to other countries is nowhere near as bad, that we are in this fortuitous position with low debt in comparison. Households know that you do not compare your own debt situation with your next-door neighbour, you consider what you have to do to make those repayments. What the debt means is that there are large interest payments necessary with that debt, now up to $8 billion a year, which takes away from services and means that Australians pay more tax than necessary to make those repayments and pay back this legacy of Labor debt that we will deal with when we are able to take government. This budget was a massive disappointment. It showed that Labor has no coherent economic strategy to deliver stronger economic growth and a stronger and more productive economy. We have seen in my local area disappointments as well. Genuine needs like the Bald Hills freeway interchange, the additional freeway interchange because of the growth the state Labor government has foisted upon my local area. That was a commitment I made at the last election and I was hoping that in this budget the Treasurer might have appreciated that Mount Barker needs that additional freeway off-ramp. I have been heartened by the commitment from the opposition shadow transport spokesman, who has given me a very positive indication that as part of our commitments leading to the next election it will be, as a member of the ERC, well and truly be costed, as it was in the last election. Mr Perrett interjectingtransport minister will be right on my side in that respect. On the south coast an overwhelming concern in that community is the pool, in the hope that the government and regional development minister Crean would have seen it fit to fund that in this budget. He has not done so. What the Labor Party in government has done, in conjunction with the Greens as their coalition partner, is foist on my community the world's biggest carbon tax which will begin in a month's time. More worryingly for my state of South Australia and for our country is the impact of federal Labor policies on the mining industry. We hear regularly from the Treasurer that there is some $500 billion of investment in the pipeline for Australian mining projects, and that is true. There are plans to invest heavily in Australia. However, what you do not hear from the government is the more recent announcements from very senior companies in large mining companies talking about putting off a large amount of that investment because of the increased costs that federal Labor policies are putting on these mining companies. The very reason the civil war has broken out in the Labor Party over the last five days in relation to the EMAMr Perrett: It has been much more civil than war.",220,Hesta Which Is A Fund With $18 3 Billion Of Superannuation Savings For People Working In
201,Mr Briggs,"I can assure that to the member for Moreton. I know that the shadowwalls of the leadership challenge in February, where character assessments were granted very regularly but it has been quite a split between the Prime Minister and the relevant ministers, the minister for immigration and the minister for resources. Those ministers are to be congratulated because the policy they have pursued is a good policy. It is the right policy because it will encourage this growth. It is necessary and it is a time, and we do have Labor challenges. We saw in question time those members who claim that somehow you can just uplift all unemployed people and chuck them into mines, showing no understanding of how the mining industry works at all. These necessary skills will ensure these developments go ahead and that there is need for these sorts of arrangements. But what is really important to note is that one of the major reasons more of these arrangements are being sought is the increasing cost for companies to employ in Australia. Because of industrial disputation and because of the empowerment of the unions-and we are seeing that day after day now-we are seeing coal mines in Queensland being shut down. There was a massive industrial disputation last week as the CFMEU used every tactic in the book to take on BHP. Tom Albanese, from Rio Tinto, said last week that when he has been at international conferences he has been approached by investors saying, 'Are you worried that you are now too Australiaexposed?' Mr Albanese made the point that that is embarrassing, and he is right. This record opportunity, this amazing opportunity that Australia has-which is probably a 10-year opportunity, with the growth in our region-is being put at risk because of these government policies. Whether it be the workplace relations policies or the inconsistent taxation policies, they are making it harder for Australian businesses and Australian mining companies to compete. More worrying is Olympic Dam in South Australia. For many years, the state Labor government has told us how this investment and expansion will be the great saviour and the great opportunity for our economy, and I actually agree with them. I think this is a huge opportunity for the South Australian economy. It is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the South Australian economy. The Olympic Dam find and the exploration that BHP has embarked upon are of unbelievable proportions. It is one of the biggest mines in the world. When fully dug, the open-cut mine will cover an area the size of the 'square mile' of Adelaide. The six-year burden to get the dirt off before they even get to the ore gives you an understanding of just how big this project is. The South Australian Labor government and the South Australian Liberal opposition last year worked in conjunction in the parliament to pass the indenture to ensure that the government regulations and the environmental regulations were passed. Of course, the Greens opposed it, which will not shock anybody. Necessarily, they did the work in a bipartisan way to ensure that this project would go ahead for South Australia. Now it is being put at risk by what federal Labor is doing to our economy. It is not just me saying this; it is none other than Jac Nasser, the Chairman of BHP -I will not say he is a good old-fashioned Labor man, but certainly he has not been someone you could describe as having been, as the Leader of the House would say, a 'Tory' all his life. In a speech Mr Nasser said that there are four reasons why BHP is now giving reconsideration to possible investment in Australia. Mr Perrett interjecting-",221,Hesta Which Is A Fund With $18 3 Billion Of Superannuation Savings For People Working In
202,Mr Briggs,"It has been a civil war, member for Moreton. It may not be the blood on theMember for Moreton, is implementing. The first is that development activity has driven higher operational and investment costs. We are increasingly one of the higher cost countries in the world, and I understand that in the next little while there will be some more information from the mining industry in that respect. The second reason is the experience of a much more difficult industrial relations environment, and I quote him directly: It has not only affected productivity but has resulted in management being unable to operate its business in a fair and consistent way for all stakeholders. He goes on to describe the industrial disputation that is damaging BHP's coal mines. The third is the changes to taxation arrangements in this country. There is the debate we have had about the mining tax and the ever-changing impact of the mining tax, and, as I mentioned before, the world's biggest carbon tax is just about to start. The fourth reason is, of course, global instability. Mr Perrett interjectinggovernment, but the other three we certainly can. These are issues which can be fixed. The Labor Party likes to pretend that the mining industry in Australia is somehow separate from the rest of the world and that, unlike other industries, it does not have to compete, that it has this one-off advantage. That is simply not true. The way they are treating the mining industry is like putting Fat Albert on Black Caviar to race at Royal Ascot and expecting it to win. That would be holding it back from its potential, just as this Labor government is holding back our mining industry from its potential internationally. It is a competitive market for global mining capital. It is difficult to compete. Our costs in Australia are much higher than they were just five years ago, and that is making it much harder for big companies like BHP, who expend a lot of money in the first place to get the ore out of the ground, to make those decisions. Yes, there may be a lot in the pipeline, but there is a big blockage in the pipeline. That blockage is the federal Labor government. The sooner we can get rid of that blockage and put into place laws which encourage productivity in workplaces and restrict the rights of unions to take industrial action over any matter they are concerned by, and the sooner we have a consistent taxation policy and treat this industry in a fairer way, the more we will encourage investment in this necessary industry. That cannot come too soon, because I fear the impact of federal Labor policies will mean we will see BHP make an announcement later in the year seeking an extension on the indenture for the BHP expansion. That will be a great shame for my state because it will mean that the great opportunities that will come, the trickle-down effects of that investment in that place-3,000 direct jobs and the impact of the flow-through to the economy, the expected eight per cent increase in GST-will not flow through, because of decisions that this government is making. The most insidious part of this budget is that there is no coherent economic plan. It is a budget in which the government is trying to pay off people to increase its primary vote and keep this Prime Minister in office. It is a budget that talks tough about its war on aspiration, yet at the same time there is a little deal with Gina Rinehart on the side, which completely destroys-",222,Hesta Which Is A Fund With $18 3 Billion Of Superannuation Savings For People Working In

It was a real shame to see several Labor members and several senior union officials in what was, by one in particular, quite a hysterical performance last Friday, trying to play very low-grade politics with foreign workers. That will only do damage to our economic reputation internationally. It will reduce the amount of investment that can possibly come into our country and it will damage the prospects for future prosperity for all the Australians we seek to represent. This is a bad budget. It has barely one redeeming feature. This is a bad government. The government should go and give us a go to get Australia back on track. government, which is of course not reflected adequately in the budget papers, is the National Broadband Network. We have seen some remarkable advertising campaigns recently on which the NBN is spending $20 million, we understand, to place advertisements such as that in the Home Hill Observer on 4 April which said to readers that the NBN was coming. Of course when they checked they discovered that it was not going to come to them before at least 2015. The advertising spend is quite heroic. There was $3.659 million spent during a four-week period on the three-year rollout announcement. The average revenue per user of the NBN, we are told by Mr Quigley, is just under $30 a month. If there are 3,700 fibre customers of the NBN, that would suggest that in that month it spent 33 times its fibre revenue on advertising, which is really quite an achievement and one which the NBN should not be proud of. But the thing I want to focus on today in respect of the NBN is a decision of the ACCC only yesterday, a draft determination, a draft decision, to allow the NBN Co. to proceed with its deal with Optus whereby it is paying $800 million to Optus in return for Optus decommissioning its hybrid fibre coax network and migrating its customers to the NBN. This draft determination is a thoroughly unconvincing and contradictory document. Indeed, so unconvincing is the draft determination that one shrewd observer of the NBN saga suggested to me that it was a draft determination designed to be reversed following the period of public consultation. Right now the Optus HFC network, which was built in the 1990s to carry pay TV, passes 2.4 million households in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne, of which 1.4 million are capable of being serviced without any additional investment in the network. Optus has 486,000 individual subscribers on its HFC network, of which 429,000 are broadband subscribers. It is the second largest HFC network in Australia after Telstra's. It is not declared by the ACCC, so Optus has no obligation to make it available to other telcos on a wholesale basis. Just about everywhere else in the world, one of the biggest drivers of investment in very fast broadband, whether it is fibre to the node or fibre to the premises, has been the ability of HFC cable companies to provide broadband and voice services in competition with the traditional copper based telcos. In the United States, for example, it was the competition from cable companies like Comcast and others that caused Verizon to build a fibre-to-the-premises network and AT&T to build a fibre-to-the-node network. While they used different technologies, their competitive objective was exactly the same-to compete with and be on",223,Hesta Which Is A Fund With $18 3 Billion Of Superannuation Savings For People Working In
205,Mr Briggs,"Absolutely, but I did not declare class war on Gina Rinehart either, by the",224,Hesta Which Is A Fund With $18 3 Billion Of Superannuation Savings For People Working In
206,Mr Turnbull (Wentworth) (17:42,"One of the largest financial commitments of thisthe same technological playing field, at least from the customer experience point of view, as the cable companies. In every other country of which I am aware, one of the key objectives of telecommunications policy is to promote facilities based competition, which relevantly means encouraging the HFC cable owners to compete with the telcos. It is a matter of great regretit is a long time ago now, of course-that Telstra was allowed to build an HFC network at all. If Optus had built the sole HFC network, or if a third party had built an HFC network, there would have been facilities based competition along the same lines as in other developed markets to compete with the copper based telco. But here in the socialist paradise of Julia Gillard's Australia the government is building a massive new fixed line telecommunications monopoly and, just in case there would be any competition with it, the government is paying Telstra and Optus to decommission their HFC networks as well as paying Telstra to decommission its copper network. It is difficult, therefore, to think of anything more anti-competitive than a new government owned Telco, the NBN, paying Optus $800 million to shut down the HFC network, which is currently offering high-speed broadband services comparable to those that will eventually be offered by the NBN itself. The ACCC in its draft determination has indicated that it plans to improve these arrangements. Yet, bafflingly, in the course of the draft determination it rejects almost all of the arguments put in favour of this conclusion by the NBN Co. and by Optus. For example, it expressly rejects the NBN Co.'s argument that if the HFC deal is blocked by the ACCC then the rollout of the NBN will be slowed down or diminished. It does not accept the argument that the HFC deal with Optus will improve the NBN Co.'s internal rate of return, which was the justification the government gave for the deal, I might add. It also rejects the argument from NBN Co. that the HFC deal is required in order to deliver the reforms to the Australian telecommunications market initiated by the government-structural separation and so forth. It further rejects the argument that the HFC deal will bring forward the claimed benefits of allegedly enhanced competition in the telecoms market. On the other hand, the ACCC concludes that, if the HFC network does not proceed, 'There is scope for the Optus HFC network to meet consumer demand, predominantly in relation to entry level services.' The ACCC also concludes that the Optus HFC agreement 'has the potential to promote competition and efficiency in fixed line access networks'. It adds about the agreement that 'providing for the decommissioning of an otherwise competing network removes a source of competitive tension, which could deliver improvements in both allocative and dynamic efficiency'. How on earth did the ACCC conclude that the Optus HFC deal should be approved? How could it conclude that an anticompetitive arrangement which has to the best of my knowledge no counterpart anywhere else in the world be acceptable here in Australia? The only substantial benefit from the deal, the ACCC concluded, was that decommissioning the Optus HFC network would 'reduce or avoid inefficient duplication of infrastructure'. This benefit would accrue, of course, only to Optus itself, as it would avoid the cost-so the ACCC concluded-of maintaining and operating its own HFC network. The ACCC writes: The economic cost saving to society from operating one network instead of two networks is the difference between the resource costs of providing services to these customers using the HFC network and the resource costs of providing the same services to these customers using the NBN. But is this a public benefit, or is it really is simply a supposed benefit to Optus? Even if you accept the ACCC's proposition, why does it not offset that benefit to Optus against the $800 million cost incurred by the NBN and the unfortunate Australian taxpayers who are ultimately funding that and many other payments to the NBN? It all seems a very thin argument. It is as though the ACCC has concluded that what is good for Optus is good for the public of Australia. How could this possibly outweigh the obvious diminution in competition? Here the ACCC goes into the realm of heroic assumptions. First it asserts, or assumes, that Optus will not invest in its HFC network to increase its capacity to offer products comparable with the higher speeds available on the NBN-one gigabit per second, for example. Given the rapid pace of disruptive technological change-given the plethora of technological changes which were not only not predicted but also not anticipated-why would anyone assume that this network will not be upgraded in the future? The ability to upgrade copper networks to carry high-speed broadband improves year after year, month after month, as we have seen with the various evolutions of DSL. Why on earth would the ACCC make a heroic assumption like this? Why would it not stick to its charter, preserve competition, let Optus look after its own financial destiny and not constitute itself as a charity for the benefit of Optus, and see what the future brings? Having assumed that the NBN will overbuild the Optus HFC network, the ACCC goes on to assume that Optus or some future owner of its network will not invest to enable it to compete with the NBN. But why would it not do so, given that its capital cost is so much lower than the NBN's capital cost? Optus would be in a very strong position, as is elsewhere acknowledged in the draft determination, to provide broadband services as it is currently doing in the footprint covered by its network. The ACCC assumes that, in the future, consumer demand for high-speed access will exceed that possibly available on the HFC. But who knows? Given that the HFC can be upgraded now to well over 100 megabits per second, given the utter absence of any applications which would require that speed now and given the international experience showing that telcos have been unable to achieve any sort of meaningful premium for very high-speed broadband because of lack of applications, the obvious conclusion is that in the here and now-here in Australia just as in every other comparable market-the HFC network is a powerful competitor with the NBN. If you accept the ACCC's reasoning, then the people running the NBN Co. are commercial morons. If you accept the truth of what the ACCC is saying-that is, if the HFC remains in place, the NBN Co. will overbuild it anyway, Optus will not invest in the NBN to compete with the NBN network and in due course Optus will walk away shedding tears of regret and remorse having lost lots of money in its vain, Don-Quixote-type attempt to compete with the magnificence of the fibre network-why is the NBN Co. giving Optus $800 million? It does not make any sense. This draft determination is so contradictory that the only conclusion you can take from it is that the ACCC believes that the management of the NBN Co. are commercial morons who are recklessly paying $800 million to get something which is going to fall into their lap for nothing anyway. The truth is that, while I do not see eye to eye with the management of the NBN Co. at all times, I do not think they are morons at all-quite the contrary. They are paying that $800 million because they want to eliminate a viable competitor with their own planned network. That is exactly how the government has justified it. The truth is that everywhere in the world HFC cable networks are providing very high-speed broadband and real, effective, commercial competition with fibre-to-the-premises networks, fibre-to-the-node networks and various variations on those two. We have the potential here at least of the Optus network being available to do that-not over all of Australia but over a large percentage of Australia. For the ACCC, which is supposed to be flying the banner of competition and ensuring that monopolies are kept in check, to say, 'No, this deal can go ahead,' is abandoning its charter. It is a draft determination that should be abandoned as well and replaced with a ruling that would be more consistent with its distinguished track record. One item I forgot to mention was that the ACCC comforts itself and the readers of its draft determination by saying, 'The NBN Co. will be regulated.' Let us just be quite clear: the NBN Co. is going to be a massively overcapitalised government monopoly in which the government will have a vested interest ensuring that it can recover some value from. It will recover that value by being able to exploit the commercial strength that it has, and that is precisely why this government is eliminating competition. To put one's faith solely in a government regulating a commercial monopoly against its own commercial interests is naive in the extreme. This draft determination should be consigned to the waste paper bin of competition history and replaced with a ruling that ensures facilities based competition is preserved in Australia. a degree of independence that I perhaps did not have in previous contributions, so I think people should listen much more closely to what I have to say in relation to this particular budget. I want to start by saying that budgets in themselves should not be seen in isolation. This budget needs to be seen as part of a series of budgets that the Labor government has brought in since it was elected in 2007. What is important is to look at the economic conditions that were there when Labor was elected in the good times before the global financial crisis had occurred and look at how the budgets had to alter and adapt to the changing global conditions that the government was faced with during that period of time and look at where they are now in relation to this particular budget. I say with a degree of independence, as I said, that this is a very good budget and it is a very good story that can be told in relation to a succession of Labor budgets. When Labor came into office the cash rate was 6.75 per cent. It is now 3.75 per cent. Inflation was tending towards the high side. There were some comments about the inflation genie being out of the bottle when Labor first came in; it is now around the two per cent mark. The unemployment rate before Labor came in had a four in front of it-and it does again now. So when we look at where Australia was and where Australia is now, we are, on any objective comparison, at least as well off economically as when we were elected. But the great story is how this Labor government charted its way through the global financial crisis-and how, while doing so, it made sure that Australian jobs, Australian families and Australian households were always put first. On the back of a resources boom, the economy was in good shape when we started. But now, compared to any other country in",224,Hesta Which Is A Fund With $18 3 Billion Of Superannuation Savings For People Working In
207,Mr Craig Thomson (Dobell) (17:57,"I come to speak on this appropriation bill with the world and compared to how things were in 2007, the economy is in great shape. The story of successive Labor budgets has been about the skill, the care and the concern shown in making sure that the Australian community got through one of the greatest challenges the world has faced since the Great Depression-and achieving Australia's current sound economic position. Those on the coalition side mock the size of it, but the Labor government is returning the budget to surplus. How can they-how dare they?-mock that when you consider what had to be done? The Labor government had to make sure that there were jobs-jobs in areas like my electorate and the member for Shortland's electorate. Our areas are always among the first affected when unemployment starts to rise. The Labor government had to make sure that families were able to get through those periods when we saw unemployment in Spain reach 20 per cent and when we saw riots right around the world, as countries struggled to come to terms with a global financial crisis. We still see those problems in Europe today and the resulting social dislocation, yet in this country there has been barely a ripple-because of the sound economic leadership of the Labor Party. We made sure this country was able to get through those periods and, at the end of it, we are in a position comparable with the position we were in when we started-low unemployment, low inflation and low interest rates. These are the key things for making sure that families-people living in our communities-are able to continue to do the things they want to do. I will come back and say something else about interest rates at the end of my contribution, but now I will talk about the sorts of things these budgets have enabled in my electorate. We have been able, in some cases for the very first time, to make really good investments in infrastructure and the environment. Tuggerah Lakes, one of the most beautiful places in Australia, was able to take advantage of the Caring for our Country program. The first investment from Caring for our Country was a $20 million grant to Tuggerah Lakes. The 2012-13 budget has continued this program, allocating another $2.2 billion for the period 2013 through to 2017. Caring for our Country has been a tremendous program and the Tuggerah Lakes project in my electorate has been superbly managed by Wyong Shire Council. It is not always the case that a federal politician can come in here and say what a good job their local council has done in managing money, but Wyong Shire Council did such a good job in managing their $20 million that they actually returned some money. I do not think many councils have ever said: 'We have underspent. Here you go; here is a couple of million dollars you can have back.' But that is in fact what Wyong Shire Council did. It is, again, a measure of this government that we said, 'Let's do some more work. There is more work to be done and we will re-allocate that money.' So congratulations to Wyong Shire Council. We have been able to start construction at Tuggerah on a $10 million centre of sports excellence, the home of the mighty Central Coast Mariners, the most successful team in the A-League competition. It is a great community asset with swimming pools and a medical centre. It is a superb asset that is much needed in the Tuggerah area-and it was the Labor government that put it in place. One of the things that those in the coalition always complain about, and their foot soldiers on the Central Coast have picked up this same mantra, is the GP Super Clinics. The GP Super Clinic that is close to being completed in my electorate has been nothing but an outstanding success from the moment it was announced. Ms Saffin: So has mine in Grafton. success of her GP Super Clinic in Grafton. The reason for this is that ours opened immediately, not in its permanent home-that had to be built. They set up a temporary home and we were seeing 2,000 patients within a couple of months. The area in which it was placed, around Warnervale, is one where there has been long-term doctor shortages. Doctors' books are closed and people cannot get into doctors. They end up going to Wyong Hospital, the fourth busiest emergency department in New South Wales. This has had a real effect on the community. During the 2010 election people would come up to me when I was campaigning and say, 'This is something that we think is really worthwhile locally.' They were referring to the GP Super Clinic. For those opposite to continually go on about how inefficient they are and that they are not open, and so forth, belies the fact of their success, and certainly the success of the one there on the Central Coast. The Mardi to Mangrove pipeline, the most important piece of infrastructure promised on the Central Coast some years ago, has just been completed. This pipeline guaranteed that the Central Coast's water supply was forever safe. We got to a situation where our water supply was down to about 10 per cent. We were running out of water, quite literally. We are an area where it is anticipated that there will be an additional 80,000 residents in the next 15 years. We did not have the water for this. It was the Labor government that stepped up to the plate. It was the Labor government that said: 'This is vital infrastructure that is needed for this community.' We built this pipeline. We have the situation now where the storage dam is close to 50 per cent full. Within five years it will be totally full. That will be the first time ever the dam will have been full since it was built. It is because of the foresight of this government in making sure that they were able to invest in infrastructure. One of the great things about the Central Coast, at the moment and for the last 20 years, is the University of Newcastle's Central Coast campus at Ourimbah. We are an area that has one of the lowest levels of kids going on to higher education, an area that has over 320,000 people living in it. The University of Newcastle's Central Coast campus at Ourimbah ensures that local kids have an option to go to higher education. It was not this government that build the university, but it was a previous Labor government that built it. It was founded under the Hawke government. Without a Labor government there would be no university. In the last three years we have spent $40 million on that campus, rebuilding the library, building new nursing education areas and new sports and science exercise areas. And 96 per cent of the students who go to this campus are from the Central Coast. Previously they had to commute up to Newcastle or down to Sydney. It was difficult. Many kids dropped out and many would not even take up the option. We are now seeing much higher levels of kids going on to get tertiary qualifications, because of a Labor investment under a Labor philosophy, which is to invest in education to give as many kids an equal chance of a good life. And, can I say, there has been no greater example of that than, during the global financial crisis, the massive investment in schools-the biggest investment since Federation. In my electorate alone over $100 million has been spent on our schools, and $13 million for trade training centres, which has seen tremendous opportunities for our schools. Many of these schools would never have got the infrastructure that is now there. It always seems to be those areas",227,Hesta Which Is A Fund With $18 3 Billion Of Superannuation Savings For People Working In
208,Mr Craig Thomson,"Absolutely. I hear the member for Page talking about thewith lower-socioeconomic issues that miss out, but not under this Labor government, not during the time of the global financial crisis-this was when there was the investment. Only the other week I was at Wadalba Community School and was able to look in at how this Labor government's Local Solutions program is working. Wyong council was one of the 10 areas around Australia that is benefiting from this. I sat in on a class where there were half a dozen teenage mums, who were there being taught, doing their schooling with their babies being looked after next door in a childcare centre on the school campus. This was a very important solution. These kids were not going to get through high school. They quite simply could not before this program, because they had young kids to look after; but the Local Solutions program aims at making sure in particular that young women get the opportunity in areas like mine to get an education, to go on and have the opportunity to get good employment. This was a terrific example of a pilot program that is working. Our Local Solutions committees are coming up with terrific local solutions to our particular unemployment problems. I wanted to finish by going back to interest rates and the cost of housing and mortgages. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 18:12 to 18:21 and interest rates. One of the things that governments and oppositions need to look at is what has changed in the last 20 years. Interest rates are now lower than they were when we came to government but interest rates alone are not the measure of how hard people are doing it in terms of paying back their mortgages. We have seen a massive increase in the size of mortgages. Governments need to look at supply side issues and the release of land. We need to make sure that there is more land available. It is the size of mortgages that is making things difficult for families, not just interest rates. This has been a good budget in a series of good budgets that have made Australia a better, safer and more cohesive place than it was before these budgets were handed down. I commend these bills to the House. independence. I am of the thought that maybe a leopard does not change its spots very quickly following his rather lavish praise of the government's budget. Budget 2012 is a sleight of hand. It is a fudging of numbers. Is it the best possible spin or just a plain pea and thimble trick? Virtually no Australian believes that this government will deliver on the Treasurer's promised surplus. The news that the government intends to yet again raise the Commonwealth borrowing limits from $250 billion to $300 billion-up from the $75 billion in place when they came to power 4½ years ago-is a clear indication Wayne Swan, the Treasurer, has little faith in his budget predictions. Why would the government, after all, need to raise the borrowing limit if in 12 months time it expects to owe less money than now? The attempts to justify the action by explaining the $50 billion as extra bumps is simply not believable and an admission that he has little faith in the budget projections. Almost half of the budget surplus has been manufactured by shifting billions of dollars of spending from one year to another and deferring longer term commitments. And it still does not include the NBN billions or the $10 billion green energy fund. I have just spoken to a school today who could not understand why the commitment to round 5 of the trade training",229,Hesta Which Is A Fund With $18 3 Billion Of Superannuation Savings For People Working In
209,Mr Craig Thomson,I would like to finish by talking about the size of mortgages,230,Hesta Which Is A Fund With $18 3 Billion Of Superannuation Savings For People Working In
210,Mr Ramsey (Grey) (18:22,"I must reflect on the member for Dobell's new foundcentres was being pushed out. I said it was simply the budget numbers pushing the money into the next year. The current year's budget has now blown out to $44 billion from $22 billion, and the accumulated losses since Labor came to power are now in excess of $170 billion. During the coming year, Australians can expect the government to spend $8 billion of their money on interest on the borrowings. That is about $1 a day for every man, woman and child. The question must be asked what Australia has got for this massive increase in debt. What have we built with the $215 billion turnaround in the government position in the last four years? It was incredibly disappointing to hear Ken Henry's views a few weeks ago on the ABC program 7.30, in which he said that although there is a temptation to think that it would be highly desirable to have something concrete, maybe even literally concrete, to show for your fiscal stimulus long after the crisis is past-an infrastructure project, for example-that is almost impossible to roll out in a timely fashion. I am not an economist like Dr Henry, but I am a bit thingy about taxpayers' money and I strongly disagree. Surely if it was so important that we spend money, we should have taken the opportunity to buy something worthwhile: productive assets which would have in turn generated more jobs, more cash flow, more profits and more taxes in the long term. Instead of lethal roof insulation costing more to pull out than put in, instead of a green loan experiment which had to be abandoned, instead of $900 cheques to dead people and pets, and instead of school halls costing twice their worth, perhaps we should have built ports to allow development of our assets or high-voltage electricity lines to enable renewable energy generators to link and provide backup. Perhaps we should have built new dams, roads and rail-projects which would have pumped money into the economy and returned a long-term lift in our productive capacity and an improved capacity to help repay the debt. As a farmer, I always knew there was good debt and bad debt. Good debt improves your ability to generate a return. Bad debt does not. A new car, a boat, a holiday or even a bigger house do not, while more land and more efficient plant and grain storage capacity do. They are investments that grow the pie. Unfortunately, the stimulus package bought too many cars, boats, holidays and house extensions and now Australian taxpayers have to pay back the borrowings on their old pay packets. Regional Australia appears to be forgotten in this budget, with many more minuses than pluses. Road funding, the lifeblood of our regional communities, has been cut by more than $3.6 billion despite the government legislating to raise an extra $166 million a year from the trucking industry in increased fuel taxes. The $23-a-tonne carbon tax was barely mentioned in the budget and now, just weeks away from commencement and with the world's next-highest price of carbon just one-third of ours, the sheer folly of Australia's 'go it alone' policy on CO2 emissions is starting to sink in. The tax is set to become a reverse tariff, operating to disadvantage Australian industries and giving a free kick to overseas manufacturers. The public anger over the carbon tax explains why the government has reverted to cash handouts to try to buy off the voters. Like the $12 billion wasted in cash payments on $900 cheques, this cash handout will be repaid by the taxpayer with interest. There are just three ways to fix the structural deficit: cut expenditure, raise taxes or grow the economy, which in turn will produce higher revenues. Wayne Swan's budget does not cut real expenditure, it raises huge new taxes, and that action will in turn reduce productivity. The coalition will focus on a different path. We are committed to doing the hard yards by cutting expenditure and removing the new carbon tax and mining tax. Coupled with a detailed plan to cut red tape and compliance for businesses, this will lead to greater productivity growth, effectively growing a bigger pie. Small business, the engine room of the Australian economy, has been abandoned and the promised tax cut is gone. The carbon tax delivers higher costs for everything, and Fair Work regulations are strangling any business operating on weekends and holidays. One of the problems the government has is their original justification for the stimulus spending. It was to be a 'one-off shot in the arm' but they cannot say no, just like being a bad parent. In 2007, total government spending was $270 billion a year. This year it is planned-and remember we have had a few blow-outs in recent years-to be $370 billion. That is $100 billion extra, but the stimulus is over. The extra $100 billion has been cemented into the budget floor. The government insults the electorate. The electorate can see through the game and they know that eventually they will pick up the bill, with interest. The government continues to talk up its investment in infrastructure, and certainly the demands of the economy it is attempting to restructure are strong. There are a wide range of resource projects proposed for the electorate of Grey and no shortage of projects, which have a great opportunity to contribute to the real wealth of the nation. Transport is at the top of the list, with three proposals to build new ports at Whyalla, Sheep Hill, Myponie Point and another-a longoverdue upgrade at the Thevenard Port on western Eyre Peninsula. There is also considerable interest in upgrading the Port Pirie facility to allow a barging operation to be established to shift high bulk commodities on Cape class vessels. Certainly not all will be successful, but the frustration with the lack of facilities available to shift large-tonnage ships is growing. As an example of this frustration, Ironclad has announced its intention to establish a barging operation for iron ore at Lucky Bay on Spencer Gulf working from an enlarged passenger ferry terminal. This is undoubtedly a high-cost, high-investment way of getting iron ore out of the state, when in fact we would be far better served with a decent deep sea port. There is a high chance in the current environment that, without some encouragement or guidance from government, suboptimal investments will be made. South Australia is hanging on the news that BHP will give the green light to the huge Roxby Downs expansion. Recent speeches by Chairman Jac Nasser and CEO Marius Kloppers have raised enough doubts about a possible positive announcement to cause clear concern. There is criticism of the sovereign risk introduced by the current government, and it is a warning sign for all who think the resources sector is so strong that it does not matter how much they are taxed in the end they will suck it up and wear the damage. It simply is not true. The informed in our communities know that competition for development capital is world wide. New carbon and mining taxes and increasing industrial action under the protection of Julia Gillard's Fair Work bills are combining to cause resource investors to reassess risk in Australia and the long-term profitability of our nation. If BHP decide to defer or cancel what would be the single biggest investment ever in South Australia, we will have to look no further than the federal government for the cause. If BHP defer or cancel, it is likely to also lead to a number of other projects being reassessed. The stakes are very high, particularly in South Australia, and more particularly in my electorate. However, should the projects be given approval it will present great challenges. Highway 1, which leads to Port Augusta and the gulf crossing, is likely to quickly become a bottleneck, with the added risk of a single crossing point increasing the risks for Port Augusta and the flow of freight generally. An early move on a second crossing would be a good place to start. I have raised this issue with the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government, Simon Crean. It is not the job of national governments to bail out inefficient, wasteful and incompetent state governments, but it would be remiss of me if I did not mention the backlog of work outstanding on the state road network. Three years ago the RAA estimated that $200 million was needed immediately to fix up the roads. Nothing has been done in that time, Madam Deputy Speaker; I am sure you are quite aware of that. It is a continual drain on the capacity of regional South Australia to actually reach the commitments, to raise money and expand businesses, that governments expect. I hope something is going to change in that space in the very near future. There is considerable interest around the electorate in expanding airport capacity so that country towns can enjoy and participate in the fly-in fly-out industry. Having watched the Four Corners report last night on the fly-in fly-out industry-and I am accompanied here by the member for Durack, who knows it well-while we recognise that there are many drawbacks for local communities, it seems that in some form or another we are going to have to live within that space. I am very concerned for South Australia should some of those projects go ahead-and I realise there is a bit of cloud hanging over their heads at the moment. We should be able to harvest the benefits in South Australia. But with current policies it is likely that we will see fly-in fly-out operations out of the eastern seaboard cities coming directly into places like Prominent Hill-in fact, they have just started direct flights to Melbourne-and Roxby Downs, and South Australia will be largely bypassed by the industry. As the member for Grey, where most of the resources of the state are, I think that is a great disappointment, and it behoves us to encourage mining companies to invest on the ground and grow the towns and villages where these mines are. I accept that, if you want to have a mining operation near Moomba, for instance, where Santos have a significant investment, it is unrealistic to build a new town. But if you are going to have a mining operation alongside a town like Wudinna, Port Lincoln or Kimba, the town I come from-where in fact there is an investment at the moment-I strongly encourage the mining companies to invest in those towns and base their workforce in those communities. In the end, it is a better result for the company, for the local community and for the Australian community generally. As you would know, Madam Deputy Speaker, there is much conjecture about the impact of fly-in fly-out work on families. When we run the dry economic line on how we actually fund a resources boom and how we staff mines, we do not necessarily take into account the social impact on families-the very high divorce rates, for example, and the involvement of the Family Court to get decisions on who is going to bring up the children. Sometimes there are many family arrangements when people roll from one relationship to the next. That is one of the side effects of the fly-in fly-out industry. I encourage those mining companies to look closely at where they are investing and where possible support their local communities. 5 and 6 of 2012-13, which are being debated concurrently. I rise to speak on these bills, not",230,Hesta Which Is A Fund With $18 3 Billion Of Superannuation Savings For People Working In
211,Mr Haase (Durack) (18:35,"I rise this evening to speak on appropriation bills Nos 1, 2,with pleasure but, rather, with a great deal of disappointment-disappointment for the manner in which this government is failing this great nation we call home; disappointment for the lack of integrity shown by this Labor-led, Green-endorsed government. This big-spending, hightaxing government belittles the intelligence of the Australian taxpayer. Just 12 months ago I stood before the House, weary of fixing successive Labor government financial blunders. I was sick of listening to their rhetoric. I was tired of witnessing the Liberal Party leaving Australia in a position where a financial future was assured for our children only to have that secure financial position trashed every time Labor claimed power. Nothing in the past 12 months has altered my opinions. In the past 12 months this parliament has seen the once highly regarded position of Prime Minister tarnished. We have seen the position of Speaker of the House of Representatives brought into disrepute. We have witnessed the demise of our international reputation as a lowsovereign-risk destination. We have seen our once strong border protection policies further dismantled, giving way to thousands of economic opportunists arriving on our shores. A number of pastoralists have lost their livelihoods and others are still struggling to recover from the financial setback dealt to them with the abrupt halt to live exports. Good governance is being destroyed by the rise of vocal minorities. The Greens' 'same-sex marriage' debate is a perfect example of topics being thrown up to distract the government from their focus on the more serious subjects of national importance this government ought be encouraging. This past year has, however, has seen great consistency in the government's approach and attitude towards financial matters. They are still wasting money and still introducing new taxes. In fact, this budget includes six new tax hikes, including increases to heavy vehicle road user charges and reduced tax offsets for families with high medical bills, bringing the total number of new or increased taxes the Rudd-Gillard government has delivered since 2007 to 26. This government is teetering on the precipice of extinction and it seems it has vowed, behind closed doors, to take the country with it. Rather than leaving with an intact reputation when the Australian voting public make their stand against it at the next election, this deceitful government will take with it the legacy of a dishonest and unethical government-a government that has sold out Australians, a government that breaks promises, wastes our money, lies and dabbles in dirty deals behind closed doors. Labor's cumulative record deficits of $174 billion and continued unsustainable borrowing of $100 million a day is destroying the very heart of Australia. Western Australia, and Durack in particular, is the powerhouse of the nation. We are far more financially independent than other states and the eastern states treasury see us as a volcano of gold. Western Australia is doing very well at the moment and, rather than rewarding our state, the government is hell bent on penalising us. The minerals resource rent tax, due to commence on 1 July 2012, is a federal tax on the state of Western Australia. State royalties are the traditional vehicle for the compensation of the people of Western Australia, the owners of Western Australia's resource deposits, and the federal government has no place in envying Western Australia and getting its grubby hands on those royalties via the MRRT. The 2012-13 federal budget has not an ounce of credibility. This budget is all about cooked books, the minerals resources rent tax, its evil twin the carbon tax, and more debt. Like an amateur magician, the government has used sleight of hand and resorted to accounting trickery and money shuffling to manufacture the appearance of a budget surplus of $1.5 billion in 2012-13. This budget is all about addressing a political problem-buying the votes and silence of the Australian public; it has nothing to do with sound economic management. There is not a shred of evidence to imply good budgeting policies. The government has lost sight of its desire to improve the lives of Australians, and along the way it has lost the support of its core support base. Some 70 years ago, Sir Robert Menzies delivered his 'forgotten people' broadcast. Sir Robert's commitment to the forgotten people became the foundation of the Liberal Party and the strength of modern Australia. The forgotten people, according to Sir Robert, were the growing middle class, the people who would be the 'backbone of this country'. Sir Robert, all those years ago, made the following profound statement: In a country like Australia the class war must always be a false war. We, as Liberals, continue Sir Robert's vision, we do not support politics of envy or class war, or policies that seek to penalise Australia's forgotten families. We on this side of the House have never lost sight of the aspirations of our core support base. We believe Australians who work hard should be encouraged and not penalised. We also believe in keeping our word, unlike the current government, which always talks the talk but never walks the walk. The government was given-by default, I might add-the right to govern. It must now accept the responsibility that goes with that right. Responsibility must be taken for the 2011-12 budget deficit-a deficit which has now blown out not once, not twice, but three times. Yes, that is right: the 2011-12 budget has blown out three times from $12 billion to $23 billion projected, to $37 billion and now to $44 billion dollars, and the financial year is not yet over. Now, 12 months on, we are expected to believe that a surplus of a puny $1.5 billion will be delivered-estimated by the same government that got it wrong by $32 billion in the last year. The government is witnessing the fastest growth in revenue since the mid 1980s, yet it has managed to achieve record levels of government debt and is spending $100 billion more per year compared to when it came to office. This represents an almost 40 per cent increase over a time when inflation has risen by 13.2 per cent. A closer look at Appropriation Bill (No.2) 2012-2013 shows that this bill contains a proposal to amend the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act 1911 to increase the limit on the face value of stock and securities-that is, debt that can be issued under the Treasurer's standing borrowing authority or debt ceiling. The amendment proposes to increase the existing debt ceiling from $250 billion to $300 billion. If this government truly believed their own rhetoric, truly believed in what their well-oiled statements released to the media say, if they truly believed what they themselves spruik about a budget surplus in 2012-13, why would they bury the proposal to increase the Australian credit card limit in Appropriation Bill (No.2)? Is it to avoid proper scrutiny and a specific vote on the debt limit or is it because they are embarrassed that government debt is at an unprecedented level? Why, during the fanfare, pomp and ceremony of the announcement of the proposed, yet, I am quite sure, fantasy budget surplus did the Treasurer not even mention the plan to raise the debt limit? Such is the Treasurer's flippant regard for the Australian taxpayers' money, when asked why he needed to lift the debt limit if he was returning the budget to surplus, Mr Swan responded: Well, very simply, this is no big deal. I stand before this House representing the people of Durack, and we say it is a big deal. There is currently about $227.4 billion worth of Commonwealth bonds on issuance, about $221 billion of which is factored towards the current $250 billion debt ceiling. The government's plan to increase the ceiling to $300 billion at first glance does not gel with its claim of returning the budget to surplus in 2012-13 and of reducing expenditure and debt. The carbon tax due to commence on 1 July 2012-the very same tax the current Prime Minister said five days before the last election would not be introduced under a government she led-is generating chaos in industry and panic in the minds of mums and dads all over Australia. The families in the City of Greater Geraldton and within the Shire of Broome are worried they will suffer yet another hit from this government after the Clean Energy Regulator-or the carbon cop officials-recently named these communities as being on a list of entities that may be liable to pay the carbon tax. Australians were always going to suffer the consequences of the carbon tax with rising electricity and gas prices. Now, in addition to those costs pushing up the price of everything, ratepayers in parts of Durack may be hit again because their council owns or uses a dump or landfill facility. Given the government itself has forecast that even under its carbon tax Australia's greenhouse gas emissions will increase from 578 million tonnes in 2012 to 621 million tonnes in 2020, one wonders at the logic behind this carbon tax. The 2012-13 budget papers confirm that, despite falling international prices, Labor's toxic tax will go up to $29 a tonne in just three years and an additional $36 million will be spent on taxpayer-funded carbon tax advertising over the next two years-advertisements that do not mention the carbon tax but instead tout cash handouts in a feeble attempt to disassociate the tax from the true financial pain. These handouts are a bribe and should be seen for what they are-a floundering government's endeavour to buy the Australian public's silence and thereafter their vote. This government has replaced the education tax refund with a schoolkids bonus, increasing total welfare payments, including the schoolkids bonus and the extra family welfare, by $4.8 billion. This welfare bonus has nothing to do with the cost of sending children to school but everything to do with softening the blow for the parents of school-aged children when the carbon tax arrives. There are no requirements for this rebadged education tax rebate to be spent on kids' education. This bonus is another grab for votes. The already overstretched and under resourced Customs and Border Protection Service has had a budget cut of $25.9 million and 190 staff from Customs have lost their jobs, bringing a total cut since Labor came to power of $264.5 million and 750 jobs. Our already porous borders will be further susceptible to the smuggling of people, guns, drugs and other contraband, let alone the unknown risks and cost to this nation from the absence of quarantine services. Part of our border protection systems includes defence forces, yet the defence budget has also suffered with cuts to the tune of $5.5 billion. Net government debt will climb to a record $144.9 billion in 2013-14. That is an increase of almost $40 billion since last year's budget and by 2015-16 the government will be spending over $8 billion a year, or around $22 million a day, on interest payments alone. I am sure all Australians would prefer their money was spent on health, education, disability insurance and roads rather than on an interest bill of $8 billion. This government has handed down a big-taxing, big-spending budget. This budget does nothing but confirm the Labor Party has no plan or desire to build a stronger economy, repay debt or create secure jobs. There is no rigor shown in relation to welfare and responsibility. This government cannot continue to reward people for merely existing. This is a budget with no regard for Australia's financial future; rather, it is a budget delivered by a government trying to claw back votes before the next federal election. Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2012-2013 and related bills and to speak, in particular, on this government's approach to school education. Budgets are the ultimate test for governments to demonstrate how committed they really are to reform. This is Labor's first budget since the Review of Funding for Schooling, chaired by David Gonski, was handed down in February 2012. There has been a very long wait for this highly anticipated review. First, I will reflect for a few moments on Labor's school funding policy-or, should I say, lack thereof-leading up to this report's release. The Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, in her speech to the Sydney Institute in April 2010, when she was education minister, promised to announce the new funding model by 2011, well before the 2013-16 agreement was due. We are now halfway through 2012 and are still none the wiser about what school funding model is official Labor Party policy. It must be remembered that this review was originally promised by the ALP in 2007. At that time, Labor indicated that it would retain the former coalition government's funding model for nongovernment schools for a further four years, in order to give schools certainty. The real reason this review was promised is that Labor knew that, in order to win the 2007 election, it could not again take forward its devastating 2004 policy of cutting funding to non-government schools. The Latham policy, co-authored with the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Jenny Macklin, is now commonly referred to as the hit list policy for nongovernment schools. The list would have resulted in 67 schools losing funding and is one of the policies blamed for Labor's election loss in 2004. The coalition opposed this policy because we believe that school funding must be about striving for a quality education for all, not about the politics of envy and robbing Peter to pay Paul. Mark Latham may no longer be in the picture, but the legacy of his school's hit list continues to haunt Labor. It has not as a party had a clear policy on school funding since the 2004 election loss. In April 2010, the then Minister for Education, Julia Gillard, announced the commencement of the review and the establishment of the panel. Around that time, when it came to talking about its school funding policy, we started to hear the government using weasel words such as 'no school will lose a dollar following the review'. These false assurances do not fool anyone in the non-government school sector. What the government refuses to say is that no non-government school will lose a dollar of funding in real terms, a recognition that the real value of the dollar goes down as the costs of goods and services rise. Labor then tried to sneak through the 2010 election without a school-funding policy, again suggesting that it would await the conclusions of the review. It is worth noting that, during the last election, the then new Minister for Education, Simon Crean, refused initially to guarantee that no school would lose a dollar in real terms. Realising that this commitment was not made in real terms, the non-government school sector promptly wrote to Julia Gillard, near the end of the election campaign, seeking a clear commitment that funding would rise in real terms and not be frozen. Finally, at the eleventh hour, the Prime Minister committed to extending",233,Hesta Which Is A Fund With $18 3 Billion Of Superannuation Savings For People Working In
212,Mr Pyne (Sturt,"Manager of Opposition Business) (18:50): I rise to speak on the current funding model for non-government schools until the end of 2013, to avoid a fight with the non-government school sector over schools policy. Now the wait is over. The review has been handed down and Labor has run out of excuses not to have a clear school funding policy. The Gonski panel has proposed a national approach to the school funding system and recommended that a new school resource standard be introduced in 2014. The panel has suggested that that would cost up to $5 billion per year extra beyond current funding from all levels of government in 2009 dollars. It has been suggested that the Commonwealth meet 30 per cent of the cost with the remaining 70 per cent to come from state and territory governments. Planning a school funding model around this Gonski review would, over 12 years, cost an extra $113 billion of new funding in real terms. Planning a school funding model around that $113 billion would be like my family planning on running their household budget relying on winning Powerball on Thursday night. It simply is not realistic. The 2012-13 budget continues funding for school education with only very minor changes. There is no new money in the budget reflecting the Commonwealth's commitment to implement this model by 2014. There is no doubt that Labor's approach to the Gonski review is very different to the one taken in response to the review of funding of higher education, otherwise known as the Bradley review. The Bradley review was released in December 2008 and the government provided an interim response in March 2009. When at budget time in May we saw a $5.4 billion commitment announced in response to that review, a series of new measures were announced over the forward estimates needed to transition to the student demand-driven system-that is, the uncapping of student places by 2012. A suite of legislative changes was introduced and subsequently passed by the parliament. In contrast, the government's response to Gonski has been very untidy and has created a great deal of uncertainty in the sector. The Gonski review was released in December 2011 and the government provided an interim response in February 2012. But there is notably no new money in response to the review and none of the new measures needed to transition to the school resource standard by 2014 are planned over the forward estimates. All that has been allocated is just $5 million-a paltry $5 million-for further research and technical work relating to the Gonski model. The Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, Peter Garrett, keeps suggesting the government will legislate this year, yet nobody is clear on just what it is he is planning to legislate, given there is no new money. The government's decision not to respond to the Gonski review recommendations in the budget has been rightly criticised by some school education sector representatives, such as the Australian Education Union, and now two of the Gonski panel members. Yet, despite the grumbles that in this budget we have seen no new money and no response to the review, somehow schools are under the false impression that extra funding will start flowing from 2014. We need to be very clear about this. If there is no new money there is no model. Other more measured responses from some areas in the school sector are calling now on the government to extend the former coalition's socioeconomic status funding model yet again. This call has been made only very recently, as new modelling released by the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations only last week confirmed that, while some schools may benefit under a new model, there are a multitude of non-government schools that will lose funding, in fact 210 independent schools alone, not accounting for Catholic schools, Christian schools or others. This situation puts the government in a very difficult position. As the minister for school education has suggested, the government has promised that no school will lose a dollar. So it is clear that to deliver upon that commitment, the Gonski model cannot be implemented in its current theoretical form. The government will also be reluctant to extend the coalition's funding model yet again. This is because the ALP's party policy, as agreed last year at its 46th national conference, suggests that Labor has deemed the Howard government's model as flawed and inequitable. If they extend and retain the current funding model, it would mean that they would have kept the model that they hate and that they have regarded and described as an abomination for at least as long as the coalition were in power. The Australian Greens also released a policy paper just prior to the release of the Gonski review suggesting that they will not support the continuation of the current funding model any longer. So Labor's school funding policy is turning rapidly into a mess. What will they do, Madam Deputy Speaker? Your guess really is as good as mine. The coalition, on the other hand, has a very clear school funding policy, as we know that schools need certainty. While recognising that there are some areas of the school sector that support some of the Gonski review recommendations, with some suggesting it is a great piece of theoretical work, it is also clear that no state government has the spare cash needed for it to become a reality in its current form. We do support the panel's recommendations around funding for students with a disability, a policy area I believe is in desperate need of reform that simply cannot be delayed any longer. The coalition has also flagged a number of concerns and unanswered questions about the Gonski review that we will need answers to as we further consider the theoretical model proposed in the review. These relate mainly to the fine detail that in essence makes the model, such as the methodology, the data used to determine funding and the increases to the federal bureaucracy. In the absence of governments agreeing to the additional $5 billion in 2009 terms suggested by the Gonski panel, we stand by the current funding model. This means that schools know that under our policy their funding would be maintained in real terms that would see funding rise on average about six per cent a year. This commitment extends to all non-government schools that rely upon the majority of their funding coming from the Commonwealth to supplement that raised in private income through fees. Our commitment also extends to the supplementary funding that goes from the Commonwealth to the state and territory governments in the form of specific-purpose payments, which sees government schools receive an additional 10 per cent of the average government school recurrent coststhat is, the cost of educating a student in the government school sector. We have also committed to establishing a capital infrastructure fund for schools once the budget is returned to a real surplus. The Gillard government has made no such commitment. We are also committed to addressing the inequity in funding arrangements for students with a disability over time. The Gillard government has made no such commitment. We also have plans to undertake reform to lift school improvement across the board by focusing on the areas of policy that are known to lift student performance, such as teacher quality, school and principal autonomy, a robust curriculum and parental engagement. To conclude, I want to leave you with a quote from economist John Quiggin on this year's education budget. John Quiggin is not known to be a conservative or coalition-leaning commentator. He wrote: The really blatant piece of spin is the claim that the government is almost doubling the Commonwealth investment in schooling. On the face of it, this claim is directly contradicted by the budget papers. Schools expenditure was $10.7 billion in 2008-09 and is projected to be $12.9 billion in 2012-13, rising to $14.5 billion in 2014-15. That's a real increase of around 20% over six years, which would be just about enough to cover growth in student numbers and modest increases in real wages for teachers and other school staff. It turns out that the claim has been justified by comparing schools' spending for the four years from 2009 to 2013 with the four years from 2005 to 2008, and including the stimulus spending under the Building Education Revolution for the later period. Using the same basis of calculation, the government is actually cutting schools spending from a peak of $25 billion in 2009-10 to $15 billion in 2014-15. So we can see in fact, by using Labor's own calculations upon which they have built the claim they have doubled school spending, that the budget actually reveals that Labor are making the largest single cut to education in Australia's history. From 2009-10 to 2014-15 they will slash $10 billion from education. If they continue to perpetuate the myth that they have doubled education spending, then surely they must also be prepared to accept that they are presiding over the biggest single education cut in Australia's history. And that is the great hoax of the education budget-that the minister for schools and the Prime Minister continue to convince members of the Labor caucus that in fact they are increasing spending on education when the truth of it is, on John Quiggin's own analysis-not a supporter or a friend of the coalitionMr Entsch interjectingpoints out. But, on Professor Quiggin's own analysis, the government is cutting spending on education by $10 billion. So members of the Labor caucus, who were told today to go into schools and sell the carbon tax-which I imagine is quite hard to sell-who take up the Prime Minister's clarion call should also level with schools when they are there and explain to them that they have cut education spending by $10 billion in this budget. contribution from the member for Sturt. I watched with interest the announcement of the 2012-13 budget, and it was sorely disappointing. For my electorate of Leichhardt, this budget is yet another blow to growth, another blow to tourism, another blow to economic enterprise and another blow to small business owners. For too many years, Leichhardt has missed out on funding and investment opportunities-they have bypassed us-and projects have stagnated to the point where my constituents sometimes wonder whether they are considered part of this wonderful country at all. Members would have heard me speak time and again about the Torres Strait Islander communities who yet again face inundation by the king tides, with no money to rebuild the seawalls that protect their small islands. The Bruce Highway south of Cairns is renowned for being an accident black spot. The state government has now committed $1 billion for the upgrade, but how many more people have to die before the federal government comes to the party? On the 80-20 split, one would have expected at least a $4 billion contribution, given that the state has already made its commitment well and truly known. The renowned tourism town of Port Douglas is now just a shadow of its former self. It needs critical investment in public infrastructure to regain its status as a jewel of the north, but yet again it misses out on federal money.",237,Hesta Which Is A Fund With $18 3 Billion Of Superannuation Savings For People Working In
213,Mr Pyne,"He is not known to be a friend of the coalition, as the Chief Opposition Whip",240,Hesta Which Is A Fund With $18 3 Billion Of Superannuation Savings For People Working In
214,Mr Entsch (Leichhardt,"Chief Opposition Whip) (19:06): What an outstandingIn the Torres Strait, the tuberculosis clinics on Saibai and Boigu islands are unmanned and underfunded. In Cairns, cruise ships carrying 2,000 passengers at a time bypass the port because Trinity Inlet is too shallow and too narrow, costing the town millions of dollars every year. While the new state government, an LNP state government, has committed $40 million to dredging it again, the federal government has failed to even recognise the need for, let alone commit to, funding. Finally, the effect of the budget is evident among the most vulnerable people suffering in our community-those needing aged care or rehabilitation from drug and alcohol addictions. Funding shortfalls mean that services such as the Rose Colless Haven in Mareeba, and Lyons House and Douglas House in Cairns, have closed down. This leaves a huge void in our region, and there is no funding at all to re-establish those services. Marj Norris from Mossman District Nursing Home Inc. continues a 15-year campaign to build a much-needed aged-care facility in that region, yet those pleas continue to go unheard. I have so many concerns about this budget, but the biggest has to be the impact on the tourism industry in my electorate. It is certainly the backbone of our economy, and a series of blows at a time when we are focused on trying to move out of the slump has seen business after business close in our region. On Sunday, a very popular restaurant in Port Douglas, Bistro 3, became insolvent, just days after well-known retailer Something Tropical was forced to close its doors at four outlets in Port Douglas. This budget will deliver the world's biggest carbon tax, and the tourism industry will be among those hardest hit. The increases in fuel prices will hit those small businesses hard. Fuel is one of the biggest expenses for companies offering coach tours to the Daintree rainforest, trips onto the Great Barrier Reef and scenic flights around Cape York. They work on wafer-thin margins as it is and they cannot afford to wear these costs, particularly after the very tough few years the industry has had as a result of the high Australian dollar and the disastrous start to 2011 and low economic confidence. This government have loudly trumpeted the family assistance package and the schoolkids bonus, but we all know that it is very much a flash in the pan-all on borrowed money, I might say-to try to lessen the blow of the carbon tax when it hits on 1 July. They have tried to sneak in legislation that will raise the country's debt ceiling to a record $300 billion. This is another increase in our nation's credit card limit, so that by 2015-16 we will be spending over $8 billion a year, around $22 million a day, just to pay our interest. We have been there before but not to this extent. I remember when I came into this place in 1996 that we were faced with similar challenges at that time. It took us eight years to extinguish that debt. I suspect that it is going to take a little bit longer this time. Do not forget that in the last 18 months the government's estimated deficit of 2011-12 has blown out by $12 billion to $44 billion-and the year is not over. Some people would think this is something of a bad joke. Far from receiving a break in this budget, small business-the engine room of our economy-will receive no compensation for the carbon tax and no break in the form of corporate tax cuts. Your great friends from the Greens told you that they were prepared to put the small business tax break through, but you did not have the courage to put it into the parliament. The reality is that it could have happened. From our perspective, we do intend to get rid of this tax completely. The tax break certainly would have made a difference to small business in my electorate but, yet again, they have been disappointed by this government. The Australian Bureau of Statistics shows that nationally there are over 60,000 tourism reliant businesses and another 290,000 businesses that are tourism connected. Tourism and hospitality is a classic small business sector, with 90 per cent of these businesses employing fewer than 20 people. Now the government has dumped the pledge on the company tax and announced this mickey mouse scheme, the $700 million tax carryback to support businesses. But in order to take advantage of this you have to be an incorporated business-and how many tourism businesses in the Far North are incorporated? I suggest that it is very few. Nationally it is about 20 per cent, so I know that up in Cairns there would be a very significant number of businesses that would not qualify. Furthermore, the two-year carryback policy will only be beneficial to a business that has recorded a profit in the last couple of years. How many small tourism businesses in my electorate can say that they have made a profit in the last couple of years? I would suggest that it is very few. The ATO found in 200910 that 35 per cent of companies were trading at a loss. This is likely to be significantly higher in Cairns considering the impact of the high dollar on hospitality and tourism. There is also no benefit to most hotels because they are owned by trusts. These guys are screaming out for help but they are clearly getting nothing from this government. If that is not bad enough, let us not forget the triple whammy at the airports. The increase in the passenger movement charge from $47 to $55 per passenger will increase the cost for tourists to fly into Cairns. The passing on of the $120 million cost of the Australian Federal Police security to this country's airports is particularly onerous on regional destinations like Cairns. Lastly, the slashing of the duty-free concessions on tobacco is another kick in the guts for small retailers at our airports and a disincentive for those travellers who look for these savings. Cairns Airport is a major gateway into our region and the airport has now banded together with other international airports in Australia-essentially, their rivals-and tourism bodies to battle this increase in the passenger movement charge. So much for a commitment to regional Australia. This was totally unexpected and there could not be a worse time to be doing this when we are trying to look at a recovery for our tourism industry. The increase in the PMC will mean an overseas family of four will pay an additional $220 to visit Australia. By 2015-16 the government's total revenue from the PMC, a tax on tourists, will be as high as $1.04 billion, or around eight times the amount currently spent on marketing Australia. Meanwhile, this budget cuts Tourism Australia's funding by more than $6 million a year at a time when this organisation should have its funding increased, not reduced. It shows again that the federal government have no understanding of the needs Northern Australia. When I look back at the promise made in last year's budget that Australia would create some 500,000 new jobs over two years, I have to say I am disgusted. I am disgusted because I now see the government expects to miss this target by some 300,000 jobs. The national unemployment rate is forecast to increase to 5.5 per cent. In itself, 5.5 per cent is a daunting figure, but in Far North Queensland the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show unemployment is at a staggering 9.9 per cent-almost twice the national rate. It equates to almost 14,000 unemployed far northerners. My region needs targeted investment in training and employment programs that will lead to real jobs, not make-work positions where employers can just tick the box to meet the requirements that put extra cash into their bank accounts. I was horrified to learn of the cuts in defence spending. Just three weeks ago the Defence Force Posture Review recommended that HMAS Cairns should be upgraded as a key military port for new Navy ships, yet this government has allocated an amount for defence spending that is the lowest since the late 1930s. This means we will now have to be very vigilant in watching what happens to our facility in Cairns. We cannot afford to lose services and capability when the coastline of my electorate is a key border that must be defended. Lose these capabilities and the boats that are plaguing the coastline of western and northern Australia will start to target north-eastern Australia, as will those who smuggle people, guns, drugs and other contraband. The Australian government has shown it has no comprehension of the depth of the Australian migration crisis. In the last couple of weeks we saw the arrival of two more boats carrying more than 80 people, meaning that more than 18,000 have arrived under Labor and more than 1,000 this month alone-a new monthly record. We learnt at estimates that the government has budgeted for just 450 people turning up each month, meaning that in the last 12 months Labor's budget has blown out by $1.7 billion. In my electorate the Scherger Immigration Detention Centre, located near Weipa in Cape York, was set up in 2010 as a short-term fix to house a maximum of 300 asylum seekers. This was originally a base set up as a military installation. Unfortunately, it has now become a prison centre. Two years on, the number is currently at 437 single male detainees. The centre continues to put pressure on the health services and accommodation sector in this small regional town. Residents in my electorate have been very vocal in their displeasure with this budget and they see it holds nothing for them-no promise, no positivity and no opportunity for growth. Kim Cook, a local mum, contacted my office to register her concerns about the budget cuts for sole parents. She told me how difficult it was to find work as a sole parent in Cairns. With unemployment at almost 10 per cent there is a lot of competition for jobs, and the bulk of these jobs are in the tourism industry-hardly compatible with somebody with school age children. Trishalee Moore, from the southern suburbs of Cairns, asked why families who send their children to public school, pay more for their home loan and work full time should no longer be eligible for tax cuts, just because they put in the hours to earn a little bit over the threshold. How can this be right? Industry in Cairns has slammed the budget. In the Cairns Post on 9 May there was an article titled 'Construction sector sees no relief, no stimulus'. For example, managing director of Dixon Homes, Andrew Thomas, said it was a terrible budget from a terrible government: 'I cannot see anything in there that is going to help us in business.' On the same day, there was an article titled 'Nothing to boost commerce, laments lobby group'. In the article, Oscar and Elliott, the owners of Rehab-one of my favourite coffee shops in Cairns-said the budget did not have much for small business. 'We've been left out, once again,' they said. 'Something would have been better than nothing.' All in all, this budget is simply a smoke and mirrors effort by a government that is looking to achieve a surplus by projecting a $34 billion increase in revenue with a $7 billion decline in spending. What does that mean for the people of Leichhardt? Cuts where it hurts-a rising cost of living and a blow to business and tourism. It is time that the people of Far North Queensland were treated with a bit of respect rather than suffering and missing out on opportunities in misdirected priorities. Bill (No. 1) 2012-2013. In doing so I want to point out a few issues in relation to this budget and its effectiveness. DareI say, there is very little in this budget for the people of Canning other than what is deemed to be the misconception and misunderstanding of is called the schoolkids bonus. As I have said in this House before, the schoolkids bonus was meant to be for schoolkids. At the end of the day, if a parent came along and kept their receipts and put them into the appropriate redemption area they would have them redeemed. That meant that they could then pay for uniforms, school shoes, school fees, excursions and all these sorts of things. It was a genuine injection into the education of children. I have had people from my electorate come to me and say, ' Mr Randall, I have kept all these receipts. What do I do with them now?' They cannot do anything with them because they are just going to get a cash splash. I heard the member for Petrie stand and say how disgraced and upset she was that people were saying those who received these payments would use them on things like alcohol and gambling. I would be disgraced too if that happened, because it is meant for schoolkids and their school fees. The national broadcasters of this country and the media in general have found people who have said, 'Well, if don't have to spend it on the kids I might spend it on myself.' There are some worthy spends. They are people with electricity bills-and we know they are going to get higher-and other expenses. But do not call it a schoolkids bonus. It is not for schoolkids any more. We even heard today in the House that there are schoolkids who will receive it even if they do not attend school. How does that apply? The Prime Minister's lame, limp response was, 'I want to make sure we give it to the people in need.' The people are in need because they are being compensated for a tax that they do not need-a carbon tax. This is a bribe and a pay off for people on low incomes-who, in particular, are going to be some of the worse affected by this government's world's highest carbon tax. Let us get that on the record. This schoolkids bonus scheme is bogus because it is just a bribe and an injection of cash with no accountability and no audit trail any more. In addition to that, the Treasurer lauded his $1.5 billion surplus. By the end of this year or towards October-November when MYEFO is to be revealed, the Treasurer will put it offbecause he will not want to reveal the fact that he will not make his surplus. As the Leader of the Opposition said, in a trillion-dollar economy $1.5 billion is 'a rounding error'-and this Treasurer is going to be found out again for another bogus set of circumstances around his budget. I dare say also that this is a budget which has forgotten small business. Remember that they were going to reduce company tax from 30 per cent to 29 per cent? All those people in my electorate said, 'What's the federal government going to do for me? ' Retail in this country is being absolutely strangled. Retailers are in dire straits. The retailers in my electorate are screaming that not only are they bound up by red tape but people are not spending. In fact, there are statistics showing that billions of dollars are not being spent in this economy because there is a lack of confidence in spending. Not only are people not spending on retail, they are not developing land and other developments-because they have no confidence in this",240,Hesta Which Is A Fund With $18 3 Billion Of Superannuation Savings For People Working In
215,Mr Randall (Canning) (19:19,"It is my pleasure this evening to talk on Appropriationgovernment. A large developer came to me in Perth the other day saying he is not going to pull the trigger on his development until this government is gone. So that is the situation that confronts us. A lot of people have spoken about the fact that a whole lot of jobs are going out the window. They are saying it is because of the carbon tax. Why would anybody who had won an election allow the Greens to compromise them? You should never trust the Greens. You should never take the Greens for their word. Along came Prime Minister Julia Gillard. From day one she was compromised when she got sucked into the whole vortex of the carbon argument and the climate change argument and gave us the world's highest carbon tax. I said to one of the Deputy Speaker's colleagues, who shall remain unnamed: why did you guys do this? You could have lived happily ever after if you had not done this. You could have sat down and negotiated a sensible arrangement. But the Prime Minister's lack of judgment was again on the record when she went down this path, compromised by Bob Brown and the Greens because she had to tie up an unseemly coalition. I have the aluminium industry in my electorate; I have Alcoa. Sixty per cent of Alcoa's world income comes from my electorate-whether it is through the mining of it or the processing of it. The bauxite is processed into alumina and then it is shipped off to Point Henry to be turned into aluminium. That is a huge cost. The price of electricity used to be one of the attractive parts of producing aluminium. But Loy Yang and all those electricity generating facilities in my colleague's state are now going to be hit with the world's highest carbon tax, which will make it so much harder to produce refined aluminium. Going to asylum seekers: we have never had so many turn up in one day. In 24 hours, close to 1,000 people turned up-because the Labor Party, under Kevin Rudd and endorsed by Prime Minister Julia Gillard, changed the policy, which opened the door. We have seen all the media reports that they are lining up to get here while there is an open door. But you could stop it in one day if you brought in the Nauru solution and temporary protection visas and, where practicable, turned the boats back. So we have this issue, and now we have the uncertainty surrounding the government's handling of the Roy Hill Enterprise Migration Agreement, which has totally backfired on the Prime Minister. She wanted to start a class war against Gina Rinehart and Twiggy Forrest-two great Western Australians. Lang Hancock had nothing. He had to borrow £500 from Stan Perron to explore a mineral deposit in the Hamersley Range. That allowed Lang Hancock to have 15 per cent of future royalties. That is how poor he was as a sheep station owner. He made something out of nothing. It is the same with Twiggy Forrest. Twiggy Forrest comes from the incredible family of Sir John Forrest, who was the former member for Swan in this place at the time of Federation in 1901. This is a family explored and developed Western Australia-and this government blackguards them. Why does this government blackguard them? Because they have been successful and have made billions of dollars. Along the way they pay company tax. They employ people and make sure that Australia is in a secure trading position in terms of our balance of trade, but they are blackguarded because of the class war going on between the Labor Party and anyone who is successful. WhatI am about to say I do not say lightly. As the member for Swan, I lost my seat after one term. It was in the GST and One Nation election when 19 of us lost our seats. I came back as the member for Canning and I have one Canning four times. I speak with a lot of sympathy and I do not say this in a gloating way. To the people in the Labor Party who are in marginal seats I say that this Prime Minister is selling you down the drain. Your policies are going to hurt you and you are not going to be back here. There is a list of 12 seats. Obviously the member for Corangamite is in real trouble, as is the member for Moreton. In the recent Queensland election there was a 15.4 per cent swing against the ALP. What was the margin in Moreton at the last election? The member for Moreton got 51.13 per cent of votes, so his margin is 1.13 per cent-gone. The third cab off the rank is the member for Lyne-for all different reasons, gone. The fourth cab off the rank, obviously, is the chief of 'Thomsongate', the member for Dobell-that seat will come our way. The fifth cab off the rank, Greenway, 900 votes-there are 900 Sri Lankan's in the member for Greenways's seat and she has blackguarded them all. I made a speech in this House and invited her in to listen because the Sri Lankans had contacted me and the Sinhalese community are not happy with her. The sixth seat is Latrobe and Jason Wood is again standing for preselection. The seventh seat is Petrie-it will be coming our way, with the recent swing in Queensland. The eighth seat is Lilley. I am trying to place a bet on Centrebet on the seat of Lilley because I do not believe that the member for Lilley will be back. Remember Elizabeth Grace? She took his seat once. Elizabeth Grace will be standing again at the next electorate. The ninth seat is Bass. The member for Bass is a lovely bloke. I understand our two-party preferred polling there is at 60 per cent. The tenth seat is New England-they have gone off him. That seat has a Labor primary vote of something like 15 per cent and he has backed the Labor Party, the Left. He is gone. The eleventh seat is Blair, another Queensland vote. The next election will largely be won in Queensland. The twelfth is Capricornia-coal mines. The member for Capricornia is a lovely lady. I do not wish her any harm but at the end of the day-gone. I understand the member for Robertson has dug herself well into her seat and is very popular there, so there will be idiosyncratic results. I was in the party room when John Howard had 52 polls against him saying we were not going to win. You hear it all at the doors, people saying, 'But it's not Newspoll today, it's not this one, it's the poll on the day that counts.' Unless you get this government to change its policies on the carbon tax, the mining tax, to reverse the health insurance changes, capping childcare fees and all the other issues you will show how you are out of touch with the Australian electorate. I am sick of getting bailed up on ANZAC Day, at schools or at shows by people saying, 'Do we really have to wait 16 months until we can kick-start this country? It's an embarrassment.' When Kevin Rudd went overseas, begrudgingly we were proud of him because at least he handled himself and he was articulate. When this Prime Minister goes overseas, she is a pale imitation of Helen Clark, who used to be very 'agricultural' in the way she spoke. We have someone who is worse. Australians are not proud of our Prime Minister. There is a pox on all of us, because this is the ugliest parliament that I have seen in the nearly 14 years I have been in this place. It reflects on all this when the state of this place is like it is at the moment. We deserve far better. In coming to a conclusion I will point out that I wrote an opinion piece in the West Australian newspaper today. It is called 'A funding tale of two cities'. In the piece I compared Armidale in New South Wales, in the seat of New England, with Armadale in my seat of Canning, pointing out the difference in funding and the issues that separate the two. I seek leave to table that at the end of my speech. Leave granted. can we end the malaise; when can we stop the paralysis of this government and what it is doing to this fine country of Australia. Yes, we are in a better position than many other countries, but we can do far better. Our constituents and our country need better. 2013 and in reply to the federal budget, which was handed down earlier this month. I will speak on its impact on households and businesses in Calare and on agriculture and industry in Australia, but particularly on its impact in central-western New South Wales. It will come as no surprise that I think the budget is a disaster, not because I am in opposition but because this Labor government has failed to implement any measures to improve the economy in its time in power. All it has done is introduce tax after tax and, at the same time, put us in record levels of debt in a record short amount of time. Regional Australia has been completely neglected in this budget. From any regional perspective-whether it is on the edge of Melbourne, in western New South Wales or anywhere else-it is a disgrace. Ten days after the last election, nearly two years ago, the Prime Minister told the National Press Club: … the new Parliament will also have a focus on the needs of regional Australia. … … … We don't have to re-discover regional Australia because we never lost it. From well before our election in 2007 we have taken the needs and interests of regional Australia as one of our priorities and this is reflected in our record in government. Let us have a good look at the record. This government has allocated almost 80 per cent, or $16 million, of $20 million of funding that was meant for regional Australia in last week's budget to projects in Melbourne, Adelaide and Hobart. Only $4 million went to projects outside capital cities, and that $4 million was used just to keep the votes of two independents in conservative electorates, who are traitors to those electorates. Further, the largest allocation from the government's Regional Infrastructure Fund, $480 million, went to fund road upgrades around Perth airport. While I am happy for Perth, I am not aware that it counts as a regional spend. Another $54 million will be spent on upgrades to the Blacksoil Interchange around Brisbane. That is nice for Brisbane, but it is still not much good for regional Australia. As with the carbon tax, this government has done the exact opposite of what it promised regional Australia. This Labor Prime Minister promised that there would be no carbon tax under the government she led. We have all heard it a lot, but it is still true. After all that, she introduced the carbon tax. She promised that regional Australia would be a priority under her government then she took the money for regional Australia and gave it to major cities. It is an absolute disgrace. I know that people in the bush will not forget this easily. We in Calare did not get a great deal. I will acknowledge the things that Calare got in the budget: a Peak Hill multipurpose centre that we had attempting to get for some time; $1½ million for a hydrotherapy pool at Dudley Private Hospital, that works in closely with public",244,Hesta Which Is A Fund With $18 3 Billion Of Superannuation Savings For People Working In

217,Mr John Cobb (Calare) (19:36,"I rise to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2012health; almost $4 million for the Orange Aboriginal Medical Centre redevelopment; $6 million to construct a family medical practice at CSU Bathurst; and, over four years and the whole of regional Australia money will be spent on encouraging dentists to relocate to regional and remote areas. Unlike those opposite, I will give credit for things that are good and these funding announcements are very welcome. But before this government should pat itself on the back, let us look at the bad news. Unfortunately for those opposite, the bad news far outweighs the good. On a local level, there are very disappointing omissions. No money was allocated to the ongoing project for a medical school at Charles Sturt University in Orange and as every man and his dog that has ever looked at the issue knows, unless you train regional people in regional situations you do not retain them where they are most needed, which is in regional Australia. There was nothing in the budget for Bathurst, nothing for Oberon, nothing for Lithgow, nothing for Forbes. For the people of Calare as a whole, an incredibly important part of any budget-federal, state or otherwise-is funding for roads. That is why it is unacceptable that road funding has fallen to the lowest point in over a decade. Overall expenditure on roads plummeted from $6.2 billion in 2011-12 to $2.6 billion in 2012-13. Even that figure of $2.6 billion is the result of fudging the figures, something that appears to be one of the few talents possessed by the government. Perhaps most disappointing of all is the complete omission of funding for the much-needed Bells Line expressway project, namely funding for an engineering study or funding to secure the corridor. This is a project that successive Labor government's have refused to support. In 2007 the then Prime Minister John Howard announced funding to do the engineering on the Bells Line of Road, to be matched by the state government. Fast forward five years and the project is still on the shelf. It goes to the heart of one of the many downfalls of this government and that is its neglect of rural, regional and remote areas. Almost 80 per cent of funding meant for regional Australia in last week's budget went to Melbourne, Adelaide and Hobart-and I have nothing against those three places, but they are not regional Australia. A detailed analysis of regional development issues in the budget shows that almost $16 million of $20 million in new regional development funding went to projects in capital cities. Those projects funded by the Gillard government include $8.7 million for a sports and community precinct in Hobart. I suppose regional people go to Hobart but it is certainly not in regional Tasmania. There was $3.4 million for an enterprise in Adelaide, and I am sure South Australians go to Adelaide but I do not really think that is catering for their direct needs. There was $2 million for a Greek culture centre in Melbourne and $1.5 million for an Islamic Muslim centre in Melbourne. I am very happy for those places but this was regional money being spent in areas of population, not in regional locations. Only $4 million went to projects outside capital cities. As I said earlier, all these funds were spent to secure the vote of two Independents in conservative electorates who had, from memory, Labor votes of around eight to 15 per cent respectively in the last election. This government does not understand the bush. It does not acknowledge the bush and it does not care about it. As my colleague and the leader of the National Party said, this budget fails to inspire or encourage struggling communities and families in regional Australia. That will be to this Labor government's eternal detriment and eternal shame. The carbon tax will also be to the detriment of this government. It is the world's biggest carbon tax, the toxic tax that will hit businesses, hurt our families and do nothing that it supposedly aims to do-that is, help the environment. That is the biggest puzzle about all this. The environmental improvement is virtually non-existent. At a time when business confidence is at such a low, when the government has a record net debt of $145 billion, when the cost of living is one of the greatest concerns facing Australians today, this government thinks it is a good time and a good idea to introduce the world's biggest carbon tax. The carbon tax will act as a wrecking ball across the local economy, particularly regional ones and particularly Calare. We will all be paying for it through increased prices, higher energy bills and pressures on local businesses. Never mind the government's claim of returning the budget to surplus. That is simply a fabrication, a cooking of the books, and everybody, particularly the Treasurer, knows it. But it is more than that: it is all spin and no substance. Take the National Disability Insurance Scheme. This is a very significant policy and one that the coalition supports. The government has announced $1 billion for the scheme-never mind that it is $2 billion short on what the Productivity Commission recommended. We understand, and there are serious reports, that there is in fact no funding stream out of the budget for it. The finance minister would not rule out further taxes to fund the scheme. Then the Treasurer told the media that he was not entirely sure how much revenue would be raised from the dreaded mining tax-the very tax which was needed to fund these additional income support payments. This budget is more about buying votes than it is about restoring the economy that it has sought to destroy. This budget is about cash handouts rather than investing money. This is not a budget about the future. This budget is about the government making a last ditch effort to win back voters who abandoned it when it broke many promises but particularly the one on a carbon tax. I want to take some time now to talk about agriculture. My counterpart, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Ludwig, has decided to defend himself in the media lately. It is good to see that Senator Ludwig has some fight in him, and I hope that he can use some of that same resolve to finally stand up for agriculture. But I am a little amused that the agriculture minister put out a press release last week saying that the opposition had no vision for agriculture. This is a minister in a government that had no agriculture policy at all at the last election. It did not announce one; it did not even go there; it did not mention it. This is from a minister whose department has taken the word 'agriculture' out of its primary vision, out of its mojo. Since Labor came to power the agriculture sector has been under constant threat and attack. After cutting Land and Water Australia and after cutting funding from CSIRO and funding to the CRCs-$60 million-the government conspired with the Productivity Commission to cut research and development funding to RDCs. The coalition had to join with everybody, whether it was MLA, whether it was GRDC or whether it was a state organisation, to defend the government funding vigorously until, finally, Labor did back down. But they actually intended to pull 50 per cent of their funding from R&D. In this budget the government cut FarmReady and the National Weeds and Productivity Research Program. Also, all the signs were there that they were going to cut Caring for our Country in the budget, with many stakeholders raising concerns. The government did not, and that is great, but it is a bit sick or a bit sad when a government has to claim that simply continuing funding for a program is a win for agriculture. It was a win that they did not cut it-because they obviously wanted to-but, to claim it as a win that they have not is a little different. At the same time, this government has put our industry's viability under threat from a massive increase in red tape and business costs. We have a sector that has to absorb the world's largest carbon tax and compete internationally with businesses that do not face this cost. The minister has tried to remind us that agriculture was not actually suffering the tax. That kind of ignorance is what makes us all despair-because no sector is more affected by this tax than agriculture. The government has removed the 40 per cent rebate on AQIS inspections, which has led to an across-the-board registration fee increase in the order of 1,000 per cent to small export operators such as cold stores, specialist meat processors and private grain stores and which makes it much more difficult for new businesses to enter the market. We have seen the new draft legislation for the chemical regulator, the APVMA, being considered by the government that will increase the cost of chemical registration to the sector by one-third, about $9 million. It will impose another layer of regulation, with automatic five year reviews, adding to the inefficiency while not addressing the slow, cumbersome and costly chemical review process that sees products being used and registered by our competitor countries 18 months and two years before us. We have a government that unilaterally shut down live exports without considering the impact on a $1 billion industry and without consulting the major trader and our closest and vital trading partner, Indonesia. This has further reduced our competitiveness internationally by forcing overseas markets to factor in sovereign risk when doing business with Australia. This is a government whose idea of Murray-Darling Basin reform is to keep basin communities in a state of permanent drought through buybacks instead of investing in infrastructure and water use efficiency to deliver triple bottom line reform. The government did give some much needed funding to biosecurity for a new quarantine station, but it is over seven years. (Time expired) about two things: to give someone a fair go and to put yourself in the shoes of the other person. There has been quite a deal of discussion around the parliament in recent weeks about the rule of law and the importance of the individual under that law having their day in court. We as a nation restate that principle at every citizenship ceremony. Why, then, would we take a pregnant woman from her home without warning, who has been living in the community for more than a year with her two boys, and detain her indefinitely? Well, she has an adverse assessment from ASIO. This is lawful. The parliament has legislated accordingly. She has no right of appeal. She was not told of the basis for the adverse finding and, to the public's knowledge, is not being held for removal. That would be, and is, a reason for detention. This nation of the great south land has always held to the right of the individual to have their day in court. The colour of your skin, the mode of arrival, your life's background, are irrelevant to the right to a fair go. The Australian parliament should now resolve that no person can be held in indefinite detention without the right of appeal and the full knowledge of the basis of the adverse assessment from the authorities. It is not whether ASIO is right or wrong. It is about the character of this nation.",247,Hesta Which Is A Fund With $18 3 Billion Of Superannuation Savings For People Working In
218,Mr Broadbent (Mcmillan) (19:51,"My beautiful father, Benjamin, often talkedTony Abbott tells me that former Prime Minister John Howard would say, 'Every day in politics is a test of character.' I put to you, Deputy Speaker: this is a new day. I live in hope that we will not fail this test of character. Protection of our freedom and the rule of law demands we choose the right over the expedient. I speak to Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2012-2013, now that I have made that statement. The Treasurer began his budget speech by saying: The four years of surpluses I announce tonight are a powerful endorsement of the strength of our economy, resilience of our people, and success of our policies. This in itself demonstrates the level of spin which is contained in the Treasurer's budget speech. I say to the people of Australia that no surplus has been achieved yet, and we will not know if any surplus will be achieved until September next year, let alone in the forthcoming four years. In fact, the Treasurer's predictions in the past lack a certain credibility-a responsibility which, I might add, is the Treasurer's favourite catch cry at the moment. McKibbin, a former member of the Reserve Bank board, said: The problem with the entire fiscal debate in Australia today is that many economic concepts have been spun so far they have lost their meaning. There is serious economic damage being caused by attempting to reach political goals with no economic rationale. Of course, McKibbin was referring to both the budget deficit debate and the carbon tax pledge-both politically motivated without consideration for rational economic considerations. Another respected economic commentator, Ross Gittins of the Age, lamenting the absence of some vital statistics regarding the 'headline cash balance' in the budget papers, had this to say: The hiding of the headline deficit is just one example of the way the budget papers are becoming less informative rather than more, and the way the government's spin doctors are turning them into an exercise in media management rather than transparency and accountability. The budget speech used to be a thorough and trustworthy exposition of the new measures announced in the budget; these days it's a made-for-television rave about the budget's good points. I suspect one reason the budget papers have become less rather than more user-friendly over the years is the spin doctors' desire to drive journalists and others away from the budget papers proper … As in previous budgets, this surplus is entirely predicated on the prospects of the resources boom, which in turn is heavily reliant on China's demand for our resources. Any downturn in this demand puts the budget at risk-a risk exacerbated by an already recognised drop-off in tax revenues. JP Morgan chief economist Stephen Walters said the Australian economy was vulnerable to external shocks, especially as China's slowdown took hold. The financial crisis engulfing the European Union poses another risk to Australia's ability to forecast economic outcomes. This is of utmost importance, as I will expand upon. As an aside, it has previously been noted that the rhetoric surrounding the 'spreading of the benefits of the resources boom to ordinary Australians' who 'don't feel they are part of someone else's mining boom' has been an abject failure. The Treasurer admitted this two budgets ago, and it is an indictment of this government that it has not done more to stem the development of the Australian economy, which is not a two-speed economy or a multispeed economy but a patchwork economy. Note the removal of the word 'speed'-speed is necessarily not present everywhere in a patchwork economy. At the same time, Australiansparticularly those who live outside the mining states; ordinary men and women and families-are struggling with the cost of living: ever-increasing price rises in electricity, water, health insurance and local government rates. A question not answered by the Treasurer is: why are these cost of living components rising far in excess of the CPI and the RBA's measures? Another question which should be asked is: would the benefits of the resources boom be fairly shared had the Greens and the coalition agreed to the proposed reduction in the company tax rates? The Treasurer has said, in his own words: So in this budget the funds for company tax cuts have been redirected to families … It begs the question of what support families would have received if the company tax had been implemented. Moreover, the schoolkids bonus does not begin until January next yearalthough there is a prepayment in June of this year-a full six months into the financial year; and the proposed Family Tax Benefit PartA increase does not come into effect until 1 July next year, the 2013-14 financial year. Apart from the risks facing this budget's forecasts posed by the eurozone, domestic issues also loom large, as highlighted by Dr Martin Parkinson in his annual post-budget address: We are particularly worried by the Euro-zone situation … He continues: But there are also domestic risks. A key one is around the labour market … there is 'the possibility that frictional unemployment could temporarily rise as businesses adjust to changing patterns of demand and workers look to find new opportunities in emerging parts of the economy'. According to Treasury we now have a new form of unemployment-frictional unemployment, in contrast to ordinary unemployment. If you are out of a job like the many hundreds of Victorians once employed by Qantas, you are out of a job. This points to the oftrepeated statement by the Treasurer, and Dr Parkinson in his address, that 'the economy is going through a large structural transition'-not that at any time has this piece of spin ever been deconstructed and given some detail. Dr Parkinson points out: The labour market is not the only thing that it is difficult to get a handle on at the moment. We know, for example, that the elevated terms of trade and the high exchange rate are having big effects on the broader economy. As are attitudes to debt, changing patterns of consumer spending, competitive pressures and technological change. But, as you would expect, translating the impact of these broad structural forces into precise central case forecasts is particularly challenging. For Treasury to admit to such difficulties does not inspire an exuberance of confidence. More disturbing is the Labor government's 'spreading the benefits' rhetoric when it comes to the proposed $60 per week income cut for about 100,000 sole parents-many, for sure, in my electorate. It is well recognised that the Newstart allowance, which is what the sole parents will move to, is at a rate below the poverty line and offers little assistance in finding a job. Moreover, this forcing of sole parents into the workforce begs another question: are the jobs out there? As one commentator suggests, the government would do well to look at the figures published on its own website. DEEWR's Vacancy report for April 2012-March figuresshowed that there were as for 225,000 job vacancies. There are 774,124 official job seekers registered with Job Services Australia. They compete with other job seekers who are not on benefits or even officially unemployed. This gives a potential ratio of roughly three applicants to each vacancy. However, this ratio becomes more truncated once categories of vacancies are further matched with experience and qualifications. It is further exacerbated when questions of mobility arise with sole parents and the needs of their children. More disturbing for my electorate of McMillan and that of my colleague in Gippsland, Darren Chester, are the regional figures. The Internet Vacancy Index for Victoria-covering six regions-recorded a decrease in vacancies over the year, with the strongest fall being recorded-where? In Gippsland, down by 22.5 per cent. Furthermore, the April figures from the ABS show the Gippsland unemployment rate of 5.9 per cent, which is considerably above the Australian average of 4.9 per cent. One could be forgiven for thinking that regional electorates even exist, in the eyes of the Treasurer. The primary producers in McMillan are yet again 'forgotten people', as they have been in budgets past. The Treasurer's speech does not even mention farms, farmers, agriculture, beef, apples, wheat, grain, wool, lamb or dairy. This whole productive sector of our economy has been ignored. This is despite the impact of the high dollar on dairy exports, for instance, and the prospect of lower milk prices in the forthcoming months. In fact, this is a budget of lost opportunity. Motherhood statements such as-to quote the Treasurer again-'to create more wealth, prosperity, and jobs; spread more opportunity; and advance the living standards of millions of families and pensioners on modest incomes' lack all credibility, given the facts surrounding this patchwork economy. Some Western Australians and Queenslanders may be experiencing the benefits of the mining boom, but 85 per cent of Australians live in coastal cities, mainly on the eastern seaboard. And while the linkages from mining do spread into the wider economy, the mining industry employs only two per cent of our total workforce. At the same time, the patchwork economy of south-eastern Australia languishes, with lost jobs in banking, manufacturing, retail and aviation, to mention a few sectors. While a high dollar may make imports of all sorts of goods cheaper for us to buy, it punishes our exporters-of processed dairy products, for example-and it certainly does not help families struggling with out-of-trend increases in utilities and related costs. Add to this the growing uncertainty and concern that electricity generators and their workers face in the Latrobe Valley as a result of the carbon tax implementation. There is little in this budget that is visionary for Australia. Bringing the budget back to a surplus is an admirable goal, but not when it is achieved through increased debt. Surpluses achieved while at the same time drawing down debt are real. As the budget papers show in statement 7, page 7-4, the government's measurement of its financial position, that is, its net financial worth, will be lower, from minus $198.5 billion in 2011-12 to minus $248.6 billion in this budget. The budget papers state: A range of factors, including the further write-down in tax receipts and the increase in the market value of CGS on issue, have contributed to a higher expected level of net debt, and lower expected net financial worth and net worth, than was forecast in the 2011‑12 Budget. Further, table 3 in statement 10 shows that since Labor came to power the government sector net debt, as a percentage of GDP, has risen, from minus 3.8 in 2007-08, to an estimated 9.6 per cent in 2011-12 and 9.2 per cent in 2012-13. This is a high-spending, high-debt government. Suggesting that a surplus will be achieved in 2013 is, at best, fanciful. As one commentator put it: No Australian government has ever proposed such a huge withdrawal of spending from the economy … On Treasury's estimates, that the turnaround from deficit to surpluswould take at least 2.6 per cent of GDP out of the economy.' On that basis, given the current growth rate, the patchwork economy, the reduction in revenue and the impact of the carbon price on businesses, the suggestion that growth will return to trend and achieve a surplus is pure wishful thinking. It has been predicted that a more probable outcome is that, on current counting, we will be $44 billion in deficit this year. The blow-out is unprecedented. The year before, 2010, a deficit of $40.8 billion was predicted but they delivered a $47.7 billion deficit. Overall, the Treasurer's five budgets have delivered a combined deficit in the vicinity of $154 billion. Promising to bring a surplus in 2012-13, as one commentator noted, 'would be the biggest budget turnaround ever, at a time of falling tax revenue'. On that basis-given the current growth rate, the patchwork economy, a reduction in revenue, the impact of carbon pricing on business, the suggestion that growth will return to trend-achieving a surplus, as I said before, is purely wishful thinking. the issues that have been raised by a number of opposition speakers in relation to what we are doing. In particular, they tried to use a number of claims, which I think are quite false and, frankly, wrong about what we have been doing with this budget. There is no way that you can cook books, with an economy as big as ours, with a budget as big as ours and with a government that needs to be as transparent as ours. You need to be able to verify exactly what you plan to do and how you plan to achieve it. We have been able to do in one year-and it has been clearly recognised by many people who look at the work that we have done-what those opposite were not able to do in the last five years of government, namely, cut expenditure. In the coming fiscal year we will cut expenditure by more than four per cent, whereas those opposite in the last five years of government continued to increase spending to the tune of four per cent every single year. They were unable to deal with the critical issues that were constantly raised, and I mentioned these in the House earlier today. The Reserve Bank has said that there were two particular issues in terms of capacity constraints affecting the economy that those opposite were unable to deal with, chiefly skills shortages and infrastructure blockages that were affecting the country. Skills shortages take ages to deal with. They require sustained investment by government in education and training, both in tertiary and vocational areas. Those opposite, when in government, had the idea that in dealing with skills shortages they would do a number of things. They underfunded the TAFE system and then sought to duplicate it by the creation of Australian Technical Colleges, which were in direct competition with TAFE. IfI can also point out, they undertook radical industrial relations reforms, designed to suppress wage growth, undercut conditions, ensure that there was a massive transfer of wealth from employees to businesses and cap wage growth. They dealt with it in that way, in a market where skills shortages would drive up wage costs because demand for labour was high-a fundamental underinvestment at a time where they continually spent. This government, in cutting spending, has targeted its spending on the way through, making sure that economic conditions are not affected by a government continuing to drain money away, in terms of capital markets. When economic conditions are much more buoyant, we start withdrawing our spending and ensuring that business has the best climate to",250,Hesta Which Is A Fund With $18 3 Billion Of Superannuation Savings For People Working In
219,Mr Husic (Chifley,"Government Whip) (20:06): by leave-I want to address some ofinvest. It is clear that a lot of investment in the economy is about to occur over the next few years, and the competition for cash should not occur as a result of anything the government is doing. We are spending more wisely but also ensuring that we are facing the economic challenges of the nation, such as investment in skills. We had a debate today, for example, in the House on enterprise migration agreements. There are massive projects occurring on the other side of this continent that will see up to 100,000 positions that require to be filled. We are providing the mechanisms to ensure that they will be filled. We are making investments in trade training centres, in vocational education and in enterprise migration agreements. These mechanisms will ensure jobs for Australians. Businesses will be required to get their supply of labour through hiring locals or, if they cannot, through hiring people on 457s. If you look at the budget, these initiatives have all been detailed. They have been up for public scrutiny. They demonstrate investments in our people, particularly through education. I am particularly proud of those, yet those opposite, when they were unable to achieve these things during their time in government-and some of the snapshots I have given have demonstrated they were unable to do so-seek to denigrate what this government has been able to achieve in a short space of time. I have previously commented on what this means for people on the ground in my own electorate, and I commend the budget not only to the constituents that I am proud to represent but also to the nation as a whole, because I think it meets the challenges now and into the future. Dr WASHER (Moore) (20:12): I agree with the comments of my colleague Judi Moylan, the member for Pearce, in her budget response speech on 23 May, when she described the budget as an opportunity lost. I support her sentiment and make a further observation on the desperate scramble to achieve a pathetic, smoke-and-mirrors excuse for a surplus that totally dismisses Australia's responsibility to halt the enormity of the diabetes epidemic that is set to engulf this country and, potentially, ultimately bankrupt it. The 2005 Australian diabetes, obesity and lifestyle study (AusDiab) follow-up study showed that 1.7 million Australians have diabetes. Up to half of the cases of type 2 diabetes remain undiagnosed. By 2031 it is estimated that 3.3 million Australians will have type 2 diabetes. The total financial cost in this country of type 2 diabetes is estimated at $10.3 billion per annum. Of this, productivity losses make up $4.1 billion. People with this disease who can no longer work effectively become statistics in terms of the cost of treatment of this sinister disease. One leading Australian expert, Professor Stephen Colagiuri, has published the prediction that the cost of diabetes in Australia will exceed $23 billion within 20 years. Another Australian world expert, Professor Paul Zimmet, in commenting on this budget, stated that the diabetes epidemic will become the fastest growing non-infectious disease epidemic in human history. He has expressed his deep disappointment at the Gillard government's decision to reduce funding for a major four-year, $200 million program for the prevention of type 2 diabetes. The health appropriations are principally directed at so-called 'prevention', and it was disappointing that the budget did not contain any detail of planning or strategies to reduce the death rate from diabetes and/or the comorbidities that contribute to it. I did expect in the appropriations a mention of funding for Indigenous Australian citizens for the dialysis that is needed desperately in the Northern Territory, including Alice Springs. Indigenous Australian citizens from Alice Springs are lining up for treatment after contracting diabetes at a rate about three times that of the rest of us. Alice Springs has the largest kidney failure dialysis unit in the Southern Hemisphere, with over 2,000 patients on dialysis. The main focus should be to prevent the diabetes epidemic that will overwhelm this country's economy progressively over the next 25-40 years if these funds are not increased. This budget does nothing to address the problem. The Gillard government is actually going to reduce the expenditure on dialysis and you can find a reference on page 172 of Budget Paper No. 2. Why is it doing this? The Treasurer, Mr Swan, says this measure will save a miserable $12.3 million by cutting the dialysis grant component with the 2007-08 budget measure entitled COAG, reducing the risk of type II diabetes. Compare that with the $23 billion he would have to find in 20 years to pay for the cost of doing nothing today. Type II diabetes is preventable. The government claims to be spending big in the budget on preventive measures, so they cut diabetes spending. What completely irresponsible, indefensible nonsense. How, one might be entitled to ask, can this government stand there and tell us that one of its key priorities is not diabetes? Like my colleague the member for Pearce, Judi Moylan, I too had the privilege of being a guest of Novo Nordisk at the European Diabetes Leadership Forum held under the auspices of the OECD. Novo Nordisk, the world's largest insulin manufacturer is internationally recognised as a leader in diabetes research and is responsible for many of the breakthroughs giving diabetes sufferers a better life free of costly complications. Australia as a member of the OECD was invited to attend this international forum attended by some 700 leading health policy experts and government representatives. While the Treasurer, Mr Swan, is ever ready to accept the accolades of the OECD when it comes to being recognised as a responsible Treasurer, there was no-one from this government at this important OECD meeting. The outcome of that meeting is of vital interest to this government if it is serious about doing anything effective and meaningful about diabetes. Slashing spending on diabetes prevention, as the Treasurer has done, is utterly contrary to the OECD agreed needs to staunch the epidemic and its cost to treasuries around the world. The Copenhagen roadmap takes in United Nations resolution 61/225 on diabetes. This country was a signatory to the recent declaration of the UN 2011 meeting on the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases. A statement released proposed that the health of countries' citizens equated to wealth. Further, without strong national policies addressing diabetes and associated noncommunicable diseases the inevitable results are increasing debt burdens that will engulf developed and developing economies. Put simply, the cost of diabetes intervention is nothing compared to the cost of treating it. The Copenhagen meeting called on all member countries of the OECD to adopt a diabetes national action plan. There is no diabetes national action plan in Australia despite calls from stakeholder, community and health professional groups over the years. It is a sad fact that one in three of today's generation Ys will join the ranks of persons with type II diabetes during their lifetime. A new report has been released by the partnership of Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute, Diabetes Australia, JDRF and Novo Nordisk called Diabetes: the silent pandemic and its impact on Australia. This report presents in the clearest terms a frightening assessment of the rapid growth of diabetes and its impact on Australians. As an immediate priority we need to recommit to the development of a formal national action plan in keeping with the UN resolution 61/225 on diabetes which is demanded by health consumer groups, a strategic plan that recommends countries review and strengthen critical activities to contain the growth and burden of disease. The CEO of Diabetes Australia, Lewis Kaplan, says of the report that 'time is of the essence because unlike other developed nations, despite agreeing with these global recommendations, Australia has failed to take comprehensive action and implement change'. This report underscores the fact, that in the absence of taking preventive measures, type 2 diabetes will triple in prevalence and affect three million Australians in just over a decade. This is a tragic prediction, especially given that type 2 diabetes is potentially preventable in a substantial percentage of people. In addition to this dramatic growth in type 2 diabetes, the report highlights a continuing rise in the occurrence of type 1 diabetes-particularly in very young children, from zero to four years of age. In contrast to type 2 diabetes, type 1 is unpreventable and the cause for the rise is, worryingly, unknown. Prevalence of type 1 diabetes in Australia is one of the highest in the world and is increasing by approximately three per cent annually. The result is that significantly more young children and their families are burdened with a lifelong incurable disease, requiring effective and consistent self-management to control the conditiontypically multiple daily insulin injections. Other OECD countries like Denmark have increased regulation and introduced taxes on what their experts, like our own, have labelled as 'risky food'. These funds are applied to programs to reach and educate at-risk groups and type 2 diabetes patients to adopt healthy lifestyles and diets. More importantly, these strategies are interwoven with intervention techniques based on early diagnosis and early commencement of treatment. Treatment can take the form of maternal and adult lifestyle modification, medications or even, more recently, adoption of bariatric surgical measures as outlined in the International Diabetes Federation Consensus Statement released in February last year. This government is taking a short-term view with an eye towards showing a paltry $1 billion budget surplus today that will cost the country billions in the future. Short-term thinking about short-term gains mean long-term problems. AusDiab, a world-recognised groundbreaking study funded by the Howard government in 2000, proved that Australians at high risk for diabetes can be identified, and cost-effective lifestyle interventions implemented which effectively delay and prevent the onset and insidious development of diabetes. There is proof positive that over 10 years, the costs of an intensive lifestyle intervention for high risk individuals are almost entirely offset by the savings arising from averting diabetes and its complications. Those complications-amputations, blindness, heart attacks and kidney failure-require costly management from allied health professionals and carers as well as general practitioners and endocrine specialists. OECD meeting in Copenhagen reaffirmed a directive to all member nations, including Australia, that nations must deal with diabetes by early diagnosis and intervention as a matter of extreme urgency. The Copenhagen Roadmap will be published online on June4 and sets the benchmark for all OECD member countries to meet if this battle is to be won. There is an urgent need for Australia to re-formulate and re-state its commitment to a national diabetes plan, and for that plan to be properly resourced so the increase in diabetes prevalence and its costs in the Australian population can be averted. Almost 40 percent of Australia's adult population is already 'touched' by diabetes in some way. The diabetes monster, if unchecked and untreated, not only threatens our quality of life; it threatens to demolish the wealth of individuals and families, leaving them no alternative but to turn to the government for support. I am also concerned that this budget makes provision for a number of 'expected savings' on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Buried in its language are references to what are falsely described as reviews of therapeutic categories by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. The PBAC has, until recently, stood on its record as an independent, expert body in determining what cost-effective medicines it should recommend to the minister to be funded by the government and introduced to the PBS. Patient groups were outraged when this government decided to embark on a savage, thoughtless assault on the PBS by introducing a policy under which cabinet effectively second-guessed the PBAC and decided which medicines it would fund. A Senate enquiry blew the whistle on this stupidity, as a result of which the then health minister backed down and gave an undertaking to revert to the previous coalition government policy which allowed medicines costing less than $10 million per annum to be signed off by the health minister. Regrettably, this policy, again in the name of senseless penny pinching, will be re-introduced in October unless savings are found. This is despite almost $2.3 billion in savings the government has already milked from the scheme. It is widely feared that this is another naked cash grab dressed up as what the government disingenuously refers to in the budget as PBAC 'reviews' of prescribing costs of drug categories, including diabetes. It is imperative we take action now on diabetes. Just consider that in the 15 minutes allotted to me to make this speech, two more Australians have been diagnosed with diabetes and there are another two who have the disease but are undiagnosed. disappointment to the people of Western Australia for a number of reasons. Canberra continues to take more and more from the state, in the form of GST, the carbon tax, and the mining tax, while failing to give a fair return. I have consistently shared my disappointment in this parliament at the way regional Western Australia is overlooked by the Labor Party-and the 2012-13 federal budget is no different. Once again, the federal budget has left many holes in regional Western Australia for the state government to fill. Fortunately, a fund created by the Nationals WA, the Royalties for Regions fund, is coming to the table with a $1.1 billion funding commitment to regional Western Australia in 2012-13. This is $1.1 billion that the Nationals WA in government are contributing back to regional communities. This funding is being used for important infrastructure funding, including the development of brand-new hospitals in Karratha and Albany and the development of the Bunbury to Albany gas pipeline. Royalties for Regions is also supporting the PortLink project and has contributed $5 million towards getting this project off the ground. This nation-building project will connect the five major ports of Western Australia-Esperance, Port Hedland, Karratha, Fremantle, and in the future, the Oakajee Industrial Port-with Kalgoorlie, as a gateway to the eastern states. The project will also create an intermodal freight hub in Kalgoorlie, allowing Kalgoorlie to service all five ports, eliminating the need for freight between the eastern states and the ports to be transferred through the metropolitan area. While the federal government has contributed some funding to the planning phase of this project-and I thank federal",254,Hesta Which Is A Fund With $18 3 Billion Of Superannuation Savings For People Working In
220,Mr Crook (O'connor) (20:26,"The 2012-13 federal budget has been a greatMinister Albanese for this assistance-it is the Royalties for Regions fund that continues to drive this project into the future. Royalties for Regions is delivering funding for better health care, including the Southern Inland Health Initiative, funding for the Royal Flying Doctor Service and St John's Ambulance, and funding to assist patients needing to travel for medical appointments through the Patient Assistance Transport Scheme. There are many issues surrounding regional health in Western Australia. The regional doctor shortage is the single biggest issue affecting regional communities and local governments. There are currently 95 regional doctor vacancies in Western Australia, stretching right across the state. While the provision of GPs is a federal government responsibility, it has been left to the state government and the local governments to pick up the slack on this issue for too long. The Southern Inland Health Initiative, funded through the Royalties for Regions fund, is a $565 million program which will dramatically improve medical resources and deliver better access to general practitioners in regional areas. It will provide the equivalent work value of 44 full-time doctors across the region, dramatically boosting emergency and general practice services. Time and time again I have called upon the federal government to work to address regional health issues in Western Australia-to no avail. The federal budget offers very little to give regional Western Australian communities hope with regard to this issue. Funding is also required to expand and improve the Rural Clinical School in Northam. Given that the state government is funding the placement of 44 regional doctors through the Southern Inland Health Initiative, I would hope the federal government might see the error of their ways and be prepared to take responsibility for the expansion of the Rural Clinical School, which would deliver better outcomes for regional health in future years. There have also been initiatives by the Curtin University to train more doctors as well. The WA Nationals are also providing Royalties for Regions to strengthen mobile phone networks across the state to assist families, businesses and emergency services. Royalties for Regions is also delivering the Country Age Pension Fuel Card, providing assistance to pensioners to allow them to remain connected to their community, visit family and friends, and attend important medical appointments. There is no denying that The Nationals WA and the WA government understand how to implement a regional development scheme off the back of a successful state development resource industry. The federal government's own regional development scheme clearly failed in comparison. There is great scope and opportunity for the federal government to join up with a pioneering, innovative and successful fund, such as Royalties for Regions, to deliver greater service and infrastructure to regional communities. There is even scope to partner with the private sector to further improve these outcomes. I have listed a number of projectsPortLink, the Bunbury to Albany gas pipeline, the Southern Inland Health Initiative, the Rural Clinic School and the remote communications rollout-that would benefit from partnering with the federal government. I am disappointed each year that the federal government are not doing more for regional Australia, particularly considering the massive financial windfall that they are receiving from the mining tax. Using the billions of dollars raised by the mining tax, the federal government's Regional Infrastructure Fund will deliver just $6 billion over 10 years into regional Australia. It is disappointing that some of this money will only wind up being spent in metropolitan areas. Last year, more than half a billion dollars out of the Regional Infrastructure Fund was spent on a metropolitan roads project in Western Australia. The mining tax is a consistent disappointment. It is an anti-Western Australia tax; no other state or territory will contribute more to the mining tax than Western Australia. The Labor government speak of spreading the benefits of the mining boom. In reality, this is just another way of saying that they will take more from Western Australia and support projects in the eastern states. Certainly, in the 2012-13 budget, there is no significant funding for infrastructure projects in Western Australia. The Labor government have also dropped the ball by utilising the mining tax to deliver company tax cuts, doing a complete back-pedal on their previous commitment. For the massive amount of pain that the mining tax is inflicting on Western Australia, it was expected there would be a small gain in company tax cuts. Instead, this was scrapped by the Labor government. This move has already been poorly received by regional businesses. While we are on the subject of regional businesses, let me raise the subject of another tax against Western Australia-the carbon tax. The carbon tax will see more families and communities paying more for basic services such as electricity and transport. Regional communities, due to the tyranny of distance and the increased cost of living, will be hit the hardest by the carbon tax. Although the government purports to be supportive of regional development, the carbon tax and the mining tax do not speak highly of the Labor government's ability to support regional Australia. This leads me to the third element of the Labor government's anti-WA federal budget: GST returns. As many of you in this House will know, GST returns are very important to my home state of Western Australia. I raised this issue in a private member's motion in parliament last year, along with my plans to deliver a fairer GST return to Western Australia. Aside from Bob Katter, who seconded my motion, every member of this House, including Western Australia's own elected MPs, united to vote against that measure. My motion to implement a GST floor for all states and territories was unanimously supported by the Western Australian state parliament, including Premier Colin Barnett, Treasurer Christian Porter, Leader of The Nationals WA Brendon Grylls and former opposition leader Eric Ripper. Despite this, Western Australia's own elected representatives in Canberra have refused to support a fair go for their own state. This year's federal budget highlights the cost of their decision to oppose a fairer deal for Western Australia. In the 2012-13 budget alone, the cost is $556 million. As the resources industry continues to grow, Western Australia's GST returns will shrink. The forecast by the federal government's GST review panel has Western Australia receiving 55 per cent of GST returns next year, on its way to receiving just 36 per cent of GST returns in 2014-15. The federal government's GST review panel has also acknowledged that Western Australia could conceivably be ruled out of GST returns entirely in the medium to long term. This is totally untenable. A zero GST return would be an unquantifiable loss to the state of Western Australia. I am disappointed that the GST board has ruled out a GST floor before the report has even been completed, contrary to submissions from the WA state government, the state Labor party and me. The board does not include a Western Australian representative on the panel. How does the board profess to understand Western Australia's economic plight when not a single representative of the board is able to represent Western Australia, and Western Australia's own submissions are ignored? Unless significant GST reform occurs as a result of this review the economic outlook for Western Australia will only worsen. So, there we have it. Under the 2012-13 budget Western Australian communities will be hit hard by a carbon tax, a mining tax and the GST. In return, it will be offered a share of a paltry federal government investment fund which will be spent fixing up Perth roads. There has never been a clearer sign that the Labor government has lost touch with the people of Western Australia than this year's federal budget. BeforeI go I would like to touch upon the National Broadband Network rollout. Many members have made comment in this place about the NBN rollout. Prior to the rollout I raised concerns that the NBN would not be delivered in all areas of my electorate. I guess that is understandable-in a 909,000 square kilometre electorate it is not going to be everywhere. But these concerns have been confirmed, as the initial NBN rollout will not include the town of Esperance in my electorate of O'Connor. Esperance is a major regional centre for my electorate and regional WA. It has a strong agriculture sector. It is a major port for the nation, exporting significant quantities of iron ore. I am very disappointed that Esperance has been ignored by the Labor government in terms of the NBN, particularly considering previous comments by the Labor Party that regional communities would be prioritised in the rollout. I would also like to take this opportunity to say that I think this parliament has failed regional Australia. As a former member of the crossbench, where there were four regional members that focused strongly on regional Australia, I think it has clearly failed regional Australia. There are many opportunities for this government to partner with significant regional programs, as I have highlighted in my speech tonight, around the Royalties for Regions funds that will deliver real benefit to regional Australia, and regional Western Australia, and I think it is certainly a lost opportunity. Dr SOUTHCOTT (Boothby) (20:37): This is another Labor budget with more debt and deficit, and no plan to rein in the rising cost of living. It is another traditional Labor budget, with no coherent strategy to tackle the debt. It is a budget where Labor have cooked the books by shifting the NBN off budget and juggling spending in other areas to create an artificial surplus. If the members of the government were honest and included the NBN in the budget we would continue to see deficits over the next three years. It is an artificial surplus that is so small, with so many budget assumptions, that it is unlikely it will ever be realised. The 2011-12 budget deficit has now blown out to $44 billion-more than $20 billion higher than originally forecast. Now the government are saying that they can take us from $44 billion in the red to a budget surplus in just 12 months. It would be an extraordinary turnaround to see this. Spending this financial year is almost $100 billion more than it was just four years ago. Now we hear the government talk tough on cuts but it is all just rhetoric. Net debt is going to climb to $144.9 billion in 2013-14, and the budget bills have secretly tried to raise the debt ceiling to a record $300 billion. What Australia desperately needs-what families suffering rising costs of living need and what small business desperately need-is a return of confidence and a government that will deliver a sound economic strategy which will reduce the cost-of-living pressures and create jobs. We need a safe pair of hands managing our economy. The sad history of Labor shows that they are just not capable of providing this. It was left up to the coalition to pay off the Labor government's debt last time and the coalition will have to pay it off again. I turn to a number of health measures announced in the budget. In this budget $44 million is coming out of the GP superclinics program, which has been characterised by delay and by waste. The extraordinary thing is that the government have quite easily found $44 million in savings in what was one of its flagship health programs. They have claimed that this money was 'uncommitted funding for the provision of development, networking and other operational activities'. The deduction of this $44 million is not going to impact on the construction of a single GP superclinic or a single grant to general practice. This shows the level of waste in government spending at the moment. Forty-four million dollars in savings could be found in the GP superclinic program, but the deduction of this money will cause very little disruption to the program. It is an admission that the program has not lived up to the promise of 2007. After more than four years, only 25 of the 64 promised clinics are open, at least three have required bailouts and two have been scrapped completely-they have not even got off the drawing board. The budget papers show that not until 2015-16 will the last nine clinics become operational. In other words, clinics that were promised in 2010 will not be operational by the time of the next election and will only be operational by the time of the election after that-more than six years after they were promised. The budget also has a number of changes to the Practice Incentive Program. These changes are in the areas of immunisation, diabetes, cervical cancer and e-health. These changes have been met with opposition from doctors and their professional bodies, including the RACGP and the AMA. I am concerned about the impact that these Practice Incentive Program changes will have on public health. The government forecasts that these changes to the PIP will save $83½ million dollars over four years. There are cuts to health spending, but the cut which I think is the worse of all is the cut to the immunisation branch of the PIP. The government has announced that it will discontinue the General Practice Immunisation Incentive, which is paid to GPs to ensure that 90 per cent of children under seven attending their practice are properly immunised. This has been a very successful initiative. I saw it as originally proposed by Michael Wooldridge, the minister for health in the previous government. By using general practice, the General Practice Immunisation Incentive saw to it that Australia had high rates of immunisation. Our immunisation rates had fallen: they were well below those of developing countries such as Vietnam. The government's rationale for these cuts is that there was a change to the immunisation requirements in November 2011 that tethered the family tax benefit payments to compulsory immunisation and that these changes will save $209.1 million over four years. While the government claims that its all-stick-and-no-carrot changes to the family tax benefit A payments caused the GP immunisation incentive to be redundant, this is simply not the casethere are a number of families who are not eligible for the family tax benefit payment and who will now fall through the cracks. This has been a very successful public health initiative. We have seen immunisation rates rise. The government's cuts to the program show that it is not serious about the program. Without high levels of immunisation, the spectre is raised of future epidemics of whooping cough and other childhood illnesses. The government has increased the targets for the diabetes and cervical cancer PIPs, and general practices must achieve them to receive the incentive to screen for cervical cancer and provide diagnosis and care to diabetes patients. On the one hand this does lead to better quality; on the other hand it is there as a savings measure, so the government expects to be paying less overall for the program. I would be interested to see the hard evidence that shows that increasing these targets will actually improve patient care. It is a matter of raising the bar so that they end up paying less overall on diabetes care and on screening for cervical cancer. There are further changes to the e-health practice incentive payment, which sees general practice required to participate in the personally controlled electronic health record to receive the incentive. However, it is unclear whether the practice management software will even be capable of interacting with the PCEHR until later this year. How can a general practice comply with the requirements of the incentive payment when the technology will not yet allow them to do so? This is just another example of poorly implemented policy. In the area of the PCEHR the federal budget has provided an extra $233.7 million over the next two years, despite concerns that there will be very little to show for the last $467 million when it becomes operational on 1 July this year. What we see from the approach to the electronic health record is very similar to what we have seen from a lot of government projects. Rather than go for the approach which was outlined to them in the national e-health strategy which was prepared for the health ministers, which outlined a period of 10 years and incremental improvements and quick wins which clinicians could find easily, they have gone for the big-bang, high-risk solution of the electronic health record. The latest budget announcement will take the spend on the electronic health record to over $700 million since 2010. On1 July there will be nothing to show for this. On the budget papers' own targets, only 500,000 people will sign up for the electronic health record in the first 12 months. After four years, less than 30 per cent of the population will have registered for an electronic health record and even less will be actively using it. It remains to be seen what we will have to show for the $700 million on 1 July, but I can assure the parliament that the opposition will be watching this space very carefully. I will talk a little about the impact of this budget on my electorate. Residents of Boothby will suffer even more under this government's budget. The budget does nothing to ease the cost-of-living pressures that Australians are currently facing. Families will not be helped by this budget. Since Labor was elected, electricity prices have gone up 66 per cent, gas prices are up 39 per cent, food costs are up 11 per cent, petrol prices are up 11 per cent and education and health costs are up by over 25 per cent. This budget will make these costs rise more by introducing the world's largest carbon tax. We will never forget the words uttered by the Prime Minister just six days before the last election: 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' This was a complete breach of faith to the Australian people, and this breach of faith will see electricity bills rise by 10 per cent and gas bills rise by nine per cent in the first year alone. The carbon tax will increase the cost of everything for those families in Boothby that are already struggling with the rising cost of living. I would like to speak about infrastructure as well. The electorate of Boothby has missed out on vital infrastructure funding in this federal budget. The budget has provided $443 million for four underpasses and improvements to the rail corridor in the seat of Adelaide to improve traffic flows and reduce waiting times. Of this, $232 million comes from the federal government with the remainder coming from the South Australian government. This is disappointing news for residents of my electorate who are very concerned about the significant amount of time being spent at the Oaklands railway crossing where a diagonal road, Norfolk Road, and the rail line meet. There is no funding for that. It is also a sign that the Labor government has backed away from the recommendations in the Rail Freight Movements Study, which had options including the Northern Bypass to remove the impact of the freight trains on Hills residents in my electorate. On the issue of the potential for upgrading the current route, the rail freight movement study concluded that there will continue to be amenity issues and potential safety risks to the communities that live in close proximity to the route. Trains will also continue to face the steep grades and tight turns on the existing route. The Labor Party has chosen to ignore this study and go ahead with upgrading the existing line. These budget changes will also increase the length of freight trains along the Belair freight line. The changes will allow freight trains to add an extra 300 metres, up from 1.5 kilometres long to 1.8 kilometres long. This is going to have a further impact on the residents in the Adelaide Hills, who can see all three crossings in their area blocked simultaneously with a large freight train. In summary, this is another typical Labor budget with spending out of control, and we are unlikely to see a surplus. If everything goes right we will see a very small surplus, but we all know Labor's track record. They have not delivered a surplus in over 20 years. They expect us to believe they will deliver a $1.5 billion surplus, when their deficit last year has blown out from $20 billion to over $44 billion. spoken on appropriations bills since I was first elected in 1998, I have seen it all come and go and I understand that if you are a government member you like to boast about what it has done for your electorate, how good the budget is, and what a country we have and haven't we got such a great government. I have to say that I think this time they will be very disappointed because of the huge amount of the cuts. We understand the reasons this has happened. Through various means they have shifted about $12 billion from what would have been in next financial year into the present financial year. And of course the last time we debated appropriations bills members of the government would not have known that was going to happen. So they could not actually boast about that $12 billion of funding that might have affected their electorate. I know that on our side we say how bad the government is. That is the way things happen. In my judgment I think this is quite easily the worse budget I have been involved with. There is no doubt in my mind that if the chief financial officer of a company tried to put forward a budget like this, where it has actually shifted funding from one financial year to a previous financial year in an attempt to manufacture a wafer-thin surplus, they would be held up before the Australian Securities and Investments Commission on the basis that this was all a bit shonky. This idea that at the end of the budget speech they sneakily slip in this idea that they have to raise the debt ceiling from $250 billion to $300 billion just does not wash. Remember that recently it was $75 billion and we had to have a debt ceiling. But before that we did not need a debt ceiling because we were in surplus and we did not have any debt when the Howard government was in office. The ceiling was then raised to $100 billion, then to $200 billion, then to $250 billionAn opposition member: And it is still not enough.",258,Hesta Which Is A Fund With $18 3 Billion Of Superannuation Savings For People Working In
221,Mr Secker (Barker,"Opposition Whip) (20:51): This being the 14th time that I havedebt ceiling to go up to $300 billion-even though they are suggesting they are going to deliver a surplus. If you are not delivering a deficit, how can you be adding to the debt? Somehow they are, and I think that shows that this government does not believe its own rhetoric about somehow delivering a surplus. We all remember that, two years ago, the budget forecast for 2012-13 was going to be a temporary deficit of 'only $11 billion'. By the time of the MYEFO, six months later, it was going to be $22 billion, and now it is $44 billion. In around 12 months, we have gone from a deficit of $11 billion to a deficit of $44 billion-that is, the debt has gone from $500 in credit for every man, woman and child in Australia to $2,000 debt for every man, woman and child in Australia. As countries throughout the world are finding-in Europe and in America-the problem is that, if you keep building on your debt, you end up borrowing to pay off your debt. It is a never-ending circus where you will never actually get to the idea of paying off your debt. With surpluses of $1.5 billion, even if they were delivered, it would take 100 years for the government to pay off the debt. We know how hard it is to pay off debt because we actually did it when we were in government. When we came into government we had a net debt of $96 billion. The real figure that you have got to work from is the $96 billion debt that this country had when the HawkeKeating government was finally defeated by the Howard-Costello government. I think it is always very interesting to look at our history. In the 90 years between our Federation in 1901 and 1991, we as a nation accumulated $16 billion worth of debt. In that time, we had to find money to fight World War I, World War II and a few other skirmishes, and we had to build a national capital. In that 90 years, we accumulated $16 billion worth of debt. And then the Hawke-Keating Labor government delivered $16 billion worth of debt every year for the next five years-which it had previously taken us 90 years to accumulate. So as a nation we went from having a debt of $16 billion to having a debt of $96 billion. We know how hard it is to get rid of that debt. It took us 10 years, but we got rid of it. We were the first government in Australia's history, since Federation, that actually put money into the bank. We put money into the Future Fund and we delivered surpluses of over one per cent of GDP. That is something this government has yet to deliver-and, I believe, will never deliver. We have a history of Labor governments not being able to handle money. That was shown in the Hawke-Keating days and we are now seeing it from this government. We left this government $40 billion in the kitty, and they are already up to $160 billion of debt. That is a turnaround from having $2,000 in the bank for every man, woman and child in Australia to having a debt of $8,000 for every, man woman and child in Australia. That is the difference between Labor and us. They cannot handle money. They continue to raise debt in the hope that it is going to buy them some votes. We are seeing it now with the $300 billion debt ceiling. And we have seen so much of that money actually wasted. I mean, how much money did we lose through Building the Education Revolution? Probably $6 billion or $7 billion of the $17 billion that was spent on that was wasted, or overpaid, in terms of what those buildings could deliver.",264,Hesta Which Is A Fund With $18 3 Billion Of Superannuation Savings For People Working In
222,Mr Secker,"No. And somehow they are going to increase the debt-and they need theI remember that we had a fund called the Investing in our Schools program. I was very proud of that. We did not actually tell the schools that they had to build a school hall or a gymnasium. We said we would provide them with, say, $150,000 for whatever they wanted. If the school decided they needed a new toilet block, that was fine; or if they wanted to spend it on carpets or air conditioning, that was fine. The beauty of that funding was that we got such great value for taxpayers' money. If we gave a grant of $150,000 to a school, we often got $300,000 worth of value. The school would have their working bees, they would often have a builder on their school board and, as a result, they got things done cheaply. That is very well explained in the example of Naracoorte. We had a school hall there that cost 2½ times more per square metre when it was built by the government through the state education system, using builders outside the township of Naracoorte, than it cost the local private school. They did not have to conform to the state school system model of funding and they did it for 40 per cent of the cost. That is getting value for taxpayers' money. Of course, we know about the pink batts and the green loans and how all that money was wasted. I think that is the real difference between our type of government, with its good governance, and this government, who are not worried about spending money. In fact, they seem to think that if they spend money that is an outcome in itself. The fact is that it is not an outcome just to spend money. As my father always said, it is very easy to be generous with other people's money-and certainly this government has done that. I come from a largely agricultural electorate, like yours, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, and it worries me that this government has shrunk the department of agriculture from a budget of $3.8 billion to just $1.8 billion. That is a cut of more than half in funding. The industry funds that sort of spending by way of levies to the extent of 50 per cent. So the reality is that, in four years of Labor government, they have diminished the agricultural portfolio-something that is so important to this country, not just in food production but in the exports it produces, the jobs it provides and the efficiency in the way that it does things, as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker. But, unfortunately, I do not think Labor really care or understand the agricultural industry. We have a problem with the spend on roads in Barker. That is no surprise. Overall expenditure on roads has plummeted from $6.2 billion in 2011-12 to just $2.6 billion in 201213. Again, that is way less than half that of the previous year. I think that is a disgrace. If you were to keep those sorts of spending cuts up for the long term, you would see a very quick deterioration in our roads, because not only do we have to build new roads but we also have to maintain the existing roads. When you get that sort of drastic cut in funding there is no doubt that it is not good for our future. We introduced the Roads to Recovery funding, but this government is not committed to that beyond 2014. The Roads to Recovery program, as local governments in my area will attest, has been a saviour for them when it comes to maintaining and building new roads in their council areas. I have 24 council areas, and the fact that they get their funding increased from the ordinary state grants by 118 per cent has been a real boon to them. To my knowledge, not one dollar has been wasted on the Roads to Recovery program. Even though Labor, under Kim Beazley, said it was a boondoggle, it has actually been one of the great programs, and it is at risk of being cut in the future. But, of course, we have the carbon tax. What is that worth? Thirty-three billion dollars over the forward estimates. Mr Hartsuyker: How much? going to do? It is actually going to penalise this country. To try to find a reason for why they are doing it, they are actually having this whole advertising campaign-$36 billion-which is supposedly about the carbon tax but which does not mention a carbon tax. It is all about the supposed good news, but I think people in Australia are not that stupid and they obviously will not be conned by it. I move on to the Murray-Darling. I represent all of the Murray River in South Australia. It is a huge issue-an icon issue-in South Australia. But unfortunately Labor has deferred $940 million promised for infrastructure spending to bring community-friendly environmental benefits to the Murray-Darling Basin off into the future. We are also moving $40 million worth of water buybacks into this financial year. Again, this is a con when it comes to the actual spending on the budget. That is despite the Windsor review saying that we should not just go into buybacks because of the Swiss cheese effect. So, all in all, this budget is the most disappointing and dishonest budget. I have to say that; that is not just rhetoric. It is a dishonest budget; it is a budget that is going to be very sad for all members of parliament, because they know that it does not give us a long-term future, something to plan on and things like defence. What a shocker! I leave it there. I think it is just a bad budget and that we should recognise it for what it is. Ms SMYTH (La Trobe) (21:06): I move: That further proceedings on the bill be conducted in the House. Question agreed to. Broadcasting Services Amendment (Digital Television) Bill 2012 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Broadcasting Services Amendment (Digital Television) Bill 2012. The bill before the parliament today deals with the switch to digital television. Digital television has been broadcast in metropolitan areas since 2001 and in regional areas beginning in 2004. At the end of 2007, the Australian government announced that the switch to digital television would be completed by the end of 2013. We are now halfway through the process of switching off the analog signal. The end of this very long process is now in sight. The analog signal in the southern part of New South Wales will be switched off in just a few days, on 5 June. The northern part of New South Wales, including my electorate, will go digital only in November. The capital cities and remote licence areas will switch to digital only next year. The switch to digital television is a complex and expensive process, and I commend Free TV Australia and Regional Broadcasting Australia for their efforts to ensure that the switch has been as smooth as possible. Australia is a very large country, so it has been an significant undertaking by Regional Broadcasting Australia to send technicians up and down suburban streets to fine-tune coverage and identify coverage black spots.

224,Mr Hartsuyker (Cowper) (21:07,"I welcome the opportunity to speak on thetowers have been upgraded to digital standard by the broadcasters, and scores of self-help retransmissions sites have been upgraded or installed. Of course, the switch has not been without its problems, and I know that some of my colleagues have raised concerns about specific locations. It is impossible to overlook the government's gold-plated set-top box scheme, which somehow managed to provide cheap settop boxes to pensioners at an average cost equivalent to the price of two widescreen televisions. But, with that notable exception, the switch to digital TV seems to be running as well as could be expected. The bill before the House today makes a number of sensible amendments to improve the rest of the switchover process and to remedy some minor issues which have arisen during the switchover. The most important changes included in this bill are amendments to the conditional access system which will allow earlier access to the VAST satellite system for people who will never receive a good terrestrial television signal. Presently, most people are not eligible to apply for VAST until six months before the switch-over date for their area. Many of these people live in reception black spots and will never receive reliable terrestrial television reception. For these people it makes sense to permit access to VAST at the earliest possible opportunity. The television industry is not opposed to this change, and it will be a major benefit for many people in television reception black spots. The coalition believes that people living in regional and remote Australia should have access to high-quality services, which is why we support this bill. The VAST service has proven to be a significant improvement on the old satellite television services available in remote Australia. Instead of just providing a couple of free-to-air channels, VAST provides a full range of digital channels and local news channels. Making this service immediately available to everyone who cannot access a decent television signal is a good policy which will be welcomed by many people in regional Australia. The bill also makes consequential changes to a number of sections in the Broadcasting Services Act to facilitate the change. The bill amends section 38C of the Broadcasting Services Act, which governs the allocation and operation of satellite broadcasting licences. This amendment will allow satellite broadcasters to provide VAST to Australia's external territories-Cocos Islands, Christmas Island, Coral Sea Islands and Norfolk Island. At the moment, broadcasters with a section 38C licence are not able to broadcast into these territories. Australians living in these external territories should have access to a decent television service, and I support this amendment. The bill also amends section 211AA of the Broadcasting Services Act to allow broadcasters who operate in remote, central and eastern Australian licence areas to nominate more than one specified place in the licence area. The specified place is the location from which all time-based broadcasting obligations are determined. With the switch to digital television, some remote broadcasters are using the VAST service as the input feed for their terrestrial broadcasts. Different input feeds may be used in different parts of the broadcaster's licence area. Using different satellite feeds in different parts of the licence area allows broadcasters to better tailor their programming needs to the viewers. For example, a broadcaster may want to show rugby league programming in Queensland but AFL programming in Victoria and Tasmania. However, using these different satellite feeds could potentially result in remote broadcasters breaching their time-based broadcasting obligations. This amendment will allow the licensee to nominate more than one specified place in the licence area to ensure compliance with time based obligations. The amendment will ensure that viewers in remote licence areas are receiving appropriate programming for their time zone. A significant change introduced by this bill relates to the timing of the final switch-over to digital television. At present, digital switch-over dates for different licence areas are set in a series of legislative instruments made by the minister. The minister has the authority to vary the switch-over date by up to three months, as long as the final switch-over date is no later than 31 December 2013. This final date can be varied to 30 June 2014 if switching off the analog signal by 31 December 2013 would result in a significant and unforeseeable technical or engineering problem. It is likely that the final switch-over dates for metropolitan areas will need to change significantly to allow a staggered approach to the switch-over process. A staggered approach will allow the broadcasters to better manage the engineering resources needed during a switch-over. A staggered approach will also ensure the government's assistance scheme is not overstretched. The bill will allow the minister to vary the switch-over dates as required; however, 31 December 2013 will still be the last possible switch-over date that is scheduled, in the absence of technical difficulties arising. Digital television has provided a great improvement in viewing quality for many Australians, and the wide range of channels on offer these days, particularly in regional and remote areas compared with what they received previously, has certainly been welcomed. The coalition supports quality access to a range of technology services right across the country, no matter where people live. This legislation builds on that principle. It certainly works to ensure that people in regional and remote Australia have the very best television services available through this great new technology. I commend the bill to the House. which is a great thing. There might be a few luddites still floating around the House, but going digital has us moving with the rest of the world, and that is a good thing for viewers because it offers us all a range of services we could have only dreamed of once upon a time. However, in electorates like mine in regional Australia the transition can be problematic because there are black spots, and not everyone can receive new digital technology through terrestrial means. We are turning analog off, and that is obviously problematic for anyone and everyone living in a part of rural and regional Australia that is in what might be defined in colloquial terms as a black spot. This is welcome news because the government has acknowledged the problems, and the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Digital Television) Bill ensures that those people in black spot areas can move to satellite technology more quickly than they might have been able to if this bill had not been introduced and not, therefore, passed by the parliament. It reminds me that I have had many people in my electorate like Noel Googe from Wybong, who approached me at a forum earlier this year complaining about this very thing. It is good news for him and for my electorate, as well as more generally for all those who might have been disadvantaged by what is an inevitable transition and a good transition but which is, notwithstanding, a transition that could potentially disadvantage people who, after having analog removed, find themselves with a gap and an inability to secure new digital services.",267,Hesta Which Is A Fund With $18 3 Billion Of Superannuation Savings For People Working In
225,Mr Fitzgibbon (Hunter,"Chief Government Whip) (21:14): We are going digital,The digital world is moving rapidly, and it is causing all sorts of transitions all over the place. It is changing the way we all access the media, and certainly the way in which we use our local technologies. Just today we were reminded about the pace of this change and how it might impact on people differently in different areas. Tonight we are focusing on rural and regional Australia. In a sense it is timely that we are debating this bill tonight because just today Fairfax announced some considerable changes within its own organisation which I believe will have significant consequences for people who live in my region and, indeed, in other parts of rural and regional Australia. Most people in this place will remember that in 2006 Fairfax merged with Rural Press to form what was then a $9 billion media company. It goes without saying that the merger helped Australia to claim the mantle as the country with probably the highest level of media concentration in the world. Our lack of media diversity, given current events in the UK, would make the poms blush. I warned in 2006 that this merger would lead to (1) considerable job losses in journalism and production in the Hunter region and (2) a further undermining of both diversity and, indeed, local content. I remember having a pretty colourful conversation with a Fairfax executive at the time who called to admonish me because he believed my public statements at the time were misguided and misdirected. It was certainly a very robust conversation over the telephone, but I fear that my concerns expressed at that time have been somewhat vindicated. I would have been very happy to have been proven wrong. When you pick up a newspaper in the Hunter, whether it be the Newcastle Herald, the Maitland Mercury, the Cessnock Advertiser, the Singleton Argus, the Muswellbrook Chronicle, the Hunter Valley News or the Scone Advocate-and that is just in my electorate, as there are other examples in the electorates of some of my colleagues, including the member for Paterson, who I hope might show an interest in this issue-you will now be reading a Fairfax publication. In the past, with the Newcastle Herald, you would be reading a Fairfax publication, while the Maitland Mercury and those other, smaller newspapers would have been under the control of Rural Press, but it is one and the same now. For many years after the merger between Fairfax and Rural Press, if you had been listening to talkback radio-if you are such a masochist that you are inclined to do these things-you would have been listening to Radio 2UE streamed out of Sydney. Of course, 2UE is another tool of the Fairfax empire. That underscores the lack of diversity we have in the Hunter. But today, very sadly-and of great concern-Fairfax decided it would sack about half of its editorial staff not only at the Newcastle Herald but also at the Illawarra Mercury and at other places. This means that a critical part of Fairfax production will now take place in New Zealand. We are now off-shoring a significant part of our news production in the Hunter region. We want our local newspapers produced locally-in print, online and of course on our television screens. The Hunter's residents-around half a million of them with very active communities everywhere-deserve to be able to access local news. While I have no doubt that the Fairfax decision today is based on commercial consideration-that is their right and their will-I fear that it is going to be the beginning of not only the end of diversity in Hunter media but also the demise of local content. I have been concerned for some time that NBN3-which of course is a sister station of Channel 9, as is the case with all of the WIN television stations around the state-will begin to wind back its local content and focus its media presentations out of Sydney. I hope I am wrong about that. I want to make the general point that media organisations in this country enjoy the right to produce, publish and screen their information thanks to the licence given by the national government. I am not saying that it is always a licence to print money-obviously Fairfax has considerable fiscal challenges before it-but I think that with that licence should come certain obligations. In terms of the interests of Hunter residents, I think that obligation should include not only every effort to overcome diversity with independent thinking and the expression of views but also of course the guarantee that they will meet certain standards of local content in their publishing. It was a great disappointment today. We will see how things roll out tomorrow as Fairfax attempt to justify their decision. I am sure there will be a bit of spin and some guarantees that local content will remain and that they will do their best to prove that diversity does not necessarily matter because of their determination to be fair on every occasion and be independent in their thinking. But I think this is the start of a really worrying period for the Hunter in terms of media diversity and local content. I lament the decision today and I extend my support to all of those who, as a result of Fairfax's decision today, in a very short time will no longer enjoy the opportunity to be employed by Fairfax. Broadcasting Services Amendment (Digital Television) Bill 2012 and I do so because half of my electorate has just gone through the analog TV closure and I want to share some of my experiences with those Australians who still have this experience ahead of them-and that of course is most Australians. The closure of analog television must be the first government policy ever delivered to regional Australia ahead of the cities. When something good is to happen it almost always comes to the cities first and country areas have to wait years to catch up, if it happens at all. But analog TV closure is coming first to the country, and next year it will happen in the city. The country has been the test tube, and I hope that a lot has been learnt from the experience. Otherwise there is going to be chaos in the cities of Australia next year. Digital television is certainly a new experience and delivers more programming choice and usually better quality pictures. Viewers with good signal like it, and our deeply indebted government likes it because it wants to sell off the analog spectrum, raising billions of dollars. But digital signal has different characteristics from the analog signal. It is less robust and flexible in hilly and forested areas, and some people who have perfectly good analog signals may have trouble receiving digital TV at all. I know that occasionally the opposite can occur: some people can get digital signal who were not able to successfully get analog. But it seems that it is more common for digital signals to cause trouble in areas where the signal is marginal than for the old analog system to do so. Of course, part of that is that analog signal would drift off and still leave something of a picture and sound on people's television screens, whereas when digital goes bad it cannot be seen at all; it pixelates and disappears. It is particularly likely to be impacted by heavy rainfall, as well as even some other weather conditions, and that can certainly have an impact. Of course, everyone needs a new television set or a set-top box. On the basis of experience, I encourage anyone who is weighing up the difference between buying a new digital television and buying a set-top box: if you can possibly afford it, buy the new television set. Set-top boxes cause trouble. They are complicated to use, particularly for older people. The",269,Hesta Which Is A Fund With $18 3 Billion Of Superannuation Savings For People Working In
226,Mr Truss (Wide Bay,"Leader of The Nationals) (21:24): I rise to speak on theinvestment in a new television set would be looking much more towards the future than settling for a set-top box. I know the government's assistance program is built around the settop box, but I think that if they could do it again it would be better to start by giving people the $400 for a television set to avoid a whole lot of the problems that have actually occurred. The most important thing, however, is the antenna. Many people will need a new antenna. Nearly everybody needs some kind of adjustment and maybe even some new cabling. It is often said-and viewers often resent this fact, but it is sadly true-that most of the problems that are incurred in the changeover from analog to digital television are with the antenna. I know it can sometimes mean many calls, but if you have the antenna working right then reception problems are unlikely to be from your television set or any other part of the equipment in the house. In my own personal experience in my own home, in a regional city that has only moderate reception, it took several service calls. We have an external and an internal booster and we generally now have pretty good television reception. It fails us occasionally, but it is a pretty good effort. Digital reception is vulnerable to the weather, and of course in some places it cuts out altogether. In some regional areas, TV had come from local self-help transmitters, most of them funded under the coalition's Television Black Spots Program. These provided television in areas which otherwise would never have received television provided in a commercial way; they needed some financial support. Labor, with its program of conversion, chose not to convert any of those transmitters, and I think that was an error. I think that a lot of the trouble could have been avoided if the expenditure had been put into simply converting those existing transmitters to digital. But in most cases that did not happen. In some cases the television stations did put in the money, but in others they were simply closed down and people had to migrate to the satellite. There have been many, many difficulties in the conversion. Many people have had problems. I think the Digital TV Ready service were helpful. They were friendly, and generally you did not have to wait all that long on the phone. But on many occasions the problems were outside their expertise. Technicians were run off their feet. People were inevitably in the end directed towards the VAR satellite system, but it was always seen as a second-best option. People were saying, 'I had a perfectly good TV. Why was it switched off? Why have I got to spend all this extra money on a satellite system?' It is costly and the government subsidy was only available to pensioners and people migrating from self-help transmitters. But those caught in black spots, particularly those who had had an analog reception but now cannot get a digital reception, naturally felt aggrieved by these changes. However, once people have got the VAR satellite system connected, I have to say I think it is a pretty good service. It offers all the channels, it offers regional news from around Australia. It took me a long time, many questions on notice and many letters to the minister without being able to find out what was actually going to come on to those channels, and it was only when the commercial broadcasters themselves came to me only a few weeks before my area was closing down that I learned what was going to go on those channels and I was satisfied with the answers that I received. There is a new issue developing, however. The VAR service is so good that in areas still receiving analog signal many people now want access to the programs that are available on the digital network and they cannot get them even if they are in one of these black spot areas where the digital services do not come through. So now I am getting pressure in my electorate from those who have not yet been converted that they would like to access the VAR satellite. They will be entitled to it because they are in areas which are not getting any decent digital signal and they would like to be connected now. This legislation will enable that to happen and I am pleased that that is occurring. It has become especially pressing because the digital carriers are now taking a lot of the football coverage and people who have only got an analog signal and will never get a digital signal would therefore be denied those pictures. I am pleased that this bill is addressing those issues. I had a number of problems in my electorate which I would like to refer to briefly. Only half of my electorate has been switched off. The other half has to wait until the metropolitan changeover next year. That caused a number of complications, particularly in a city like Gympie where two-thirds of the city is not turned off but the other third is. There is all sorts of confusion occurring. I had a particular problem on the Cooloola Coast, where there was a fairly unusual and difficult changeover and troubles have lingered on for months. On the Cooloola Coast there was no trial period of concurrent analog and digital signals before the analog signal was turned off. The existing transmitter at Cooloola Cove was one of the selfhelp transmitters and because of a spectrum issue the transmitter had to be swapped from analog to digital on the same day. In addition, the TV channels decided at the same time to install two new transmitters to better service the area-all on the same frequency. There were some anecdotal reports that it worked okay for the first couple of days but it seemed to be nothing but trouble from then on. There was denial. No-one would take responsibility for the fact that it was not working properly. Time after time technicians were called. Others simply dismissed the concerns. But they were real. New equipment had to be installed and I think that broadly now it is working okay. New parts have been fitted but it has been a very tortuous and difficult experience. If anybody else is going to have to live through one of these changeovers that involve multiple transmitters using the same frequency, they can expect a good deal of trouble. I have a caravan park in my electorate which had permanent residents but there is no television reception following the switchover. This is a small caravan park and they cannot afford to install satellite services. They are now suffering financially because people do not want to stay at the caravan park because they cannot get any television. And there is no support available, no matter how impoverished the small business man might be, to enable a hotel, a caravan park or places like that to make the conversion. I think that is an area where there does need to be some support for the local people. I have already acknowledged the effort that was put in to helping us with our conversion by the telephone service. But I also want to commend Emma Dawson. She comes from the communications minister's office and she is sitting in the gallery. I very much appreciated her efforts to help address our problems, particularly the problems we had on the Cooloola Coast and in other parts of my electorate. We were on the phone to Emma and she to us almost every day. I am sure that she endured some of the same pain that local members endured during the switchover. The advantage for us is that members of parliament only have to do it once. It seems that she has a life sentence, as this work goes on. But having helpful, friendly people who tried to do something was a great assistance to us and, Emma, I thank you very much for the service that you provided. I hope you will be around again when the other half of my electorate gets switched off fairly soon. Another point I want to make-and it concerns quite a serious problem-is that I am currently in the process of surveying my electorate on a whole range of issues. One question I have asked is: are people satisfied with the quality of their digital television reception? We are still collating the results, but we have done enough to know that this issue is indeed going to be a significant one for us. Thirty-eight per cent of those who have responded to the survey say, four months after the switch-off, that they are dissatisfied with the quality of their digital TV reception. There will be people amongst that group who probably did not have a very good analog signal, but it strikes me as though that is a very large number. I can break down the number into those who have had a switch-off and those who still have the analog. But the dissatisfaction is probably stronger in areas where there has not been a switch-off. That will just be a coincidence and the numbers are not all that different. But 38 per cent of the people in my electorate, four months after the switch-off, are dissatisfied with the quality of their digital reception. That is an issue and I suspect that other members of parliament will run across similar issues. I will certainly be raising this with the television channels, because they have a responsibility to ensure that there is a good-quality reception available. There may be technical issues also that have to be addressed in association with the changeover in other parts of Australia to ensure that some of these problems do not occur. In years to come we will look back on this and say that it was only a momentary issue, and people will grow up used to digital television and the better quality pictures, better sound and so forth that it delivers. But, for those who still have the digital switchover ahead of them, you can expect some troubles and some trying times. It is probably worth it in the end, but you will wonder about that every day while the changeover is occurring. the member for Wide Bay on the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Digital Television) Bill 2012 as to whether or not the Nationals are in favour of this proposal, whether they are pro analog or pro digital or whether they are happy or unhappy with the process.

I think we will be entirely in the chair's hands. fighting spirit and our alliance, Chair. people say about the world of analog, you would think it was perfect. The experience in my electorate is that analog was far from perfect. There are people living in a couple of suburbs, Hillbank and Craigmore, with a population of some 15,000 people, in the metropolitan area of Adelaide, who for about 20-odd years had terrible reception. It was an ongoing problem. We had a situation where the TV broadcasters, the council and the federal government would all point the bone at each other and say it was someone else's responsibility to provide a retransmission tower. That situation went on forever, for 20 years. People could not get the",271,Hesta Which Is A Fund With $18 3 Billion Of Superannuation Savings For People Working In

231,Mr Champion,"I withdraw. Big changes like this are never easy but, in hearing whatcricket, could not get the football and could not get soccer-and this was in the metropolitan area. When people talk to me about analog being a perfect era, I have to say frankly that the experience of many of my electors is that it simply was not. That goes for some of the country areas as well. In Craigmore it is a story with a happy ending, and that is because of Emma Dawson, who the Nationals graciously paid tribute to. Her hard work was also useful to my electors in the seat of Wakefield, particularly those in the two suburbs of Hillbank and Craigmore. Ms Dawson, with the minister's help and as part of an election commitment in 2007, provided a new digital tower which has fixed all of the problems that those two suburbs were having. They are growing suburbs, where people work hard and do the right thing. They expect to be able to get a good TV signal and watch the footy, the cricket and the soccer. This retransmission tower has been a great success. It has been much welcomed. When we opened it about 50 to 100 people turned out on a Friday afternoon to watch the tower being erected. That is a pretty strong turnout. I suspect most of them came to make sure that it was getting constructed and that I was fulfilling my promises. That is an important thing for local residents, and it is important for local members to make sure that their election commitments are met. It was one of my proudest moments as a local MP. This bill is particularly important. It must pass during the winter sittings in order to provide VAST services for viewers in digital television black-spot areas in major population centres in Adelaide, Brisbane, Darwin, Hobart, Perth and Sydney. As I said before, these black spots are not unknown in metropolitan areas. They often cover vast areas and vast numbers of people. For too long we left the television stations to some degree off the hook. We left it to local communities to shoulder the burden of providing these towers. The advent of a digital signal has meant that the situation, certainly for my constituents, has changed. This bill is very important because it is a $375 million initiative which will provide digital free-to-air services from the new satellite platform known as the VAST service. This will be particularly important for my rural constituents, who have often had indifferent analog services. As the member of the Nationals said, many of these people suffer from a digital signal that may be intermittent or affected by hills and valleys or the weather. That is the experience of some of the residents in areas around the Clare and Gilbert valleys. I have asked many of those residents, through the local paper, to provide us with feedback so we can point them to the services that they might need to provide. At Lyndoch and in parts of the Barossa Valley it is also an issue for some rural properties. This is a good bill. It provides for a good service. As I said, I do not think we have much to fear from change. My constituents have benefited greatly from this government's program, and I think the minister and his office should be commended for their work. Ms MARINO (Forrest-Opposition Whip) (21:44): The Broadcasting Services Amendment (Digital Television) Bill 2012 relates to the provision of access to digital television via satellite services. Of particular interest is the following aim, as described in the explanatory memorandum:  facilitating earlier access, in particular circumstances, to the digital commercial satellite television services licensed under section 38C of the BSA (known as the Viewer Access Satellite Television (VAST)) in areas where it is considered viewers will not be able to receive adequate reception of all the applicable terrestrial digital commercial television services at the time of digital switchover … I wanted to explore some of the background of this to identify some of the significant issues. Satellite delivery of a digital television signal, as we know, is not new technology, and it is not even cost restrictive for most Australians. For Australians who live in or around a metropolitan area-around 90 per cent of the population-satellite coverage is a moot point; it is mostly irrelevant to that 90 per cent. With 70 per cent living in our major cities and another 20 per cent in the surrounding areas, we are probably amongst the most urbanised nations on earth. It is therefore simple and economically viable for television service providers to invest in adequate terrestrial infrastructure to provide a more-than-adequate signal to nine out of 10 Australians. As with most other services, however, the city-country divide again falls on the side that is to the advantage of those who live in our urban areas. We have heard of TV black spots in certain urban areas, but most urban residents would not have an understanding of the fade-outs and pixelation that face regional viewers all of the time. Naturally, we regional viewers understand pretty well-although we might not always like it-why our service is poorer than that of our city cousins. We are spread out over a large area and we do understand that it would cost more to deliver to us the same standard of service that city viewers demand; it is basic economics at work. Terrestrial digital antennas deliver a signal that has a limited range and is frequently disrupted. A good antenna might have an effective signal with a range of 100 kilometres, but this depends on the hardware and the software used by the signal provider. It also depends on the topography of the area, because the signal, as we know, is line of sight and that is easily disrupted. If the antenna is in the middle of Sydney, obviously that 100-kilometre range reaches a lot of homes. In some parts of regional Australia, including parts of my electorate, given the topography, the signal does not even reach your neighbour's house, as Deputy Speaker Scott would be aware. There are of course a vast range of people in the middle, but it is obvious that regional Australians have a greater chance of receiving poorer or poor signals. If someone is far from a terrestrial antenna, they may get no signal or a very poor signal sometimes, if they are lucky. They can apply to the viewer access satellite television service for permission to receive a satellite signal. They can buy the appropriate hardware and software and could receive a very good high-definition signal. Many have already done so, but many applicants have not been successful. Under the access provisions for VAST, there is a time period of six months prior to the switch-off of the analog signal in which people are able to apply to VAST. As the switch-off for WA is not likely to be until August 2013, many households in my electorate and throughout Western Australia are not yet able to apply. Additionally, people are currently only able to apply for VAST services if they are in an area that does not receive digital terrestrial transmission from a commercial broadcaster's tower or if they are in an area of very poor signal reception. If they are within an area that is supposed to receive good digital terrestrial service but for some reason does not, they can apply and they will assess the strength of the signal to determine if they are eligible for VAST. I note that, if they want just ABC and SBS, they can access VAST for just those channels. But this aspect of signal strength, especially the assessment of it for regional households, has the greatest impact on people's ability to access the service. The legislation preventing households from subscribing to VAST if they are within an area that receives a digital terrestrial signal from a commercial broadcast tower, even if they consider it a poor signal, is outlined in the Broadcasting Services Act under the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Television) Act 2010. It is this assessment of an 'adequate' versus 'poor' signal that is most difficult. The digital television signal will in fact carry a long way further than the 100 kilometres mentioned before-many times further. However, it is only for the first 100 kilometres or so that the signal retains sufficient strength to be picked up and displayed by the receiving television set-there is no distinct cut-off point. The range that can result in inadequate signal reception varies dramatically depending, as I said, on topography and climate. Trees and buildings also disrupt the digital signal. As the range increases, the quality and strength of the signal declines and that results in pixilation and channel freeze, for example. You may be granted access to VAST if you are predicted to be in a poor coverage area and you are likely to experience difficulties receiving the available digital TV services some or all of the time. However, this depends on a bureaucratic process accepting that your television reception is not up to standard. The real trouble comes when you are classified as being in a variable coverage area. Common sense tells us that someone in such a designation does not get a consistent or constant quality signal and that therefore their access to VAST should be obvious; but unfortunately this is not the case. Currently the system seems to believe that it is perfectly acceptable for country people to receive a lower standard of reception than city viewers do, and many whose reception is well below standard are being refused access to satellite services. If someone tries to apply for VAST at the moment and they are not eligible because they are in the wrong area or it is not yet open for applications, two things will automatically happen when they apply. Firstly, they will automatically be refused. Secondly, the application will be referred to a review process and then there will be an investigation into the reasons for which they were refused. The review process, however, seems to not understand or have little interest in the need for regional viewers to be able to access an equivalent standard of reception, and it appears to be a double standard. SoI ask: why restrict the access to satellite signals? I have been told that there are two reasons to restrict access to the VAST satellite services at the moment, particularly in Western Australia. Apparently, it is in part to protect customers from the costs of signing up and maintaining satellite services that they may not need. I find that to be a relatively disingenuous reason. Of my constituents, there are some who are prepared to invest in the service. But, more importantly, restriction of access is apparently designed to ensure that commercial broadcasters are able to achieve a return from their terrestrial transmission infrastructure, especially the cost of converting it to digital to ensure the availability of terrestrial signals without the need for satellite installation in the future. I understand there was a fear in the government and amongst television providers that, if VAST services were available to all, people would migrate en masse from the terrestrial transmission to the satellite. From this I assume that net return on investment on antenna installation is a key factor in who is allowed to access a satellite signal. But is it actually good enough to allow regional communities to endure lower quality services in the meantime in order to subsidise antenna capital costs? It is a question that really does need answering, because that is where so many people are at. Is there really any guarantee that regional services will ever catch up? That is a question that exercises the minds of those of us who represent regional and more remote areas. Many regional viewers currently receiving an Aurora television signal will be able to access digital satellite via the VAST system; however, some of those who live in regional areas and who have previously had access to Aurora will be prevented from accessing the VAST system because someone who has never seen their TV reception or the limit of it has decided from lines on a map that they already get an adequate terrestrial service. This is obviously not working and is a slap in the face to rural and regional Australians, who unfortunately appear to have been the target of the government on more than one occasion. There is one remaining key issue here: who gets to decide if the terrestrial signal of a person's TV is adequate? According to a letter I received from the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, the commercial broadcasters decide if the signal is up to standard. Given that access is denied mainly so that the antenna costs of commercial broadcasters can be underwritten, it seems strange that they themselves determine the application. Of course, those denied can appeal to ACMA-the Australian Communications and Media Authority-but I would really like to know how many times there has been a reversal of the original decision. I think it would be much simpler if an independent umpire decided whether the digital signal that a country viewer received was adequate, and I would hope that they might even seek an equivalent signal to that available to our city peers. As we know, the digital satellite signal already covers Australia; what is needed is for people to be able to receive it in regional and remote areas. time, Mr Deputy Speaker, I am happy if you would prefer to adjourn, and I will start afresh in the morning.
