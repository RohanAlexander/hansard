277,The Speaker,"The answer to the honThursday, 12 August 2004 ----Barbaro, Montana would like to raise a disturbing event that occurred in the new division of Gorton, which I hope to represent after the next election. This matter has had an extraordinary impact upon the whole nation, as I think it touches on one of our most elemental fears: the sudden disappearance of a child. I am speaking of course about the alleged abduction of baby Montana Barbaro at the Brimbank shopping centre last Saturday. The baby’s parents, Anita Ciancio and Joe Barbaro, are obviously relieved to have their child returned to them alive and healthy, and I would like to offer my best wishes to them in their recovery from this traumatic event in the days and weeks to come. I would like to say how grateful for and impressed I am by the performance of the police and emergency services in this matter, in combination with the media. The emergency was resolved in an extremely short time and with a minimum of extra trauma to the parents, which does the police and emergency services nothing but credit. I would also like to take the opportunity to commend a group which we are often eager to criticise in this place-namely, the media. Both the print and the electronic media reacted swiftly by spreading accurate information about the events at Brimbank and made it possible for a local to assist the police by passing on vital information that put baby Montana back in the arms of her mother. The local to whom I refer-a jogger, Lesley, I understand-happened to be passing the derelict North Melbourne house and alerted emergency services after she heard the baby’s whimpering from outside. Her first thought upon hearing the child was that it must be the baby Montana, as she had heard the news reports. I am pleased to say that the matter is proceeding through the courts with a couple currently in custody. I hope the case passes through with a minimum of fuss and stress added to that already suffered by the parents. I inform the committee that we have present in the gallery this morning members of a Commonwealth Parliamentary Association delegation from the United Kingdom. On behalf of the committee, I extend a very warm welcome to our visitors. Honourable members-Hear, hear! Environment: Great Barrier Reef Marine Park this morning, because I would like to talk about a part of Australia that is larger in size than the United Kingdom.

281,Mr Lindsay (Herbert) (9.42 A.m.),"It is appropriate that the delegation is here with uslia and indeed the people of the world that we have to do everything that we can to protect this wonderful asset that lies off the Queensland coast. I pay a tribute to the Catholic bishops for taking the stance that they do on this protection. The document says: As the Catholic bishops of Queensland, we have written this letter to emphasise our shared ecological responsibility for one of the greatest national natural treasures, the Great Barrier Reef. Care for the environment and a keener ecological awareness have become a key moral issue for the Christian conscience. Good on them for standing up and saying that. They go on: We cannot realistically love our neighbours and leave out the neighbourhood in which they live, nor can we pretend to respect that neighbourhood without understanding it is a life-sustaining environment. Some in Queensland-indeed, some in Australia-really think that the government did the wrong thing in relation to the Representative Areas Program. For the information of the delegation here today, the government and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, which manages the reef system, embarked on a process to lock up more than 30 per cent of the reef system as representative areas so that future generations could have examples of the ecosystems of the reef and, of course, to make the reef system sustainable. It was done on a sound scientific basis. It was questioned by those who felt that you could rape and pillage and do whatever you wanted to do in the environment-those who felt that it was their right and that the government should not interfere. The government should interfere. The government has a responsibility, as the Catholic bishops quite rightly point out, to make sure that our environment and our wonderful Great Barrier Reef are protected for future generations. I know that it has been a wonderful exercise and that we are the envy of the world in what we have been able to do. I encourage the members of the delegation to have a closer look at that to see what you might be able to do in your part of the world. Health and Ageing: Funding Ms GRIERSON (Newcastle) (9.45 a.m.)-TodayI wish to lodge a petition, signed in my electorate over the past two weekends by 536 people, calling on the government to provide ongoing funds to secure the long-term future of the Hunter GP access after-hours service. The petition notes that this is an essential service for our region, providing in its first year an extra 40,332 bulk-billed consultations across five clinics and professional telephone advice to more than 45,000 patients. It delivered more than 500 home visits in its first year. It has also reduced by 20 to 60 per cent walk-in patient workloads at our public hospital emergency departments. We have asked for ongoing funding, but we have found out this week that the Minister for Health and Ageing, Tony Abbott, has announced a one-year stay of execution. We do not know what that means and we are not very excited about it.

Rather than the hard policy work being done, we get the cheap bandaid fix. It is not good enough. The minister is arguing that a one-year extension will enable the government to properly evaluate this service. The service has been going for four years, and in its first expanded year its outcomes are outstanding. My 536 petitioners represent only the tip of the iceberg of widespread community support for the Hunter GP access after hours service. We have a message for Tony Abbott: only long-term sustainability of this essential health care service in our community will convince us that the Howard government is at all serious about our health care. We suggest that he goes back to the drawing board. Another example of bad policy impacting on the health of regional Australia is the outrageous decision made by the Minister for Education, Science and Training to restrict the number of HECS medical places at the University of Newcastle to just 80 per year, despite ongoing calls for an increase of 40 each year to 120. One hundred and twenty places are needed just to meet the demand of our public hospitals. It would not do anything more than that. This decision to restrict Newcastle’s medical places is in spite of evidence of a strong correlation between a GP’s place of training and where the GP subsequently practises. It is scandalous that the minister has refused to grant any additional medical places in a regional university which specialises in training GPs. What is his solution for the future? Apparently he is going to leave the oversupply of doctors in Sydney and will not make any attempts to put doctors into regions with chronic shortages like Newcastle. What he and John Howard are going to do is spend millions of taxpayers’ dollars to establish a private medical school in Sydney rather than put extra places into regional universities and see those regional GPs serving regions where the shortages are extreme. For the sake of my region’s health and the nation’s health, we do need a Labor government and very soon. (Time expired) The petition read as followsTo the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House: That the Hunter GP Access After Hours service is an essential service in the Newcastle and Hunter Region providing an extra 40,332 bulk-billed consultations across five clinics, professional telephone advice to more than 45,000 patients and delivering more than 500 home visits in its first year of operation. That the Hunter GP Access After Hours service has led to reductions of 20-60% in ‘walk-in’ patient workloads at public hospital emergency departments across the Hunter region. Despite a chronic shortage of GPs in Newcastle and the Hunter region, more than 240 doctors are working in the Hunter GP Access After Hours service. That the Hunter GP Access After Hours is not a trial service it is a new service providing essential health care to more than 450,000 people in the region.

Agriculture: Apple and Pear Industry Dr STONE (Murray-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage) (9.48 a.m.)-I wish to present a petition on behalf of 2,388 petitioners which is addressed to the Hon. the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament. The petition is from certain citizens of Australia and it reads: … we the undersigned: totally reject any plans that expose Australia’s apple and pear industry to fire blight. Fire blight would devastate our apple trees and kill off our pear industry. Fire blight spreads rapidly and is incurable. We request that the House joins us in condemning the draft Biosecurity Australia interim risk assessment which recommends the importation of fresh apples from New Zealand. Quite clearly, this is not a trade issue. Sometimes the New Zealand industry claims that all Australians in the apple and pear industry are simply afraid of some competition. This is about a deadly disease-apple and pear fire blight-which, once it has established in any country, has been found to be incurable. It leads to a significant curtailing of the vigour and thriving of the apple industry. When it comes to pears, you do not have a pear industry and fire blight. I need to make the point that the electorate of Murray is a remote regional electorate. A lot of people had to drive several hours to put their names on this petition. Since the commencement of the petition, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, the Hon. Warren Truss, has taken measures to substantially improve the process. Now, the draft interim risk assessments will be subject to the review of eminent persons-a scientist’s review-and I am very grateful that Mr Truss has understood the issues and problems that have long been identified by stakeholders. The eminent scientists for the new process were announced just yesterday. That process is going to give us a lot more confidence in the way that the science will be dealt with. A draft interim risk assessment will be developed in the first instance followed by an independent scientist review. In the electorate of Murray, we have more than 90 per cent of the pear industry of Australia. It is the underpinning of a manufactured fruit industry. Without our pear industry we will not see great companies like SPC Ardmona, who are one of the last Australian owned fruit manufacturing companies, produce magnificent product for both domestic and export markets. One of our concerns is the fruit labelling issue. The CER agreement means that New Zealand apples would not even be labelled as coming from New Zealand. So, if they were allowed to come in, Australians could not even demonstrate with their eating habits their concern about that fruit being in the country and they could not take special care with the cores, peels and any remains after they had eaten the fresh fruit because it would not be labelled as coming from New Zealand. In tabling this petition I wish to say that this is a very important issue.

Braddon Electorate: Penguin Skills Centre the Penguin Skills Centre, which is located at Penguin High School in my electorate, overlooking the beautiful Bass Strait. The Penguin Skills Centre is a special place that promotes, nurtures and delivers lifelong learning. It fulfils all the needs for lifelong learning that are stated in the Tasmanian government’s A State of Learning objectives. It has 130 students, primarily adult learners, under the coordination of Liz Ryan. It has one full-time VET coordinator/manager and five part-time and several sessional trainers. It delivers a variety of important courses taken up by adults who are returning to learning, in most cases. It offers certificates II and III in community services, aged care and child care and certificates I and II in visual arts and contemporary crafts. It delivers a very special mentoring program in the community, and it offers certificates I and II in information technology. It also provides a program of basic IT enabling skills for older workers, of which there are 40 participants for 2004-05. There is a competitive bids IT certificate II. They provide certificate training places at both Wilmot and Sheffield, which are spread far and wide from Penguin. It also provides an ANTA innovative literacy project. Some of the mentoring programs, particularly provided by Aboriginal groups, play a very important role. Penguin Skills Centre has also received local, state and federal recognition for its courses. I publicly record my appreciation of the Penguin Skills Centre, particularly to its coordinator Liz Ryan. But I am concerned as I have heard there are proposals in the wings that they may phase out certificate III level training packages at skills centres throughout Tassie-and that of course would include at the Penguin Skill Centre. I believe that TAFE Tasmania will become the controlling body. I am concerned about that because I think it undermines the very nature of continuing learning and lifelong learning in a community, where an organisation such as the Penguin Skills Centre has built up a tremendous network of connections and connectivity with its community, employers and local groups. I would hate to see that undermined and the viability of these skills centres threatened. Grills, Mrs Ethel dents gathered at the Winfield State School to celebrate the 90th birthday of a truly remarkable and gracious lady, Mrs Ethel Grills. The day was made even more special with the attendance of Mrs Grill’s loving family and friends, many of whom travelled considerable distances to attend the day, coming from Brisbane, Miles, Tara and New South Wales centres.

In fact, it was Mrs Grill’s father-in-law, Ernest Jacob Grills, who originally donated to the Queensland Education Department in the 1920s the five acre parcel of land on which the school stands. For many years Mrs Grills continued the family’s association with the school, serving on school committees, and teaching sewing to the students for 29 years. She used to travel to those lessons on a bicycle across very rough roads; that is a mark of her dedication. Many of those same sewing students returned to the school to help Mrs Grills celebrate her big day. It was quite clear by the turnout of people at the party that Mrs Grills gave her heart and soul to the Winfield community, to the point that many guests were invited to make a donation to the Winfield Community Hall Fund, one of her family’s pet projects. Mrs Grills and her late husband, Ernest John, raised their eight children on a mixed enterprise farm. It is an interesting aside that, after her husband’s death in 1981, Mrs Grills took over the duties of collecting and reporting data for the Bureau of Meteorology. For 22 years Mrs Grills provided the general public with accurate rainfall figures and the like, which is vital to a community such as Winfield, heavily reliant on rain for agriculture. On the day, I was pleased to be able to read a congratulatory letter from the Prime Minister, while Burnett Shire Mayor, Ray Duffy, read out a letter of commendation from the Bureau of Meteorology. Although Mrs Grills moved to a care facility in Bundaberg earlier this year, I know she greatly enjoyed coming back to Winfield to celebrate her birthday amongst her family and friends. Her children, Robert, Melvyn, Graham, Ferna, Delphene, Clifford, Jeffery and Christine as well as grandchildren-all of whom are still living in the Bundaberg districtdeserve genuine commendation for their efforts in organising this community event.

New England Electorate: Health Services ment debate about a survey on health that I recently carried out in my electorate of New England. The survey, comprising six questions, was answered by 8,380 people within the electorate. I thank those people for the effort that they put in not only in responding to the survey but also in writing letters, many of which related personal experiences with respect to the delivery of health care-the problems, the good points et cetera. As I said, 8,380 people responded to the survey, which is about a 16 per cent response rate on the number of surveys that we sent out. I think it was an excellent response; it was similar to that received to a survey on Telstra a couple of years ago. I would like to go through the results of that survey. As many members would know, there is currently a merger process going on with some of the area health services within New South Wales.

290,Mr Windsor (New England) (9.58 A.m.),"I would like to speak today in the adjournfurther down the track. The merger process that was under way at the time was between the New England Area Health Service and the Hunter Area Health Service. Asked whether they supported that merger, 93 per cent of the respondents said no, 2.3 per cent said yes and 4.7 per cent were undecided. The other issues that were canvassed were in relation to dental health. On the question ‘Should dental health work be covered by Medicare?’ 92 per cent of the respondents said yes, five per cent said no and three per cent were undecided. That is a very appropriate question to ask at this particular time. At the recent budget, the government made some positive moves in the right direction to include some aspects of dental care under Medicare. I do not think that has gone far enough. I understand that the Labor Party are moving in a further direction in relation to that as well. I would encourage both the government and the opposition to look very carefully at the results of this survey and particularly at the issue of dental care. If we do not look after oral health we are going to end up with some enormous expenses further down the track in terms of bodily health. It amazes me that we have not included dental health in Medicare in the past. Bulk-billing is another significant issue. I asked the question, ‘Does your local doctor bulkbill?’ and 34.6 per cent said yes, 58.2 per cent said no and 7.2 per cent did not know, so obviously they are in good health and are not going to their doctors. Those figures are quite alarming. I ask the Minister for Health and Ageing to release the bulk-billing figures. I know that they have changed the rulings on that recently. I think the December ruling was that about 47 per cent of New England doctors were bulk-billing. This survey indicates that it is not improving, and we need to take these figures on board. I asked, ‘Which level of government do you want in charge of our hospitals?’ I apologise for this question because I think it was actually interpreted in slightly different ways. I know that debate is taking place at the moment between the Commonwealth health minister and the state ministers. The answer is interesting, but, because of the way the question was framed, I do not know whether we can take a lot from it. A lot of people in New England are very upset with the Carr Labor government at the moment, with the health merger, and that had some impact on the way in which this question was answered. Forty-one per cent said that they would rather see the federal government take charge of our health system, 20 per cent said the state government, 24 per cent said the local government-that is where there is a bit of a merging of the question-and 15 per cent were undecided. Another issue of great importance-and I highlight this one-is that people would vote for an increase in the Medicare levy from 1.5 per cent to two per cent. Eighty-one per cent of people said that they would vote for that. Ninety-one per cent said that they wanted the University of New England to be the facility for a medical school and allied health services in order to train and retain doctors and allied health service professionals within country areas. (Time expired) Lindsay Electorate: Environmental Protection Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay-Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (10.03 a.m.)-TodayI would like to raise an issue for which I have fought very long and hard-and very well, I think-in my local area, and that is the preservation of the environmentally sensitive lands at the ADI site. Since Labor first wanted to sell the land, it has been a sore point for the constituents in my area. This government commissioned an Australian Heritage CommisMAIN COMMITTEE sion report on the land, and over 850 hectares were listed by the Australian Heritage Commission. Just prior to the last election, the then environment minister, Senator Robert Hill, announced the preservation of another 300-odd hectares on the site, so that the entire site would be protected by an AHC listing. Since that time the remainder of the site has gone forward in the development process. Certainly I fought to preserve some sporting precincts within the area because there was so much environmental land. The point of environmental land is that it is environmental land and you cannot have a barbecue, play footy or ride your BMX bike or skateboard there. You certainly cannot take a trail bike through it. The area was always slated for urban infill because it is totally surrounded by urban areas. In Western Sydney we are in the burbs-pram city, as I call it. It is a place of children. If children see a park like that, with an open green space and a creek, they are going to climb under the fence, get inside and have a great time. They are going to come home to mum dirty and muddy up to the knees, they will not really tell mum where they have been and they will get cleaned up and have dinner. In the meantime, some very sensitive land has been destroyed. It is important that the existing fence remain. I propose that inside that fence we erect another fence-a vermin-proof fence which goes three feet down into the ground and prevents dogs and other vermin from burrowing underneath the fence. It should go up six feet and have railings that project out towards the existing fence. That should have about three strands of barbed wire along it as well as two electrified wires. This prevents cats and other vermin getting over the top of the fence. Within the environmental precinct you would also run your ducks and white chooks so that, if any vermin do get inside, they normally catch the ducks and chooks first. You can then see that you have an intruder. Over time you rebuild your natural flora and fauna. With that comes the birdlife and nesting. You end up with a real state-of the-art environmental precinct and you preserve and enhance all of those values that we have fought so hard to preserve on those 850 hectares. It is critical that the environmental precinct stays fenced. A wonderful private enterprise example of this is Warrawong sanctuary, north of Adelaide. I visited Warrawong some time back during my fight on this thing. The vision that I have had is that private enterprise would move into the conservation area. Always leaving conservation to government is a tall ask. At the end of the day we have only so much money that we take off the taxpayers. Generally things like medicine, health and education get higher priorities than perhaps the environment does. We slice off these big areas and leave them unattended, but the National Parks and Wildlife Service is poorly funded to do its job over such a huge area. Consequently our kids, our trail bike riders and other people jump the bollards, come in through the parks and destroy some very sensitive areas. In the Warrawong example you actually have a paid entry point and local residents get so many passes a year to bring visitors in. You can generate wooden boardwalks above the environmentally sensitive areas and really have a superlative tourist attraction right here in our own backyard. I really recommend fencing of the environmental land in the state management plan. (Time expired) Olympic Games 2004 Ms VAMVAKINOU (Calwell) (10.08 a.m.)-I want to take the opportunity to say a few words today about the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens. As we all know, tomorrow at some time in the very early hours of the morning, the official opening ceremony is due to get under MAIN COMMITTEE way. I am absolutely certain that, in the next two weeks, Australia and the rest of the world will be absolutely transfixed by the action taking place in Athens. For us here in Australia, the excitement and interest will be greater, I think, than elsewhere, not only because just four years ago we experienced similar excitement and world attention when we staged the very successful Sydney 2000 Games but also because Australia is home to a very large Greek community. In particular, my home town of Melbourne has legendary status as the city with the greatest proportion of the Greek diaspora. Australia’s participation and involvement in the Athens Games is very much defined by the special relationship that this country has with Greece. When I visited the Mayor of Athens, Dora Bakoyiannis, last October, she was very keen to convey to me and through me to the House the sentiments and affection of the people of Greece for the people of Australia. She made the point to me last year that ‘we are like family’ and there is no need for Australians to feel insecure and unsafe about travelling to Greece. Of course, I took the liberty of reassuring the mayor that most Australians felt comfortable about travelling to Greece, and certainly those lucky enough to be attending the games were very much looking forward to the experience. We are all keenly aware that the Olympic Games are being held against a backdrop of international terrorism and world conflict. I think everybody knows that. I can assure this House, as the mayor of Athens and other Greek government and Olympic officials have-and indeed as have our own Olympic officials-that the Greeks have made security their No. 1 priority. They have invested lots of time and, might I say, money-millions and millions of euros-and effort into doing everything they possibly can to keep participants, particularly athletes, and that includes our athletes, safe and secure. I know that our athletes have been looking forward to the games and to the competition. We have read about the efforts and the very hard training that go into getting ready for the Olympic Games. They have now all left this country for the games-I certainly hope they are all there-taking with them our hopes and our aspirations. I would like to take this opportunity to offer them my support and my electorate’s support and good wishes, and we wish them the best of luck. It is very important during a time of some apprehension, given the international circumstances, to concentrate on the positives. I am sure that our athletes, as well as the Australian Olympic Committee, want to focus on winning medals rather than being distracted by fear. I know that they have not been distracted from the main game, and I am also confident that the Greek authorities are well placed to provide the security and safety for the athletes of the world, including our own athletes. The 2004 Athens Olympics will also be great games. They will be particularly special, I think, because they are returning back to their place of birth. I think no city in the world, despite all the tremendous efforts, can ever recreate the atmosphere of the original place of birth. It is a shame that our colleagues from the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association from Britain have left the chamber. But given that they were here, I want to take the opportunity to say that it is indeed a great pity and quite sad that the British government and the British Museum were unable to assist in the reconstitution of the Parthenon marbles. I know for a fact that in Greece, in the worldwide movement and in Australia in particular there is support for that to occur. I look forward to speaking to the private member’s motion of the member for Kooyong in the next sitting on the reconstitution of the Parthenon marbles. I know that this MAIN COMMITTEE House will support that reconstitution. It is a shame that the 2004 Games in Athens will not see the Parthenon marbles reconstituted to Greece. In any case, the theme of the Athens Games is the unification of civilisations. They are celebrating the world’s diversity and rich cultural heritage. I am sure that we Australians can relate very well to that theme. We often celebrate our cultural diversity, which is the cornerstone of our multicultural identity. As I said, Australia has a very special place in the minds of the people of Athens. In fact, when the games ended in Sydney in 2000, many Australians followed the flame to Athens. Australian expertise and knowledge has been involved in assisting in the preparation for 2004, including people like Michael Knight and Peter Ryan and the many volunteers(Time expired) Canning Electorate: Mandurah Bypass the Labor Party’s road funding gestures in my electorate that occurred several weeks ago. I have spoken on this issue in the House before. After this year’s federal budget, it was announced as part of the AusLink program that $150 million would be spent on the Mandurah bypass in my electorate and on the completion of the Kwinana Freeway, which coincidently is in the electorate of Brand. That was the figure that the state government and the minister, Alannah MacTiernan, had asked for as the 50 per cent share for completing this freeway and building the Mandurah bypass, which is crucial to transport and infrastructure not only in my electorate and the Peel region but in the south-west of Western Australia. Senator Ian Campbell, the then Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads, announced this money in Mandurah. Following this announcement, I said that the money was readily available-it was in the forward estimates; it was in the budget-and could be accessed forthwith. However, the minister of the state Labor government, who have to build these roads-we give them the money and they do the job-said, ‘No, we don’t want to build this road until 2009.’ As a result of pressure by the then minister, Senator Ian Campbell, she brought that date back to 2008, and then even suggested 2007. We believe, on advice from Main Roads Western Australia, that this road could be built and begun in early 2006. As a result, benefits would flow to the people of Western Australia and the regions that I have described. However, something happened a few weeks ago that was quite baseless politicking, without any sincerity to it. The federal Labor transport spokesman, Martin Ferguson, the member for Batman, arrived in Mandurah along with the member for Brand and the candidate for Canning-we are not sure if she is still the candidate for Canning after this morning’s news or whether she has resigned-along with the state minister for transport. They said that a federal Labor government would give $170 million to this project-an extra $20 million. We are now in a Dutch auction for the Mandurah bypass. I wonder why they are going to need an extra $20 million. One can only surmise that, if you allow the time for a road to be built to blow out by two years, the road will cost a lot more to build. If they actually got on and built this road when Main Roads said they could build it, it could be done for the figure they asked for, which was $150 million-$75 million for the completion of the freeway and $75 million for the bypass. But no. The state minister-who is part of the guilty party on this-then said the state government would up the ante and put an extra $20 million in too. Here is extra expenditure of $40 million on a road for which they asked for $150 million to build. It could be built for that amount; Main Roads have costed it out at that now. What is the MAIN COMMITTEE",201,Adjournment
291,Mr Randall (Canning) (10.13 A.m.),"I wish to slam the cynicism and opportunism ofproblem? The problem is, as I have described, the delay. They do not want to do it until at least two years later. The other problem is that the state transport minister is in the process of building a very expensive railway from Perth to Mandurah. The cost started off at about $1.8 billion. It is now $2.3 billion and rising. All the road and transport infrastructure funding is being sucked into this railway, which by some estimates will take only 400 people a day between Mandurah and Perth. It has been estimated by some that you could actually give those 400 people a brandnew Hyundai car every three years and a fuel card and it would still cost less over a period of time than building the Mandurah railway. I am not against the Mandurah railway; it is just the wrong route and the cost has just blown out. But let us get back to Martin Ferguson, the member for Batman, going down there. One of the other reasons why the cost is blowing out is the collusive tendering arrangements that the state government has entered into. By way of example, I mention the speech I made in this place not so long ago about the Tonkin Highway. The cost of that was estimated to be $105 million. It is now $145 million. Why? Because, as I said at the time, Leightons and their associated companies got together and settled on a price which saw it blow out from $105 million to $145 million. I am urging the state government to stop playing games with the Mandurah bypass, to stop playing games with building the freeway and to get on and put the necessary infrastructure into the region. Be serious about it now: build the road and stop the cynical opportunism about the Mandurah bypass. (Time expired) Environment: Mandatory Renewable Energy Targets Scheme sponse to the government’s so-called energy white paper recently and I found it very sobering. It reinforces what I have had to say on a number of occasions in this House on the issue of lack of support for renewables in the government’s energy white paper. I would like to share some of Hydro Tasmania’s responses to the energy white paper. I note that Hydro Tasmania recognise the importance of fossil fuels in meeting Australia’s energy needs-as we all doand recognise that, like elsewhere throughout the world, renewable energy will also contribute significantly to meeting our growing energy demands. They are not mutually exclusive, as some would have us believe. Hydro Tasmania recognise that MRET has been retained but are concerned that the key findings of the government’s Tambling report-that is, in terms of target size and duration-have been ignored. I think that was the great shock in this energy white paper. It shocked Minister Kemp so much that he resigned. Hydro Tasmania welcomes the funding opportunities for renewable energy but is concerned that, without a strengthened MRET and emissions trading, the market required to deploy new and developing technologies will only exist overseas-not here but overseas. Hydro Tasmania’s $1.4 billion renewable energy program needs a strengthened MRET; otherwise it will stall by 2007 due to a lack of commercial viability and a restricted market. This is the same for all other renewable energy developers. It is okay to provide funding for research and development for the development of greater efficiencies, particularly at the up-front stage of developing renewable energies but, if you do not have a market, what is the incentive? I cannot see the logic to it. Hydro Tasmania also recognises, like all of us, that significant regional development, manufacturing, jobs and investment will not proceed unless MRET levels are strengthened. Already the industry is in a state of high uncertainty. Haywards Engineering, for MAIN COMMITTEE",205,Adjournment
292,Mr Sidebottom (Braddon) (10.18 A.m.),"I became aware of Hydro Tasmania’s reinstance, are involved in the base works for the wind turbines, and Vestas, which is located in my electorate, was very close to introducing a blade manufacturing plant. That is on hold and has a very uncertain future. One of the main areas of concern-and I have tried to raise this in the House before and publicly in my newsletter, which is now doing the rounds through the electorate-relates to the exaggerated claims of electricity price increases to households if an MRET is increased. Some of the figures thrown out by Senators Abetz and Colbeck are absolutely outrageous. Comparing oranges with apples and a whole European energy system with Tasmania’s is quite ludicrous and illogical, but that is the type of stuff they are pumping out as apologists for this government’s failure to support renewable energy in the energy white paper. I would like to present some figures from ABARE which basically show that the national average household quarterly electricity bill forecast for 2010, without an MRET-and my colleague and friend the member for Franklin will be interested in this-is $261.85. ABARE’s figures show that the increased quarterly cost due to an MRET-for instance, continuing the target of 9,500 gigawatt hours-would be $3.07, or a rise of 1.2 per cent. A total of 20,000 gigawatt hours or a five per cent MRET, as the Labor Party is advocating, on 2010 figures would be a quarterly increase of $8.20, or a rise of three per cent. If it went to 32,000 gigawatt hours or a 10 per cent MRET, which is not our policy, there would be an increase of $13.12 a quarter for a household electricity bill, or a five per cent increase. We know that by 2016 the cost comparisons between coal, gas, wind and energy will overlap if the wind industry is allowed to grow(Time expired) Gilmore Electorate: Medical Facility medical facility at the Shoalhaven campus of the University of Wollongong. TodayI want to raise the issue once again, because since then I have become aware of an attempt to falsely claim credit for that announcement. In my earlier speech I acknowledged those who contributed towards the realisation of this project worth $10 million. Let me repeat my words. I said: I wish to congratulate Vice-Chancellor Gerard Sutton. I also wish to thank the Divisions of General Practice and all our GPs, who were totally united in working on this project. I also want to thank Professor Don Iverson, whose dream it was to have a medical school at the Shoalhaven campus in Gilmore, and Canio Fierravanti-Wells from the university. They were the significant players who helped bring this initiative to fruition. I am not so crass as to not acknowledge anybody else’s contribution, but last Friday when I was speaking to the media my breath was taken away by what I heard-and I later had this confirmed from university sources. In medical terms there is a condition called Munchausen’s syndrome, sometimes referred to as ‘factitious disorder’. Factitious literally means contrived, and the meaning could hardly be more apt. People with factitious disorder are great con men or con women, although what they obtain through their conning most people would far rather not have. It was named in honour of a German baron who was a famous liar, so imagine my surprise and contempt when a comment was made by the member for Cunningham claiming undeserved credit for contributing to the medical school’s success. I would like to know how his reasoning allowed him to do so. MAIN COMMITTEE",206,Adjournment

What he did do was indulge in negativity, saying it would never happen, leading people to believe we had failed to deliver and hoping to achieve a political hit on this government. I even went to the extent of asking the member twice to stop his negativity and say something positive for a change. In fact, his constituents need to know that not once-and I repeat, not once-has he ever voted with the government on any issue, even when it would have been of benefit to his constituents. Yet, when this government introduced this innovative and exciting proposal for the Shoalhaven campus of the University of Wollongong, he wanted to take the credit. What he has actually done could be seen as a form of plagiarism-taking credit for someone else’s efforts, and brazenly so. Is the member so desperate for recognition that he needs to hunt publicity in someone else’s electorate? I think it is sad that the member must resort to such devices. It has certainly lowered my respect for him as a representative of the people of Cunningham. The act is opportunistic at best. I urge the member to approach the people he made the claim to and apologise for his cheap, shabby behaviour. It diminishes the genuine work of other people and denigrates the reputation of this House. In fact, I wish the member for Cunningham were present in the Main Committee chamber so I could ask him what he has done for his electorate apart from making untrue speeches. Education: Early Childhood forces to gain a better understanding of the excellent work being done by those serving our country both here in Australia and overseas in the various military domains. I decided to volunteer in another area of service to better understand the superb work done by other workers-workers in our child-care sector. As a teacher in my former life and as someone who has always been very interested in the education of young people, I have long been an advocate for the child-care sector. When I was a teacher, it used to annoy me that when politicians visited my school they came out and, especially in the early childhood area, looked at what was happening, saw the prep, grade 1 and grade 2 teachers, saw that things were going along swimmingly and assumed that there was no great need to further resource the early childhood sector. However, as teachers know, this is the area where you are actually building the foundations. To expect teachers to cater for the individual differences of anywhere up to 25-in some cases even more-young children and provide them with the necessary knowledge, experiences and challenges is very time consuming, very difficult and, in some cases, very frustrating. In the preschool and early childhood sector it is even more challenging and difficult. So, as I say, I volunteered to work in a child-care centre. I had a meeting with some childcare activists-Mel Webb, Hester Van Niekerk and Roseanne Wardrop-who told me of the campaign being run to alert not only the public but also those in politics to the need to support workers in their struggle to gain recognition in the community, to gain a better wage structure and to develop a more professional education basis for the work that they do. So the other week in the early hours of the morning, at half past seven, I rocked up to the Howrah Beach Childcare Centre and experienced life for 4½ hours working in that wonderful child-care centre. I met the parents bringing their kids in. I saw the wonderful work that the centre workers did in welcoming the children and parents into the centre. It amazed me, as a MAIN COMMITTEE",207,Adjournment
294,Mr Quick (Franklin) (10.27 A.m.),"Many in this place volunteer to serve in the armedformer teacher, to see the knowledge that they had of the children and the interest that they took in them. As a bit of an oldie sitting down and reading stories with the kids, I was soon struck by the fact that there are no men working at the centre. In fact, there are very few men working in the child-care sector. I was a bit of a novelty sitting down and reading the kids books. They played with my moustache and one said, ‘I’ve a grandfather who’s got one of those things.’ I helped set up the playground equipment and I fed the kids. I baulked at changing the nappies in the babies room; I have not got around to that as yet. I quickly gained an experience of the wonderful work and amazing preparation that the child-care workers do to enable them to support, challenge and nurture the children as they prepare them for later life. As I said at the outset, many of us in this place volunteer to work in the various forms of the armed services. I would issue a challenge to politicians to work at child-care centres. I know it would be seen as a bit cynical at the moment, in the lead-up to the election, if we all volunteer to work in child-care centres, but I have long had an association with early childhood and I am going to volunteer, even if the election is on, to work at the Howrah Beach Childcare Centre and also at some of the country child-care centres in my electorate, just to give the workers the support and encouragement that they so richly deserve in the wonderful work that they do in educating our children at that early age. Forde Electorate: Defence Personnel and Veterans doing a tremendous job overseas and have a great deal of community support, I want to take the time today to reflect on some local achievements by our defence personnel, our veterans and our local RSLs. Last weekend I was pleased to join with the Minister for Defence, Robert Hill; the Chief of Army, Peter Leahy; and our Governor General, Michael Jeffrey, as the Australian Army Intelligence Corps was presented at Canungra with the high honour of the Governor General’s Banner. I know first-hand what a fine group of people work at the Canungra Land Warfare Centre and how important the defence community is to the area. The Canungra Land Warfare Centre has a proud history, and its new intelligence centre is a tremendous addition. The Governor General’s Banner is traditionally awarded for great service or efficiency. This custom began with the presentation of 20 King’s banners in 1904 for service in the Boer War. Established in 1907, the Australian Army Intelligence Corps predates its United Kingdom and United States of America equivalents and has done service in both World Wars, Korea, the Malayan Emergency, Borneo, Vietnam and, more recently, Somalia, Rwanda, Bougainville, the Gulf War, East Timor, the Solomon Islands and Iraq. Canungra’s $17 million Defence Intelligence Training Centre became operational this year. Congratulations to everyone at Canungra and, again, a big thankyou to our defence personnel for the fine job they do in these challenging times. I would also like to give my thanks to the many hundreds of people in the Canungra community who came out and witnessed this very special and big event in our community. I was also pleased to host a special presentation recently of certificates of appreciation to our local veterans and their families. These certificates, part of the government’s Saluting Their Service program, provide important recognition for those who served our country in war. I would like to record the names here today of those who were presented with certificates, including family members accepting on behalf of those who served who are no longer MAIN COMMITTEE",208,Adjournment

They were: Stephen Armbrust of North Tamborine, Thomas Bevan of Beaudesert, Gloria Buchanan of Mount Gravatt, John Damon of Eagle Heights, Graham and Fay Davis of Beaudesert, Ellen Doak of Beaudesert, Barbara Donaldson of Jimboomba, Frederick Franklin of Mount Tamborine, Elizabeth Hayward of Mundoolum, Terrence Kassulke of Beaudesert, Elizabeth Laughton of Calamvale, John Arthur Marshall of Eagle Heights, Jack Valentine McNamara of Mount Warren Park, Robert George Millar of Waterford West, Frederick John Ward of Bethania and Mary Waight of Beaudesert. I also presented the National Service Medal, recognising the unique contribution of our national servicemen who served between 1951 and 1992, to Barbara Donaldson of Jimboomba, for her late husband, and to Douglas Panten of Loganholme. I was also privileged to be able to present the Australian Service Medal to Gary Fern of Beenleigh. Finally, while we are on the topic of our veterans, I want to congratulate two local RSLs which recently received funding grants. The Rathdowney subbranch will receive $4,000 to restore the Rathdowney Memorial Gates, and the Beaudesert subbranch will receive $3,000 to build a memorial wall at the club to display local wartime memorabilia. Both these organisations do a fantastic job for their members and the general community. These two projects, funded under the Howard government’s Saluting Their Service program, will help ensure that future generations remember the debt of gratitude we owe to those who served us well. These grants come on top of grants earlier this year to Boonah and Canungra RSLs. I am very fortunate to have both a strong ex-service community in the wider electorate and a tremendous service community at Canungra. I feel very honoured and very privileged to represent this great electorate of Forde. Scullin Electorate: Essential Services with regard to the delivery of three essential services in my electorate. They are all matters that I have raised on various occasions in the past. The first concerns the Thomastown office of the North-East Migrant Resource Centre which I officially opened on 29 June. The new office of the North-East MRC will provide valuable assistance to the many new arrivals in ethnic communities in the city of Whittlesea, which is long overdue. I congratulate the migrant resource centre on this initiative. The second service is the Whittlesea Community Legal Centre, officially opened last Friday by my former federal parliamentary colleague the state Attorney-General Rob Hulls at the Community Information Whittlesea office in Epping. In the few weeks this legal service has been operating, it has absolutely demonstrated the unmet need for legal services which existed. The service is booked out through to the end of the month. The community legal education offices have been busy, and a team of volunteers has been attracted to assist the service. Outreach services to Whittlesea township and Mill Park will commence shortly. I congratulate the state government on funding this service. I congratulate Community Information Whittlesea and Kildonan Family Service as the auspice consortia partners. Sadly, it is becoming clear, even at this early stage, that the resources available are outstripped by the demand. I again call upon the federal government to join in partnership with the local community and the state government and provide their share of the resources that are required to ensure that the Whittlesea Community Legal Centre further develops. MAIN COMMITTEE",209,Adjournment
296,Mr Jenkins (Scullin) (10.36 A.m.),"TodayI provide the House with a progress reportThe third proposal I raise is the after-hours GP clinic at the Northern Hospital. I remind the House that, in the run-up to the last election, on the basis of indications from the Commonwealth government through the then minister, Minister Wooldridge, of Commonwealth support for the project, the Bracks state government funded a purpose-built facility which now awaits an announcement from the Howard government of the recurring funding required. The accident and emergency centre at the Northern Hospital is one of the busiest in Victoria. In excess of 60 per cent of those that present at the accident and emergency centre are triaged as category 4 or 5, indicating that they could easily be treated by a general practitioner. The federal government should recognise that the majority of these patients are a Commonwealth responsibility and should fund this project. A proposal has been before the government since December 2002, and in February this year the member for McEwen indicated that a decision would be made soon. It is the local residents in the federal seats of Scullin and McEwen who suffer, as they are the greatest users of the Northern Hospital. This is about freeing up the resources of the Northern Hospital and assisting it to meet the unmet demand for more after-hours GP services. It is not about taking patients from existing services. Labor has already announced funding for a Medicare team to work at the currently unused clinic at the Northern Hospital, adding to the role already provided by local GPs helping to ease the pressure on the hospital’s emergency department. The Northern Division of General Practice, an industry body, advocated for an after-hours GP clinic as the sort of service that is needed by the Northern Hospital. I believe it is time that Minister Abbott acted. He should act because the community is still waiting. The Northern Hospital’s resources should be freed up. The minister should make a decision and he should make it soon-sooner rather than later. This is what the community demands to ensure that the services provided by the Northern Hospital continue to develop to the high standard that the community has expected from other services and that it now recognises that the hospital can provide. James Cook University to get a veterinary school for James Cook University in Townsville. Part of that veterinary school would also be located in the tablelands of North Queensland. It is a very good proposal, but it is only part of the vision that I have for the next major step that will take James Cook University forward to be one of the top five universities in Australia and one of the leading universities in the world. There is an outstanding opportunity right now for James Cook University, which we must seize, we must implement, and which the government must help implement. I am very strongly supportive of James Cook University’s vision to become the nucleus of a tropical research and development headquarters for Northern Queensland and indeed the world. This vision seeks to bring together on one site as many as possible of the R&D providers of the region, with a view to creating the largest aggregation of tropically focused researchers in the world. In the broad context, there is a general strategic goal for JCU, both in Townsville and in Cairns, to act as the major facilitator to encourage a greater degree of collaboration and, where appropriate, proximity between the university and as many as possible of the various state, Commonwealth and industry based research agencies in our region. The prerequisite for the practical implementation of this vision is the appropriately designed special-purpose building to be located on the Townsville campus of James Cook UniMAIN COMMITTEE",210,Adjournment
297,Mr Lindsay (Herbert) (10.41 A.m.),"Over the last several months, there has been a pushversity, close to the medical school and the Townsville Hospital; the schools of public health and tropical medicine, tropical biology and engineering; and the current site of the CSIRO Davies Laboratory. Detailed costings are to be prepared, but I estimate that something in the order of $20 million will be required to provide the necessary capital infrastructure to allow JCU to take advantage of and implement this vision. We are talking about co-locating the CSIRO on campus. The EcoGrid consortium aims at JCU. We are talking about a marine science consolidation at JCU and new tropical science courses at JCU-and this is where veterinary science fits into the picture, along with tropical agricultural science. There is the sugar connection, through SRI and BSES. The DPI&F and other state research agencies-and of course the successor entity to the rainforest and reef CRCs-will be involved. There is huge potential for this at our university. James Cook University is the natural site for the development of a concentration of tropical science and innovation expertise and capacity in Queensland. It is one of only 13 Australian universities to rank in the Shanghai Jiao Tong University’s top 500. It ranks second in Australia in terms of actual over expected citation performance. It ranks second in the world amongst specialist marine science institutes for a number of publications. Amongst tropical universities, JCU ranks in the top dozen or so in the world. JCU has positioned itself well over the last few years. Its broad strategic goals are in line with some of the major recent strategic initiatives at both state and federal levels. Its mission statement emphasises its tropical focus. Its vision statement sets the target of becoming by 2010 one of the world’s top five universities with a focus on life and living in the tropics. Some of this has already been achieved. I am doing everything I can to enable James Cook University to make its vision a reality. It is a tremendous step forward to think that JCU can get this huge centre of gravity of world tropical science on its campus in Townsville. Greenway Electorate: Child-Care Services in my electorate, and that is the lack of child-care places. I have spoken about this on many occasions-as many as 30 times in my eight years as a member of this parliament-but recent events in my electorate have highlighted this problem even further. The Kings Langley preschool and its long day care centre have received notification from the state Department of Community Services advising that the existing before and after school care service will have to close before 20 August. This means that parents of some 50 children will have to find alternative before and after school care in an area that already faces long waiting lists and limited places. It appears that under child-care regulations the number of school-age children attending before and after school care must not exceed 10 per cent of the licensed preschool places unless separate facilities are provided to care for these children. The number of school-age children attending far exceeds this number. It also appears, though, that these arrangements have been in place at Kings Langley preschool for over 10 years. This decision by DOCS is within the regulations and is in the interest of the welfare of the children, but nevertheless it will cause hardship for many parents who, with both parents working, will have insufficient time to find alternative before and after school care. MAIN COMMITTEE",211,Adjournment
298,Mr Mossfield (Greenway) (10.46 A.m.),"I rise to speak about a very important issueI have written to the state Minister for Community Services asking for the closure of this service to be delayed until the end of the current school year or until a new service can be established, which I understand is what the local primary school wishes to do. The difficulty that the parents of these children have in finding alternative places highlights a problem that has existed in Greenway since the first year of the Howard government. In the 1996-97 budget, there was an $820 million cut in child care, which led to increased fees, reduced child-care assistance and the closure of several services. At that time, the closures occurred in Greenway, Seven Hills, Marayong, Riverstone and Blacktown. Moving forward to the present day, we find that the result of this short-sighted policy of funding cuts is expressed in the closure of Kings Langley before and after school care. Mr Ross Cameron interjectingstated that there was a shortage of before and after school care in the Blacktown local government area of over 1,000 places. This was well in excess of any local government area in Australia. The next highest shortfall was in the neighbouring area of Holroyd, which had almost half that number-some 590 places. So you can see Mr Deputy Speaker-and I am sure that the member for Parramatta can see-that the closures of these before and after school care services will only make the situation in Blacktown worse than it already is. I am very pleased to say that the new Labor candidate for Greenway, Ed Husic, is an excellent candidate. He is a young man who has grown up in the area and went to school in the area. He is now campaigning strongly in the electorate, as I am in this parliament. He is going around the electorate doorknocking and meeting the constituents, and this is one of the big issues that people are talking to him about. He is also getting on with the job of campaigning for extra child-care places in the electorate of Greenway. In May this year, Ed invited the Labor shadow minister for family and community services, the member for Lilley, to launch a campaign to force the Howard government to increase child-care places in Greenway, and there has been a good response to the petitions. Further to that, he organised for the Labor shadow minister for children and youth, Senator Collins, to address a child-care forum of providers and parents in the local community. Ed has been telling me about some of the horror stories that he finds while doorknocking-for example, a woman who earns $350 a week in wages and spends $290 on child care. This is a major issue in my electorate. The problem has been caused by the Howard government and it will only be rectified by the election of Mark Latham as the Prime Minister of Australia. Flinders Electorate: Koo Wee Rup, Lang Lang and Clyde the area of Koo Wee Rup, Lang Lang and Clyde. I would like to firstly talk about the magnificent Koo Wee Rup Primary School. I have been informed by senior members within the school that the school faces two challenges. First, there is a problem in relation to the car parking outside the school, which is, in the words of one of those people, a virtual quagmire every time it rains. I know this because, during my walk around the electorate for juvenile diabetes, I happened to visit the Koo Wee Rup Primary School on a morning on which it was raining, and the car park was a quagmire. There is a very simple solution. The local council, the Cardinia Shire Council, which generally does a great job and of which I am a great supMAIN COMMITTEE",212,Adjournment

301,Mr Hunt (Flinders) (10.51 A.m.),"I want to raise two different issues and both relate toporter, needs to contribute and work on the land outside the Koo Wee Rup Primary School to ensure that it is fully surfaced, with an adequate car park and footpaths for kids to use to get to and from school. It is only a short distance. It is a minor project but an important one to the health of the school. Second, the Koo Wee Rup Primary School also needs maintenance funding from the state government. There is a desperate shortage of maintenance funding for basic school works, whether it is in terms of guttering, paving, painting or simply ensuring that the insulation is appropriate. It is a great school with a tremendous principal, Angela Luke, and a great council. What they need is support from the state for the basics-the absolute bare minimum of maintenance work, which should be done and which the school council and the school community are taking care of themselves, with no support. It should be a priority. This is overdue funding for overdue work which should be carried out immediately. The second thing that I wanted to raise as regards the Koo Wee Rup, Lang Lang and Clyde region relates to roads. A set of three interconnected roads projects is necessary. I will start with the Clyde-Berwick road. What is needed along the Clyde-Berwick road, a road that I know very well from my own travels in the electorate, is a significant upgrade. The shoulders of that road, which is effectively a major thoroughfare, are disastrous. There have been tragedies over the last few years. Those tragedies, sadly, are at risk of reoccurring. That road needs an upgrade to make sure that the shoulders are safe, that the conditions are adequate and that residents are protected-but residents do not want this road to be turned into a bypass. They want an upgrade, but they do not want a duplication of the road. The appropriate place for the bypass is the stretch of road between Pakenham and Koo Wee Rup. The Koo Wee RupPakenham road should be turned into a bypass. That would be the natural extension of what is currently the development of the Pakenham bypass and the process which is beginning there. The northern route and the southern route would be connected through a north-south bypass which would go to the west of Koo Wee Rup, going straight past the town, which would remove large trucks which are currently passing through Koo Wee Rup. That would provide safety for Koo Wee Rup by taking trucks off the major streets in the heart of the town, which would also protect the Clyde-Berwick road from becoming a major truck bypass, so it suits both of those communities. The third part of the equation is the town of Lang Lang, which has seen an increase in the number of sandpits which have developed in the area. As a consequence of that, as McDonald’s Track enters Lang Lang from the east, we see a very large number of trucks. There is a proposal which would represent the third part of this suite of activities to bypass the town of Lang Lang, to have a bypass to the south of the Lang Lang rodeo and the Lang Lang Pastoral, Agricultural and Horticultural Association grounds, which would connect the sandpit areas by taking McDonald’s Track in addition to its current route to the south and therefore bypassing the town of Lang Lang. Taken together, these three projects-the Clyde-Berwick upgrade, the Koo Wee Rup bypass and the Lang Lang bypass-would represent a great step forward for road users and residents in Lang Lang, Koo Wee Rup and Clyde.

Dr Jiang revealed that the SARS epidemic in China was far more serious than MAIN COMMITTEE",213,Adjournment
302,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (10.56 A.m.),"Previously I drew the House’s attention to the government of that country was admitting. His courage in speaking out on SARS made him a national hero in China but also marked him as an opponent of the government in Beijing. Dr Jiang and his wife were finally released on 20 July, after being held for three weeks incommunicado. During that time, Dr Jiang was repeatedly questioned in an unsuccessful attempt to get him to recant his criticisms of the Communist Party and the Chinese government. He is now being held under house arrest in Beijing, unable to communicate with the outside world. Dr Jiang is lucky because he has as many friends and defenders outside China as he has supporters inside China. He recently was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award, described as Asia’s equivalent of the Nobel Peace Prize, for his work in revealing the full extent of the SARS epidemic in South-East Asia and East Asia, which probably saved many thousands of lives by his frank admissions, and for his calling for a full reassessment of the events of July 1989 in which pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square were suppressed with a great loss of life. Dr Jiang deserves to be nominated for the Nobel Prize, but I doubt that he will be, because the Nobel Committee seems to have shown too little interest in human rights in China, perhaps because of the furious reaction of the government there to the prize awarded to the Dalai Lama in 1989. We do not hear much in Australia about the Chinese labour camp system, known as the Laogai, very much the Chinese equivalent of the Russian word ‘gulag’. Reliable reports by human rights organisations such as Amnesty and Freedom House say that there are over 1,000 labour camps in China. How many people are in these camps is unknown. But since it is known that some of them have thousands of inmates, the total must be very large, probably several million. Political dissidents are frequently sent to these Laogai and religious people are as well. Catholics who do not recognise the official Chinese Catholic Church are sent to these camps in large numbers. Often there is no formal conviction because the camps are not part of the official prison system. Sentences are indefinite. Sometimes inmates are released if they give satisfactory evidence of re-education or reform, but others remain incarcerated for many years. Inmates have no right of communication with the outside world, are not paid for their labour and are subject to very harsh conditions, sometimes working in extreme cold or heat or in performing dangerous tasks such as cutting lumber or in mines. I hope the labour of the Laogai is taken into account when we are negotiating the prospective Australia-China free trade agreement. Most of these inmates work in sweatshop labour factories producing goods which are then exported to the West, usually under false labels to conceal their origins, having been produced effectively by slave labour. I am in favour of good economic, cultural and political relations between Australia and China. I acknowledge that there have been some reforms to the Chinese legal system in recent years and some progress has been made in improving the human rights situation. I agree that increased prosperity through trade and investment is producing and will continue to produce greater internal and external pressure on China for political reform. But the cases of Dr Jiang, the hero who revealed the SARS crisis, and two very brave Chinese editors of the Southern Metropolitan Daily, the most popular daily in southern China, Cheng Yizhong and Mr Yu Hua Feng, are a reminder of the continued and well-documented existence of the Chinese labour MAIN COMMITTEE camp system. I would like these two editors to be released. I hope that the Australian government is going to take up their cases in the Chinese human rights dialogue. Despite all of the positive developments in China, the political system still remains what it has been since 1949-a one-party Communist state. When we talk about closer economic relations with China, we need to remember at whose expense these closer relations are being forged. I am very pleased that Dr Jiang has won the Magsaysay award. I hope the Nobel Prize committee takes up his case. The people of China will thank those people around the world who have raised the issue of democracy in China prior to the Olympics. They will not thank us in the end if we have sat silent while people like the editors of the Southern Metropolitan Daily and Dr Jiang and his wife are jailed without recourse to the law. China has every prospect of being a greater civilisation in economic terms than it is now, but it also has the potential to develop democratically like the rest of the world. Riverina Electorate: Ashmont Public School Quick across the chamber, my co-convenor of the parliamentary cancer network. I am sure that we would both urge you all to support the Cancer Council in their fundraising efforts, certainly by buying at least a daffodil, and contributing to the very good cause of research in cancer. This morning I rise to speak about the pleasure that I have just had in delivering one of the cheques under the volunteer small equipment grants that Minister Larry Anthony so capably applies to all electorates. I did have the enormous privilege of going back to a school that I was involved with some 30 years ago-that is, Ashmont Public School in Wagga Wagga. I was really surprised because that volunteer small equipment grant was given for so little but it meant so much. Ashmont Churches Caring for Children received $907.27 to purchase two industrial toasters to assist with cooking breakfast for the Ashmont school students. I cannot tell you just how important that $907 was. While we were there, we met with all of the people who had started this program eight years ago and who were still committed to going three days a week to the Ashmont Public School and providing breakfast for 150 to 200 children from one small suburb. It is an amazing feat. Also in that time the Riverina Australian Rules Football Club has donated all of the ingredients for the breakfast being made for those children-that is, cereal, juice, toast and milk. I think that is an amazing contribution and I congratulate the Riverina Australian Rules Football Club in Wagga Wagga on being so much a part of the community. There is obviously a great need. It was of concern to me to see that 150 to 200 children line up there three days a week. The only time they get breakfast is on those days. Their mums and dads are not making breakfast for them. I think that needs to move forward our care and concern about how family-friendly communities really deal with children who are perhaps not receiving the care and consideration that they should from their parents. That leads me to another issue. I am pleased to see that we have the parliamentary secretary here, because last week he led us to look at a program where people are educated from the time they have a child. They receive education in the form of a DVD or video or in some other form in order to understand a child’s needs-education on how a child needs to grow from birth through to its preschool and school years. It was a great initiative by a young woman that I think should be supported. When I went to see these children and saw their deMAIN COMMITTEE",214,Adjournment
303,Mrs Hull (Riverina) (11.01 A.m.),"BeforeI begin, I acknowledge my colleague Harrylight when they were being fed their breakfast from 7.30 to 9.20 three days a week at the Ashmont Public School, it really raised the issue for me that perhaps here is the education program that all governments should be running for all people who are having children: they should be very fixed on ensuring that we know what a child’s needs are, that we know what our responsibilities are as parents when we decide to embark upon having a family and that we continually fulfil that role of being competent, caring and valuable parents to our growing children. I again congratulate Ashmont Churches Caring for Children, who received this grant. Small grant though it may be, it certainly makes a big difference in the lives of many of the students at Ashmont Public School. Congratulations to Ashmont Public School for the caring and understanding way in which they deal with their students in very trying and sometimes very difficult circumstances and for their support of this group in order that their children can get the best meal of the day, breakfast, so that they can learn and improve their future. I also thank the minister for providing us with this grant. Health: Medical Practitioners Training torate and, I am sure, the electorates of all honourable members than the issue of health-in particular, access to health services and of course the affordability of health services. No-one knows this better than I do, representing an area with a bulk-billing rate now hovering just below 50 per cent. I think it would be fair to describe that as a crisis point. In my home town of Cessnock, we have a GP to resident ratio of about 3,000 to one, which is a totally unacceptable level. I have now learned that the federal government has announced plans to fund the establishment of several new medical schools, among them two in Sydney. This decision does not appear to have taken into account several important facts. As a consequence, it may well turn out to be a very expensive project that does not have the desired outcomes. First, establishing a new medical school is of course very expensive. In addition to capital works expenditure, it requires a very large complement of academic staff and associated general staff to teach in all the subject areas of medicine. It seems to me that it would have been far more sensible to increase the number of students admitted to existing medical schools. As I understand it, the University of Newcastle had indicated that it could accommodate additional students but was only allocated four in the most recent round. Second, after five or six years of medical school and, of course, many more years in hospital training, medical students establish partnerships, friendships and homes in the areas in which they train. Consequently, many are reluctant to leave their homes and friends or partners for other locations. Training more doctors in Sydney will result in more doctors staying in Sydney. In many regions in Sydney, bulk-billing rates are very high as competition is high because, it seems, we have doctors on just about every corner. AgainI suggest that it would make far more sense to increase student numbers in non-metropolitan medical schools such as Newcastle, with its well-placed satellite facilities on the Central Coast and in Tamworth, and only then consider new medical schools, which should be established in non-metropolitan areas. Finally, a new medical school requires access to clinical facilities and to patients. Establishing two new medical schools in Sydney will put a demand on existing clinical facilities and MAIN COMMITTEE",216,Adjournment
304,Mr Fitzgibbon (Hunter) (11.06 A.m.),"There is no more important issue in my elecpatient numbers that probably cannot be met. The medical schools of the universities of Sydney and New South Wales already have difficulty in providing adequate clinical placements for their own students. So there are many issues surrounding doctor numbers in this country. But in the medium to long term there can be no doubt that the best way to get doctors into rural and regional areas is to get more young people from the bush interested in medicine and training to practice in medicine. Again, the best way to do that is to give them the opportunity to train in regional areas, and there is no greater opportunity than the school provided by the University of Newcastle. In Maitland, another major town in my electorate, thanks to a very good initiative of a number of community members, particularly the Hunter Division of Urban Practice, for some years we have had a GP after-hours service operating at Maitland Hospital. It has been enormously successful in providing after-hours medical services to local residents. It has been so successful that it has become a national model for after-hours GP services. I am delighted that the Labor Party has picked up that model and run with it and has made a huge commitment to growing those services around the nation in areas of need. I was delighted earlier this week when the member for Paterson announced an additional amount of money to keep that Maitland service going. I must say that it is amazing what an election campaign can do, because only a short time ago Mr Baldwin, the member for Paterson, was arguing that no such commitment was necessary. I am a bit suspicious about the timing, but we welcome the funding. Dickson Electorate: Health Services portant issue to Pine Rivers and to the people of my electorate in relation to the state of health services in the Pine Rivers Shire. I have spoken on a number of occasions before in the parliament in relation to the desperation that some people in the electorate of Dickson are feeling in relation to the inadequate provision of health services. It is why I have spent the last three years fighting for additional doctors to come to the Pine Rivers area for additional services to be provided to young families and to older residents who are calling Pine Rivers their home not just for now but for many years to come. I have reported to the House before that we have been the most successful area in attracting doctors under the outer metropolitan areas scheme. We have had 18 doctors attracted to the Pine Rivers Shire. That is the highest number in the country, and it is a fact of which we are very proud because it is something that we fought very hard for over the last three years. The important point to note is that there is still more to be done. We still need more doctors in Pine Rivers. We still need to have more medical services in Pine Rivers. That is the reason why today I renew my call to the state government in Queensland to look at the prospect of establishing a hospital in Pine Rivers-one of the fastest growing regions in this country. It is a commitment that the Queensland government needs to decide upon and to make for the people of Pine Rivers. The state government puts forward the argument that there are adequate services being provided at Redcliffe and at Caboolture, that there are outpatient services at the Royal Brisbane Hospital and that medical services are being provided at the Prince Charles Hospital, which is also on the north side of Brisbane. But there is a glaring deficiency in the services that are provided to the people of Pine Rivers. Last night I spoke with a lady who is 72 years of age who detailed to me her horrific interaction with the hospital services in Queensland. That has only made my calls for a public hosMAIN COMMITTEE",217,Adjournment
305,Mr Dutton (Dickson) (11.11 A.m.),"It is my pleasure to speak again about the very impital in Pine Rivers all the more necessary. I have heard some horror stories from people in my area about the way in which they have been treated when attending state public hospitals on the north side of Brisbane. But the details that were provided to me last night by this 72year-old lady, who lives at Bray Park in my electorate, really made me feel quite disgusted at the inadequacy of the services provided, in this case, at the Royal Brisbane Hospital. This lady told me that she was taken by ambulance on Monday morning of this week, after having been advised by her local doctor that she needed to attend hospital. She had a drip put in her arm and she was taken by ambulance to the Royal Brisbane Hospital. She arrived at the Royal Brisbane Hospital on Monday at 1 p.m. and she was discharged at midday on the Tuesday. She had spent the time from 1 p.m. on the Monday afternoon in the accident and emergency section of the Royal Brisbane Hospital in a cubicle. A lady 72 years of age had spent almost 24 hours in the accident and emergency section of the Royal Brisbane Hospital without any referral to a ward and without being admitted into the hospital. She did nothing but sing the praises of the staff and the doctors that are there, but she told the story that the doctors are simply overburdened. The doctors and the nurses told her that there are no beds available and there are certainly no staff to provide the services in the beds that are there, so this 72-year-old lady spent her time in the accident and emergency section in a cubicle overnight. She was not able to get to sleep; and at seven o’clock the next morning she was shipped out of the cubicle into a lounge chair because the ambulances started a fresh round of bringing people into the accident and emergency section. And the story she told was not unfamiliar, because it is a tragic circumstance which is being played out in hospitals right across the north side of Brisbane and, indeed, right through Queensland. TodayI renew my call to the state government-one of desperation-to look at the provision of a hospital in Pine Rivers. I have said before in this parliament that I have spoken with the shire council in Pine Rivers. They are in a position to provide land. We now need the state government to respond to the letters that I sent on 7 August 2003, 7 October 2003 and 8 December 2003 and a number of calls that I have provided to the health minister’s office in Queensland. There has not been one response to the people of Pine Rivers, and it is a disgrace. Health: Magnetic Resonance Imaging Machines General Hospital and the 130,000 constituents I represent in my electorate of Lowe. This week I tabled yet another petition-the 11th petition-with now more than 10,000 signatures calling on the Minister for Health and Ageing, the Hon. Tony Abbott, to grant Concord hospital a licence for a Medicare-eligible magnetic resonance imaging, MRI, machine. Unless the Howard government grants Concord hospital one of the remaining 20 MRI licences that it announced were up for grabs, on 9 June 2004, outpatients from my electorate will continue to be denied reasonable access to this fundamental health service. For two years the Howard government has refused this request. Over and over again the Howard government has denied my constituents, confirming that it does not consider the inner west of Sydney a priority. MAIN COMMITTEE",218,Adjournment
306,Mr Murphy (Lowe) (11.17 A.m.),"I again speak on behalf of the Concord RepatriationBefore this week, in nine separate answers to my questions calling for an MRI licence for Concord hospital, recorded in Hansard from 19 August 2002 to 11 May 2004, the government has failed to give any indication that it will grant the licence. You will doubtless recall that last week I reported to the parliament that the Liberal Party has shamelessly tried to deceive my constituents by circulating a leaflet titled ‘MRI machine for our local hospital’ that claims that the Howard government has decided to issue an MRI licence ‘for our local hospital’. I said then that this was no more than a dishonourable attempt to salvage the government’s credibility on this issue by deliberately misleading my constituents. In a report by Evan Mistilis in the Inner West Courier on Monday, 9 August 2004, my Liberal opponent is reported as saying: ... the Federal Government has promised a Medicare funded MRI machine for somewhere in the Inner West. My question No. 3619 on 3 June 2004 asked: Will he grant Concord Hospital a Medicare-funded MRI service before the next federal election ... In the answer I received, recorded in Hansard on Tuesday, 10 August 2004, the Minister for Health and Ageing again failed to guarantee an MRI licence for Concord hospital. Instead, the minister referred to his announcement on 9 June 2004 that 23 Medicare-eligible MRI units would be provided, with: ... 20 to be located in under-serviced areas and hospitals. This process and conditions associated with this expansion are being advertised in the national press. Concord Repatriation General Hospital is able to apply for MBS eligibility in this context. Let it be clear: the minister for health is this week telling me, my constituents and the parliament that no decision has been made about an MRI licence for Concord hospital or the inner west, while my Liberal Party opponent is circulating a leaflet in the electorate of Lowe telling my constituents, ‘The Howard government will issue a licence for an MRI machine for our local hospital,’ and this week told a local newspaper, ‘The federal government has promised a Medicare funded MRI machine for somewhere in the inner west’. As a matter of urgency, my constituents need to find out who is telling the truth. The Minister for Health and Ageing, Mr Abbott, says that no decision has been made but my Liberal Party opponent says that a promise has been made. Adding insult to injury, in the same answer in Tuesday’s Hansard the health minister confirmed that the government does not consider an MRI licence for Concord a priority, because my constituents already have relatively close access to eight different MRI units, including those at Westmead Hospital, Darcy Road, Westmead; Royal North Shore Public Hospital, St Leonards; North Shore Private Hospital, St Leonards; and Crows Nest Sports Imaging, Pacific Highway, Crows Nest. As I understand it, the health minister does not believe that Concord hospital should receive an MRI licence, because my constituents should be able to go to Westmead, Camperdown, Newtown, St Leonards or Crows Nest. What is galling is that the Liberal Party is telling my constituents that one has already been promised. The only way that my constituents will finally get to the truth about the government’s position is for the minister for health to answer my question on notice No. 3723. I am asking the minister to explain, once and for all, whether a decision to grant Concord hospital an MRI licence has been made. I look forward to his response. MAIN COMMITTEE The government’s position in relation to Concord hospital and the MRI licence has now become a complete farce. The 10,000 petitioners and 130,000 Australians that I represent in Sydney’s inner west, in my electorate of Lowe, deserve nothing less than fair access to the MRI machine to be installed by the Carr government at Concord hospital. That is why the shadow minister for health, Julia Gillard, announced on 20 February this year that a Latham Labor government would immediately grant Concord hospital an MRI licence, and this was echoed by Mark Latham when I took him to the hospital recently. Health: Health Professionals some very positive comments about the health system and health professionals. As we all know, there has been some criticism of the system and health professionals, particularly in New South Wales. In many instances, it has been warranted. However, in fairness to health professionals, I want to speak on their behalf as a person who had an unfortunate accident in November last year. Incidentally, that accident was not as bad as many accidents that other people have had, but it has been an inconvenience to me as a member of parliament who serves his electorate in what I call people-first politics. I initially received treatment at Calvary Hospital in Wagga Wagga from a specialist called Clayton Barnes, who is a resident eye specialist there. Subsequently, I received treatment from various specialists, including Brett O’Donnell, who is a plastic surgeon. The injury that I sustained to my left eye was a very complicated injury. It was described by the specialists that treated me as one of the worse burns they had ever seen. The burns resulted in the destruction of all the muscle tissue as well as in my losing my sight in that eye. At my insistence, rather than lose the eye-because at that stage they did not think I could have a prosthesis-we undertook a very comprehensive, long and tedious program to try to keep the eye in my head and get some cells to grow back over the surface. Unfortunately, despite all the best intentions in the world and a number of operations, that did not occur. But it was not as a result of the way in which the specialists and the hospital staff-including the theatre nurses and other nurses in the hospital-undertook their very professional care, which was magnificent. I could not have asked for better care. In my view, we have the best medical care and the best hospital system in the world. Despite that care and professional advice, I did lose my eye a few weeks back. They grafted more material from my stomach. Prior to that, they grafted mucus membrane from inside my mouth to rebuild the muscle tissue in my eye socket. That just gives you an indication of the skill of these people. When I had my eye removed, they removed some muscle tissue from my lower abdomen and put it into the socket. The end result is, hopefully, that I will have a prosthesis fitted in the next couple of weeks. I made brief mention of the inconvenience of the injury. The inconvenience of the injury was caused because the trauma of losing my eye and the problems that it created affected my good eye, the right eye: I could not judge distance; therefore I could not drive. This situation took my wife away from what she does as a woman in her own right, because I was very heavily reliant on her to drive me around the electorate. After the operation-in fact, within 12 hours of my eye being removed; the mind and body do wonderful things-I could actually feel my eye readjusting. I am now at the point where I want to drive, because I think my eye is okay, but my wife says to me, ‘You couldn’t drive with two eyes, let alone one,’ and she MAIN COMMITTEE",219,Adjournment

The outgoing Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Roads, Senator Ian Campbell, announced on 17 July that no licence will be issued for the Christmas Island casino. The incoming minister, Mr Lloyd, made comments on ABC radio that the Prime Minister had decided five years ago that gambling was not in the interests of the island’s people. It is now six years since the Christmas Island Resort closed on 23 April 1998. Six years ago the government had the opportunity to act quickly and have the Commonwealth seek expressions of interest from entities wanting to take a lease on the property and apply for a casino licence-which it did. I have here a copy of a letter dated 30 August 1999 from Senator Ian Macdonald, who was then the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, to Mr Herbert, who was the liquidator for the casino, in which he makes it clear that the government was considering, and was concerned, that the casino should be sold on the basis of a casino licence being granted. I seek leave to table that letter. Leave granted. not do that, and led the eventual purchaser of the casino-a company called Soft Star Pty Ltd-to believe that they could develop a new casino operation. That was some six years ago.

I have now a letter dated 5 April which Senator Ian Campbell wrote to David Kwon, Managing Director of the Asia Pacific Space Centre, in which he indicated the process for lodging an application for a casino licence.

Subsequently, on 14 July, less than a month ago, Senator Campbell wrote to Don O’Donnell, President of the Christmas Island Chamber of Commerce, saying that he had had a meeting with investors who were prepared to put $30 million into reopening the casino. Note the date of that letter: 14 July. Then, on 17 July, the minister put out a press release announcing that the government was no longer prepared to provide a casino licence for Christmas Island and argued: In the interests of the Christmas Island community, the Australian Government has decided to make legislative changes to prohibit casino operations ...

Without any consultation whatsoever with the Christmas Island community, having led potential investors up the garden path about what they were able and not able to do on Christmas Island, giving guarantees almost to the owners of Soft Star Pty Ltd that they could open a casino, having potential investors and partners to the casino operations come to the island and effectively consummate an agreement with Soft Star Pty Ltd to spend $30 million in its first year of operation, the government then says there will be no casino. Let me tell you, people are very suspicious that someone has put the drip on the government, perhaps another gambling operator. Is there any coincidence with the fact that, at the same time this is happening, PBL is purchasing the casino in Perth in Western Australia? What is going on? This matter was raised in the Sunday Times last week, and I seek leave to table that article. Leave granted. about what is going on and that it is a rort. (Time expired) Condolences: Maddison, Mr Donald Fletcher Maddison as a sugar industry legend was both apt and well deserved. Don Maddison died in Brisbane on 20 June. He was a person of unquestioned integrity, endless enthusiasm and great personal charm. In these days when aspirational advancement is a desired goal, Don Maddison would be seen as a great role model. But the early rungs of his aspirational ladder were not climbed from a silver spoon background, indeed quite the opposite. Don Maddison’s father, who was involved in mining in the Newcastle area, died when he was quite young, leaving three sons. As an aside, a street in Newcastle bears his name. As the youngest of three children, Don was living for a time in his elder brother’s hotel room and he went to school from there, no doubt not the most conducive study environment. That did not impede his progress, nor later when studying at night for tertiary qualifications. MAIN COMMITTEE",222,Adjournment

313,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (11.32 A.m.),"The Courier Mail’s description of Donald FletcherFrom there he went to an apprenticeship at BHP, completed a chemical engineering degree at Sydney Tech in 1946 and became a member of the Royal Australian Chemical Institute. At around this time, he married his first wife, Beth Morrison, and had four daughters. His skills in chemical engineering took him to the Nestle Company at Gympie and Sydney, the latter as group manager, before he took on the momentous challenge of turning around the struggling and faction-ridden Tully Sugar Mill in North Queensland. After 10 years of distinguished service at the now well-functioning mill, he moved to Bundaberg as General Manager of the Millaquin Sugar Company, later Bundaberg Sugar, and the Bundaberg Rum Distillery. He was highly respected in the Bundaberg community. It was there that I got to know him well when he took over as chair of the Bundaberg District Tourism and Development Board, the region’s promotion and industry facilitation organisation, covering 11 local authorities. When I became CEO of that body he was my boss, mentor, guide and friend. It was under his leadership that the organisation blossomed and became the envy of like bodies. His business stature, persuasive skills and vision set the body on a firm foundation. But, in his dealings with government, councils and investors, he had an intuitive skill of knowing just how hard to push the boundaries. I well remember when we met those outer boundaries, he had a delightful closure statement: ‘Not even the Archangel Gabriel is going to change that’-and, invariably, he was right. I very much missed his guiding hand on his retirement but he never failed to call and see how I was going, even after I entered politics, on his many trips back to Bundaberg. As a mark of a fulsome life, he was an enthusiast for Apex, Rotary, the Leukaemia Foundation and, in more recent times, Probus and Neighbourhood Watch. He received the highest honours of the sugar industry and his profession, amongst them the Australian Society of Sugar Cane Technologists President’s Medal and the Emeritus Fellowship of the Institute of Engineers. The Bundaberg City Council acknowledged his service to the city by naming Maddison Court on the Bunda Industrial Estate in his honour. He remarried in 1999 and continued to enjoy retirement with his new wife, Allie Sellars, whom he met on a trip to New Zealand. Don Maddison was a devout, though not ostentatious, man with a strong commitment to Christianity and religion. He died in his sleep on 20 June, no doubt leaving a great gap in the lives of his daughters Eleanor, Margaret, Joan and Anne to whom I extend my deepest condolences. No doubt the Archangel Gabriel, whom he took a little lightly and whom he often invoked, was on hand to greet him at the Pearly Gates as a good and faithful servant. Tasmania: Sport turning to sport and our sporting heroes, as they prepare for the world competition. If only our political disputes could be resolved in such a way. I find that the spirit of the Olympics is competitive but also friendly, so just being able to compete in the games is a milestone in itself and, if you win then it is a bonus. It is the road to the games and the friends that you meet on the way that is important. I was excited to learn that a New Norfolk girl has been selected to row in the Australian fours. Her name is Dana Faletic and she is at present a quad scull world champion. Dana was born in Maydena in the south-west of Tasmania. Her father, Mike, is a tree-feller from that district.

I will certainly be doing that, and I wish Dana all the very best. It is marvellous that a woman from the Derwent Valley is out there competing with the best. Sport plays a very important part in the lives of Australians. I guess we just love to be outdoors, the chance of competing and the mateship sport engenders. Tasmania has had many excellent sportspeople who have reached the pinnacle of their careers-cricketers like David Boon and Ricky Ponting, our present captain of the Australian team, are obvious successes. But there are many others who have done extraordinary things in their lives. Another person I would like to talk about is Charles Eady, a cricketer who is now in the Tasmanian sporting hall of fame. Charles was a large, impressive man who performed efficiently for Tasmania as an all-rounder for two decades. But his real claim to fame was his innings of 566 in 473 minutes during a match in Hobart in 1902. He made it in a total of 911 for Break O’Day against Wellington-an incredible score. Eady hit 13 fives and 64 fours and added 429 for the seventh wicket with W. Abbott, who made 143. Play was spread over four afternoons while Eady achieved this. This score remains the highest in club cricket anywhere in the world. He was a tremendous hitter of the ball, but this should not be allowed to overshadow his skill as a bowler. He headed the southern Tasmanian averages four times as a batsman but 12 times as a bowler. He was a true all-rounder. In the 1905-06 season he took all 10 wickets for 42 runs for South Hobart against East Hobart. Eady toured England only once, with the 1896 Australian side, but ill health prevented him from showing his best. He made only 290 runs at an average of 13.18 and took 16 wickets at an average of 25.5. His reputation was secure in his feats at home. Eady, who stood six feet three inches tall and weighed 15 stone, was the first Australian to score a century in each innings of a first class match-a feat he accomplished in the 1894-95 season, when he made 116 and 112 not out against Victoria at Hobart. That is a pretty impressive career, yet he is still not well known outside Tasmania. It is about time that some of the feats of Tasmanian sporting people were recognised more fully. The Tasmanian Sporting Hall of Fame is now remedying that. I am sure that we will hearing more from our Olympian Dana and the many other young people who are coming through their sports to the top. Sport allows youngsters to achieve through their own efforts. They do not have to be academics but, by the same token, to be a top sportsperson you need the grit, stamina and great sense of purpose that take a different sort of intelligence. Let us hope that they are very successful and go on to enjoy a happy and fulfilling life. We wish the best to all of the Australians competing at Athens. Ryan Electorate: Marriage day.

I consider it a great honour that someone would share their life with me. I want to place on record some statements by a couple of key associations and organisations in our community which have written to me and which encourage the government to continue on its path in support of the institution of marriage. I want to first place on record a letter from Warwick and Alison Marsh of the Fatherhood Foundation. They write: Dear Michael, We write to thank you for your support for Australian families. They were involved in organising a very large forum here at the parliament last week in which more than 1,000 people participated. Indeed, the Great Hall overflowed last Wednesday, 4 August. Many members and senators joined with organisations like the Fatherhood Foundation and members of the community to support the institution of marriage, celebrate the value of marriage and acknowledge the reinvigoration and revival of this institution. I want to say again very strongly that I support it. Indeed, I want to call on the opposition to support it as well and to be clear and unambiguous about their position. I am also not sure what the position of the local Labor candidate is. There has been no utterance from her about whether she supports the government’s position or which side of the street she walks on in terms of the opposition’s position-whether she supports the shadow spokesman for this area or someone on the Labor Left. For my part, I very strongly support the institution of marriage. I want to again quote from Warwick and Alison Marsh’s letter to me of 10 August, where they say: Thank you again for your support for Australian fathers, families and that time-honoured institution which helps men and women express their love to each other in the deepest possible way.

Elections: Minor Parties candidate for Wentworth, Malcolm Turnbull, tell a public meeting that history would judge the war on Iraq as an error. Of course he was right. We need to look back at how this came about. In the coming month or so, we will be facing a federal election, but in November there will also be an election in the largest and most powerful nation on earth-the United States of America. Last time that election took place, George Bush was elected as the President of the United States, with a minority of votes counted but also with a significant dispute over the votes in Florida. One of the issues that was relevant for that result was that it was not just a contest between George Bush of the Republican Party and Al Gore of the Democrats; there was a third candidate-the Green Party leader, Ralph Nader, ran in the election. In Florida, Ralph Nader polled more than 95,000, or more than two per cent, of the votes. Across the nation, he polled between two and three per cent. Exit polls in Colorado, Nevada, New Hampshire, Oregon, Washington state and Wisconsin suggest that a considerable majority of those people who voted for Ralph Nader would have preferred Al Gore to be the President of the United States if it were a two-horse race. It is quite clear that, had Ralph Nader not run in the ballot, Al Gore would have been elected President of the United States in 2000. If Al Gore had been elected President of the United States in 2000, it is clear that he would have had a very different attitude towards the United Nations processes and towards international relations in the wake of 9-11, the tragedy that struck the United States. It is quite clear that we would have had a very different international environment from the one that we face today. Ralph Nader said: I did not run for President to help elect one or the other of the two major candidates. You can’t spoil a system spoiled to the core. I do not think democracy is spoiled to the core. I think democracy is the greatest system that we have and we need to acknowledge what people’s role is in that democracy. Ralph Nader and those people who supported him, such as the Australian Greens, and who are supporting him running again in 2004 could make the difference and ensure that George Bush is re-elected to the White Housepoint. The Greens, through their candidature of Ralph Nader, assist the process of a rightwing Republican regime in the United States, just as here in Australia the Greens spend most of their time attacking the Labor Party, attacking progressives who are closest to them in MAIN COMMITTEE",226,Adjournment

(Time expired) Defence: Personnel Labor Party over its policy on defence. It is very appropriate that here this morning we have two parliamentary secretaries, one who has had a long-time association with the Australian Defence Force and another who has a new but very important association with the Australian Defence Force. They will know, as I do, that Labor’s policy to cut 3,000 civilian jobs in defence is nothing short of disgraceful. In my electorate in Townsville, where I have Australia’s largest Army base and a very significant RAAF base, we have 564 civilians providing much-needed support service to the ADF to allow ADF members to do the work that they are there to do-to be on guard, ready to respond, ready to look after Australia’s interests. But the opposition spokesman on defence announced yesterday that 3,000 civilian jobs are to go. What is going to happen in Townsville, where we have both Australian Public Service and defence contractors on bases? These people are performing senior management roles, clerical and administration support, dealing with personnel and HR issues and giving pay and accounts advice. They include facilities people and engineers. They provide infrastructure support, information technology systems support and financial management. The contractors do access security, patrols around the perimeter of bases, grounds maintenance, cleaning, running of messes and accommodation facilities and maintenance of the built infrastructure. Labor’s policy is to take serving men and women of the Australian Defence Force, in uniform, and put them into these sorts of jobs. That is a disastrous policy and that is a policy that I will resist to my last breath. The current government has spent significant resources moving members of the Defence Force to the sharp end. The men and women of the Defence Force in Townsville-particularly the men of the 1st Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment, currently Australia’s ready deployment battalion-are ready to respond anywhere in the world within 24 hours. But how are they going to keep up that professionalism if they are out there manning gates, mowing the lawn, fixing a leaking tap somewhere or driving a desk? It is not right. This comes from a shadow minister who believes, of all things, that we should not have chocolate bars in Australian Defence Force ration packs. He just does not understand the Defence Force.

It was only the coalition which reinstated those battalions-fortunately-to enable the ADF to be ready for the challenges of East Timor. Let me say quite specifically that I believe the agenda of the Australian Labor Party is to cease having overseas deployment for members of the Australian Defence Force. Labor obviously does not understand the Defence Force. The people in the Defence Force spend their entire working lives training to be ready to deploy, and it is these overseas deployments that hone the skills of our Defence Force and make sure that they are ready to go when they are really needed. I have seen first-hand the wonderful things that the men and women of the Australian Defence Force have been able to do in recent years on overseas deployments. I have seen them in East Timor and I have seen them in the Solomon Islands. You have people from those countries coming up to you and saying: ‘You’re an Australian. We want to thank you for bringing back safety, security, peace and stability to our country.’ It is the men and women of the Australian Defence Force, highly trained people, who do that and make sure in Australia’s name that we are able to help our neighbours. But we are not going to be able to do that if the Australian Labor Party has its way. We will be sending a battalion of cleaners over to the Solomons or East Timor. I am not going to stand for that.

Shortland Electorate: Medicare Office Ms HALL (Shortland) (11.57 a.m.)-I rise today to implore the government to reopen the Medicare office at Belmont. This is an issue that I have raised in the House on numerous occasions. I raised it the first time when I made my first speech in the House on 11 November 1998. I raised it again on 12 November 1998, when I pointed out the difficulties that people living in Shortland electorate have in accessing the Medicare offices that are currently available to them. I raised the issue again on 5 September, after we had a public meeting at Swansea and the people who attended that public meeting raised it as an issue. On 26 February 2001 I again raised the issue of how the Medicare office had been closed and how it had been one of the busiest Medicare offices in New South Wales. I pointed out that the nearest Medicare offices were at Lake Haven on the Central Coast and at Charlestown. I also pointed out that there was a high pensioner population in the area and that a number of people who lived in the electorate or nearby really were elderly. On 19 March 2002 I again raised the issue of the Belmont Medicare office and pointed out that the staff at the Charlestown Medicare office had identified it as the single most important issue relating to Medicare in the area. On 11 August 2003, I raised it again and I put it in the context of the decline in bulk-billing. To date, the government have not acted on this. The people of Shortland electorate are being penalised by their inaction. I implore them to reconsider their decision and to reopen the Medicare office at Belmont. I seek leave to table a question that I put to the former minister for health, Minister Wooldridge, which contained a number of questions about the closure of the Medicare office. Leave granted. MAIN COMMITTEE The former member for Shortland submitted petitions with 14,150 signatures calling for the reopening of the Medicare office. I have submitted 6,000 signatures. During the last sitting week, I submitted 1,372 signatures, and I have with me another nearly 700 signatures. This is an enormous issue for the people I represent in the electorate of Shortland. Shortland is the 10th ‘oldest’ electorate in Australia. Living there are a number of elderly people who do not have driver’s licences or who have restricted licences which allow them to drive as far as Belmont. Unfortunately, if they do not have a licence or if their restricted licence limits them to driving to Belmont, they cannot drive to the Medicare office at Charleston or the Medicare office at Lake Haven, and it will therefore take them up to an hour-or in some cases longer-to get to a Medicare office. At a time when fewer doctors are bulkbilling, this has created a real problem for them. Many of the people who need to access a Medicare office need to get an immediate refund to enable them to purchase their medication. I feel that it is heartless of the Howard government to ignore the needs of the people I represent. It is not that the Medicare office did not have a substantial number of people using it. It is not that the staff did not recognise the fact that the Medicare office was of vital importance. No, it was none of those things. I think the only thing that determined that the Medicare office at Belmont be closed was the fact that it was in a Labor electorate. I implore the government to reconsider their decision, because this is an issue of vital importance to the people I represent in this parliament. Social Welfare: Debt Ms KING (Ballarat) (12.03 p.m.)-I rise in the adjournment debate to highlight yet again the impact of the Howard government’s mismanagement of social security debts. On the eve of the release of Audit report No. 4 of 2004-05, Management of customer debt, the government sought to deflect criticism by announcing a review of the debt recovery arm of Centrelink, but it was too little too late and was an inadequate response to what the Audit Office itself has said is a pretty damning report. The Auditor-General revealed in his report that nearly $1 billion in overpayments and debts had been racked up, an amount that excludes the $500 million generated by the flawed family benefit system. I am appalled that the Audit Office found that the irresponsible practice of not only offering credit cards as a repayment option but listing it as the first option available on the Centrelink web site did not stop even after the government publicly stated that it did. I am appalled because the practice came to light as a result of a complaint by one of my constituents, and I naively believed the government when it said that the practice had stopped. The Audit Office also found that the government’s management and recovery of debt were inconsistent and that the government collected no information about the impact of their debt management and recovery system on individuals. The government can give no assurance that people are not being placed in real financial hardship as a result of their practices. Only a small proportion of debts are created by deliberate fraud. The vast majority of debts are caused by the complex nature of our social security system. In recent months, we have seen the continuation of the flawed family payment system. We have seen the government’s clawback on age pensions and the extraordinary double standards shown by the government in applying a different standard to families paid two lots of the government’s election bribe while cracking down on age pensioners, the disabled and carers. MAIN COMMITTEE",228,Adjournment
328,Ms Hall,"To date, numerous petitions on this issue have been submitted to the House.Back in June, Senate estimates figures showed that the Howard government had raised almost $39 million of Centrelink debts against more than 15,000 pensioners. The government may not collect information about the financial hardship its debt management and recovery system people in Australia but we do, because we see it on a weekly basis in our electorate offices. Currently in the cases I have before my office we have the government trying to claw back $85,635 from aged pensioners, $21,000 from the disabled, $37,899 in family tax benefits and $39,488 from students and young people. That is a total of $184,022 from my electorate alone-and these are just the cases that we know about and that are current. The worse case I have is the case of a couple on the age pension. The debt that the government claims they owe was not brought about by deliberate fraud; it has come about because the government failed to conduct basic annual checks of partners’ income. In this case, one person was on the age pension and the other had casual employment. They informed Centrelink of their income and provided income tax returns on request. The person on the age pension had never received a full age pension and their pension fluctuated, but, because the government failed to match the income information provided by them with Centrelink data on an annual basis, they have incurred a debt. If they had been told of the debt in the first year, I have no doubt at all they would have repaid the money and the problem would not have occurred again. Both of them are now on an age pension. The initial bill the couple received from the government was a massive $30,000. The government has now, after a wait of over five weeks, given them their first ARO review. In my view, this system is designed to automatically knock people back and dissuade them from further pursuing the matter. They have now been told their combined debt is $35,000. The couple are incredibly distraught by being faced with this level of debt at this time of their lives. Despite being part of the way through their appeal process and having sought a waiver from the parliamentary secretary, they have had to start their repayments. They are frankly mortified by the situation they find themselves in. Further examples in my office include a 66-year-old who received an overpayment from Centrelink of $16,000. While her daughter contacted Centrelink and was informed that it was okay, Centrelink immediately automatically withdrew from her bank account $8,000, the balance of that account. Another lady received a debt of over $7,500 due to CPI increases in her Netherlands part pension. Failure by the government to data match and make adjustments has seen her have to repay over $5,000 of that money. In relation to family tax benefit, I had the case of a woman receiving an overpayment of $1,000, despite declaring her regular income. I have also had cases of couples being told to repay on credit card. Is it any wonder that this audit report found that the government’s debt management system is inconsistent, in some cases heavy handed and unable to ascertain whether the government’s debt recovery activities place people in real financial hardship? We know they do place people in real financial hardship. The review announced by the minister is totally inadequate. The system needs reform. Lindsay Electorate Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay-Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (12.08 p.m.)-Under the Commonwealth’s Roads to Recovery program, Penrith City Council has received $3.637 million over the life of the project from 2001 to 2005. So far, only $2.879 million has been spent. Therefore over $757,000 remains to be spent in the financial year MAIN COMMITTEE 2004-05 on specific programs via council application. One of the projects I recommend to council is Chain of Ponds Road. I have received a petition from a number of concerned residents regarding the dangerous intersection into Chain of Ponds Road from Northern Road within my electorate. It is a very bad accident waiting to happen. There is no space to wait on Northern Road while you are turning and there is certainly no through lane so that traffic backing up behind you can swing to the left and get past you. This encourages motorists to overtake from behind cars, possibly collecting a car turning right or, with oncoming cars, causing some dire accidents. There have been a number of very near misses, according to my constituents. It is an area that needs some attention. Whether it needs to be as serious as lights or just a widening of the road at that point to two lanes to incorporate a turning lane is up to road specialists to determine. But something certainly needs to be done in that area before an accident occurs. A place which has seen numerous accidents-this is not an accident waiting to happen; accidents have occurred on a regular basis-is at the intersection of Mulgoa Road, Spencer Street and School House Road. It is a very crowded intersection. The residents exiting Regentville or Glenmore Park, in my area, come along Mulgoa Road and have School House Road to the right, coming down from a very busy and large primary school, and Spencer Street on the left. Again, there is not sufficient room for cars backed up waiting to turn, and motorists on the inside lack a clear enough field of vision to make a good judgment of when to turn. We have seen a number of instances when cars have turned across one lane of traffic, and the second lane of traffic has not seen the turning car and has collected them on the way through. There have been several very nasty accidents already at that intersection. Another area of concern is Old Church Lane. It has been turned into a dead end with the lakes development, and that has caused much consternation to the constituents along the road. Again, I have received a number of petitions from residents in that area. I would like to see an upgrade of that road, as well as police attention to the road because it seems to be a loitering area for vandals. Another place council can pay its attention to-because the council does charge our ratepayers outrageously, and recently we have seen a 30 per cent rise in council fees for some ratepayers-is near Kingswood railway station. There is an uncovered portion of pipeline there that is running parallel to Park Road in Kingswood. It is an unusual part of the pipeline to be exposed. All along that area there are units. It is a very high-density living area, and something as unsavoury as that pipeline needs to be covered. I have yet to mention the inordinate number of footpaths that are still to be built around our area. I notice that the Liberal councillors on Penrith City Council have been making good efforts in this area and in the last few years have upped the amount that council spends on footpaths, but there is still a significant number of footpaths that need to be put around our area. The money was placed with council when developments went ahead, so that council could come back later and put in the footpaths once all the driveways were in place in the various subdivisions, but council seems to have pocketed the money and left residents without footpaths. That money should be used now and council should hurry and start putting those footpaths down around our new subdivisions. Other things that council could be working on include the beautification of the Jamison Park area, Grey Gums Oval and Tench Reserve, to create some lovely walking tracks around MAIN COMMITTEE our area so that when our residents do finally get on the new footpaths they can go down the end of their street to a really nice walking area-which would also fit into the government’s healthy living plan and obesity in schools program. Early Childhood Ms O’BYRNE (Bass) (12.13 p.m.)-Approaching nine years in government, what can the Prime Minister and those on the opposite side claim as anything like a national strategy for early childhood? Labor quite rightly places the early years of every life on the first rung of the ladder of opportunity. A working partnership between the Commonwealth and the states and territories on the vast array of issues which affect the early years must be a priority of the highest order. When the member for Werriwa became the Leader of the Opposition he demonstrated most emphatically Labor’s commitment to proper and adequate support for a national strategy for early childhood development. His first question in the House as leader was about just that. He asked why the government had no early childhood strategy. We failed to get an answer then and we have seen virtually nothing of substance since. It took until earlier this month-almost nine long years after Howard and his ministers took office-for something to appear, and then the best they could manage was a dollar-free draft national agenda for early childhood. On the other hand, it is not a theme that we have forgotten. Once again it is Labor with the ideas, Labor creating the agenda, Labor showing that it understands what Australians need. Read Aloud Australia, an assault on childhood obesity, support for community playgroups, acceptance of the recommendations of the experts on infant vaccinations, and a commissioner for children and young people form the beginning of Labor’s plan for early childhood development. While the government muddles and engages in the odd bit of rhetoric, we on this side of the House are listening and responding to the needs of the parents of the youngest Australians. The recent framework announced by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is the government’s first attempt, despite being in power since 1996, to engage the states and territories on childhood issues. One of my organisations, the Child Health Association, recently wrote to the Minister for Family and Community Services about the lack in many parts of the country of parenting facilities-clean and easy-to-access feeding and changing areas for babies and accessible toilets for young children, regardless of the gender of the parent or carer with them at the time. What became of the letter? It was referred to the department, who said, ‘No, it’s not our problem; it is all to do with the state department.’ Why? Because this government has no strategy for dealing with the issues-no compact with states and territories, no plan to ensure that the role of families is well regarded in the community. Labor do have a plan, and we will work with the states to ensure that we develop good strategies for children and families. The first five years of a child’s life are absolutely critical to development. Learning does not begin when a child first enters school; it starts on the first day of life. All governments must be receptive to the needs of parents and be prepared to partner them in ensuring that children have the best possible start in life. Community playgroups, mostly run by voluntary committees of parents and grandparents, play a valuable role in this regard, and we believe they deserve more support. We believe that the government ought to partner these groups through targeted provision of additional resources. The Leader of the Opposition in a recent speech drew attention to international studies which have shown that it is possible to predict a child’s opportunities in life by the age of five. This demonstrates the absolute importance of a MAIN COMMITTEE real and working Australian agenda for early childhood development. Every Australian child deserves the opportunity of a fair go in life. If, as has been indicated, those first five years are so critical then they need a range of supportive and supported environments in their own homes, at child care centres, in playgroups and at preschool. Australia’s younger citizens deserve to be supported, engaged and challenged in appropriate ways. They need opportunities to interact with other children and adults in friendly circumstances. For too long the ideologies of those opposite have left all of these issues to look after themselves, but the reality is that failure to invest in the earliest years is a recipe for lower education, fewer social opportunities and lower standards for those who miss out. The words of the Treasurer urging Australians to populate have a hollow ring when one takes time to reflect on what the government has planned for each newborn’s first five years-essentially nothing. The other area that I wish to discuss is to do with the ABC’s commercial arm, ABC Enterprises. While I am fully aware that it is not parliament’s role to determine what the ABC should broadcast and the nature of ABC programming, I am particularly concerned that ABC Enterprises may have been handed the power and authority to make the judgment on what Australian children will see on television. The ABC children’s television department has quite rightly been feted over time for its knowledge and expertise. It has made a substantial contribution to the education and enjoyment of countless young Australians. It is therefore very disappointing that the ABC now appears to have become beholden to the commercial dollar. Sadly this is even evident in the area of children’s television. It seems that the programs our children will in future see on ABC television will be determined by the marketability and profitability of spin-off products such as videos, DVDs, books, toys and other merchandise. Marketing should not become the primary consideration of an organisation such as the ABC. The recent advertisement by ABC Enterprises for expressions of interest in developing a program for toddlers or slightly older girls was accompanied by the rider that the program should be commercially saleable intellectual property for the ABC. The advertisement further required the program to have broad international potential in respect of both TV program sales and ancillary rights exploitation. These outcomes are fine as flow-on benefits but, as I have said before, they should not be the primary consideration. The development of children’s minds and thoughts are too important for that. The ABC, as an independent broadcaster, has a terribly important role in children’s television. One key aspect has been its ability and capacity to place other issues ahead of commercial considerations. This ought not change. Defence Industry: Tenix Ms GAMBARO (Petrie)-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence) (12.18 p.m.)-I am privileged to be speaking today regarding the historic signing-which I had the pleasure of attending the other night-of the $500 million contract between Tenix and New Zealand for Project Protector. While that is terrific news for the New Zealand government, it is also terrific news for Australian companies of the high calibre of Tenix. Tenix is one of the top 50 defence companies in the world and it employs some 3,000 people in locations throughout Australia and the Asia-Pacific region. It is involved in a number of areas that benefit Australian jobs and provide very valuable support to our defence industries. Those areas are aerospace, land and marine, and electronic. MAIN COMMITTEE The Aerospace Division was established in 1998. It provides support to the Australian defence forces and employs 170 personnel. It is a very specialised area that provides design for a number of defence aircraft. Its standards are very good; it delivers world’s best practice. The Aerospace Division is also ISO 9001 approved. It does all sorts of terrific things such as system design, aircraft integration, development of ground flight and systems tests, and logistical support. The Land Division employs a large number of Australian employees in Wingfield in Adelaide and also in areas such as the Albury-Wodonga region. Both sides are capable of managing production activities. In particular, the Bandiana site manages the garrison support side of things and the logistical part that is so very important. The marine aspect, though, is perhaps the one we hear about the most, particularly when we are talking about frigates and the ability of companies of high calibre, such as Tenix, to deliver the frigates on time, which they do. They deliver as per their contract on time and in a professional manner. The Marine Division, a newly formed division, has shipbuilding in Western Australia and naval systems in Victoria and is the central point of contact for Commonwealth Defence managers of marine projects combining west coast and east coast activities. The particular vessels that were launched the other night will perform very valuable work in fishing and protection activities. It is with that in mind that the Australian government will be watching very closely the success of the New Zealand contract. The Marine Division also has some operating facilities located at Henderson in Western Australia. It is very important that that construction, repair and maintenance work continue. The Rockingham site in Western Australia and the Williamstown site in Victoria provide inservice support activities, and other support facilities are located in Darwin in the Northern Territory and at the World Trade Centre in Melbourne. This company has grown. We should be very proud of our Australian companies and the support that they provide. There are many locations around the world where Tenix is also placed, and it delivers to other countries quality services in providing tenders and very good services such as shipbuilding services. Another area that is extremely important is the electronic systems area, an area that Tenix has also been involved in. It provides systems engineering and integration, design, development, installation, test, manufacture and all kinds of electronic software, electro-optics, mechanical and aeronautical systems. That is extremely important, particularly when you are dealing with simulation, electronic warfare, command, control and communication, and surveillance and reconnaissance. I know that the Australian defence forces will benefit from much of the logistical work that is being done by the company, and I know that the technology in this country and our innovations are something that we can be truly proud of. There are many companies that are providing services for our defence forces that provide us with top technological standards and innovation. I want to say one last thing before I close. The Tenix Group have had a very successful and very dynamic impact on this country, and they will continue to provide this very valuable assistance and support. I congratulate them on their latest milestone. I know that they will continue to be a world-class defence supply company into the future. (Time expired) MAIN COMMITTEE Defence: Military Justice Minister for Defence that Labor are also pleased that Tenix has won the Project Protector contract.

I ask, Parliamentary Secretary: why was every avenue of internal redress proved to be unsuccessful but, as soon as you have got an independent external body-the WA Medical Board inquiry-it unanimously finds the doctor is guilty of a whole range of professional misconduct? This is the same doctor who was on the HMAS Kanimbla and who gave injections to those ratings and servicemen that were sent to the Middle East. Remember that controversy? This is a doctor who is found guilty of not being able to maintain a professional confidence of a patient. Is there any rating or soldier that has suffered as a result of you and the department deliberately secreting this doctor away to the Middle East so he could not face these charges? I think these are reasonable questions to ask. It is very good for the parliamentary secretary to be proud about the ship contract, but what about how it affects personnel-how a distinguished naval officer, who is entitled to look to a career where she probably would have reached the rank of rear admiral, has had her career destroyed? We do not hear a word out of the minister; we do not hear a word out of the parliamentary secretary. Why won’t you make a full statement?

Foreign Affairs: Taiwan about the talking up of tensions across the Taiwan Strait and the belligerence that was being adopted in certain areas on that. I was interested to read in the Weekend Australian of 7 and 8 August quite a large feature, headed up ‘Storms on the strait’. That article states: Sino-Taiwanese relations-edgy at the best of times-have deteriorated following the re-election in May of President Chen Shui-bian who has promised to adopt a new constitution for Taiwan in 2008-a move that Beijing sees as tantamount to an act of self-determination. The article also states: China’s state-run newsagency Xinhua quoted ... minister Cao Gangchuan as pledging that the 2.5 million-strong Chinese military would crush any attempt at independence by Taiwan. The article further stated: “For Taiwan, Beijing’s rhetoric and a belligerence reflected in a build-up of missiles are creating an increasingly tense situation-and a self-defeating stance,” noted the Financial Times. “Threats from Beijing have always antagonised Taiwan, widening the divide across the strait.” As I said in my previous contribution, why is the PRC talking up this tension across the Taiwan Strait? Why all of a sudden is the PRC getting edgy about this? They point to the Taiwanese elections. No doubt the PRC would point to Taiwanese elections-they do not have much experience of elections themselves. But there was a proper, fair and democratic election in Taiwan in May of this year. There had previously been an election in Taiwan where President Chen was elected and he was re-elected in May this year. As I said in my previous contribution, there was a lot of talk in Taiwan amongst the various political parties about what the outcome of the election would be and whether there was a proindependence position.

344,Mr Leo Mcleay (Watson) (12.28 P.m.),"Recently in this chamber I raised a questiondent Chen’s party was in favour of independence, were the old KMT regime. They left China in the forties and still pretended, right up until they were defeated by President Chen and the democratic forces in Taiwan-they pretended right up until this century-that they were still the government of China. Now they have changed their tack and they maintain that President Chen is interested in having independence. The interesting thing that people should do, as I said in my last contribution, is go back to what President Chen said at his inauguration. At the inauguration of the President and Vice President on 20 May this year, the President said that Taiwan was going to get into a constitutional re-engineering project. He said that that project’s aims were to enhance good governance and increase administrative efficiency to ensure a solid foundation for the democratic rule of law, and to foster long-term stability and prosperity of the nation. He went on to say: There are many problems in our current Constitution that need to be tackled, amongst which the more immediate and obvious include: whether to have a three-branch or five-branch separation of power; whether to adopt a presidential or parliamentary system of government; whether the president should be elected by a relative majority or an absolute majority; reform of the national legislature and relevant articles; the role of the National Assembly and its retainment versus abolishment; whether to suspend or abolish the provincial government; lowering of voting age; modification of compulsory military service requirements; protection of basic human rights and the rights of the disadvantaged; and, principles governing the running of the national economy. Indeed, this will be a project of grand scale that is certain to have significant impact. But he went on to say that there was a great non-issue. He said: In the same context, I am fully aware that consensus has yet to be reached on issues related to national sovereignty, territory and the subject of unification/independence; therefore, let me explicitly propose that these particular issues be excluded from the present constitutional re-engineering project. It could not be any more plain. The President of Taiwan is not talking about independence. The PRC are beating this up for reasons known only to them. (Time expired) Capricornia Electorate: Shoalwater Bay Ms LIVERMORE (Capricornia) (12.34 p.m.)-It has always been my belief that the most important job of a member of parliament is to be the voice of his or her community in the parliament. I am here as the voice of the people of Central Queensland and as a link between them and the government. Right now the people of Central Queensland, particularly those living on the Capricorn Coast, have a message for the Howard government about the plans it has for Shoalwater Bay. On their behalf I am asking the Minister for Defence for some answers. Shoalwater Bay, just 80 kilometres north of the city of Rockhampton, is a special part of my electorate for a number of reasons. To many Central Queenslanders lucky enough to get out on the water and explore it, Shoalwater Bay is a spectacular natural treasure with miles of beaches and clear blue waters reaching out to the Great Barrier Reef. We are also well aware of Shoalwater Bay’s other purpose and the important role it plays in the defence of Australia. The Shoalwater Bay training area has been managed by the Australian Defence Force since 1965. It is recognised as one of Australia’s premier defence training areas, encompassing 270,000 hectares of land and 180,000 hectares of marine reserve. Apart from its size, it has enormous value to Defence because it is the only place in Australia where the Navy, Army and Air Force can engage in joint exercises involving all three MAIN COMMITTEE forces as well as forces from other countries. We in Central Queensland have always been pleased to play our role as host to the visiting forces of our allies, such as the Singaporeans and the Americans, when they have stayed in our region to take part in joint exercises up at Shoalwater Bay. The large joint exercises bring welcome dollars into our businesses large and small. The soldiers spend up big in Rockhampton and Yeppoon when they are on leave, and many other local businesses have taken the initiative and geared up their operations to support defence activities in our region. It is because we have always been so supportive of these joint exercises in the past that the people of Central Queensland are so angry and concerned about the treatment they have received from the defence minister since his announcement on 8 July this year that the US and Australian governments had agreed to develop a joint combined training centre. The minister’s statement identified Shoalwater Bay as a key part of that plan. The minister’s statement refers to Shoalwater Bay as one of the sites in Australia to be ‘further developed and able to be linked with American facilities’. He said: Our initial priority will be to upgrade the Shoalwater Bay facility to support the first of the Talisman Sabre series of biennial joint training exercises that will be undertaken in 2007 ... He went on: Talisman Sabre will see tens of thousands of Australian and US military personnel undertake land, sea and air training in operations such as full-scale amphibious landing, airstrike bomb runs using live munitions as well as high-tech computer simulated scenarios. If you will pardon the pun, Mr Deputy Speaker, that news hit Central Queensland like a bombshell. Shoalwater Bay is in our backyard, and here was the Australian government making plans for it with no consideration or acknowledgement of what it might mean for the local community and the fact that we might have liked to be consulted on its impact before hearing about it on the nightly news. The minister’s statement aroused significant concern throughout the Central Queensland community-concern which only grew as the weeks passed and still no answers came from Minister Hill to clarify exactly what was planned for Shoalwater Bay. What about the local roads surrounding Shoalwater Bay? Will Livingstone Shire ratepayers continue to foot the bill for their maintenance and repair following exercises, or does the government plan to pay its fair share? What about the significant environmental value of Shoalwater Bay-are there guarantees that it will be protected? Does this mean troops will be permanently based in Central Queensland? Minister Hill’s failure to engage with our community and share the details of the government’s plan was an insult to a community that has given loyal and patriotic support to joint exercises that we recognise as a vital part of preparations for our nation’s security. The Morning Bulletin newspaper in Rockhampton summed up the feeling in the community in its editorial on 21 July, entitled ‘What is Howard trying to hide?’ It said: We’re not happy being treated like second class citizens over the Shoalwater Bay defence force agreement. Our entire community is angry and insulted that our federal government is hiding from us information which we more than anyone else in the country have a right to know. Finally, on 29 July we got some reassurance from the minister in his statement confirming that ‘the US is not seeking to base forces in Australia’. But questions are still being raised by the Capricorn Coast community and its representatives. I have written to the minister on their MAIN COMMITTEE behalf, asking, among other things, that he release full details of the agreement signed with the US government and that he answer questions such as what measures will be put in place to deal with the social impact of any upgrade, whether Shoalwater Bay will be permanently closed, whether the US will want sovereignty of the area, what capital input will be involved and what funding will be provided for the necessary infrastructure. I want those answersand, more importantly, the people of Central Queensland deserve those answers. Health and Ageing: Aged Care not have in their electorates aged care facilities and, in particular, retirement villages that service the needs of those who have moved from their own homes and live independently, some for long periods of time, in arrangements that allow them some flexibility in their lives. The residents of these places do not require accommodation in aged care facilities specifically designed for those who cannot care for themselves, and they have entered into these arrangements on the understanding and expectation that they would not be subjected to the impost of the GST in relation to the service fees and costs associated with their accommodation. The reason why they had that expectation was that there was an explicit commitment given by the coalition government before the introduction of the GST that it would exclude retirement village residents. Sadly, there has been an ongoing area of uncertainty because of the way in which the Australian Taxation Office has been flagging that many of the services and costs related to the provision of aged care services to those in independent retirement will in fact now be impacted by the GST. On Tuesday, I think it was, the Treasurer was asked by the shadow Treasurer, in relation to these particular services, whether or not GST was going to be charged by the Australian Taxation Office. The Treasurer told the parliament that retirement village residents in serviced apartments and independent living units are not GST-free-a direct contradiction of the pledge that they would be free of GST made by the coalition before the introduction of the GST. Yesterday, I understand, the Prime Minister expressed the view that they were in fact going to be GST-free. The problem is that the administrative arrangements that are being pursued by the tax office have not been suspended as a consequence, and those who are living in those independent serviced units and retirement villages rather than aged care facilities as such still believe, rightly, that their costs may now be the subject of additional GST. I have been approached by a number of people in my electorate who are very concerned about this. I have been unable to provide them with any assurances in relation to this. When I pursued it, I found that there was no answer. It caused some difficulties for me because I was unable to provide a clear explanation to my constituents. I feel rather embarrassed about it, but I understand now that the reason why I was unable to find out and give clear answers was that the government itself is pursuing two diametrically opposite approaches. The Treasurer is saying that they will be the subject of GST and the Prime Minister is saying that they will not. The Taxation Office is pursuing arrangements in line with the Treasurer’s instructions and is looking for arrangements as to how the GST will be applied. My constituents are entitled to clarity, particularly before the next election. They are entitled to me being able to provide them with a clear answer and I am entitled, I believe, to be able to provide them with that clear answer. Thus far I am not able to do so. I find that extremely disconcerting-much less disconcerting, I am certain, than the residents in, for examMAIN COMMITTEE",237,Adjournment

That place provides accommodation for many people who are entitled to a secure understanding of their future. I would like to be able to give it to them. Sadly, I am not able to. I hope this issue is clarified by the end of this parliamentary sitting week because, if it is not, all around Australia there are going to be thousands, if not tens of thousands, of elderly Australians who will be left in a state of complete uncertainty as to whether or not, after the next election, this GST will be imposed, contrary to the commitments given by the government before(Time expired) Same-Sex Relationships living happily in communities all around Australia. Many of them do not wish to marry; some do. But until the recent legislation introduced by the Howard government, this question of gay marriage was not an issue in Australian politics. There was no community campaign seeking the right to marry on the part of gays and lesbians-some wish to; some do not. I support the amendments to the Marriage Act that the Howard government is putting forward, because they reflect the existing reality and the existing law, but I object strenuously to the homophobia being purveyed by the Howard government surrounding those amendments-the transparent attempt to inflame hatred of gays and lesbians in the community for political purposes. Ultimately we cannot vote on the motives behind a particular piece of legislation or indeed the rhetoric surrounding that legislation or who it is announced to but on the merit of the legislation. The vicious bullying strategy that we saw from the Howard government surrounding refugees in the last election is now sought to be replicated by attacks on gays and lesbians, and that is not something that I or the Labor Party are going to join in. We condemn it absolutely. Labor have already determined our policy on these issues some time ago-in fact, November last year-indicating that we do not support changing the definition of marriage away from heterosexual couples but we are committed to eliminating all forms of discrimination against gay and lesbian couples, whether it is in superannuation, taxation, immigration, property or family law. Inevitably there will be a need in our community for some means of formal recognition or formalisation of same-sex relationships to ensure that gay and lesbian couples can enjoy equivalent rights to those of heterosexual couples obtained through the marriage institution. As the shadow minister for community relationships, I am committed to pursuing some kind of formalisation available to gay and lesbian couples. Our society should support, acknowledge and recognise all loving, nurturing relationships as worthwhile. The formal mechanisms through which we do this may vary. We do not have to adapt an existing mechanism to suit other circumstances. We can create new mechanisms, and that is what we need to do to ensure that gay and lesbian couples can enjoy the same equivalent rights that married heterosexual couples enjoy in our society. I think the practical issues of discrimination are more important than the symbolism of the word ‘marriage’. We need to commit ourselves as a society to ensuring that those thousands of couples who do live happily in good, genuine, caring, loving relationships are able to enjoy the legal protections-and the responsibilities-that married couples also enjoy and that they have access to a framework of legal rights and responsibilities covering issues like property MAIN COMMITTEE",240,Adjournment
346,Mr Tanner (Melbourne) (12.44 P.m.),"There are thousands of gay and lesbian couplesrights, custody of children, taxation, superannuation, social security and matters involving next of kin, such as organ donation and turning off life support. All of those issues can be covered in an equivalent legal relationship. I am proud that 10 years ago I was part of a government that legalised, finally, all homosexual activity between consenting adults in Australia. That in itself shows how far we have come as a society in such a very short time on these issues, but it also illustrates how far we have to go. It is a long, hard battle in Australia for decency, for equal rights and for fairness. I am committed to ensuring that we fight that battle to its ultimate conclusion. We must not allow the voices of hate, prejudice and religious fundamentalism to deter us. We must not let the desperate political manipulations of the Prime Minister get in the road of this important, vital pursuit of genuine human rights for all Australians. I have no doubt that in the past it has been Labor governments that have achieved the great steps forward in human rights in this country such as the abolition of the Tasmanian criminalising legislation 10 years ago, and I have no doubt that it will be Labor governments in the future that achieve these very important social gains. For all the posturing of the minor parties like the Greens and the Democrats, who demand everything overnight-safe in the knowledge that they do not have to deliver it, safe in the knowledge that they do not have to change community opinion, and safe in the knowledge that they do not have to win government to actually achieve those outcomes-it will be a Labor government in the future that delivers equal rights for gay and lesbian couples and gives them access to something like a civil union framework that ensures they have the ability to live, as couples, the same kinds of lives, with the same kinds of legal rights and responsibilities, as married heterosexual couples do in our society. East Timor Chisholm Electorate: Caroline Chisholm Awards Ms BURKE (Chisholm) (12.49 p.m.)-I rise today to express my gratitude and thanks to the Rotary Club of Huntingdale, which last Friday night hosted a dinner in honour of Kirsty Sword Gusmao, who spoke at the dinner. She spoke passionately about her adopted country and about her frustration at the current government’s futile attempts to refuse to negotiate with that country. I was very pleased to read in the paper about possible negotiations and to see in the gallery yesterday Jose Ramos Horta. Hopefully, those negotiations have recommenced, because for the current government to refuse to negotiate with East Timor is absolutely barbaric. East Timor is the newest nation on the earth and one of the poorest. To not give it justice in respect of its own resources is just criminal. East Timor is a country crying out with need. We are currently providing it aid; I do not see why we should not do a fair deal that gives it the resources so that it can provide for its own people. Kirsty went through some statistics. Unfortunately, I do not have them with me today but they were quite frightening. Particularly frightening were the rates of infant mortality and childhood diseases. It was stark to hear about a country that has been deserted by the international community. She talked about the Portuguese stance during their time in East Timor and how fundamentally they had not done anything on the ground. The Indonesians did even less, because they destroyed the country and took things away, well before the fatal invasion and the lead-up to the vote for independence. Kirsty spoke about her passion for and delight with MAIN COMMITTEE the Timorese people, a proud people who, in some respects because of their isolation, have been able to continue, maintain and foster their own culture. It was a delight to hear Kirsty, and it was a wonderful function for the Rotary Club of Huntingdale to organise. Rotarians throughout Australia but particularly in Victoria have been extremely generous in their support of Timor. Shipment upon shipment of goods has been sent across. Kirsty stressed that it is really good if you ask the Timorese what they are in need of before you ship something, because some things have arrived that are unusable. There is a lack of constant electricity; there is a lack of a constant power supply. One recent Rotary shipment was of old-style typewriters that we might think obsolete, but in a country that does not have a sufficient power supply it was an absolute godsend. We might not like paper and carbon, but over there they are keeping the system going. We would not want old-style, treadmill sewing machines, but in a country without a constant electricity supply they are an absolute bonus. We need to show justice to our neighbour, a country that fought with us and gave us aid during World War II, a country we have a proud history with. It is a disgrace that we have not been able to resolve the Sunrise gas contract to ensure that the project is up and running and that much needed royalties flow to East Timor, a country that is in great need. It is also very unfair for our government to say, ‘We’re only going to negotiate twice every year,’ as opposed to getting down to brass tacks and saying, ‘This is a new nation.’ There have been movements in maritime law. It is time to sit down and do justice for this nation. The Rotary Club of Huntingdale presented Kirsty with a cheque for $7,000, and more was raised on the night. It was an absolute privilege and joy to be there and to meet such an amazing woman, who had such wonderful, glowing things to say about her adopted country. I wish her well with her third pregnancy. I am not sure how she manages it. I do not know how we manage it in this place sometimes with our children, but this woman has two small children and another on the way and is running around the world trying to get justice for her adopted people. She is running the Alola Foundation for Timorese women, and it is doing phenomenally great work. We need to encourage support and to do more for this country. I would also like to state that this coming SaturdayI will be hosting the Caroline Chisholm awards, which I am pleased to be hosting for the fifth year in a row. I am hopeful that I will be home to attend the awards; my big message to the Senate is: let me go home to attend the awards. I am looking forward to over 500 people coming along and witnessing me saying thank you, on behalf of my community in Chisholm, to 30 volunteers and 50 runners-up who have given so much back to my community.

347,Mr Laurie Ferguson (Reid) (12.54 P.m.),"Australia is a land of an increasingly diass fellow Australians. I think the recent events in Perth are at the extreme edge of that problem. Over the past few years I have been pleased to support many positive steps on the part of interfaith dialogue in Sydney. One of those is Affinity, which is essentially a Turkish organisation that has conducted a number of events including interfaith discussions, seminars and briefings et cetera and, most recently, the 3rd International Interfaith Conference at the University of Western Sydney at Rydalmere on 30 May. In relation to that visit, I was pleased to meet in my office Professor Ibrahim Ozdemir, a leading authority and worker in interfaith knowledge and work, on 28 May. Also, there are the Australian Partnership of Ethnic and Religious Organisations or for the Study of Jewish Civilisation. They held the Third International Inter-Religion Abraham Conference in Melbourne on 22 May. I also had the pleasure of attending an event in Adelaide in relation to this. The title gives you the gist of it-it is about Jews, Muslims and Christians working together around the commonality of Abraham’s contribution to their religions. Whilst national and international efforts are important, it is crucial that there is grassroots activity around these matters. I want to recognise the work of the Catholic Bishop of the Parramatta Diocese, Kevin Manning. Of course, we are aware that he also did a lot of work in regard to aircraft issues in our region. He and Keysar Trad from the Islamic community have been at the forefront of a number of local events. Crucial in this is that they are actually in the western suburbs, not suburbs that have a high Anglo-Saxon content. It is no good talking about these issues in Balmain, Glebe, Granville and Auburn. These events have been featured at Greystanes. I attended one at which there were about 500 people present. There was a very good and open exchange and an honest throwing of ideas around the room. More recently, on 30 July at Castle Hill, the theme was that Christians and Muslims have more in common than most people think. Annangrove has been subject to attacks on the site of a proposed Islamic prayer centre, so it is taking the issue out to where the forefront of the problems are. I congratulate all of those organisations. I want to join the member for Cunningham in recognising the contribution of Bill Whiley, who died very recently. Bill was a former Communist Party alderman in the Broken Hill City Council. He then played a major role in the miners federation on the South Coast and in many local campaigns. He must have been into his eighties when he expired. Recently he had been involved in the Sandon Point issue-that is a very controversial development issue down there. Every Christmas when I went down there I would go to the pub along the coast-I have forgotten the name of itBetween bets we would have discussions about politics. He was a very militant and active person on the South Coast who gave a lot to the Labor movement and the broader progressive politics of this country. He was a person who did not actually believe in any particular political party but strove to improve the condition of his fellow humans. His most recent activity of later years was to do with retired members of unions-superannuants and pensioners. MAIN COMMITTEE",243,Adjournment

349,Mr Laurie Ferguson,"Yes, I went to both of them fairly regularly on my holidays.I also want to recognise at this stage the recent death of former councillor Reg Norford of the Parramatta City Council. He was in there in the fifties and sixties during a period when Parramatta was probably at the forefront of activities with regard to libraries, baby health centres and those types of things. Norford Park in South Granville is named after him. He had a long tradition of political activity in our area and I want to recognise him. Both of those people made major contributions. I really appreciate the comments made by the member for Cunningham. We both knew Bill Whiley very well and we recognise his activities in the broader Wollongong region and in the broader Labor movement. Defence: Royal Australian Air Force reseal program. It has been an issue that has been ongoing for a long time. In fact, it started back in the 1970s and ran right through to the 1990s. It is something that is of grave concern to me and many of my constituents as RAAF base Amberley is a significant part of my electorate. The reason it has come back up for discussion is twofold. One reason is that there is a new report, Study of health outcomes in aircraft maintenance personnel: Phase II Mortality and cancer incidence study, the second report, April 2004. The other is the growing incidence of cancer related death or the suffering of the people who worked on those programs during the seventies right through to the 1990s. The first board of inquiry originally commissioned was the largest board of inquiry of its type to ever take place in Australia. This goes to show the level of complexity and the problems associated with the deseal-reseal program. I want to put on the record a couple of things which I think are really important. This report found quite conclusively a number of things, particularly with regard to the incidence of cancer. The study found a higher rate of the incidence of cancer in the deseal-reseal group with an increase of around 40 to 50 per cent relative to both the Amberley and Richmond comparison groups. The report found conclusively that there was a raised incidence. What disturbs me is that for a lot of years the government has known about this but has not acted. That to me is distressing. It is distressing to many of my constituents who live in my area and are suffering because of the work they undertook as part of their official duties with the Air Force. There have been a lot of changes since those days. When the report was originally tabled in 2001, Air Marshal Houston made a number of comments, and I want to put one on the record. He said, ‘While we cannot change the past, we can ensure that all current and future working environments are safe for our people.’ While I do not want to attribute anything in particular in terms of an admission from what he said, it is a clear indication that the practices in the past were bad; they were unsafe. I think there was a macho culture in the Air Force and right across our military. It was a culture which basically said that you did not have to wear protective clothing, eye protection or gloves when working with chemicals; in fact, it was frowned upon. There was a real culture that to be a man and work in these environments you did not need to be protected and that you would be okay. We now know that that is not the case; that these people did have high exposure to very poisonous and carcinogenic materials. They are now paying the penalty. Their families are suffering and they are suffering. They have high incidence rates of cancer and, as this very significant report of many hundreds of pages indicates, these people are suffering greatly. WhatI would like to see the government do, now it has the weight of evidence from this report that it needs, is to take the steps necessary to properly compensate and recognise the MAIN COMMITTEE",244,Apero Convened By The Federation Of Ethnic Communities Councils Of Australia Or Fecca The Australian Intercultural Society The Catholic Interfaith Committee And The Centre
350,Mr Ripoll (Oxley) (12.59 P.m.),"I want to raise the issue of the RAAF F111 desealsuffering of these people who were involved in the deseal-reseal programs from the seventies to the nineties. I think that there is a responsibility attached to government. While government is more than prepared to cloak itself in the flag of the military in times of war and in times of trouble and is more than prepared to take all the public benefits of its military, I think at the same time it has to take responsibility publicly for things that took place-no matter how long ago and no matter what the cost, because this does involve some matter of cost. The people and the families, many of whom I have spoken to personally, cannot understand why it has taken the government so long to do something about this. This commission of inquiry report, this phase II report, gives very hard evidence to what these people anecdotally have been telling us for a long time. I think it is enough evidence for the government now to take the responsible action of looking at proper compensation for the people affected. If we are going to be serious about this issue, just like in the James Hardie case where a company is responsible for its work force, so too must the military, the RAAF and the government accept responsibility. I think it is time that the government seriously looked at the findings of this report and properly compensated families for their suffering. (Time expired) Education: Teachers lar, the debate going on about the state school-private school divide. I have an immense respect for teachers. I think teachers are the custodians of the minds of our children. They do not just teach literacy and numeracy; they teach other subjects, like geography, history, sociology and many others, depending on what sort of school you go to. I therefore find it extraordinary that the organisation that represents them-at the national level the AEU and at the state level in Queensland the QTU-can indulge in such a dishonest campaign in respect of this matter of state and private funding. Their arguments are totally and utterly selective. They deny totally the states’ involvement in education. They concentrate totally on the federal part of the cake, which, as we all know, is the minor part of it. One of their great techniques is to pick out the eight or 10 schools of Sydney and Melbourne-schools like Wesley, Scotch, Trinity and King’s-and try to make the public believe that these are representative of all schools in Australia. They then quote the $2.6 million, the $3.2 million, the $3.5 million et cetera. Never anywhere in that debate is the per capita figure given-never! AndI just happen to have some of those figures-for example: Wesley, $2,380; King’s, $2,600; and Scots, $2,330. I do not say that as an apologist for those schools; I am not. I believe in choice. My kids attended both systems. In the private system one of my children attended a Catholic school. One of my children who had trouble with study went to a boarding school. Another one went to a state school. SoI am quite conversant with all three types of education, and I am not an apologist for any one of them. WhatI do want to see is fairness and equity in this system. Against those figures of around $2,000 to $3,000, you find that run-of-the-mill Catholic and Anglican Christian schools get between $4,500 and $5,500-at least, that is the Queensland experience. But the state schools get $11,700 in New South Wales, $10,590 in Victoria and $10,800 in Queensland. Parents, no matter where their kids are sent to school, have all contributed to the taxation system. No-one is suggesting for a minute that the children who go to well-endowed schools MAIN COMMITTEE",245,Apero Convened By The Federation Of Ethnic Communities Councils Of Australia Or Fecca The Australian Intercultural Society The Catholic Interfaith Committee And The Centre
351,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (1.04 P.m.),"I wish to talk about schoolteachers and, in particushould get the same money as children who go to state schools. I have never argued that case. But to argue that they are not entitled to anything is distinctly un-Australian and dishonest. The QTU go around Queensland whipping up this campaign-they are going to launch it in my electorate, and I will be delighted to debate this issue with them-never telling the full story, selectively whipping up the idea of envy and division in the community and taking us back almost to the edge of that sectarian divide of 30 or 40 years ago, which was appalling. These are the custodians of the minds of our children. And the union are sending home in the lunch boxes of children selective material so it will get to parents. Is that an appropriate use of school facilities, making the kids take things home in their lunch box? I have been into a couple of school common rooms and seen noticeboards packed from end to end with ALP and Queensland Teachers Union literature-not a space for anything else. Is that the appropriate use of the state schools, which should be neutral grounds for people of all political persuasions? No, it is not appropriate. If the state schools are short, it is because the Queensland government in the 2003 budget could only afford a 2.4 per cent increase-it could not match the Commonwealth’s 5.4 per cent-and this year, after a record budget surplus, could only afford a 3.9 per cent increase against the Commonwealth’s 4.5 per cent. That robbed Queensland schools in 2003 of $116 million. Another interesting statistic, on which I will finish, is that the Catholic school system works on a bureaucracy and an administration figure of five per cent. Do you know what that figure is in the New South Wales state school system? It is 25 per cent. Let us direct that 20 per cent to the schoolchildren of the state schools of New South Wales. (Time expired) Aviation: Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport and its impact on my constituents in the electorate of Lowe, in the inner west of Sydney. As you know, I have spoken on innumerable occasions in the life of this parliament and the preceding parliament, and I have also asked an innumerable number of questions. I want to take the parliament through the history of this, because prior to the election of the Howard government in 1996 the coalition aviation policy, entitled ‘Soaring into tomorrow’, made it quite plain that Sydney airport would not be sold until the aircraft noise problems had been resolved. Also during that campaign of 1996, the Liberal candidate made it quite plain that under the Howard government there would be no new flight paths over the electorate of Lowe. That was challenged by the Labor Party in that campaign and it was made quite clear that this could not be achieved under the coalition’s policy. That came to be true. But, worse, since the government got in and promised that under the long-term operating plan those people living north of the airport would only receive 17 per cent of air traffic movements, we have tragically found that air traffic movements have, in the main, been 60 per cent to 80 per cent more and at the moment are running at almost double those promised under the long-term operating plan. Last year, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, Sydney airport was sold, with no resolution to the problems of aircraft noise. Worse, the master plan for Sydney airport over the next 20 years forecasts a massive expansion of air traffic in and out of Sydney because, as we all know, Sydney is the gateway to Australia. That is going to have horrendous consequences for people living in the inner west and particularly for people in my electorate of Lowe.

352,Mr Murphy (Lowe) (1.09 P.m.),"I would like to again raise the issue of aircraft noiseI want to make the point that, under the government’s aviation policy, Badgerys Creek is still their preferred option. You might also remember that last year the opposition took the position that we could never have two major international airports within the Sydney basin, within about 40 kilometres of one another. We have decided that, subject to an EIS-and I note the member for members for Lindsay and Chifley are here, and they understand this very well-there should be a second airport outside the Sydney basin, in the Wilton region. The opposition, in the run-up to the next election, offers the full implementation of the long-term operating plan, which will give relief to my constituents in Lowe. Moreover, we will immediately take it upon ourselves to start an EIS so that we can put in train a process that will one day see a second airport built in the Wilton area, to take the pressure off Sydney airport.

Fran Bailey-The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: The unclassified information that I can provide is as follows. The Australian Defence Force (ADF) does not conduct ship based patrols as such in the Southern Oceans. During the relevant period the ADF did however operate a number of operation deployments. Resources referred to in this answer relate to those deployments and are limited to ADF resources except where otherwise stated. (1) (a) 44 days. (b) nil. (c) 46 days.

(3) (a) 265 ADF personnel and three Australian Fisheries Management Authority officers. (b) One ADF member participated in a Customs surveillance patrol. (c) 363 ADF personnel, two Australian Fisheries Management Authority officers and one Customs officer engaged in operational deployments to the Southern Ocean region in ADF units, and six ADF personnel participated in two Customs surveillance patrols. (4) (a) The net additional cost (1) of the ADF deployment was $20,000. (b) Nil. (c) The net additional cost (1) of the ADF deployment was $405,000. Note (1): The net additional cost reflects the true cost to the taxpayer of undertaking an operation and recognises that the ADF is already funded by the Government to raise, train and maintain personnel and equipment in preparation for operational contingencies. The net additional cost of an operation includes such things as any special equipment purchases required, airlift costs, additional personnel costs such as rations and allowances, extra fuel used by assets employed and remediation costs on completion of the operation.

No person or entity was positively identified as a result of this exercise. Since the initial exercise was undertaken as described above, later lists have been checked against ATO databases. The position is unchanged – still no person or entity has been identified. In the event that a person or identity was positively identified administrative steps would be taken to ensure that in the event of a refund becoming due it would be frozen. (d) 1 x Executive Level1 1 x Australian Public Service Officer Level5 (e) The two officers are involved in dealing with other matters that are within the province of the business line.

Ms Julie Bishop-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (a) and (b) Funding for aged care places is a special appropriation under the Aged Care Act 1997 and is therefore not part of the annual appropriation Budget Bills. Estimates of expense under the Act are based on expected levels of operational places. Under the Act, a subsidy is not payable until a place becomes operational. The estimate in the 2004-05 budget of $5.088 billion includes provision for existing operational beds ($4.8 billion) and for those expected to become operational in the course of the year ($287 million).",258,Questions On Notice
362,Mr Anthony,"The Minister for Family and Community Services has provided the followHealth and Ageing: Aged Care Facilities (Question No. 3663) Ms Hall asked the Minister for Ageing, upon notice, on 17 June 2004: What was the effect of coalescence on money lost on aged care facilities. Ms Julie Bishop-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: The Funding Equalisation and Adjustment Package (FEAP) replaced the coalescence policy from 200001. This followed confirmation by the independent Productivity Commission that there was no basis for differential subsidy rates across the States and Territories. In response to the Productivity Commission’s 1999 Report on Nursing Home Subsidies, the Australian Government provided $148 million over six years from 2000-01 to further ease the transition of aged care services to consistent national rates. Following the release of new rates of subsidy effective 1 July 2004, all States and Territories except Victoria and Tasmania now have the same subsidy rates. Victoria and Tasmania will continue to be paid above the national average until 1 July 2006. The transition to achieve consistent national rates is being achieved through incremental differential subsidy rate increases over the six year period. There will be no decrease in subsidy rates in any State or Territory during the transition to nationally consistent rates. Environment and Heritage: Planning and Environmental Laws (Question No. 3671) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 22 June 2004: Will he review the operation and interaction of Commonwealth and NSW planning and environmental laws so that Commonwealth land use, such as land affected by the Airports Act 1979 and ‘works’ and ‘activities’ as defined in the NSW Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 on other Commonwealth land, are developments made subject to the NSW Forward Planning Scheme, under the NSW Act; if not why not. swer to the honourable member’s question: Where appropriate, Australian Government activities are subject to NSW legislation or achieve equivalent requirements through Australian Government legislation. The Airports Act 1996 provides a comprehensive and uniform approach to land use, planning and environmental management issues in relation to leased airports. Part5 of the Airports Act, which relates to land use, planning and building controls, is expressed to apply to the exclusion of State or Territory laws in relation to land use planning or the regulation of building activities. A requirement to comply with State and Territory laws would produce unnecessary duplication. However, consistency with State or Territory laws is considered in relation to the development and management of leased Australian Government Airports. For example, under s.71(6) of the Airports Act, an Airport master plan must address the extent of consistency with planning schemes in force under a law of the State or Territory in which the airport is located, in relation to specified land-use or development objectives or proposals.
