Having looked at the relevant clauses after the inquiry made by the honourable member for Wakefield, I failed to find any provision by which the policy of touching Crown lessees could be enforced. Bill submitted to us is one to tax freehold estates ancl all estates derived therefrom. The Crown estate is not a freehold, ancl a lessee under the Crown cannot possibly have an estate derived from a freehold, because a freeholder is a holder under the Crown. ment, even at this early stage, are going to amend the machinery of this very widereaching B ill . I hope that this apparent change in policyI cannot imagine that ii mistake has been made in drafting, because the blunder would be a most egregious one-is not to be brought about, because it will involve a serious doubt as to the constitutionality of a good deal of this B ill . Whilst not throwing doubt upon our power to impose land taxation, if it is taxation, I must say that a doubt will be cast upon the constitutionality of this legislation' if -we tax Crown lessees, and through them affect the instrumentalities of the States. Surely the Government are not going to impair the propriety of. the tax by taxing -a leasehold interest under the Crown? If lancl were held at a rent that was not fair to the State, it would be for the State itself to raise that rent at the next valuation, but, in effect, the Commonwealth Government would tax the very rental value which belongs to the State. think that we can do that. speaking now from the point of view of the constitutionality of sueh an act; I It was thought at think that a State can make an arrangement under its leasehold Acts to prevent that being clone. The South Australian Parliament has expressly declared, if my memory serves me rightly, that the Crown shall own the sale value represented by the difference between the rent paid and the true rent. true rent? next appraisement. If land is held at a rental of ^ 2 0 per annum, and it is That found that the true rent, as settled by sales in the market, should be ^ 3 0 per annum, that becomes the true rent. The idea of the Government is to tax the capitalized value at 10 per cent, in relation to the duration of the lease. As a matter of fact, some of the Soutli Australian Acts expressly prevent that being done, because they say that in such cases tlie difference belongs to the Crown, and will he taken eventually by the Crown. The Government ought to leave well alone. If The they are going to dismay their followers by throwing a doubt upon the whole constitutionality of a Bill of this far-reaching character, then they will not be acting in accordance with tlie best interests of those who have sent them here. We are told that the Governbe considered here. tiie measure, but I think it would be a great pity for us to be launched again into a sea of doubt as to the constitutionality of a far-reaching measure like this, whicli seems to have divided public opinion in Australia to a very large extent. understood the Attorney-General to say that the power to tax Crown lessees, for which this Bill does not provide, will be covered by an amending clause. If that is so, I ask the honourable gentleman to reconsider this question very carefully, for such an amendment would broaden the principle of the Bill altogether beyond the extent contemplated. I am astounded at the statement made by the honourable gentleman, that Crown leases, whether pastoral or otherwise, are to be brought under the operation qf this measure.

Sir WILLIAM -I from the statement made by the Attorney General that this Bill when amended will go further than was ever contemplated by being applied to lessees of the Crown. I agree with the ex-Attorney-General the Government cannot do what they propose in that regard, because I think that, the right of the States as owners would be asserted, and would effectually block action in that direction. may, such a proposal would be a staggering blow at the imposition of equitable land taxation. the Government, as set out in the newspapers this morning, are difficult of compiehension, but I sincerely hope that the tine principle of land taxation will be adhered to by the Ministry. ciple underlying the proposal to which we expected to be asked to agree is, first of all, that a tax should be imposed on verylarge estates. This Bill, however, goes a great deal further, and I question very much whether it does not go so far as to he likely to bring about its own defeat. far as I could gather last night, it seemed to me that the schedule of rates then put before us did not rise in easy gradations from id. to i^d., and from i|d. to 2d. in the £1, and ""so forth, but jumped from 2d. to 3d. and from 3d. to 4d. in the jQi. takes its own gradation.

I know something of algebra, but I confess that I cannot understand this schedule. I do not wish to put any obstacle in the way of the passing of land taxation, but I certainly do desire that principles shall be adhered to. I desire, to see the imposition of a tax that will have the effect that we have always desired. Our intention was that we should so tax large estates as to cause them to be more closely settled than they are. If a i l to see why LYNE (Hume) [10.52]. a tax should be imposed merely for the think that we are correct in assuming sake of imposing taxation. The Commonwealth Parliament is placing itself in an unenviable position if , in order to return to the States ,£5,000,000 per annum, it has to tax the people to find that money. that It would have been better to give the States just what we could afford, and leave them to impose the taxation necessary to provide the revenue requisite for their own purposes. We ought not to imBe that as it pose taxation merely for the sake of finding revenue for the States. My desire is that we should adhere to the principle of The land tax proposals of taxing large properties, so as to make more lancl available for settlement.

Sir WILLIAM LYNE I did not say that. with my honourable friend.. There are many matters in connection with this proposal that No ; every pound of value need to be explained. We are treading paths that have never been previously I have had trodden; and difficulties always arise when we enter upon paths that are expressly forbidden, not only by the Decalogue, but by the Constitution, which is our political Decalogue. However, I suppose that all these matters will be unravelled in Committee. I am surprised to hear, for the He is not asked to first time, that Ministers, who professed to believe with all the ardour of their political faith in the relationship of landlord and tenant, as applied to the land-owning of the country, are interfering with that ideal --perfec t as it is, according to their stand-point, from an economic point of view. I am surprised that they are taking steps to disturb that relationship as it exists to-day between the Crown and its tenants.

I hope the Government will look carefully into these proposals, and place them plainly before the House and the country. I am quite certain that leaseholders in 'South Australia thought that they were exempt from this taxation. many different kinds of leases in that State, and the State Government, instead of subjecting them to re-valuation, passed an Act bringing them under the same conditions as freeholds, for the purposes of land taxation. In my opinion, these taxation proposals will be, to some extent, interfering with State properties, and, for that reason, they require careful consideration. Perpetual leases in South Australia cannot be transferred to any person who already holds land of a certain value, and it will be seen, therefore, that the leaseholders in that State are in a very peculiar position. have to be exercised in the valuation of these lands on their rental or selling value> as freehold or leasehold. I could point to hundreds of leaseholds that have been almost doubled in value by improvements, and yet there is scarcely a trace to show what has been spent by the occupiers, who thought they were free to deal with it under the State Government, without fear of further taxation in consequence. Then, again, perpetual leases in South Australia already carry a heavy land tax, and the double taxation will prove most burdensome. Indeed, I do not think that any State will be so hard hit by the Commonwealth land tax as South Australia.

I hope, however, that the Government will not frighten people with a big land tax. most impossible for leases to come under this tax. hope they will not come under it . From freehold land the Governments have already had their money, though, I believe, not a quarter of the alienated areas are freehold to-day. It will be impossible for a man to carry out improvements on his land under the conditions contemplated, and I am afraid that land-holders may be driven to the conclusion that they had better leave the land alone if they are to be taxed in consequence of their own enThere are terprise and foresight-whicl i have made Australia what it is. In my own district I have known as much as £ 5 an acre spent in clearing and other improvements, and, m the absence of any evidence to that effect, I do not see how we are to have fair and equitable valuation. In view of the statement of the Attorney General that the taxation is to apply to Crown leases, I suggest tliat the Prime Minister prepare a table showing exactly the different kinds of tenure under which these leases are issued. The terms of freeholds and ordinary leaseholds are well And, especially, care will known, and to these a uniform law might apply; but, in the case of Crown leases, of which there are several kinds throughout Australia, and very often several kinds in one State, difficulties and injustice must arise. A uniform tax may appear perfectly fair on paper, but, under the conditions., may prove unfair and inequitable in practice. I should suppose that the information I suggest has been found necessary in preparing this legislation, and there should be no difficulty in issuing a table. fhe Government can give will be available.

MrM c WILLIAMS (Franklin) [ n . 2 6 ] . -On the last occasion I pointed out the effect of the present condition of the sugar industry on the. kindred fruit industries. SinceI began to take an interest in the subject, it has always been my desire to bring the fruit-growers, on the one hand, and the sugar-growers, .on the other, into more complete union than at present. It will be seen that by far.the best customer to the cane-grower is the fruit-grower. If a man in Tasmania or Victoria plants quinces, or other fruit, to be made into preserves, some one in Queensland tins to plant out 2 acres of cane to furnish tbe sugar to convert that fruit into jam. simply impossible. A very interesting report was prepared some time ago, showing how closely allied the'two industries really are. It was read as a paper before a conference of fruit-growers in Victoria two or three years ago. I have laid the figures contained in it before fruit-grower's in my own State, and they consider that, if any thing, they are under-estimated so far as Tasmania is concerned. It is stated that in plums the fruit-grower' usually plants out 120 trees to the acre, the average produce of which is one and a half cases; or 60 lbs., per tree. The average yield per acre, therefore, is 7,200 lbs. of fruit, which, at Jd. a lb., or about' 2s. 6d._ a case, rather more .than the average price now receivable, gives a return of £ 1 5 an acre. To transform that fruit into jam requires an equal quantity of sugar, or 7,200 'lbs., the duty on which, at £ 6 a ton, is one and a half times the total, value of the fruit produced. The growergets £ 4 per ton for his fruit, and the duty on the sugar alone is £ 6 per ton. The same thing applies to apricots, which are now being grown very largely. We are sending apricots to the jam factory, at about 2s. 6d. a bushel. The duty on the sugar is £.6 per ton, and the value of the fruit is only ^ 4 . ber calculated the duty per ton on jam? .

The State was then producing more than sufficient for its own requirements,out x acre of plums' or and its sugar manufacturers were .in the position of the jam manufacturers of Australia to-day Replying to -the interjection of the honourable member for Denison, let me read what Mr Peacock, of Victoria, The present condition of affairs is one of the Best authorities in Australia on this question, saysThousands o l tons of fruit are specially grown, for the factories. In addition, whenever.fruit falls lo a figure which enables the manufacturers to buy, they step in, clear the market, and prevent a furLher decline in prices. Take plums as an instance. The price of plums at the be> ginning of the season may be £ g per ton, a price which, say, we manufacturers cannot afford to pay. As more and more of the crop comes into the market, the price begins to decline, and ns the market becomes stocked beyond household requirements, prices decline till they reach the level at which manufacturers can afford to operate. Say this is £ 4 per ton ; at this price manufacturers will then take all they can get, ond consequently this controls the price, not only for the purchases made by the manufacturers, but for all that comes into the market. Every acre of plums or apricots planted in the southern parts of Australia for the production of fruit for jam making requires thc planting of two acres of cane in Queensland for the production of sugar for preserving them. M i . TUDOR -Ho w much of the fruit giown is converted into preserves? i.br every apricot eaten as fresh fruit, more than a bushel is converted into jam.

In fruit-growing districts now one may see cattle depastured in the plantations, the industry being sacrificed to thcproduction of sugar.

But notwithstanding that, the profits of the company on its Australian business are too large, judged by the price given to the grower for eane, and charged to the consumer for sugar. The company started its operations '-as an unlimited liability company with a capital of .£150,000. In 1888 it had a paid-up capital of £648,000, which is now ,£2,850,000. been reduced since 1888 from £901,000 to £64,000, and its reserves have increased fiom £318,000 to ,£500,000.' Its profits have increased from ,£103,000 to £258,000, and the total of its balance sheet from .£2,000,000 to £4,500,000. The value of its properties, which in 1888 was £1,767,000, is now £2,947,000, and its dividends have grown from £31,705 to £285,000, having amounted to over £4,000,000 in the aggregate since 1888, tlie profits being about £4,500,000. I have said sufficient to show that the position of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is, from our stand-point, intolerable. It will not to-day give to any preserving company in Australia a contract extending beyond the month of November. That is the month ' in which the preserving companies really commence their operations, so that, for all practical purposes, the Refining Company will not enter into a contract with them to supply sugar.

It would be useless for us to attempt to deal with this question, unless we -.were prepare^to consider means of overcoming the difficulty. I have long held that the solution of the problem is to be found in co-operation on the part of the cane-growers. Why should they not cooperate, as our dairy,nien have done? If the ingredients, other than the cream used in the production of a pound of butter were subject to a duty amounting to more than 59 per cent, in excess of the value of the cream, what would our dairymen say? What would be said if the duty, on the preservatives used in connection with the preserved meat industry were 50 per cent, in excess of the value of the meat used?

I have spent more months than the honourable member has spent hours in an effort to' secure co-operation amongst the fruit growers. 11 much time in making the same effort. I have not succeeded, but I certainly think tliat it is not a business proposition that sugar grown in Queensland should be .sent to Melbourne or Sydney to be refined. The cane-growers should co-operate, and refine their own sugar in the home of the product. According to the press, the Prime Minister, in reply to a deputation, which recently waited upon him, to ask fpr assistance' in establishing refineries, said that the matter was one for action on the part of the State for the Federal Government to take up. The Federal Parliament, which has the political control of the industry, should also face the financial responsibility relating to it. The Federal Government has the sugar industry, so to speak, in the palm of its hand. We levy a 50 per cent, duty, we impose an Excise duty, grant a bounty, and regulate the scale of wages to be paid in the industry. We have taken the industry within our control, and it is our duty to face the financial responsibility devolving upon ""us. I am prepared to-day to support a reasonable vote-eve n in excess of .£500,000-to back up the cane-growers in establishing co-operative refineries, for the treatment of their own raw product, so that they may obtain the full and complete reward of their labour. That is a way out of the difficulty. 1 believe we should thus be able to reduce' the duty to £ 3 per ton, whilst, at the same time,'the profits to the 'cane-grower would ' be enor1 mously increased.",22,Sugar Bounty Bill No 2 Second Reading

I am willing to admit that the small holder is loyal to a degree, but a very bad example is being set by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, who are employing coloured labour wherever they can.

129,30th September . Mr Bamford,"The Federal ParliaNotwithstanding that my opponent had behind him the Australian Sugar Producers' Association, having branches, strong numerically and financially, in every sugar district in Queensland, the desire of the farmer that this legislation should be continued was so keen that in six of the seven sugar-growing districts in my electorate, I secured a majority. That surely proves conclusively that the farmers wish thc bounty and Excise regulations to continue, as they are now, and, as ' I think, they will be continued. On this question no one should have more influence upon this Parliament than the people who are directly interested-the farmers who recognise the advantages of the bounty system, and freely admit that by its agency they have been put upon their feet. The impartial canegrower will admit that, notwithstanding the restrictions imposed, the conditions under which he is working now are better than ever they were before Federation. Mr G. gave them the bounty without the Excise? difference. The story whicli my opponent poured into the ears of my constituents was that the cane-growers paid the Excise, but their minds were soon disabused of that idea. . Any one save an economic baby would know perfectly well that it is the consumers who pay the Excise. They are, of course, pleased to get the difference of £ i per ton between the Excise and. the net bounty, but they do not ask for the abolition of the Excise. I am confident that honourable members generally -are desirous of helping the sugar farmers of Australia, and of having Northern Queensland peopled by white men. in that direction. derable assistance. Prior to the introduction of the bounty system, the white population of Northern Queensland was not increasing. I regret that, owing to the change made in the order of business this morning, which resulted in the consideration of this measure being suddenly resumed, I had not at hand, when I rose, the somewhat exhaustive notes that I had prepared on this subject. I had prepared a return showing the advances made by the Mackay district since the passing of this legislation, as compared with the period 1891-1902, but, unfortunately, I am unable to give the figures at this stage. Between 1891 and 1902, although the planter had been able to exploit every avenue of cheap labour, including those offering, not only in the Pacific Islands, but in Italy and Spain, the town of Mackay went back. Its population decreased, the value of its rateable property declined, and the number of names on its ratepayers' and parliamentary rolls likewise decreased. I obtained from the Registrar-General figures pointing conclusively io that fact, and also another set of figures, showing that since 1902 there had been an advance right along the line. Since then the population of Mackay has increased, and the number of houses, the rateable value of property, and the number of electors on the ratepayers' and parliamentary rolls have all expanded. This proves conclusively that the bounty system has been most beneficial to that particular district. I did not take out the figures relating to any of the other sugar-growing districts, but I am satisfied that an investigation will prove that the same story may be truthB. EDWARDS -Supposing we fully told of the whole of them. I selected Mackay for the purposes of illustrating the effect of the bounty system, because it is the largest, the most settled, and the oldest of the sugar-growing districts. The largest amount of capital in the industry has been invested there, and it has in its neighbourhood the largest area under cane. These facts ought to be sufficient to satisfy a man with an unbiased mind that the bounty and Excise system has been productive of much good. sugar be reduced if the bounty were removed ? but it would be reduced if the import duty were removed. A great deal of raw sugar is now being imported from Java, and,'as we do not differentiate between the raw and the refined article, a duty of £ 6 per ton is being paid upon it. If that duty were removed, no doubt sugar would be selling for £ 6 per ton less than it is at the present time. I would remind honourable members, however, that in all parts of the worldin all the States, with one exception-suga r has always been regarded as a commodity upon which the imposition of a duty is justifiable. Even in free trade England, a duty of 40s. per ton is imposed on some classes of sugar; and the duty runs up to as much as £ 7 per ton on certain articles in which sugar is used as an ingredient. That being so, we are following a wellbeaten course in imposing a protective duty on sugar; we have followed the example",30,Profit And Loss Account For The Half Year Kxdkd Iist March Iqio

We know'what the duty on sugar is in the United States, and that the Government of that country will not allow one ton of sugar to be exported from Cuba, except to the land of the Stars and Stripes. I shall not discuss this question further at the present stage, save to say that it is of the deepest interest to me, and to my constituents, and that I trust this Bill will be passed. Sitting suspended, from 1 to 2.1 § Mr G. B. EDWARDS (North Sydney) [2.15] -'B y a strange coincidence I find I am following the honourable member for Herbert, whom I followed in the discussion on this question when it was first before the Commonwealth Parliament. I must compliment the honourable member on the extreme fairness with which he puts his views, representing as he does the growers in the great sugar-producing centre of Australia. We all agree that he presents his case very strongly, and I sympathize most with him when he says that he is not asking for benefits exclusively for the growers, but admits that there are other interests that ought to be considered, and alludes broadly and fairly to what, I think, is an accepted fact, namely, that we have, and must have, the one desire to protect this magnificent industry, and to hold and conduct it on White Australia principles. The only difference between us is as to how this is to be done. My own difficulty is that the question has never been adequately considered in all its bearings, though masses of facts are available in all directions. Seeing that the present scheme has been in force for eight or nine years, we should have an additional body of information acquired under the operation of the laws we initiated to govern and support this industry, to lead us to definite conclusions, which we could regard as of a more permanent character than the fiscal legislation of the past was ever likely to be regarded by, I venture to say, either side of the House. The question immediately before us is the second reading of this B ill ; but by tacit consent, I understand, we are allowed to deal with the whole question of the sugar industry, the existing legislation in regard to it, and what means outside of that legislation might be taken to supplant it in the better interests of the whole of the Commonwealth. I am not here exclusively to represent the sugar planters, much as I think.the sugar industry is worthy of the utmost support by those who know anything 1 of it ; nor am I here to represent, as I have had to represent in the past, the interests of those manufacturers largely engaged in the consumption of sugar in their factories. I know the case of the latter probably as well as any man in the Chamber or out of it, having beai connected with a manufacturing industry, though I have now practically retired. There are, however, broader interests which I can satisfactorily represent in this House, and which are near and -p.m. dear to my heart, namely, the interests of the general taxpayer and the consumer. In addition to the Bills immediately under our purview, there is the further question, which was debated yesterday, and which will come up again, of the appointment of a Royal Commission to deal with the great mass of information available now throughout the Commonwealth for the guidance of the Government. It would have been wise during the discussion yesterday, or in the debate to-day-and I waited some time in hope of the event-if a member of the Government had told us what is intended in regard to this matter. Do the Government intend to assume what I consider a reasonable attitude and appoint a Royal Commission to institute a non-political inquiryan inquiry, as far as possible, scientific, the only aim of which will be to elicit the actual facts, or do the Government intend to simply go on with the Bill now before us, and the other Bill that is immediately to follow ? If the second is to be the attitude, the House will have the right to demand from the Government some exposition of the principles underlying the policy they have determined to adopt. This Bill was introduced a fortnight ago by the Minister of Trade and Customs; and I was surprised that a gentleman in that position should submit to the House a proposal for departing entirely from a policy that was adopted in 1905, and re-enacting, as it were, legislation which was limited by the 1905 Act, without some explanation of that determination. When we decided to give this assistance in the first instance, many honourable members who know something of the industry and its entanglements with many other industries, and other honourable members, who were sensible of the burden of taxation we were imposing on the consumers and general taxpayers, but still more largely on the poor, wished to see ""the legislation limited or tapering off in its incidence, so that at some time or another those concerned, particularly the poorer classes, could be free from the burden of carrying this industry, magnificent though it may be In the eyes of all who are able to judge of the chief industries of Australia. 'attitude that I take to-day is that we should not depart from the position of 1905 without some clear view, and the consideration of reasons why the departure should be made. policy of the Government with regard to the sugar question? no reply. The Minister of Trade and Customs, introducing the Bill the other day, briefly referred to the fact that everything was looking well-accordin g to him, '-' everything in the garden is lovely ""-and the Prune Minister has told the sugar planters aiid others in Queensland that, whatever the Government do, they will protect the interests of everybody concerned. I do not know that the honourable gentleman mentioned the consumer and tlie taxpayer, but he promised to protect the interests of everybody connected with the industry. We have a right to know how that is going to be done. Is this Bill, with the one to immediately follow, sufficient to protect the interests of everybody? the measures protect the interests of manufacturers who have to use sugar as a raw material ? Do the Bills do justice to the taxpayers of the country ? The Labour party is charged, more than any other party ever has been, can be, or will be, with the protection of the interests of the poorer classes; and I ask whether they can justify the continued imposition of heavy duties without grave reason ? knows that the Bills do not add a fraction to taxation or to the price of sugar. Mr G. B. EDWARDS I may tell the Prime Minister that he and I differ most diametrically on that matter, as I think any one with knowledge of the subject must differ from him. ""It is a most extraordinary attitude to take up that this legislation does not impose burdens on the people; and before I have finished I hope to be able to show the position in such plain terms that the whole of the taxpayers will know what is being placed upon them by a Labour Administration, supposed to be here to protect the interests of the very poorest classes. In the past, Protectionists naturally assented to this legislation in order to protect a great industry. Free Traders, swallowing their convictions, likewise assented for the realization of the great ideal of a White Australia. individual interests. I myself voted against my own interests in supporting this duty on sugar, with the Excise and bounty; but we The did it willingly to achieve a great national object. So far as legislation to bring about a White Australia is concerned, we have done all that we can do, ancl no one is proposing anything further to I ask now, what is the confirm or extend the policy. When we passed the original legislation, we did We have had so with the id^a in the minds of most of us that it would come"" up for review again in a few years, as, indeed, it did in 1905. When the Bill was then before us it was contended, not by Free Traders or Protectionists, but by a combination of both, with extreme Labour men, acting in the interests of the consumers and taxpayers, that there ought to be some tapering off policy with regard to the duties, Excise, and bounty. That was a policy that I enunciated at an early stage of the legislation. I contended that whatever we did, if we guaranteed a bounty of £ 3 or £ 4 , and an Excise duty of a somewhat similar amount, we should not fix it for all time or leave the matter open, but should let those Do interested in the industry know that there would be a tapering off side by side with a constant diminution of the Customs revenue. I admitted even then, as a Free Trader, that some measure of Protection was absolutely necessary to support a tropical industry like this under white labour conditions in Australia; but I contend that a duty of £ 6 is not, and never was required. If we, for other purposes of the legislation, had to impose an Excise duty in order to pay the bounty, or rebate as it was called in the first instance, tliere was a logical conclusion in our minds that the legislation should be based in a tapering-off policy, by which we should reduce the Customs duties and the Excise and bounty until they were cleared away altogether. In 1905, when the measure came on for reconsiderCorinella, proposed, as the basis of the Bill we are now asked to repeal, that the duties should diminish in a certain number of years to two-thirds, and subsequently to one-third, finally passing out of existence. That proposal was supported by members of all three parties-Fre e Traders, Protectionists, and Labourites. It was brought forward by a Protectionist, rupported by me, a Free Trader, and supported also by two members of the preFurther, some of us sunk our sent Administration.

What should be the attitude of the Labour party on the financial and fiscal operations of this measure? I take it that the members of the party have full freedom to deal with all questions affecting their fisto an island in the Pacific. cal beliefs, but no Labour, man is free, and I am not free, to act unjustly to the taxpayers of this country. member is free to heap the burdens of a measure of high policy upon the shoulders of the labouring class. Yet that is what we are doing with the taxation at present before us. In this measure we are recognising that it takes £300,000 or £400,000 a year to support the policy of a White Australia, and we place that measure of taxation mainly on the shoulders of the poor. We go further than that. We not only get that amount paid in the form of. revenue, but we put another burden of £600,000 or £700,000 on to the shoulders of the poor, by reason of the fact that we have enhanced the price of sugar, without getting any equivalent into the Treasury of the State. I shall endeavour to explain that that must operate as a fixed law. better off if they could get black labour sugar from Java? Mr G. B. EDWARDS -They would be better off if they got sugar die price of which was regulated by a lower Customs duty than we now impose. All the measures that we took for securing a White Australia were in the direction of ceasing to receive coloured aliens for labour in our tropical industries, and deporting those we had already brought in for that purpose. coloured aliens, and deported all we could legally deport. No member of the House, ancl no political organization outside, has ever proposed to go further. We all looked upon this policy as absolutelyfinishedwhen we had done those two things; yet, what are we doing ? Some sort of ethical conviction should be at the base of the politics of any party, but we now say to the coloured aliens who are in our midst, and cannot be legally deported, To some of them having been here for a long time, and married, and settled down"" We decree, by our fiscal legislation, and by no other law, that you shall not work in the sugar cane fields of Australia."" For what good.purpose is that done? Let us look dispassionately at the question. The honourable member for Herbert said, to-day, that if he had his way, and could roll all the coloured aliens into one, he would gladly get them collectively by the scruff of the neck and pitch them into the Pacific. I hope, for the honourable member's own sake, that he meant he would put them on of course. No Labour Mr G. B. EDWARDS -That is not an attitude that could possibly be adopted by this House, or any body of humane persons. We have never considered, much' less passed, any legislation for getting rid of those men, and in the name of humanity, we have no right to forbid them to labour in that particular line of work to which they are most used, and to do which many of them were brought here. If we had that right, and if it were not as inhuman and disgraceful as it is to stop these men labouring in the sugar-fields, on what grounds of reason or common-sense could we def end it ? What good is effected in the interests of the white labourers themselves? We are not here to legislate in the interests of any particular body of workers, such as the labourers in the canefields, as opposed to the labourers in the maize-fields or the mines or the workshops. We are here to look after the interests of labour generally all over the Commonwealth. If these men are forbidden, or prevented by our fiscal legislation, whicli is th* same thing, from labouring in the sugar industry, they must work elsewhere, or thieve, if they are going to live. If we force them away from one class of work they must seek it in other directions, ancl to the extent to which they succeed in getWe stopped the arrival of ting it elsewhere, they must interfere with' other white labourers. On grounds of reason and common-sense those who advocate this policy would be beaten at every point of the argument, and driven back to the inhuman conclusion that these people who are allowed to be amongst us, shall not be allowed to work to earn their living.

You must have absolute justice at the bottom of everything you do, and humanity under that; but this course is neither just nor 'humane. able member suggest? Mr G. B. EDWARDS I shall endeavour to show the honourable member what I suggest, but neither he nor I would undertake to pronounce straight off how the problem is to be dealt with. AllI can do now is to suggest certain avenues of thought and directions for looking for information. Anything is better than the policy of drift which the Ministry are inviting us to follow. I have heard it said here many a time that Protection does not raise the price of commodities, that it may in the first instance cause a rise in price, but that as soon as the industry becomes established competition for possession of the home market will so regulate prices that they will come down even a little below the old level. Customs, however, admits to-day that this policy had been a conspicuous failure in regard to the sugar industry. object in dealing with the matter was to benefit the people, but if we cannot create competition by our legislation we have no right to retain a fiscal regulation, which, by the admissions of honourable members opposite, simply plays into the hands of a gigantic monopoly. Ministers who are putting forward this legislation cannot show us that it is in the interests of anybody but thei capitalists-the Colonial Sugar Reriing Company and the sugar millers. fining Company do not want this legislation. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -The Colonial Sugar Refining Company have never wanted anything. Years ago, at this table, I pointed to the fact diat every time this question came up, the company used to state, through its officials and at its public meetings, that Federation meant the ruin of the sugar industry. YetI have shown -that at each important epoch which brought Federation nearer, up went the price of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company's shares, ancl that they still rose after Federation was accomplished, showing that Federation certainly did not ruin the industry. keep the money in the country, and enable us to deal with any monopoly, which we could not do before. Mr G. B. EDWARDS I have heard of that argument, and of Adam and Noah and other ancient people. I differ from the honourable member, for I do not want the money in the country. So long as we have happiness and comfort and wealth in the country, the money can go where it likes. The honourable member is not awake if he thinks a country is to be made prosperous by keeping the money in it. We must have something more than money in it. At a'time when Spain had more money pei head of the people in its coffers than had any other nation, it was the poorest country on the face of God's earth. It is only in the diffusion of wealth and comfort throughout a people that you will find prosperity. But there is another aspect of the question. The world's price of sugar has gone up during the period that our legislation has been in operation. The Minister of Trade and Australia because of the monopoly. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -The price of sugar in Australia has also gone up all the Our time.' The honourable member for Hume says it is on account of the monopoly here, but I say it is on account of no such thing. If we had had three refineries in Australia during all that time the price of sugar would have been precisely the same. But what honourable members opposite are wanting to bring about would have happened-the growers would have received a better price for their raw material. The price of sugar would have been the same as now, because it is inexorably fixed by the price in the world's markets, plus the duty which this Parliament, in its wisdom, imposed on its importation.",34,Profit And Loss Account For The Half Year Kxdkd Iist March Iqio

I admit that if there were competition in the refining business the growers extra sum paid by the public, we have left might get a better price for their cane, but I do not .admit that the consumers would get cheaper sugar; because the price of sugar is regulated abroad. Refining Company has increased the price of its sugar by £ 2 a ton, although the cost of production has not increased. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -If the honourable member buys an article for £ 1 0 he does not sell it for £ 1 1 when he can get £15 for it. Similarly the Colonial Sugar Refining Company charges for its sugar what it can get, and it can always.get, in Australia, the world's price, plus our import duty of £ 6 per ton. more equitably divided with the consumers and the growers. Mr G. B. EDWARDS I am greatly in favour of the division of profits, but how can it be brought about in this case? I wish to draw the attention of honourable members to the statistics relating to the use of sugar in the Commonwealth for the years 1902-3 to 1909-10, and the estimate for the present year, 1910-11. The quantity of sugar on which import duty was paid in those years, less drawbacks and refund on quantities exported, was 377,142 tons, while the Australian grown sugar amounted to 1,382,112 tons, making the local consumption 1,759,254 tons, exclusive of the sugar used in manufactures exported to other countries. If I am right in assuming-and no one has shown me that I am wrong-that Australian consumers Py a Per ton more for their sugar thau they would have had to pay if there were no duty, the extra cost of sugar to them during the period with which I am dealing has been £10,555,524. During the same period the Treasury has received in Customs revenue £2,470,840, and in Excise revenue £4,837,010, of, in all, £7,3° »75°8 We have to deduct from the Customs and Excise collections the cost of the deportation of Kanakas, which was £13,903, the bounty and its expenses £2,831,915, and 3 per cent.j which is the cost of collection cent. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -Fo r the purposes of my comparison, I do not think I shall be far out in taking it at 3 per cent., or £219,262, making the total deductions £3,065,080, and bringing the net receipts of the Treasury to £4,243,670. Deducting the Treasury receipts from the £6,311,854. The people must pay taxes of some kind, and the net amount which has been received by the Treasury must be deducted from the extra cost which I have mentioned to show the net extra cost to the taxpayers, which is £6,311,854, or about £800,000 a year. That is what it costs to uphold the White Australia policy, and it is not a halfpenny too much; but the wrong persons are paying. Why should the cost of the White Australia policy be tome mainly by the poor? Should not the rich pay more towards it than they do, and the tax be made proportionate to means to pay? Why select an article like sugar to pay for this necessary national policy? To check the figures which I have given, let us now deal only with the estimates of the Treasurer for the present year. It is estimated that receipts from Customs duties for 1910-11 will be £286,628, ancl ifToni Excise duties £676,558, a total of £963,186. From that must be deducted for bounty £573,102, for expenses in connection with the payment of the bounty £6,031, and for the collection of the excise and import duties £28,905, a total of £608,038. This leaves the net gain to the Treasury from this heavy taxation of the people of £355,148. The extra price paid by the consumers for the sugar consumed in the current year may be estimated at £1,269,288, being £ 6 a ton on 211,548 tons. I admit that sugar should bear some taxation, but not the excessively heavy burden that we have imposed upon it. It is true, as the honourable member for Herbert said this morning, that it has been, and still is, taxed in most countries; but the honourable member did not tell us that in only one State was a duty of £ 6 per ton imposed prior to Federation. In New South Wales, a sugar manufacturing State, the duty was only £ 3 per ton. ton. Mr G. B. EDWARDS--Fo r four or five years immediately preceding Federation it was only £ 3 per ton; yet the. sugar industry there did not pass out of existence. There is the further curious anomaly that sugar growers in New South Wales, who did not employ black labour to any extent, and who, prior to Federation, had a protective duty of only £ 3 per ton, under our wise system of legislation",36,Profit And Loss Account For The Half Year Kxdkd Iist March Iqio

Mr G. B. EDWARDS -We have to consider. this question in all its bearings. The sugar industry is undoubtedly a magnificent one, and it is essential that we -should buttress it up, not only because of its own value and importance, but in order that we may have the tropical north settled and peopled by white races, who will be ready to defend it in the hour of danger. But do not let us work blindly, and without any system. Let us get at the facts. Let us see whether there is not some other way of carrying out our object than that of placing the whole burden on the shoulders of the poor. The latest figures I have given show that, deducting £355,148, the amount that reaches the Treasury, the amount that the people have to pay in excess of the world's price, is £914,000 per annum. That enormous sum is annually paid more by the poor than by the rich j more by the young than by the aged; more by women than by men, in violation of every canon of taxation that has ever been enunciated. A proposition for a polltax, coming from either side of the House, would be regarded as most extraordinary; but, after all, what is this legislation but tend to satisfy the grower and the a poll-tax? Is it not, indeed, worse than a poll-tax ? A poll-tax, if it were imposed for war purposes, would give the poor the satisfaction of knowing that they were paying no more than the rich. The burden of our White Australia policy, however, is thrown upon the poor, and if they pause to think, they must know that, although the average burden placed upon them is 6s. each, they are probably actually paying 7 s.; while the richer classes are paying only 5s. per head. I ask honourable members opposite who, like myself, are supposed to be, and, I hope, are here to protect, mainly, in the first instance, the poor per ton. Let us abolish tlie Excise altoand the struggling, if we should not consider whether it is worthwhile continuing this legislation, which does so grave an inmaking it a condition that fair wages shall justice to those least able to bear it. have been asked how I would approacli the solution of the problem. that 1 am not omniscient on the subject of sugar, or anything else. I am further ready to confess that the difficulties which perplex any one who tries to deal with the sugar question are greater than are those which confront one in dealing witli almost any other subject of which I know. The difficulties of the money problem with which we were dealing recently seemed great, and I dare say that we were all surprised to find how little we really knew of the question when we were brought face to face with it, and bound to arrive at a determination. But this problem of the sugar industry, although it may seem much simpler, is, to my mind, almost as complex as is the money and paper currency question. The net revenue from sugar to be received by the Treasurer during the current year is estimated at £355,148, and the estimated revenue from the import duty at £286,628. If we reduced the import duty to £ 3 per ton, abolished the Excise, paid, a bounty of £ 1 per ton on the sugar contents of the cane, direct to 'the growers, and made it a condition of the payment of the bounty that fair wages should be paid, and free employment given to everybody, irrespective of colour, race, and origin, we should bring about two important changes. I say that free employment should be given to everybody, irrespective cf colour, origin, or race, because, as we have allowed coloured people to remain amongst us, that is the only course that we can fairly take in regard to them, but we must bring them up to our wages standard. By these changes we should labourer. So far as I know, under present conditions, the other party concerned in the industry does not want looking after. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company has been gaining money under our legislation. Honourable members who have been buttressing up that company by legislation have been doing nothing for the labourers, and nothing for the planters. They have been putting everything into the pockets of this already rich and wealthy corporation, and the only way to prevent it making more than it ought to make is to reduce the import duty to £ 3 gether; ancl if the planters must be assisted, assist them by a direct bounty, I be paid. If the import duty were reduced to £ 3 per ton, it would, of course, make I confess some difference in the amount of Customs duty collected during this year. A certain amount of duty would be collected; but, if my theory were put into practice, and were successful, it would be so little",37,Profit And Loss Account For The Half Year Kxdkd Iist March Iqio
153,Mr Mahon,"Still, land there is goingthat it could be treated as a negligible quantity. would be exposed to the products of the cheap labour of Fiji. Mr G. B. EDWARDS A duty of £ 3 per ton was considered enough in New South Wales when the honourable member was a member of the State Legislature. able member's leader, Sir George Reid, who reduced the duty from £ 6 to £ 3 per ton. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -The honourable member was then in the State Legislature, and he knows that the reduction of the duty did not wipe out the industry there. It still exists, and receives the Fedeportation of sugar from Fiji, which constiral bounty. said that if fhe industry could not maintain itself on a duty of £ 3 per ton, the sugar-cane lands in New South Wales ought to be devoted to dairy farming. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -That is being done, and the people would do much better by devoting that land to dairy farming. In Northern Queensland the position is different. WhatI complain of is the want of thought given to our legislation, as shown by the fact that we absolutely made a present of the bounty to sugar-cane growers in New South Wales who were not employing black labour, and who had previously carried on their industry with a duty of only £ 3 per ton. The honourable member for Hume says that to admit sugar under a duty of only £ 3 per ton would be to expose our growers to the competition of the black labour of the world. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -Did not the gentlemen who represented the sugar growing districts in this House in the first instance tell us, time after time, that the difference between the cost of white and of black labour was £ 2 per ton? That statement is to be found again and again in Flansard. It appears in Dr. Maxwell's report, and also in reports of meetings of cane-growers and others. I think that the cane-growers say that the difference is £ 2 4s. per ton; but, roughly speaking, the difference in the cost of growing sugar by white and black labour was taken in the first Parliament to be £ 2 per ton. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -It does not up its present Customs revenue of matter materially where it is. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -Then what were the wages paid to black labour on the cane-fields ? their keep. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -If we add that to the total, what difference does it make? The men could not labour for nothing, so that, even if we take ""all these considerations into account, they do not, materially alter the main proposition, that it costs £ 2 per ton more to produce sugar by white labour than it does to produce it by black. Then, again, we have to take into account freights, insurance, and the cost of handling, in connection with the imtute a further protection. I admit that, with a duty of £ 3 per ton, we should not have such a measure of protection as wouia enable a colossal institution like that of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company to be built up; but we should at least be able to establish the industry on such a basis that manufacturers could make an honest 7 per cent, or 8 per cent, out of it. Manufacturers who entered into an industry carried on upon a large scale, and returning 7 per cent, or 8 per cent., would be in a very satisfactory position. It was generally considered that the original' system of granting a rebate direct to the growers was the most satisfactory; but it was unconstitutional, and we had to substitute for it the payment of a bounty, which would come within the ambit of the Constitution. With the expiration of the Braddon section, however, we shall be able to pay the bounty direct to the grower of the cane, and so make sure that he receives it, and that at the same time he pays a reasonable wage. Supposing that we paid a' bounty of £ 1 per ton on sugar Mr G. B. EDWARDS -To support the industry. If we did that, abolished the Excise, and lowered the duty to £ 3 per ton, we should reduce the cost to the taxpayers. If the legislation which I suggest were successful, we should get no revenue from the import duty, because Australia must shortly produce the 200,000 tons per annum which she requires for her own consumption. Thus a bounty of £ t per ton would mean £200,000 per annum paid direct to the growers, or a total loss to the State-sinc e it would have to give £500,000. That would be the total cost",38,Profit And Loss Account For The Half Year Kxdkd Iist March Iqio

At present the taxpayers and consumers are charged £1,000,000 a year, but under the system suggested the cost would only be £500,000, and probably the rich would pay more than they do at present. meinber think that sugar would be cheaper under such conditions? Mr G. B. EDWARDS I am absolutely certain of it. We should not be governed by a monopoly then, and a manufacturer or wholesale merchant could send to Java, China, the Mauritius, or England for sugar at the world's price, subject to a duty of £ 3 instead of £ 6 , and the company would be compelled to reduce their price accordingly. This company, gigantic monopoly as it is, is one of the finest mercantile institutions south of the Equator. It has been built up by indomitable pluck, wonderful perseverance, great ingenuity, and by the most careful management that could be exhibited. In the early stages, it was doubtful whether the shareholders would not lose every penny they had invested, and at certain periods they were in dire straits; but they conquered without help, and made fortunes, which, by our legislation, have been doubled. Under all the circumstances, we can certainly extend our respect to the institution; but we have now to consider whether it is wise for us to continue legisdeclining by £10,000 a year for twentylation which pours gold into their coffers, or whether we shall adopt some other system, resulting in less profit to the company, but relieving the poor and the taxpayers of this country from the very heavy burden they have now to bear. We can relieve the poor only by reducing the Customs duties, the grower only by a bounty, and the labourer only by insisting that he shall have fair wages and conditions. If these latter conditions be attained, the meanest amongst us can afford to be just ancl humane to the few thousands of coloured aliens we have here by giving them a fair field in which to earn their living where they can best find it. journed. a message from His Excellency the Governor General, recommending an appropriation for the purposes of the amendment [79] which the Senate had requested the House of Representatives to make to clause 5 of the Surplus Revenue Bill.

212,Amendment (By Mr Deakin) Proposed,"[3-54]-I make no complaint about the action of the Leader of the Opposition in this matter, but he will find no authorities worthy of the name who say that a reserve of a third, or anything like it, is needed for a note issue of this kind. who has had more experience than any other living person in Australia in connection with a Government note issue, the general manager of the Queensland National Bank, which has dealt with over £ 3 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 worth of Queensland State notes during the last seventeen years, without ever presenting a note to the Treasury for payment, says that that issue, with its reserve of 25 per cent, is the strongest paper currency in tlie world. He has not hesitated to make that statement publicly. strengthened it, when the Bill was last in Committee. To say that the reserve should not be less than one-fourth practically means that the Treasury would have to hold one-half of the gold received for the notes. I want honourable members to keep in mind the meaning of the words "" not less than."" They mean, for instance, that if there were £ 6 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 of Australian notes in circulation, and the Treasurer had in his possession only £ 1 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 in gold, he could not legally cash the first £ 1 note presented over the counter. Honourable members will recognise, therefore, the enormous gold reserve for which provision is made when we say that it shall be not less than one-fourth of the note issue. gin above one-fourth to meet any emergency, so that he could not cash a £ 5 note if he had in his possession a gold reserve only £ 4 in excess of the minimum of 25 per cent. show the honourable member for Ballarat that, by having behind this note issue the larger gold reserve that he suggests, we should really defeat the purpose that we have in view. I remind him, too, that we have laid down the principle that no Government shall gain a single penny towards its annual income or expenditure from this system. defeat the object that we have in view, namely, that of making legitimate use of the balance of the gold reserve which can be properly invested. vested, it will yield a return that will go to a sinking fund that will, I hope, be not only used in years to come for the protection of this currency, but will prove such a -financial backing, that it will be unnecessary to have unsigned Australian bills held over as a double currency, With great respect, therefore, to the honourable member's opinion, I cannot accept his motion. [3-58]--We are very glad of what the The man Prime Minister has already done in tightening up this issue, but I would point out to him that his closing remarks related to something foreign altogether to the purposes of this B ill . I hope that he will not shut his mind altogether to this proposal, notwithstanding the optimistic report of the manager of the Queensland National Bank. There are other bankers in Australia who take another view. I amended this clause, and had anything against these notes. other parts of the world Treasuries which have gold against their notes. In Canada, for instance, they have from 66 per cent, to 70 per cent, of gold coin and bullion as against their Dominion notes, and they have in addition 60 per cent, of guaranteed securities. Mr A. B. Stewart, a Sydney bank manager, in a very excellent paper on the question of currency, some time ago made that statement. I do not wish to say more at this stage, but I think that the Prime Minister would strengthen his Bill immensely if he agreed to the substitution of the words "" one-third "" for the words "" one-fourth."" I should like to explain that we make this proposal to-day because The Treasurer must keep a marwe had no opportunity to submit it when the measure was last before us. We had intended to put it before the Committee, but the amendment moved by the honourable member for Lang providing for a reserve I mention these illustrations to of 50 per cent, was put in such a form and so worded that we could not do so. I strongly iurge the Treasurer to consider these further points, and to tighten up the issue in the way we propose. regret that the Treasurer has not seen fit to accept the very reasonable proposal made He would, therefore, by the Leader of the Opposition. His own figures as published in Hansard show that this paper currency will be backed up by a gold reserve lower than that of any Legitimately incountry of importance.

The Treasurer's own figures show that it is altogether inadequate in the light of what is done by older and more experienced countries. The honourable gentleman quoted figures showing that the percentages of reserves in other countries were as follows :-Bank of England, 108 per cent.; Scotland, 76 per cent.; Ireland, 47 per cent.; France, 82 per cent.; Germany, 87 per cent. issued.

I have always been sympathetic towards the Government controlling the national currency, but we cannot ignore those plain fundamental principles which mark the only path of safety. I am sorry that the Treasurer cannot accept the amendment. desire to make only one quotation to show how reliable the statements of the honourable member for Parramatta are. It is ridiculous for that honourable member to say that Canada has a gold reserve of 60 per cent, for notes, as is made plain from the following quotation from the Dominion Banking Act. . . the Minister of Finance ancl ReceiveiGeneral shall always hold, for securing the redemption of such notes issued and outstanding, an amount in gold or Canada securities, guaranteed by the Government of the United Kingdom, equal to not less than 25 per cent, of such notes, at least 15 per cent, of the total amount of such notes being held in gold; and provided, also, that the said Minister shall always hold for the redemption of such notes an amount equal to the remaining 75 per cent, of the total amount thereof in Dominion Debentures issued by authority of Parliament. [4.7] -The honourable member for Melbourne is fond of using the word "" ridiculous,"" but if anything is ridiculous it is the language he has just used. His figures show nothing, except that in Canada the banks are compelled by law to hold an irreducible minimum, whereas I quoted the actual coin held against the note issue. admit that the provision mentioned by the Treasurer materially strengthens the position ; and, further, that, after a few years, we might be safe with a gold reserve of 25 per cent. For a few years, however, we do not know what may happen j and it would be just as well to accept the suggesSwitzerland has a Gotion of the Leader of the Opposition. With the fund that is being built up, provided that Parliament does not touch it in any way-and as to that we have no guarantee -w e may, as I say, in a few years find a gold reserve of 25 per cent, sufficient. guarantee of the honesty of representatives that there is now. Bank has the exclusive aspersion on the honesty of representatives; but emergencies may arise and induce Parliament to do what it would not do if the opportunity were not there. I would sooner see the whole matter free from the atmosphere of politics. not propose to further argue this question. If honourable members will be good enough to refer to the argument I endeavoured to follow on the second reading, they will understand why I am now advocating a gold reserve of one-third, since a reserve of one-half is not obtainable. I have not altered the opinion that a much' smaller reserve would do, and more than do, in ordinary periods; but the panic test which has ruined every paper currency that has been ruined, and there have been many, should be provided against. We can afford to put aside such a reserve, and thus place our issue beyond, all suspicion or doubt, and create an impression which will stand us in good stead, not only in tiiis country, but outside. This reserve would really cost us nothing, and call for no sacrifice worth mentioning. We can well afford it, and it would be to the permanent gain of .the reputation of Austialia..

Queensland has there been a demand in excess of 11 per cent. been the slightest suspicion of a panic. to make the forecast that in the most extreme panic in Australia there will never be a demand that will bring the reserve under 25 per cent., or doubtfully near 25 per cent.; for, obviously, a gold reserve of 25 per cent, means from 25 per cent, to one-third. I admit freely that there is no special providence watching over Australia, and we can look for no special exemption from financial crises, which do, and will, occur. But strong as the Northern State note issue is, with a reserve of 25 per cent.,, a Commonwealth issue, with the same reserve, will, for obvious reasons, be doubly strong.
