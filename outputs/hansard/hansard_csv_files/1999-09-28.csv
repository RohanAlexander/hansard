We will be regulating to ensure for overnight stays; private patients who are that a greater than $500 up-front deductible nursing home patients; and the revenue that per single insured unit will not be eligible for the states get from the Commonwealth out of exemption from the one per cent levy surveterans. charge.

Labor Party after a realisation that the award Dr SOUTHCOTT (Boothby) (5.02 p.m.)was no longer relevant and that adversarial relations between employers and employees In speaking in this debate on the Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (More Jobs, were not good for workplace relations. Union membership during the period of the Labor Better Pay) Bill 1999, I would like to focus on three points. The first point is that it government decreased from 50 per cent of the strikes me how out of place the rhetoric in the work force to its present level of 28 per cent. Workers realised that unions were no longer debate is when you compare it with the legislation. One of the features I have noticed relevant. The union movement itself has since I have been in the parliament is that, decided it needs a sea change from amalgawhenever we debate a piece of legislation on mation and the creation of mega unions in the 1980s to a culture which gets back to the industrial relations, the rhetoric is strong and shop floor.

This point was noted in the debate Greg Combet argues that unionism is all on the 1996 Workplace Relations Act by about 'educating delegates and activists to better recruit, service and bargain in the several commentators on labour relations. workplace' . The second point I would like to focus on is the principle which lies behind this bill. We Centralised tribunals conducting conciliation pursue labour market flexibility to decrease and arbitration have been a feature of labour unemployment. There are significant advantamanagement relations since 1904.

The key unemployment and to give businesses a features of the 1996 act were the continuation competitive advantage.

They think that individual Australian workplace agreements, the only way you can do this is by cutting the award simplification process, the influence a wages.

The future lies in businesses realising During the 1996 election, the Minister for that their sustained competitive advantage lies Workplace Relations and Small Business with their human capital. described the coalition's vision for industrial relations as one where direct relationships Since this piece of legislation does continue between employers and employees were from where the 1996 act left off, I would like -entral a-d where the scope for third party to focus on the results from that act.
