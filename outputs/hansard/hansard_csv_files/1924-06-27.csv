6,"Mr Bruce (""Flinders","Prime Minis£500,000 into next year's accounts mstead of into those of the present year. The Grovernment is accepting the amendments because their adoption w ill not prevent the money being made available for main roads development. Ministers were in a position to know before the budget figures were finalized that the money would be available. There will be a surplus on the year's transactions, out of which the proposed vote of £500,000 can be paid. The Senate's requested amendments involve merely a bookkeeping alteration of the period to which the amount of the vote should bo charged. I move That thc amendments be agreed to. have no desire to embarrass the Government in connection with this matter, but this House should retain absolute control of expenditure. The Senate, by its requested amendment, presumes to decide what this House should do witb tbe prublic funds. I do not know of any more glaring attempt by the Senate to control the public finance, and dictate to the Government what year's revenue expenditure should be paid from. understand that it is the intention of tbe Government to provide in the budget for an expenditure of £500,000, and to debit that expenditure to this financial year, when, fortunately, it will have a surplus. But the expenditure would have to be debited to next year if the amendments requested, by the Senate were agreed to. We sbould always be very jealous of the right of this House-give n it by tbe Constitution-to control expenditure. If the House of Lords were to do what the Senate has done in this case tbe House of Commons would not tolerate it for a moment. I enter my protest against tbe action of the Senate, and though honourable members may decide to go no further, they sbould at least express tbeir objection to the Senate dictating to this House in connection with expenditure it has proposed.
