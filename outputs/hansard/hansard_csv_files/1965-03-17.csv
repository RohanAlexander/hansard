The future because they were able to deduct the full of the activities of the United Nations in amount of interest in arriving at their taxable Cyprus is the subject of pending consideraincome, companies which borrowed money tion in the Security Council. If the by means of debentures and registered notes on which they paid 8 per cent, were in effect paying only 4.8 per cent.? At that time companies were paying tax at the rate of 8s. in the Â£1. The right honourable gentleman will be well aware that since that time the Government has increased the rate of company taxation to 8s. 6d. in the Â£1. I ask further: Is it a fact that, due to the policy of the Government of the United States of America in requesting United States companies to repatriate maximum profits to assist that country's balance of payments, those foreign companies will raise way of debentures? Is it a fact that the cost of those loans will be less than the interest rates paid by government authorities in Australia? If these are facts, what action does the Government intend to take to stop foreign owned companies invading the local money market? honourable gentleman puts forward is quite conjectural. Yesterday the Prime Minister indicated that this matter had been receiving the consideration of the Government and that he had been in communication with President Johnson in relation to it. We shall continue to keep under close examination developments arising out of the policy of the United States. Minister for External Affairs a question relating to the contingent of Commonwealth police which was sent to Cyprus for duty some twelve months ago. Is it true that this force of Commonwealth police was originally sent for a period of three months?

If it is intended to return the force to Australia in the near future, is it to be replaced by a further small contingent? vice of members of the Australian police contingent in Cyprus was for 12 months.",7,Setup

If, upon such a request being received, we decided to continue to provide a contingent, the position of the individual members of the present contingent would be governed by the fact that their contract of service is for only 12 months. I cannot forecast what action would be taken by the Government if and when a request was received. I should like to take advantage of the opportunity to say that Australia has very good reason to be proud of the way in which this particular contingent has served the cause of international peace in Cyprus. Members of the contingent have brought on themselves and on Australia generally very considerable credit by their efficiency, general conduct and demeanour. the Minister for the Interior.

30,Sir Robert Menzies,"There have-the Minister for Health been drawn to a problem regarding the importation of timber through the port of Townsville in north Queensland? I understand that timber can be imported into Queensland only through Brisbane, and this is causing great concern to the Townsville Harbour Board, for obvious reasons. Could consideration be given to establishing an inspection service at Townsville to overcome this problem and also to protect the local timber industry? that I have received personally about this matter, although a few days ago it was raised in the Queensland Press. It is a fact that quarantine inspection points have been established at the first ports of entry, the capital cities in each State, and also at Newcastle, New South Wales. Outside of that provision, timber is not allowed to be imported. The main reason for the quarantine controls, of course, is the protection of the Australian timberindustry from, princithey do, rarely-whe n somebody misuses a pally, the Sirex wood wasp and from other plant pests and diseases. As the honourable member perhaps appreciates, the Sirex wood wasp is already in Australia. It was brought here in timber from New Zealand some years ago. Some idea of the cost to the industry can be gained from the fact that since 1961 the Commonwealth and State Governments have spent over Â£600,000 on the eradication campaign, but the wasp is still infesting centres in Victoria and Tasmania. So the first consideration, as far as I am concerned, is the protection of the Australian industry. However, when I read the reports in the PressI did arrange for some investigations to be made. We have officers going to north Queensland now and we shall see whether we can provide the facilities which have been requested. addressed to the Minister for the Interior. It secondary industry, exporters and primary relates to an item in the Sydney"" Daily Telegraph"" regarding the use of government cars by members of Parliament. First, a matter of nomenclature: The Minister is reported to have referred to private members of Parliament as "" ordinary members "". Can he assure me that he is not as ignorant member mentioned an increase of one-half about parliamentary terms as one naturally per cent. The increase in the maximum expects Press reporters to be? Secondly, Sir, a matter of substance, lest he should put me on the carpet: When, on Tuesday morning, I catch the 15 minutes past 8 plane at Kingsford-Smith airport to attend meetings of the Foreign Affairs Committee in Canberra, will I be expected-as , of course, I would be quite happy to do-to travel to the airport on my private and quite ordinary scooter? make a comment about the newspaper report. Newspapers like to pick on members of Parliament, their activities and the institution, whenever possible, and one of their favourite marks is the use of Commonwealth cars by members of Parliament. IfI did use the term "" ordinary members"" when defending back-benchers, it was my mistake, but I do not recall using the term. I did say that any criticism in the Press of the back-bencher-the ordinary member of Parliament-is unfair, because he has limited use of cars. If occasions arise-and a Commonwealth car, the matter is generally brought to his attention. In respect of the particular case that the honourable member for Bradfield has brought up, the regulation provides that members of Parliament are allowed to have cars to and from their homes in the capital cities if they leave before 8 o'clock in the morning, and if they arrive in the capital cities at 8 o'clock or later at night; but they must be going to or coming from sessions of the Parliament. If they are coming to Canberra to attend a meeting of a statutory committee they are also allowed the use of a car. it a fact that current bank advances amount to Â£1,200 million? Is it a fact also that the increase of one-half per cent, in interest rates will apply to current borrowings?

I have become involved in it on more than one occasion. It has been very difficult indeed and we have done our best with it. There is one odd thing about the Commonwealth table of precedence-which , of course, is laid down by Commonwealth proclamation -and that is that it differs in almost every here from overseas from countries which particular from the orders of precedence in the States. If the honourable member would have a look at the order of precedence in his own State he would discover that anybody connected with the Commonwealth judiciary, the Commonwealth Parliament or the Commonwealth Government is really the least of God's creatures.

Is the right honourable gentleman aware that the Sydney"" Sun"" newspaper of 5th March stated that the Federal Government had decided to underwrite the Askin policy of promises for the forthcoming New South Wales general election?

In view of some of the suggested difficulties which may be be of advantage to have a wider range of investment or less of a concentration, if that is the way it should be fairly expressed, than occurs at the present time. Out of last year's capital inflow about Â£98 million came into Australia from the United States of America, slightly more than Â£98 million from the United Kingdom and the balance of up to Â£215 million from other sources. It is of advantage to us in many respects to have so much of the capital investment have very similar attitudes to our own and with whom we can more readily develop an understanding and a co-operation, but there has been a growing interest in the countries of Europe in Australian investment over recent years. Several of them have approached us for a double taxation agreement. That has been under consideration in relation to particular countries but there are some complexities and some practical problems, one being to establish a balance of advantage that runs fairly in both directions. In most instances the gains to the countries of Western Europe would be much larger than those to Australia. On net balance we would be the losers. We do not normally take a narrow view of these things, but at present I am not in a position to state the outcome of these discussions. I can assure the honourable member that we are giving close consideration to the requests which have reached us from these other countries, including one from Japan.",17,Commonwealth Table Of Precedence

55,Mr Speaker,"I have received a letterI call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in thenplaces. (More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places)United States of America and the United Kingdom are having balance of payment difficulties. They have spent so much abroad that their overseas funds are being depleted, and they seek to remedy the position by controlling the funds of their own nationals throughout the world. They are discouraging investment overseas by their nationals. To me, that appears to be justifiable. However, the Government of Australia is entering emphatic and bitter protests. The President of America made a statement telling American companies that they should remit home a higher proportion of the profits they earned abroad and rely more on borrowing abroad the funds needed for expansion and avoid new direct investments which would not yield quick returns. It is against this policy of the United States of America that the Prime Minister of Australia ( Sir Robert Menzies) has sent a communication to the President of the United States. The United States of America, Mr Speaker, is not the only country that has adverse balances of payments. Australia has, during the last 15 years, had a succession of adverse balances of payments and she has met those adverse balances not with the money of her own nationals but with money borrowed abroad. She has met them by selling a bit of Australia to overseas interests. During that period a total of about Â£2,000 million of overseas money has been invested in this country. The difference, that not only have we a deficit of Â£500 of course, is that the Americans seek to get out of their difficulties by utilising the we have the added disability that arises resources of their own nationals. We have saved the solvency of this country by utilisthe United Kingdom will not flow their ing the resources and the money of countries overseas. What will the Government of Australia now do? As the policy of America-and that of the United Kingdom also-mean s that money to meet our overseas deficits will not flow into this country from the United States and the United Kingdom we will then have to finance those deficits from some other source. On what other source will we rely? Where will we go for money to replace that which was flowing into Australia from America and the United Kingdom? The Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) in answer to a question in this House today, suggested that we will give taxation concessions to the investors of Japan and West Germany and other countries in Europe-includin g Sweden, as one of my colleagues points out-in order that money will come to Australia to replace that which we cannot get from the United States of America and the United Kingdom. There is more to it than that, of course, because in thisfinancialyear there will be a greater financial deficit than almost any we have had in the history of this country. Only twice previously-if twice-in our history have there been greater overseas deficits than we will have during thisfinancialyear. In 1952 we had a deficit of over Â£500 million, and the Prime Minister went to the microphone and announced to the people that Australia was in danger of insolvency overseas. In 1960, preceding the credit squeeze, there was a deficit of Â£300 million. I have here a document issued by the Chamber of Manufactures which says ""Trade Deficit a Darkening Cloud"". It says that on the arithmetic of this organisation there remains a current account deficit of Â£500 million for this year. In recent years the Opposition has asked whether or not it is a good practice to borrow overseas and to sell our assets overseas. We have continued to finance our current account deficits by the inflow of private capital from abroad, but Â£500 million this year is well beyond our capital inflow expectations. That means million due to trade discrepancies, but also from the fact that the United States and money into this country as they have in the past. This Government has been warned that that position would come about. We warn this Government now that if, instead of rectifying the present method of allowing finance to come into this country, and if, instead of scrutinising the needs for which that capital is used, it merely induces more capital to come from Japan, West Germany arid other places, it will inevitably only be putting off the evil day.",19,Control Of Capital Inflow
56,Mr Peters (Scullin) [3.18],"Th eThe position that has arisen, of the United States and the United Kingdom preventing or discouraging the flow of capital from those countries into Australia, will arise inevitably in regard to every other country. The time arrives when we have sold so much of our country to overseas investors that little or nothing remains to be sold, and this matter. In the past it has done nothing then a decrease in the inflow occurs. That decrease ultimately leads to the end of the flow of capital into the country. When that position arises and the country is paying to overseas investors immense dividends on the moneys that have been invested, the country becomes merely the hewer of wood and the drawer of water for the exploiters in the other countries. We warned the Government about the seas capital has been so operated and so position.

Even India, which is hungry for resources from overseas, has a vast number of complicated regulations which prevent the indiscriminate exploitation of its people, its resources and the nation by overseas capital. But this Government does nothing about to see that the capital that came to Australia was utilised so as to create assets with which the assets of this country that were sold or pawned overseas could be redeemed. After all, the proof of the value of overseas capital to the Australian community is that the capital, by its operations within this country, does things which enable Australia in the future to become less dependent upon overseas capital.

Almost every other developing country of the world is pleading for investment from overseas so that it can get ahead with its own development. We are using the savings that we are building up in this country. We have a good record of savings. Four fifths of the investment in Australia today comes from the savings of the Australian people. The remaining one fifth comes from the savings of people in other parts of the world who are prepared to risk their own savings in the hope that they will find a profitable and rewarding investment in this country.

60,Mr Harold Holt,"It is too riskyindustrialised country honourable gentlemen opposite could name the level of employment for our people, with good conditions and good wages. Does the honourable member for Scullin believe that there is no connection between that result and the capital which has come into this country over the period? Sir, what we ought to be looking at is whether there are dangers associated with the inflow of capital and whether there are ways in which we could have a better outcome from the investment here. I do not deny that there are dangers inherent in the importation of capital. Those dangers have been debated in this House and other places at various times. What we have to try to weigh is the balance of advantage for Australia. The honourable gentleman creates some great scare story about the current deficit situation in which we find ourselves this year. This is not the first year in which Ausbecause we colleot 42i per cent, of that tralia has run a current deficit. We have done so for many years. We did in the years in which honourable gentlemen opposite were themselves in government. It may comfort the honourable member for Scullin to know that considered as a proportion of our export income and of our gross national product, the income which is payable overseas from the investment that has come here is, if anything, a slightly lower proportion of our gross national product-and , at that, it is about 2 per cent, only-and a slightly smaller proportion of our export income than it was in 1947-48, the year in which the big inflow of migrants commenced. Does that suggest that the country has been slipping into some disastrous situation? What has been happening over this period is a great expansion of Australia's economic base. Australia is a much stronger country. Australia is a much more prosperous country, and we have much more versatility in our industrial capacity than we had in those days. Many of these industries have themselves provided import replacements for us. How many Australians today would be driving around in their own motor cars if we had to import motor cars and use up foreign exchange for that purpose? Yet, the automotive industry has come to us as a result of a series of investments not only from the United States but also from Britain and European countries. Japan even has in contemplation some automotive investment here. While we are on the subject, let me say that the honourable member for Scullin has a curious phobia about General MotorsHolden's Pty. Ltd. I have rarely heard him make a speech in which he has not attacked the company. Yet Australia has received great benefits as the result of the activities of the company. One of the interesting things about this matter is that the honourable gentleman overlooks the fact that Australian people reap a very substantial financial return from the operations of General Motors-Holden's Pty. Ltd. If he is looking for an Australian equity, he will find that the Australian people have an equity in G.M.H. There is not just a handful of shareholders who might be able to take advantage of some arrangement if General Motors-Holden's provided an equity participation here. ButH i million Australian people have a share in the profitability of General Motors-Holden's company's profits in tax and when it sends some of the balance overseas we get another chop at that under the withholding tax arrangement. So, there is this equity. In more recent times, it is worth noting, G.M.H. has built up an export income for this country. In a statement which he put out as recently as 4th March 1965, the Managing Director of General MotorsHolden's Pty. Ltd., Mr Hegland, said that export earnings this year were expected to reach Â£9 million. He said also that it was now the company's policy to keep the dividend pay-out inside the company's export earnings, barring no major downturn in export returns. What is true of G.M.H. here will be true, I believe, to an increasing extent, of industries established in Australia from overseas but which, by their efficient operation, are able to develop an export market as well as contributing to the Australian market. I repeat that what we must ask ourselves is whether this country is on net balance gaining from this overseas investment. I do not think there could be a reasonably minded person in the country who would not admit that this company has made a major contribution to our development, our growth, our strength and our prosperity in earlier years and that, situated as we are with a great continent to develop and with a determination to go on with our migration programme, we shall have a need for capital to supplement our own savings for as far ahead as we can see. I want, as other members of the Parliament want, to guard against the situation where the basic resources of this country have fallen into the control of overseas interests without any basis of Australian participation. We have used from time to time such persuasive influences as we can exert in particular situaspeakers on the Labour side in this debate, tions where we felt it desirable to encourage Australian participation. It is significant that people notorious for their antipathy to in two of the important proposals to reach the Government in relation to the development of the bauxite deposits at Gove, substantial Australian participation is proposed. If any concern is felt about our capacity is left to us my friend the honourable memto pay our way in the future, let me say ber for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) who, that any possible incapacity in this direction if he entertains feelings of that sort towards is the consequence of the fact that AusAmerican investment, has certainly been tralians themselves have either been unwilmuch more discreet in relation to his ling to finance a good deal of Australian expression of them. developmental activities or have lacked the financial capacity to do so, leaving overseas investors to provide the required opportunity for thrashing out this matter. financial backing.

They arepeople and provide employment opportunities for them. I said a little earlier that I believe it is unfortunate that this very complex and far reaching issue should come before us in this way, virtually in the form of a political attack on the Government. First of all, a discussion in these circumstances leaves us with insufficient time to canvass al] aspects of the matter. Secondly, it is surely a reflection of the state of the Australian Labour Party that not only should this discussion have been initiated by the honourable member for Scullin, who has for a long time expressed opposition to overseas investment in Australia, but also that such opposition has been building up on the Labour side during the years in which American investment has been increasing in this country. In fact, three of the four as they have been announced to me, are America and all things American. They are the honourable member for Yarra (Dr. J. F. Cairns), the honourable member for Reid( Mr Uren) and the honourable member for Scullin. Of the four speakers there I hope that the House will find a better deal more when the comments of the discussion by the honourable member for The failure of the Government to protect the economy by effective measures which would control the flow of capital into Australia. I should think that it is implicit in the terms of that proposition that the Labour Party at least does not believe that in no circumstances should there be foreign investment in Australia. What it suggests is that there ought to be some regulation of the flow of capital into Australia, and perhaps some conditions also imposed upon the entry of such capital. I should also like to say at",22,Control Of Capital Inflow
61,Mr Crean (Melbourne Ports) [3.49],"this point that there is no doubt that individual industries. I shall quote some Australia's overseas reserves would be nonfigures from the tableexistent if it had not been for the flow of foreign capital into Australia in recent years.

In round figures, the apparent capital inflow in 1962 amounted to Â£150 million, in 1963 to Â£222.5 million and in 1964 to Â£215 million. That flow of capital inward includes, of course, that very mysterious item "" unremitted profits "". But let us look at the other side of the picture. Outflow in 1962 amounted to Â£97.6 million, in 1963 to Â£128 million and in 1964 to Â£133 million. In other words, we are rapidly reaching the point where the outflow each yearthat is, the profits earned on capital already invested-is of the staggering magnitude of nearly Â£200 million. The Government has suggested that it is un-Australian to call attention to this factor. It is time that the Commonwealth Government did as the Government of the United States is doing and took steps, on the one hand, to promote our balance of payments position and, on the other hand, to ensure that industry which is operated in Australia is at least substantially controlled by Australians. In our economy manufacturing is still the biggest single source of employment. This may not continue to be the position in the future. Nevertheless, at present it is the biggest single means of absorption of those people who come onto the labour market each year. However, the decisions that are taken in nearly one third of manufacturing industries-a t least in excess of one quarter of them-ar e not taken in Australia. I have in mind the fields of chemicals, oil exploration, the distribution of petrol, the manufacture of motor cars and even some of our basic minerals. Mt. Isa Mines Ltd. is unfortunately a good enough example of this. It can be said that in 95 per cent, of cases in some fields, and in 50 per cent, of cases in other fields, those industries are not Australian owned and controlled. We believe it is time that something was done. We have not sufficient time this afternoon to specify what steps should be taken, but at least this Government should rise from its dilatory sitting position and state whether it is as alarmed about this matter as are other people in the Australian community. These feelings are not confined to members of the Labour Party. Surely the Government will not pass off this complaint by claiming that anyone who is critical of the position is anti-American or anti-British. As I have said, we are no more anti-American in this respect that we believe President Johnson has been anti-Australian, although presumably the Government thinks he has been anti-Australian if the letter which the Prime Minister sent to him recently is any indication. -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. speeches that we have heard this afternoon from Opposition members indicate clearly the obsession that they have about controls. They seem to think only in negative terms and not nearly enough of the positive side of things. Australia is a young and growing country, a rapidly developing nation which needs the inflow of capital from overseas. Any action that is taken to control, regulate or restrict-cal l it what you wish-the flow of capita] into Australia will have a detrimental effect on us. Inevitably it will scare off much needed capital, and valued existing investment will melt away slowly but surely, to the detriment of the industries concerned. Not only this, but I believe such a method of controlling the inflow of capital would immediately encourage inflationary tendencies in our economy. Overseas capital has been prominent in the post-war years in the development of our natural resources, in the rapid expansion of many of our major industries and in the establishment of new large scale industries. At the same time, interest has not been confined by any means to large scale industries. The spread of investment is reflected in the increase in the number of agreements between local and overseas organisations and the diversity of industries involved. Profits reserved by companies to finance expansion have been a very important source of capital for industrial development, and the willingness of overseas investors to re-invest their profits is a measure of the confidence that they have in Australia. It is a very good thing indeed for Australia and for the future of our country that such a climate exists. The Australian Government welcomes and always has welcomed overseas investment, particularly investment of the kind likely to help in the balanced development of our",24,Control Of Capital Inflow
62,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Lucock).,,26,Control Of Capital Inflow
63,Mr Drury (Ryan) [4.1],"Theresources which are great and scattered. Much work has yet to be done, and we need capital with which to do it. As the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) pointed out earlier, we particularly appreciate overseas investment when that investment brings with it new techniques and new skills -or the successful fulfilment of the particular project which has attracted the investment. To encourage the capital investment in which we on this side of the House believe most firmly and which we regard as an important ingredient in our national growth and advancement, we have negotiated from time to time taxation agreements with the governments of the major overseas investing countries designed to relieve double taxation on income flowing between our country and theirs. All this has helped to make for goodwill, better understanding and certainly from our point of view, greater development. An analysis of overseas investment in Australia must be objective and rational. I realise that some honourable members opposite are not capable of bringing to bear objectivity or rational thinking, but I believe that for any analysis to be worthwhile it must be along those lines. As the Treasurer said on another occasion, an analysis of this kind should be based not on emotional or political considerations or on any understandable sense of nationalism, but rather on a realistic appraisal of Australia's needs. I believe that expresses the position extremely well and sums up in a sentence what I have been trying to say. The Treasurer is also on record as having said that any general system of screening overseas investment or imposing conditions on its entry would turn away more desirable investment than it would keep out undesirable investment. We do not deny that perhaps there are, here and there, elements of investment that are not desirable. I have in mind the case of a company that is not working efficiently seeking to take over an organisation that is working efficiently. We do not regard that as a desirable form of investment, but there is very little of that. For the great part, the investment is most desirable and worthwhile and we welcome it. For many years-a t least for 15 yearsAustralia has enjoyed a reputation for political and economic stability. It is indeed fortunate for this country and for its future that such a political and economic climate exists and that we have friends in big investment countries overseas who regard Australia as a good avenue of investment. Far from failing to protect our economy, this Government, by its financial and economic policies over the last 15 years, including the allowing of a reasonable inflow of capital from abroad, has speeded up our rate of development in very many fields. The Government has sustained an increasing immigration programme. This was mentioned this afternoon by the Treasurer. It has provided the wherewithal to strengthen our defences and to improve our education system, and it has contributed significantly to import replacement, with a consequent saving of overseas exchange. The present Government has achieved a good share of overseas markets for our manufactured goods. It has encouraged the growth of Australian industry in a much greater variety offieldsthan would have been possible without British and foreign investment in this country. Investment, Sir, does not necessarily mean control. I am afraid, however, that many honourable members opposite fail to make this distinction. It is one that I emphasise. In fact, a large and growing proportion of the overseas capital invested in Australia is what we call ""portfolio investment"". This is investment made for precisely the same purpose that you or I or any other Australian citizen buys shares on the local stock exchange-jus t as a form of personal investment. It has been estimated that approximately one quarter, or perhaps a shade more, of the total capital investment in Australian industry is owned by British and foreign investors. The remaining three quarters, or near enough to three quarters, is owned by Australians. So it is quite incorrect for honourable members opposite to suggest, or by implication to say, that there is any threat of domination in this field by overseas concerns. Speakers on the other side of the chamber so far have produced no facts or figures to prove that there is any foreign domination or any threat of foreign domination in the investment field. Nor, I suggest, is there any foreseeable threat. Obviously, if we judge by the hostile way in which this matter has been submitted for discussion this afternoon, Opposition members have some fears on this score. But I believe that, for the most pan, whatever fears they entertain are hypothetical and without real substance. Speaker, I support the discussion of this subject as a matter of urgent public importance as submitted by the honourable member for Scullin( Mr Peters). At the outset, may I direct the attention of the House to an inspired Press leak from the Cabinet. This was the substance of a report in the "" Daily Telegraph "" of Monday last under the headline, "" Clamp on American investors "". This article, based on an inspired Press leak, mentions two members of the Cabinet-the Minister for Labour and prominent member of the Liberal Party of Australia, and the Deputy Prime Minister tralian Country Party. They are reported as supporting the clamp down on American investment. The lonely man of the Cabinet is the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt), who is now sitting at the table. We know that on the issue of foreign investment this Government is divided. This is why there is such small ministerial backing for the Treasurer on this matter today. We know that a junior Minister will speak later, but no senior Minister will support the Treasurer this afternoon. I should like to refer honourable members to the ""Daily Telegraph"" of 29th May 1963, which reported remarks made by the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) at Port Lincoln in the by-election campaign for the seat of Grey. I shall quote from this report in the right honourable gentleman's favourite newspaper. The report is headed, in heavy, black print: "" Investment Welcomed. ' Confidence Vote' from Overseas "". The Prime Minister is reported as having said that investment in Australia in the past ten years had been phenomenal and that hundreds of millions of pounds had been invested by the United States of America and Britain. The right honourable gentleman is reported as followsBut every time. I mention these facts there will be some bunch of Left Wing men who will say: "" You are pawning the country to the overseas bankers"". Really, the Labour Party has got me baffled. Only one person is baffled. That is the all countries of Â£1,902 million. With our Prime Minister. We know that, only traditional trading partners, the United recently, he stated that he wanted to see Kingdom and the United States, we have Australians participate in foreign companies in Australia and it is interesting to know that he is now moving away from the Treasurer towards the Minister for Labour and National Service and the Deputy Prime Minister. We find fhe Prime Minister now in good company, for he has joined the ranks of the so-called left wing. We know that the Deputy Prime Minister joined the ranks of the left wing several years ago in opposing the inflow of indiscriminate foreign investment. We in the Australian Labour Party oppose indiscriminate foreign investment and we have with us not only the Deputy Prime Minister but also the Financial Editor of the "" Sydney Morning Herald"", the financial writer for the Melbourne ""Herald"", Mr John Eddy, and Maxwell Newton, who was once editor of the "" Australian Financial Review"". Let us keep in mind, too, that the most respectable of stockbrokers throughout Australia-me n such as Sir Ian Potter and Mr Staniforth Ricketson-ar e aligned with the so-called left wing in opposing this indiscriminate inflow of foreign investment. So also is a broad section of the Australian community aligned with this so-called left wing, as it was described by the Prime Minister at Port Lincoln in May 1963. As a socialist member of this Parliament I shall support any Australian, including members of the Australian Country Party, or any other member on the Government side of the Parliament, who will oppose indiscriminate foreign investment as the Deputy Prime Minister did. May we remind the Treasurer that, at the conference of the Victorian Country Party on 2nd April 1963, the Deputy Prime Minister saidWe are selling a bit of our heritage each year. Warning has been given time and time again. Surely we know that foreign investment has taken control of Canada. Walter Lippman has written that more than 50 per cent, of Canadian manufacturing industry is owned by American investors. Surely we must learn from history in this young country. Our great problem has been that, during the last 15 years, under the administration of the present Government, we have had a deficit balance of trade with",26,Control Of Capital Inflow
64,Mr Uren (Reid) [4.7],Mr Deputy,28,Control Of Capital Inflow
65,"National Service ( Mr Mcmahon), Who Is A",,28,Control Of Capital Inflow
66,"( Mr Mcewen), Who Is Leader Of The Aus","had a deficit balance of trade totalling Â£3.666 million including invisibles-Â£2,07 2 million for the United Kingdom and Â£1,596 million for the United States. On the other hand, we have had a credit trading balance with countries such as Japan, Belgium, France, China, Russia and other Eastern European countries. Yet we still have a total overall deficit of Â£1,902 million. We have met this deficit by increasing Government borrowing and indiscriminate private foreign investment. As the Deputy Prime Minister has said, we are selling a bit of our heritage each year. Indeed, we are eating the heart out of our heritage. This Government has been pawning Australia's future. This is typical of our Prime Minister. His attitude is: Let us live well today and tomorrow will look after itself. This is typical of the approach of the Government as a whole. The Prime Minister did not imagine, as he made his remarks at Port Lincoln in May 1963, that we would have an economic crisis over foreign investment so soon. He imagined that we would have rosy years ahead of us as we lived on the sale of our national heritage. Why has the present crisis come about? We know that it has arisen because the United States of America has had a balance of trade crisis and is determined that more and more of the profits of American investment overseas shall be returned to that country. Many things could be said about matters such as double taxation agreements. At question time today, we heard about agreements A conservative estimate is that the double taxation agreement with the United Kingdom has cost Australia Â£130 million. The undistributed profits tax of 2s. in the Â£1 was abolished by this Government in 1951. If it had remained, Australia would have obtained about Â£25 million from it. This means that we have made a gift of nearly Â£155 million to British investors. Australia entered into a double taxation agreement with the United States of America in 1953 and this has cost Australian taxpayers Â£42 million. The abolition of the undistributed profits tax has cost a further Â£24,700,000. But we should look further at the handouts given by this Government to the top 102 companies, the .19 per cent, of the 54,000 companies in Australia, which receive one-third of all profits. This Government has granted them a very liberal depreciation allowance. In the last year of office of the Chifley Administration this allowance amounted to only Â£96 million; last year it was Â£670 million. As a percentage of the gross national product, in the days of the Chifley Government it was 4.2 per cent, and last year it was 7.7 per cent. This means that the Government has given an additional 3i per cent, of the gross national product to that section of industry, which is seeking to maintain a monopoly. The Government has given handouts to the companies not only by entering into double taxation agreements and abolishing the undistributed profits tax but also by granting a liberal allowance for the depreciation of plant. We believe that the Government should plan and control foreign investment. We know that we have difficult days ahead of us, but we believe that it is impossible to apply one policy to all foreign investment. An attempt must be made to distinguish one type of investment from another. We should allow essential foreign investment and technical know how to come to this country, if we need it. We may need foreign capital for other purposes; but we must get out and plan. The honourable member for Ryan( Mr Drury) criticised controls. We on this side of the House believe in planning. We want to plan the future of Australia for the benefit of Australia and of Australians, not for the benefit of a small minority section. The Government represents a small section. It represents a monopoly section, of which agitation for double taxation foreign companies form a part. with further countries. -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. for the Interior) [4.18] -On e wonders what thoughts pass through the minds of Opposition members who, in raising this matter of definite public importance, express concern about the inflow of foreign capital. Probably three reasons prompt them to raise this matter. The first is a matter of national pride or national concern that Australians should participate in companies established in this country by foreign investors. I will accept that point of view. I think all Australians feel that Australia should be a partner in enterprises established in this country by foreign investors. The second",28,Control Of Capital Inflow
67,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Lucock).,,29,Control Of Capital Inflow
68,Mr Anthony (Richmond,"Ministe rpoint of view probably prompts many Opposition members. It is that demagogues can get up and blow off about a national issue that engenders emotions in the people. In many a country, demagogues have aroused the emotions of the people and taken over the government, only to lead the country to economic ruin. The third reason is that some left wing members of the Australian Labour Party see this as a wonderful opportunity to further their anti-American feelings. wing? Opposition members know where they are, whether they are right wing or left wing. We have been told that there is great conpoints in our economy foreign investment cern about foreign investment in Australia and that there is danger at the moment. I think we should take the other point of view and be very proud that Australia is receiving so much foreign capital. The world is hungry for capital. Those who travel through the less developed countries of South East Asia will know that they are crying out for money to develop all types of industry, both secondary and primary. Australia is one of the few countries that is receiving a fair share of foreign capital. Those who hold the view that this will be a permanent feature of the Australian economy are in for a rude awakening, because foreign investment can be cut off at any time. Other countries have found that this is so. While Australia is able to accept foreign capital without being unduly harmed we should welcome it. We are a country that is developing and must continue to develop. We are surrounded by countries that look jealously at us. We have a moral right to hold this country only if we populate it and develop it. But populating the country requires a large amount of capital for the construction of homes, schools, roads and so on, and a development programme needs even more capital for secondary industries, primary industries and mining industries. A new country such as Australia is does not have the capital resources to do all that needs to be done. America today is the greatest capital expleased if other foreign owned companies porting country, but for a big part of its adopted the same policy. I would be pleased, history it was a net capital importing for instance, if General Motors-Holden's country. Until 1923 America was a net Pty. Ltd. allowed Australians to become capital importing country and it is only since partners in the company. then that it has been able to export capital. I hope that Australia will develop to the point where it too will be a capital exporting country. Why is this foreign capital coming to Australia? It is coming here because we have political stability and sensible economics. We are developing along sensible and progressive lines and there is every prospect that the expenditure of money in this country will be rewarded. That is why Australia is regarded as a good place for investment. Perhaps Opposition members are a little jealous that we have created this wonderful attitude in the minds of people throughout the world. But it should not be thought that we accept all foreign capital as being good. At minor has been to our disadvantage. Dr. J. F. Cairns -Such as? it is good for foreign capital merely to replace Australian investment in some existing Australian industry, such as a butter factory or a flour mill-bu t these are only small spots in the economy. thing about it? fact that we have this debate today shows that we are doing something. We express the point of view that the Government welcomes partnership in foreign owned enterprises in this country and that we are not happy about foreign companies taking over existing Australian enterprises. Overseas investors know of our feelings on these matters. It was pleasant to read in today's newspapers that a big company in Australia, Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Limited, is making a bonus issue of shares and is making the largest part of this issue available to Australian shareholders. This will increase the Australian shareholding in the company from 10 to 15 per cent. Do Opposition members not welcome this? It is a move in the right direction and I would be",29,Control Of Capital Inflow

73,Mr Anthony,"I think we are. TheAs has been mentioned by other honourable members and by the Treasurer ( Mr mission to examine the situation of Canada. Harold Holt), the inflow of foreign capital has two effects. It helps with our balance of payments and it helps to develop this country. If Australia is to develop we must have the capital to buy machinery. With foreign investment comes know how-the knowledge of how to develop mining projects and secondary industries. In addition, foreign capital helps us to find a market for our products in many countries. The foreign investors have traditionally sold their products in these markets. As the organisations establish themselves in Australia we are given a permanent outlet for many products. Over the years the Opposition has been very keen to refer to what has happened in Canada and to say how that country has been exploited by the United States of America. The honourable member for Reid( Mr Uren) was again very happy to reiterate what he has been saying for years about this issue. In Canada, some members of Parliament climbed on the band wagon and talked about the great harm that was being done to their country. There was a change of government and the new government lasted for a period, but the realities came to the people and there was another change of government. Then the Canadian Royal Commission on Banking and Finance, known as the Porter Commission, was set up. In 1964 the commission issued a report from which I should like to read the followingIt should be pointed out that it That is, foreign investmentbrings with it important advantages which contribute to domestic employment and economic growth. We do not look with favour at Canadian legislation which thwarts capital flows for reasons unrelated to our underlying economic need for them. If .certain practices of either foreign or domestically-controlled enterprises are found to be harmful, we would prefer lhat any remedies be directed to the practices themselves and not to investment as such. As long as this That is, foreign investmentis productive and adds to Canadian income and wealth, it will give rise neither to serious servicing Trade and Industry, to raise it consistently costs in relation to Canadian earnings nor to mi sail oca tion of resources in the Canadian economy. On the contrary, h will accelerate our development and bring close the day when this country will become on balance a net exporter of capital to other nations. That was the view of the most recent comThe Labour Party in this place seems to have one attitude on this issue although, as we all know, it has many attitudes on other issues. However, it is interesting to note that State Labour Parties, particularly those which have the responsibility to look after the affairs of a State, welcome foreign capital. States such as New South Wales, such as Western Australia when Mr Hawke's Government was in power, and such as Tasmania, regularly send representatives overseas and do all that they possibly can to attract foreign investmenttoAustralia to help development. I welcome at this time overseas capital that will develop this country. I believe that the more capital that comes here to develop Australia, the safer this country will be for our future generations. Dr. J. F. CAIRNS (Yarra) [4.28] -The young and rather inexperienced Minister for the Interior( Mr Anthony) wonders what has prompted the Labour Party to raise this matter at this time. The reason, which seems to have escaped the Minister, is exactly the same reason that apparently prompted the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) to make a special plea to the President of the United States of America this very week about this matter. The reason that has prompted the Opposition to raise the matter in debate this afternoon is the very reason that has prompted Cabinet -perhap s it is the inner Cabinet-to give a great deal of consideration to this matter in the last week or so. The reason that has caused the Opposition to speak on this issue today is the reason that, presumably, caused the Minister for Labour make a very impassioned speech on the subject in Cabinet and the reason that caused the Minister for Trade and Industry missions that he has now been making consistently for three or four years. The reason that caused the Opposition to raise this matter this week is the reason that caused the leader of the party to which the Minister for the Interior belongs, the Minister for for the last two or three years-precisel y the same reason. Therefore, I find it a little difficult to understand the attitude of the Minister for the Interior.",30,Control Of Capital Inflow
74,And National Service ( Mr Mcmahon) To,,31,Control Of Capital Inflow
75,( Mr Mcewen) Again To Repeat The Sub,"The position is that for five or six years the Australian Labour Party has advised and warned the Government of the need to avoid the kind of difficulty that the Government now faces in 1965. For five or six years the Labour Party has been concerned to attempt to prevent exactiy the same sort of difficulty that the Government is now wrestling with pretty strenuously. But for the greater part of this time the GovernÂ£195 million on our current trade with ment has been totally unconcerned about the difficulty. The Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt), has now found himself almost alone in an unqualified advocacy of foreign investment. To my knowledge he qualified that advocacy for the first time in this debate this afterit will produce any better results than the noon when he said: "" I do not deny that there are dangers."" So even the right honourable gentleman from the Treasury, one who is more at home in Washington than in Canberra, has now at long last admitted: "" I do not deny that there are dangers."" This admission is a wonderful compliment to the Opposition. It has taken us six long years to educate the Treasurer to this point. But, of course, the Minister for Trade and Industry has been with us on this issue for much longer. He joined us in about 1960 or 1961 when he said almost precisely the same thing that we had been saying for many years-that while there are some useful forms of overseas investment, there are some very harmful forms as well. In recent times the Press, including even the "" Daily Telegraph "", and the manufacturers and the investors-al l people who qualify for the title "" Australians""-hav e joined us, and now, presumably, the Government is sufficiently anxious about the situation to justify the report, which has not been denied, that appeared in the "" Daily Telegraph "". I should like to refer to that report which stated that the Prime Minister had made a special appeal to the President of the US. Yesterday the Prime Minister admitted that he had. He admitted that this matter, which the Opposition thinks is a matter of urgency, is so important that he, the Prime Minister of Australia, should make a special plea to the President of the US. Of course this is a matter of urgency. Can the Minister for the Interior any longer remain in doubt about this? Of course not. But what good can come from this plea secureindustrial capacity, he had a responsibility to to the President of the United States? Only would absorb the yearly increase of 100,000 in the three years ago the Prime Minister made worker force. another plea to the President of the US he happened to be President Kennedy in those days-hu t no specific promises came from the President in respect of trade. That was the outcome in 1962, and not one change has taken place in America's trading relations with Australia since then, except that in the meantime we have reached an astonishing deficit of, I think, the US. The current appeal by the Prime Minister to the President of the United States is not quite as bad as the earlier one; it is not quite a special mission, although it is a special plea. However, I do not think earlier one did. In case the Minister for the Interior, or any one else on the other side of the House, remains any longer in doubt about the importance and urgency of this matter, I should like to refer to a report which might not have had much value if it had been denied, but which has not been denied. It was a report in the ""Daily Telegraph"" relating to a Cabinet meeting. 1 do not know how the ""Daily Telegraph"" finds out what goes on at Cabinet meetings, but apparently it does. Apparently it is not only discussions inside the Labour Party that are aired to the Australian newspaper readers. If what is contained in this report did not happen, the Treasurer can tell us so and he is saying nothing in denial of it now. He is silent. If this did not happen the Minister for Labour and National Service, who is about the House somewhere but has not taken part in the debate so far, can tell us that it did not happen. I cannot recall a debate on this subject before in which the Minister for Labour and National Service did not take part, but for some reason he has not participated in the debate today. If this did not happen, let him say so. The report statesto have been particularly insistent that Australia would have to face up to this problem quickly. Did the Minister make any such statement as that? If the report is not true, he can say that it is not true. The report continuedOn his return from the US. recently, Mr McMahon emphasised that while appreciative of American investment that added to Australia's expansion of Australian industry that",31,Control Of Capital Inflow

Parliament. It is of no wonder that the Cabinet has decided upon some additional action. Without being aware of the latest news on the subject, I predicted a few moments ago that the plea made by the Prime Minister to the President of the United States would not have the desired effect. I have just had brought to me a Sydney newspaper published this afternoon which carries the captionJohnson rebuffs Menzies. The Treasurer and some of his colleagues are interjecting. It is all very well for honourable members opposite to quote from these newspapers when they are criticising the Australian Labour Parry, but they do not like it very much when the position is in reverse. They derive great pleasure and rub their hands with glee when these newsopposite they brush it aside and say that it Presumably the Cabinet has decided on a number of things, but the Treasurer, who informed about what the Government is any of them. I say deliberately that the Cabinet has decided: The general policy of acceptance and encourage(a) Long-term (b) Provides additions to Australian industrial complex and know-how.

Presumably the Government has already decided in the Cabinet room to take certain action. But it is doing quite the reverse here; it is brushing aside the Opposition's proposal as though it was of no importance and had no relevance to the subject. That is a completely dishonest way in which to conduct the affairs of this House. A similar proposal has been submitted by the honourable member for Scullin( Mr Peters) once or twice in the past. On this occasion he has done what he has done in the past; he has told us what he said on a previous occasion. He ranged over the",32,Control Of Capital Inflow
77,Mr Whittorn (Balaclava) [4.38],"capital structure of Australia and overseas countries and companies to such an extent that when he hadfinishedhis speech I was so confused that I really did not know what he was talking about. He said that the Australian Government and the Australian people would take capital from almost any country in the world and as a last resort would take capital from Indonesia. Any country that could obtain capital from Indonesia within his lifetime or mine would indeed be a very good seller of its prospects. As the honourable member for Ryan( Mr Drury) said, capital is one of the shyest of commodities. All countries have to use capital that is obtained not only internally but also from overseas. It is one of the commodities that we use in our daily life to build up the living standards of the people. As the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) said, we not only use capital but use it to increase the living standards of Australians and new settlers who are coming to this country in ever increasing numbers. There is no doubt in my mind and in the minds of some demographers that, if, since 1947, we had not brought in overseas capital amounting to approximately Â£2,000 million, our population would now be not H i million but approximately 9 i million. Moreover, the living standards of those 9 i million people would have been commensurately lower. Since the last war all Australian governments have tried to obtain capital from overseas. Members of the Opposition, some honourable members on this side of the House and many of the Government's critics have been influenced by what they think has happened in Canada and by debates in the Canadian Parliament about American investment in Canada. Since World War II Canada has obtained from the United States of America two-thirds of the capital that has been needed to build up its manufacturing industries. But in the same time only 25 per cent, of the capital that has been used to build up Australian industries has come from external sources. The Minister for the Interior( Mr Anthony) made the pertinent point that the situation in Canada influences many people who discuss the economy of Australia. As the Minister said, a commission was appointed India and certain other countries have imabout four years ago to inquire into banking posed restrictions on capital inflow from and finance in Canada. Last year that comoverseas. Countries such as India, Malaysia F.2518/65 -R -[3 ] mission reported to the Canadian Government in the following termsIt should be pointed out that it (i.e., foreign investment) brings with it important advantages which contribute to domestic employment and economic growth. We do not look with favour on Canadian legislation which thwarts capital flows for reasons unrelated to our underlying economic need for them. If certain practices of either foreign or domestically controlled enterprises are found to be harmful, we would prefer that any remedies be directed to the practices themselves and not to investment as such. As long as this (i.e. foreign investment) is productive and adds to Canadian income and wealth, it will give rise neither to serious servicing costs in relation to Canadian earnings nor to misallocation of resources in the Canadian economy. On the contrary, it will accelerate our development and bring closer the day when this country will become on balance a net exporter of capital to other nations. Is not that the situation in which Australia now finds itself, with the small difference that investments by America in the Canadian economy amount to Â£18,000 million and American investment in the Australian economy is equal to one-eighteenth of that sum, or Â£1,000 million? The difference is so marked that I cannot see the relevance of references to the situation that exists in Canada, about which the Canadians themselves are quite happy. However, I agree with the Treasurer when he says that the criticisms should not be lightly brushed off. Investment capital has contributed greatly to the development of Australia and of the living standards of people who were born in this country and those who have come here as new settlers. As I have said, the total amount of overseas investment in Australian manufacturing industries is not as the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) endeavoured to indicate to the Parliament and the people of Australia when he referred to it as being between 50 and 97 per cent, in certain industries. In the overall picture, overseas investment accounts for no more than 25 per cent, of the capital invested in Australian manufacturing industries. I repeat my earlier comment that Australia could not maintain its present growth without overseas investment in our manufacturing industries. Reference has been made to the fact that and Taiwan have given a tax holiday to tralian users of copper have to pay an manufacturers in Australia, the United additional Â£200 a ton because of the forces States, Germany or the United Kingdom at work at Mount Isa, and in other parts of who have funds to invest in their respective Queensland. I should like to see the Oppocountries. They offer an inducement by sition submit motions of censure directed at giving them a tax holiday for, say, five influences such as those evident at Mount years. We have not had to resort to such Isa, which are likely to spread to other measures to induce investors to come to parts of Australia unless something is done Australia. As I see it, there are two ways in which we can finance development. One is by local savings. As I have said, the Australian people have invested in Australian manufacturing, tertiary and primary industries more than 75 per cent, of the capital used in those industries. In manufacturing alone have we been using capital from overseas countries to the extent of 25 per cent. I ask the Opposition and the House: How could 114 million Australians finance the tremendous development that we hope to see in the Hamersley Range project in Western Australia? Thiry-five billion tons of high grade iron ore are available there. This is a tremendous heritage for Australia, for the future use of our children and their children. How could H i million Australians find the millions of pounds required to be invested in this development? I would judge from what members of the Opposition have said that they believe that we should develop these vast resources of iron ore only by digging out the ore, putting it in barges and sending it to Japan, America and England, letting the workers there process the material. I find it distasteful to realise that we have in Australia people who want us to be merely hewers of wood and drawers of water. As Australian companies and overseas companies progressively develop the iron ore at Hammersley Range, the bauxite at Weipa and Gove Peninsula and, I hope, eventually, the copper at Mount Isa, the people of Australia will be beneficiaries from this golden wealth. We cannot do it alone, so the money must come from overseas countries. As to Mount Isa, those who think only of the welfare State are doing their best to ensure that we as a people gain no benefits from the vast copper resources in that area. Most honourable members realise that the international price of copper has risen by Â£52 a ton in the past seven months, since the trouble began at Mount Isa. Ausabout them. It is true that overseas capital dominates some industries in Australia. We all know what has happened in the case of General Motors-Holden's Pty. Ltd., but that company provides work directly for 22,000 persons and an additional 22,000 operate for the company as sub-contractors. The honourable member for Yarra has quoted many extracts from newspapers but he did not quote the statement from the United States of America to the effect that 74,000 persons-and that means 74,000 familieswere relying upon General Motors-Holden's Pty. Ltd. for their workaday life and their future in Australia. I support what the Treasurer has said, and I hope that we will not find matters of this kind on the notice paper until the Vernon Committee has submitted its report. -Order! This debate is now concluded. Bill-by leave-presente d by Mr Harold Holt, and read afirsttime. Second Reading. Treasurer) [4.50] 1 move That the Bill be now read a second time. The main purpose of this Bill is to provide a legal basis for certain administrative actions for which the Presiding Officers of the Parliament are responsible between the end of one Parliament and the beginning of another. Provision has also been included to cover interim periods caused by dearh, absence or illness. Certain statutory duties are performed by the Presiding Officers under the Public Service Act, the Audit Act, the Parliamentary Proceedings Broadcasting Act, the Commonwealth Banks Act, and the Commonwealth Electoral Act. In the last three cases it is unlikely that there would be any need",33,Control Of Capital Inflow
78,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Lucock).,,35,Parliamentary Presiding Officers Bill 1965
79,Mr Harold Holt (Higgins,"to exercise the functions when the Parliament is not in session. However, in the first two cases-that is, under the Public Service Act and the Audit Act-it may well be necessary for the Presiding Officers to exercise important functions in the administration of the parliamentary departments for which they are responsible. For example, after the Parliament had been dissolved on the 1st November 1963, there was no person, in the strict legal sense, holding the office of Speaker until the election of a new Speaker in the new Parliament on the 25th February 1964. During this period it was necessary to submit certain regulations to the Governor General under section 9 of the Public Service Act to apply marginal increases to the salaries of certain positions in one of the parliamentary departments. Since there was nobody legally appointed to exercise the functions of the Speaker after the dissolution, the recommendation to the Governor General for the gazettal of new regulations had to be deferred. There are other examples which could be cited in connection with the appointment and promotion of members of the staff of the parliamentary departments which, for lack of a legal basis for exercising the powers of the Presiding Officers between the end of one Parliament and the beginning of another, would have to be held up with possible adverse effects on the individual officer's rights. We have, therefore, sought, in this Bill to provide a legal basis for the persons who had been the President and the Speaker immediately prior to a dissolution to continue to exercise the powers and functions of Presiding Officers under the laws of the Commonwealth after the dissolution of a Parliament until new Presiding Officers have been elected by the new Parliament. selves that there is a constitutional basis for Australia. The Board's principal bank this? this Bill forward supported by the advice of the law officers, but perhaps the Attorneyof Australia which is an imprest account General( Mr Snedden) could deal with this matter with more authority than I can. We have also included in the Bill provision that, if through death, illness or absence, a Presiding Officer or the person who had been a Presiding Officer is unable to carry out the .statutory functions attaching to his office under a law of the Commonwealth, then the Chairman of Committees or the person who had been the Chairman of Committees of the House concerned would have the powers of the Presiding Officer under the laws of the Commonwealth, until a new Presiding Officer is elected or the absence or incapacity terminates. The Bill which is brought forward is in line with the practice in the United Kingdom where there has been a House of Commons (Speaker) Act in force since 1832. I might add that we should have had a similar provision before this. I commend the Bill to the House. the Reform Bill! Debate (on motion by Mr Whitlam) adjourned.

The purpose of this short Bill is to amend that part of the Coal Industry Act which deals with the Joint Coal Board's banking operations and with the power of the Board to borrow money on overdraft. As the House is aware, the Board operates by virtue of almost identical acts of the Parliaments of the Commonwealth and of the State of New South Wales. As they now stand the Commonwealth and State Coal Industry Acts require the Board to bank with the Reserve Bank of accounts are in Sydney but accounts are also maintained in Wollongong, Newcastle, Cessnock and Lithgow. With the exception of one small account with the Reserve Bank kept for the purpose of paying witnesses their expenses in attending the Coal Industry Tribunal, all these accounts are with the Commonwealth Trading Bank of Australia. The result is that the Joint Coal Board is in breach of both Coal Industry Acts. As I shall now show, this position has arisen",35,Parliamentary Presiding Officers Bill 1965

85,Mr Fairbairn (Farrer,"Minister forfollowing amendments made to the banking legislation of the Commonwealth, subsequent to the enactment of Coal Industry Acts. Under the terms of the Acts, the Board, when it was established, was required to open and maintain its accounts with the then Commonwealth Bank of Australia. The Board accordingly opened accounts with the Commonwealth Bank at a number of metropolitan and country centres. Apart from the accounts at the country centres these accounts were all carried by the central banking section of the Commonwealth Bank which then performed both central and trading bank functions. By the Commonwealth Bank Act 1953 the central and trading bank functions of the Commonwealth Bank were separated. A new corporation, the Commonwealth Trading Bank of Australia, was created which took over the trading bank functions of the Commonwealth Bank. The Commonwealth Bank continued in existence with its central bank functions. Late in 1954 the Board moved from its address in King Street, Sydney, to its present premises in Goulburn Street. Shortly thereafter it requested the Commonwealth Bank to transfer all its metropolitan accounts except the one required for the purpose of the Coal Industry Tribunal to a conveniently situated branch in Oxford Street. This, in fact, was a branch of the Commonwealth Trading Bank and the Board was advised after the accounts were transferred that they would in future be with ing in this section will be omitted and the Commonwealth Trading Bank and not with the central bank as hitherto. Similarly, as a result of the 1953 legislation, each of the country accounts was transferred by the Commonwealth Bank to the Commonwealth Trading Bank. This position was basically unaffected by the Commonwealth banking legislation of 1959 under which, inter alia, rhe Commonwealth Bank was renamed the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Commonwealth Trading Bank was placed under the control of a new corporation, the Commonwealth Banking Corporation. So far as the Board was concerned, this legislation meant that the Board's accounts should be with the Reserve Bank and not with the Commonwealth Trading Bank where, with the exception of the one account referred to earlier, they were and still are held. The Board's present banking arrangements are efficient, convenient and satisfactory. It would not be possible for the Reserve Bank to provide the kind of banking service at present provided by the Commonwealth Trading Bank. The effect of the statutory changes which I have outlined above is that the Board cannot lawfully continue its present banking arrangements which it considers essential to its efficient operation. This is an unsatisfactory position which needs to be resolved by legislation. It is the Government's view that the Board should be authorised to continue its present banking arrangements and, accordingly, the present Bill has been prepared to amend the principal act which is the Coal Industry Act 1946-1958. A new section 19A is proposed for the principal act. This will authorise the Board to maintain an account or accounts with an approved bank or approved banks. Such approved banks will include the Reserve Bank or any other bank declared by regulations to be an approved bank for the purpose of section 19A. Upon the coming into effect of the legislation now before the House, it is intended that regulations will be made declaring the Commonwealth Trading Bank to be an approved bank. The power of the Joint Coal Board to borrow money is conferred by section 23 of the principal act and the opportunity has been taken to provide that the words ""Commonwealth Bank"" wherever appearreplaced by the words ""Reserve Bank"". Finally a section of the amending Bill validates the action of the Joint Coal Board in having maintained banking accounts with the Commonwealth Trading Bank in the past. Under an agreement referred to in the preamble to the Coal Industry Act the Governments of the Commonwealth and of the State of New South Wales have undertaken not to take action without the prior concurrence of the other, to repeal or amend any of the legislation covered by the agreement. The concurrence of the New South Wales Government has been obtained to the amendment proposed in the present Bill. I should add that this Bill has been drafted by the Commonwealth Parliamentary Draftsman after consultation with the State Parliamentary Draftsman, and in over of stocks of unsold raw cotton from agreement with him.

Mr Deputy Speaker, Customs Tariff Proposals No. 30 relate to tariff alterations proposed by "" Gazette"" notice during the recent recess and now formally introduced in the Parliament as required by law. The duty changes, which resulted from the Government's acceptance of recommendations by the Tariff Board and from the completion of a round of international negotiations, have been in operation since 29 th January 1965. A Press statement issued at the time by my colleague, the Minister for copy of the relevant "" Gazette"" notice and Tariff Board report, were circulated to honourable members at the time the duty changes were made. ""Gazette"" notice No. 82, now covered by Proposals No. 30, introduced duties to provide increased assistance to the Australian production of 12-gauge shotguns. The new rates are 15 per cent. British preferential tariff and 25 per cent, most favoured nation for guns having a value of Â£32 or less. Above that value, the British preferential rate is reduced gradually to "" free "" and the most favoured nation rate becomes Â£8 each or 7 i per cent, whichever is the higher. Following the completion of the international negotiations,, the most favoured nation rate of duty on light weight woollen piece goods was raised , to 45 per cent, ad valorem to conform to the level of protection recommended by the Tariff Board in its last report on this industry. A reduction of 5 per cent, in the most favoured nation duties on motor scooters and non-electric typewriters was also made as a result of the negotiations to which I have referred. Canada Preference Proposals No. 3 are complementary to Customs Tariff Proposals No. 30 and ensure that the preferential margin for non-electric typewriters of Canadian origin will be continued.

92,Mr Bury (Wentworth,"Minister for1964. Second Reading. Debate resumed from l l t h November 1964 (vide page 2792), on motion by Sir Robert MenziesThat the Bill be now read a second time. The Opposition welcomes this Bill, which extends practical aid to two Commonwealth countries, India and Pakistan, and promotes harmony and accord between them. The Australian Labour Party has repeatedly emphasised the importance of measures of this nature. At the last general election the Labour Party put forward a policy to provide for 1 per cent, of our national income to be devoted towards helping underdeveloped countries and promoting their welfare. If1 per cent, of our national income were devoted to this purpose it would yield about Â£80 million compared with the sum of Â£45 million lhat is now being spent in Papua and New Guinea and under-developed countries through various agencies and organisations. The ratification of the Indus Basin Development Fund Supplemental Agreement provides for an increased contribution to the valuable Indus Basin project. The Indus Basin Development Fund Agreement Act of 1960 authorised the payment by Australia of Â£6,965,000 to the fund. This Bill seeks the approval of the Parliament to the making of a further grant of Â£4,669,643. Australia's total contribution to this splendid undertaking will then be about Â£11,635,000. This amount will be paid in instalments between now and 1970. Australia's payments under this Bill will be in similar proportion to those made previously. It is interesting to compare Australia's proposed contribution of Â£4,669,643 under treaty in the first place took a considerable this Bill with amounts contributed by other amount of time. It was a happy day not countries. 16,810,794 dollars. Germany has contribut also for the whole of mankind when buted 80,400,000 deutsche marks. New the leaders of India and Pakistan came Zealand has contributed Â£503,434 sterling together for the purpose of signing this and the United Kingdom has contributed agreement. Those two countries had worked Â£13,978,571 sterling. The United States of patiently from 1947 onwards for the purAmerica will provide 118,590,000 dollars pose of reaching agreement. We know of by way of grant and 51,220,000 dollars by the work of Mr Eugene Black, whose way of loan. The International Bank for initiative and friendly advice made a subReconstruction and Development will make stantial contribution to the ultimate outa loan of 58,540,000 American dollars. It will be seen from this that Australia is playing a part as an active partner in the expansion of the resources of India and Pakistan and in providing for the harmony and well-being of their peoples. The total contribution for the overall scheme has risen from Â£357 million to Â£380 million. When Australia's role as a developing country is considered our effort is, I believe, a very creditable one indeed. Many people in our country, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, are quite restless because we are not doing more at home. They rightly point out that we have no major water project in course of construction north of the 26th parallel. There is emphasis also on the fact that we should be doing more in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. I subscribe to the view that we should be doing more at home, but I also welcome this legislation which enables Australia, although itself a developing nation, to play a part as a partner with India, Pakistan and other nations in giving effect to a grand humanitarian concept based on the needs of the people of the sub-continent. Some idea of this major project might be gleaned from the fact that the average flow of the six rivers which form the Indus Basin system is more than twice that of the Nile, three times that of the Tigris and Euphrates combined, and almost ten times that of the Colorado River in the United States of America. The division of rhe waters of the Indus system between India and Pakistan seems to have met with fairly general approval in those countries and helped to foster a feeling of friendship and goodwill so urgently needed in that part of the world. It is good that we can play a part in helping people less fortunate than ourselves. The negotiations that brought about the Canada has contributed only for the people of India and Pakistan come.

Both countries will co-operate to the fullest extent to further the development of the rivers. This is a very fine concept and it deserves the praise of the people of those countries and the good wishes of this nation and other nations participating in the scheme. The agreement also provides for a perpeace, contentment and good will to all of manent Indus Commission, consisting of one those people who sorely need assistance. representative of each government, with a general responsibility to carry out the treaty and reconcile points of disagreement.

We should be proud of our contribution towards this scheme. It will certainly not affect very greatly the national budget. We will not suffer because of it. I hope that this measure, which was introduced by a statement of a few words from the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) merely seeking authorisation of continuance of our co-operation, with an increased payment to the fund, will have a speedy passage through the Parliament and that by our actions, in co-operation with Commonwealth and other participating nations we shall give a form of leadership which will be followed throughout the world, bringing happiness, is nothing in what the honourable member is now aware-whe n I The second point I raise is that one of the things that strike one forcibly when",42,Indus Basin Development Fund Supplemental Agreement Bill
94,Mr Kelly (Wakefield) [5.23],"Ther evisiting the locality is the soil erosion proeven though it entailed some sacrifice. blem with which the project will be faced. Having been brought up, so to speak, in a soil conservation field in my own State, this problem worries me perhaps even more than the capital cost of the water stored. There will be a tremendous risk of siltation. The third thing that should be mentioned -w e have to face up to all these difficulties -is that 100 square miles of country will be inundated. If my figures are correct, that will involve the resettling of well over 50,000 people. So we must realise that we are playing a part in a big project, and one bristling with difficulties. To use a slang phrase, why do we pull it on? On travelling through the area, the first thing that convinces one that something has to be done is the evidence of apalling poverty. One gets used to this as one travels through the Asian countryside because poverty is always there It is an ever-present burden that has to be borne, and that is another one of the reasons why we have to do something. Then there is a particular technical problem that has to be faced. Pakistan is losing good irrigable country at the rate of 100,000 acres a year and the pressure of population on this diminishing supply of land makes some action even more urgent. But there are even more important issues between India and Pakistan at the moment than these human issues. It should be remembered that this dam, which, as I have mentioned, is the main unit in the scheme, will be in Kashmir and, as we know, Kashmir is a bone of contention between the Indians and the Pakistanis. For that reason it was even more necessary than ever that something should be done. Remember, too, that the stark necessity for this scheme springs from the partition of India and Pakistan-par tition where the boundaries cross the rivers, leaving most of the dam sites in India and most of the canals and a good deal of the irrigable land in Pakistan. Therefore, there was a stark necessity to do something and, although it may be expensive, to do it quickly. It is worth remembering, too, that the area irrigated in the Punjab by the Indus system covers 30 million acres-a n area equal to that irrigated in the United States of America, and representing about one eighth of all the irrigated land in the world. There, 40 million people live. Therefore, as I say, it was necessary to do something Desperate efforts were needed, particularly because of the lack of engineering data, lack of stream gauging information, and so on, in the past. Above all, it was necessary to do something because of the ill feeling that existed between India and Pakistan, inflamed by the difficulties those countries were having over Kashmir. In the light of all these facts, it was not an easy exercise for the International Bank. 1 have no real criticism to offer because, looking back over the literature, it became obvious that the decision to build the dam and the estimates of the cost of construction of the various works were made under a cloud of great political uncertainly and under the handicap of absence of adequate technical knowledge. Because of the great need, and as a result of the leadership shown by the International Bank, the Governments of Australia, Canada, West Germany, New Zealand, Pakistan, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, and India came together in a consortium, as it were, to help fill the need. So far as I can see, it was originally estimated that the total cost would be about 814 million dollars. Australia's share of this was originally expected to be 15.6 million dollars and it is well to realise that this works out at about four per cent, of the original amount of foreign currency that was to be contributed. So, Australia is making a considerable contribution and these things should be put into focus. America's contribution was fixed at 482 million dollars compared with our 15.6 million dollars. This is another example, if another is needed, of the generosity of American support in this kind of project. Because of the grave technical and political difficulties I have mentioned, it became obvious that the scheme was going to cost a lot more than was estimated originally. Therefore, it had to be recosted, and Australia's contribution has been increased from Â£6.9 million to Â£11.6 million, an increase of 67 per cent. I do not complain about that. I merely want the House to be aware of what is happening. I will admit that when one visits the scheme, although one's imagination is stirred by the immensity of the concept, one cannot help but feel concerned that there may be a little too much of the cost-plus system involved, but that is always one of the difficulties which go with large scale international aid projects, and the position has to be faced with particular urgency in this case because of the urgency of the need. As I have said we are proud-certainl y I am-to be able to support a scheme which, in its concept, and, I certainly hope, in its final execution, will play a part in achieving something in which we all believe. I was glad to hear the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Luchetti) speak as he did for we are continually hearing about the population explosion. We all know that it is easy to talk about the need for this kind of thing; we now have an opportunity to play our proper part in helping to do something about filling the need and helping these people. It is only proper that we should realise the significance of what we are doing, and, for that reason, I am very glad to support the Bill. measure has the full support of this Parliament, and in my opinion, rightly so. The project is magnificent in concept from any point of view and only the most selfish of people would criticise the expenditure of the proposed sum of money on a project so far away from Australia. Between the years 1960 and 1970, a total of 1,210 million dollars will be spent on this scheme in the Indus River Basin. That is the equivalent of approximately Â£A540 million. As the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Luchetti) has said, the contribution that Australia has made already is nearly Â£7 million. Our share of the originally planned cost of 895 million dollars was 15.6 million dollars, but as the scheme has progressed it has been found that there is not enough money to finish the work. A scheme of this magnitude, with its purpose and goal, must befinished.It will not serve its true purpose unless it isfinished.That is why the World Bank and the Government of Pakistan have gone into the matter together and decided to add to the original cost another 315 million dollars. Of this extra amount Australia will be required to find Â£A4,669,643 making Australia's total contribution to the scheme Â£A11,635,000. Of this amount Â£A3,270,000 has been paid so far, and the rest has to be paid in instalhave tackled things that they had never ments by 1970. In introducing this Bill the i rime J Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) saidThe Australian Government was glad to participate in this enterprise which means so much to the welfare of the peoples of Pakistan and India and benefits political relations between these two countries. The Labour Party says "" Amen"" to that. The honourable member for Macquarie, in presenting the Opposition's supporting case, outlined the details of the scheme very well. I wish to make some general observations in support of the case he put forward. This is one of the world's greatest efforts in international co-operation to help two countries in political and economic trouble. It is one of the world's finest stories of the strong helping the weak and the rich helping the impoverished. the Aswan dam. suggests that through the World Bank the Western countries should have helped the construction of the Aswan Dam on the River Nile. When the West refused to assist Egypt in developing that enormous irrigation project, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics stepped in and did so. That is a story that will go down in history to illustrate weak statesmanship and weak leadership at a time when so much could have been achieved at a relatively small cost compared with the overall figure. I am glad to have the interjection of my honourable friend. The Indus scheme is one of the best modern illustrations of what a common urgent need can do to heal the wounds of bitterness between two countries. India and Pakistan realised that their survival depended to a great extent on the development of the Indus and its tributaries for the benefit of both countries. Out of a tremendous need to survive the two neighbours decided to end a long and ugly conflict, with the tremendous assistance of the countries mentioned by the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Kelly). I repeat that this is one of the greatest stories in history. We have become so used to stories of this kind since the war that we may be a bit blase about them. It is interesting to note that since World War II the nations previously thought of tackling in the whole",43,Indus Basin Development Fund Supplemental Agreement Bill

97,Mr Duthie,"My friend from Hunter,history of civilisation. The United Nations makes the concept of the League of Nations that existed pre-war appear very puny indeed. The United Nations has pushed its frontiers into every nation and has established tremendous agencies to assist backward countries in the field of health, agriculture and research. One could enumerate at least two dozen ways in which the United Nations has pushed the frontiers of humanity throughout the world. The Indus project is one of the greatest examples of communal, international help. The gigantic scheme will irrigate thousands of acres of parched land. As we know, water is basic to the survival of mankind. It is more important than electric power or any other amenity that honourable members like to name. Without water there can be no life. I am thinking of another canal not so far away from the Indus Basin which runs for more than 100 miles adjacent to the present Suez Canal. As far as I can work out, this fresh water canal was built by the Pharaohs long before the Suez Canal was ever thought of. The Suez Canal, another great project, runs parallel with this the erosion problem by diverting water into old canal of the Egyptians for many miles between Suez and Port Said. Back in those early times, irrigation was thought of and irrigation projects carried out. That canal still exists as a monument to the statesmanship of the Pharaohs and their desire to bring water to the parched land. It is still irrigating the desert from the River Nile. The work that is being done in the Indus Basin will last probably for a thousand years. We are not doing something that will peter out in two years or five years. This tremendous project will help generations during the next thousand years. Money spent on diverting rivers into deserts, on building dams for irrigation purposes and on the construction of canals to divert water to parched lands should, in my opinion, have a top priority in all countries. Such expenditure should be considered as one of the best sorts of expenditure that any nation can incur. We in this House know that many more millions of pounds should be spent on a task such as this in Australia, which is one of the driest parts of the world. If only we could carry out the Bradfield scheme for the inland. I hope that some day that scheme will become a reality. We have to think of the necessity to take water from the coast into the inland. We have only just scratched the surface of this problem. Some honourable members have been talking for years about the Burdekin scheme in Queensland. This Government has been in office for 16 years. Its supporters have done most of the talking but still the scheme is not implemented. If we can spend all this money-the total we will spend is more than Â£114 million in ten years-o n the Pakistan-India project, we should wake up to the necessity for irrigation projects in this country. This measure pinpoints the urgent need to carry out the same kind of work in Australia by changing the courses of rivers to help our inland areas. Mr Arthur Hatfield has told us in ""Australia Unlimited"" that about two million acres of Australia is turning into desert every year. Great sheep stations that once had 100,000 sheep on them now have 40,000. This wastage is going on inexorably. Sand is encroaching on our good soil and if this encroachment is allowed to continue we will not have much of our coastal strip to live on in the next 20 or 30 years. It is about time we did something to overcome our desert inland. The Snowy Mountains scheme is one of our greatest concepts having been designed for that purpose. Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask for leave to continue my remarks at a later stage. Leave granted; debate adjourned. Sitting suspended from 5.45 to 8 p.m. FUND SUPPLEMENTAL Second Reading. Debate resumed. think every Australian, not only members of this Parliament, would be happy to support this Bill, which relates to a splendid example of co-operation by industrially advanced nations in a project designed to assist the less fortunately situated peoples of Pakistan and India. A tremendous programme is being put into operation in those countries. It is a worthwhile programme. In considering the history of the project with which this Bill is concerned, one must refer to the situation that arose in 1947 when partition brought in its wake the",45,Indus Basin Development Fund Supplemental Agreement Bill
98,Mr Hallett (Canning) [8.0],"I.migration of millions of people from one part of the area to the other. This gave rise to tremendous problems, which will be with the people of India and Pakistan for many years to come. Many of the refugees who moved from India to Pakistan and vice versa were farmers who required land and associated resources to enable theni to continue with the work they had been doing. If we look at India, for instance, we find that wheat production there is not keeping pace with the population increase. Of course, this situation applies in other countries too -chea p power will be provided to many One of the main aspeots of the Indus Basin development project is that of water conservation and irrigation. Irrigation is not new to that part of the world, or to the world generally, having been used satisfactorily for some 2,000 years. Irrigation, however, does play a big part in developing land and in increasing food production. Coupled with irrigation is hydro-electric power. These are the foundations on which primary and secondary industries are built. These two factors are being combined in the project for harnessing the water of the Indus and its tributaries. This is a project which is being developed today although it will take some years to complete. Looking ahead, we see that all nations must continue to harness their natural resources if they are to employ their people and feed them.

The Mangla dam reservoir will submerge some 65,000 acres of terrain and will displace 81,000 people. It will be a tremendous task to find new homes and other employment for these people. However, as we look at this development, we realise that it is the start to an expansion of agriculture, which is so important if these people are to be fed. It is extremely important that they use every drop of water available. In the industrial world hydro-electric power is essential. In the years ahead-indee d for hundreds of years parts of this area. I believe that Australia and the other nations of the world must not leave the project at this point but must continue to assist these countries to develop their industrial potential so as to enable them to advance. They cannot advance alone, nor can they do so if other countries of the world place barriers in their way. At present they have some factories. Their peoples have great ability in certain respects, and they must be encouraged to expand their industries. They have the raw materials, the steel and the other wherewithal to expand, but they must be taught how to develop. The peoples of these countries are not well educated. About 80 per cent, of them are illiterate. If they are to advance, they must be educated.

This country now joins the ranks of countries which are preparing to spend money from their Consolidated Revenue on tbe development of other countries. In this case Pakistan and india are to share in the expenditure of Â£A.540 million on the Indus Basin development. The remarks tonight of the honourable member for Canning( Mr Hallett), who comes from Western Australiaa very big State which needs millions, of gallons of water to make it an even better Statewere very wise and well timed.

I feel that this Parliament probably would have the suport of 85 per cent, of the Australian people in an expenditure of this nature. This is a 10 year project on which Â£540 million is to be spent by four or five countries. Spread over that lengthy period it does not mean that we will spend very much each year from our revenue to meet our part of the cost. It is not as if we have to find the whole Â£11 million in one year. It is spread over a period of 10 years. I feel that from every point of view this expenditure is justified. It is justified on humanitarian grounds alone. We are trying to help two countries to meet a human problem-thei r population problem and the problem of feeding their people. It is justified on the economic level because we are trying to strengthen the economies of these two countries. It is justified on the ground of increasing the quantity and variety of production. It is justified also on the international level in creating goodwill between Australia and these two countries. After all, as the honourable member for Canning said, if we can use trade to build bridges between nations we should do so as fast and as well as we possibly can. This is one way in which we can help to build a bridge between Australia and Pakistan and India. We may need those countries desperately within the next 50 years. This type of help may never be forgotten by them, just as the gift of wheat to India, granted by this Government a few weeks ago, may never be a tributary to the Colombo Plan. It is not a forgotten. That gift of wheat was long overdue.

Now Australia has come in from Australia. at this late hour and has made a very wise and a very commendable decision in making this gift of wheat to India. These are things which help to avoid wars. If you can spend Â£10 million on schemes like the one we are speaking of tonight, and by gifts of wheat to India, it will save spending Â£100 million in a war. This is the greatest investment against war that you can have. We spent millions of pounds in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea in spreading Christianity among the peoples of that Territory from 1870 onwards. That investment was the greatest we could ever have made there because when the Japanese invaded that Territory those peoples stood by Australia. They could have been won over by the Japanese if they had not been introduced to our own way of life through the missionary movements of the various churches and the education they received from church schools. As it was they helped to stop the Japanese. Investment in this sort of work for 70 years returned a dividend which probably saved Australia. These are the things which a bill of this nature brings to mind. It is not just a matter of a gift of money. It is a matter of what can go with it and what can result from it in the years ahead. SoI repeat that this expenditure is justified from every point of view that you can think of, particularly in the sense that we are creating a climate between Australia and South East Asia, as it were, that could save us from a war in the not too distant future. I feel that this scheme is something like part of the Colombo Plan under which nations are pouring money into South East around. money around.

104,Mr Freeth (Forrest,"Minister for the amendments are fully effective they willI do not propose to examine the details of the Bill in this speech, but there are a few points which may not immediately be clear and to which I would like to refer. The date of coming into operation of the Bill is provided for in clause 2 which lays down that the amendments will come into operation when the amendments of the Convention come into force. This will be when two-thirds of the subscribing powers to the original Convention signify their acceptance of the amendments. To date approximately 13 countries have accepted and the necessary two-thirds in number requires acceptance from 20 countries. It is necessary to postpone the operation of the Act in this way because the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth is exercised pursuant to its external affairs power and therefore should not be exercised until the Convention becomes binding on Australia. Certain definitions are amended in clause 3 of the Bill. For example, the definitions of "" the sea "" and "" prohibited part of the sea"" constitute a more convenient means of laying down that the prohibited areas under the Act are those laid down in the Convention. In the original Act the prohibited areas were defined in the Third and Fourth Schedules, but they became unnecessary under the method now followed and are being repealed. Clause4 repeals section 6 of the original Act. That section specified the ships to which the Act applied, but since the term ""Australian ship"" is introduced in the amendments and defined under clause 3, section 6 of the original Act becomes redundant. Clause4 also repeals and replaces section 7 of the original Act which The report that I have just presented relates is the main operative section of the Act. to the visit of the delegation from the ComThis section, which will become section 6, monwealth of Australia to the Tenth Comsets out the prohibitions in respect of the monwealth Parliamentary Conference which discharge of oil and the like which must be was held in Kingston, Jamaica, last Novemembodied in the Act in order to give effect ber.

It will certain extenuating circumstances which are be available to all honourable members set out in sub-sections, it will be an offence within the next few days. Some honourable for an Australian ship to discharge oil or an members may have received copies of it oily mixture into a prohibited part of the sea already. It is particularly fitting that this or, in respect of an Australian ship of debate should take place while we have 20,000 tons gross or more, into any part with us in Canberra and, in fact, in the of the sea if the contract for building the precincts of the House a distinguished visiship was entered into after the date of tor, namely the Honourable Blair Tennent, commencement of the amending Act. The the Chairman of the General Council of prohibited zones laid down under the Conthe Commonwealth Parliamentary Assovention generally include all the sea within ciation for 1965. 50 miles of land. The Australian zone, however, extends for 150 miles from land except off the north and north-west coasts where the 50 mile limit applies. The penalty will remain at Â£1,000 for a breach of the section. Section8 of the original Act is repealed and a revised section is also inserted in its stead as section 7. This arises not from the amendments agreed to in the 1962 Convention but from the difficulty of applying the term contained in section 8; namely, "" country to which this Convention applies "". Certain countries have accepted the Convention with reservations and the new section 7 is designed to overcome this problem. The remaining amendments are generally of a consequential or administrative nature. I hope that honourable members opposite are as anxious as is the Government to do everything practicable to overcome the problem of oil pollution and that the Bill will therefore receive the full support of the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Beazley) adjourned. Air) [8.38] I present the following paperCommonwealth Parliamentary Association-Tenth Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference, Kingston, Jamaica, November 1964-Report of Delegation from Commonwealth of Australia Branchand move That the House take note of the paper.",51,Pollution Of The Sea By Oil
105,Mr Howson (Fawkner,"Minister forThis is the first time that a report on the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association conference has been presented to this House. The fact that this House wishes to formally consider this report and to debate the recommendations is, I believe, significant. Honourable members will realise that at this conference there were two or three matters which arose which to my mind could be of profound significance to the whole future not only of the Association but also to the whole of the Commonwealth of Nations. I believe that this similar pattern will grow in importance at future conferences. It is important therefore that this House should consider the issues that arose at the conference in Jamaica and should give thought to the views that should be expressed at future conferences by members of this House when these and similar matters again arise for discussion. Members will note from the report that a critical situation arose in relation to the prereason amongst others, the delegation puts sence of delegates from Southern Rhodesia. There is no doubt that this situation could have involved a walk-out of some of the branch delegates. If this had happensd, I believe that there would have been a deep split in the Association. This split would have deepened in the Association and would have then endangered the future relations of the whole Commonwealth of Nations. I think, however, that it is significant also, as honourable members will see from the report, that at the moment when the situation reached its crisis in the General Council, there was a realisation by all delegates that the future of the Association was of even greater importance than the issues arising from the situation in Southern Rhodesia. I believe that this augurs well for the future of the Association. The Commonwealth of Nations may have reason to be confident that future crises will be surmounted in as successful a manner as that in which this matter was solved at Kingston. All of us felt that the successful conclusion of this debate was aided to a great extent by the wisdom of last year's Chairman of the Association, the Honourable Donald Sangster, Deputy Prime Minister of Jamaica. It is quite clear to me that the issue of race relations will continue to be debated at future conferences. There was some evidence that our own views on these matters were not well understood in some parts of Africa. I quote an extract from a speech by Dr. K. D. Konoso, a delegate from the new nation of Zambia, which will be found at page 238 of the report of the proceedings. He saidI want to request the Australian delegates to deliver my humble message to their Government requesting that that Government do away with its white Australia policy and allow races other than white to migrate to Australia. Racial segregation fosters only racial friction and racial friction promotes disaster and war. Maybe there is a difference between the Australian white immigration policy and the policy of Southern Rhodesia and Africa. Perhaps the Australian delegation could enlighten me on this point because 1 do not see much difference. This comment, fortunately, was an isolated instance at this conference, but I do think that it demonstrates the fact that delegates of the newer nations of Africa had little knowledge of the true situation that exists in this Commonwealth of Australia. For this forward among its conclusions which will be found on page 25 of the report proposals for increasing the opportunities for interparliamentary visits. Honourable members will remember that these proposals were referred to at the Prime Ministers' Conference in London in June of last year. This matter was again debated in November at Kingston. There seems to be an increasing acceptance by all branches of the Association of the need for an increase in these visits between members of the various parts of the Commonwealth, since the end of the conference. There has been news also that other nations of the Commonwealth-Tanzani a and Zambiahave taken note also of the proposals that the Australian branch put up at the conference and have felt that they would like to increase the visits made by their delegates to other parts of the Commonwealth. I think there is a realisation now of the importance of these inter-parliamentary visits and a move possibly will take place to increase them, I hope, in the coming 12 months. Honourable members will note the other conclusions and recommendations contained at the end of this report. The majority of these conclusions relate to ways in which the organisation of the conference itself can be improved so that greater value will come from the debates. Another important recommendation concerns the relationship between the annual conference of Commonwealth Prime Ministers and the annual conference of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. There is a growing realisation that there should be greater co-ordination between these two conferences and that this co-ordination could well be achieved through the work of the proposed secretariat. It is hoped that further steps in this direction can be taken during the coming year. Finally, I should like to refer to the most encouraging part of the conference. This concerned the attitude which was taken by delegates at the conference to the stirring appeal made by the Leader of the Malaysian delegation for assistance in meeting Indonesian confrontation. Quite rightly in my mind, the Malaysian delegate stated that this issue was a test case for the Commonwealth. If the Commonwealth meant anything at all, it surely meant that other members of the family should give support when one of its members is the victim of unprovoked aggression. It was quite apparent from the speeches made by delegates from other countries that they were anxious to record their support for Malaysia in her hour of need. Mr Deputy Speaker, the Commonwealth to the great assistance that we received from Parliamentary Association has grown rapidly the secretary to the delegation who is also over the past 10 years. It now comprises the Clerk of this House. 93 separate branches. At the annual conference, the numbers grow. This year, there were 122 delegates at Jamaica. The numbers very happy to associate myself with the are likely to be increased at the conference motion moved by the Minister for Air( Mr to be held in Wellington, New Zealand, later Howson), who was the leader of the Austhis year. Not only does the size of the tralian delegation to the Commonwealth Association grow, but also the seriousness Parliamentary Association conference in of the matters debated at the conference Jamaica. I would be less than generous, and also deepens. In my mind, therefore, it is it would be contrary to my make-up, if I important that this House should consider did not pay a tribute to the leadership of these matters earnestly. I am glad that this the Minister at that conference. He was House is receiving this report today. I trust personally a delightful man to associate with that the debate which follows will be of and he was hospitable in the extreme. He value to the delegates who will be selected made the job of acting as delegate to the by this branch as our representatives to the conference quite a pleasant one. Although forthcoming conference in Wellington. We all know the importance that we attach tralian leader came to the fore and I to the deliberations of the annual meetings believe we were all very happy to be assoof the United Nations. I want to emphasize ciated with him and to enjoy his leaderthe fact that many of the important issues ship. The Minister has given a factual report debated at the United Nations are also of what took place at the conference. It raised at the annual conference of the Comwas quite an experience for me to be in monwealth Parliamentary Association. But, at the C.P.A., we have the benefit of being able to debate these matters in a more intimate atmosphere. We have the inestimable benefit that we are all able to speak the same language. We are able, therefore, to understand each other's point of view much more rapidly than delegates do at other world-wide gatherings. I believe that these annual conferences can be made to play a much more vital part in finding solutions to world tensions than has been realised possibly by many of us during the past few years. This is certainly the message that I would like to convey to the House on my return to Jamaica. In particular, I believe that we should endeavour to get amongst us all a greater knowledge of our colleagues in the newly emerging nations in Africa and that we should try to give them also the opportunity to get to know Australia. Mr Deputy Speaker, I have much pleasure in presenting this report. I should like to thank all the delegates who were with me in Jamaica for the assistance that they gave me during the conference. This includes not only you, Sir, and the other delegates from this Parliament, but also those delegates from the State Governments of this Commonwealth of Australia. I think we would all like to pay a special tribute he met with severe competition on the part of the Jamaican Government our Aus-",52,Commonwealth Parliamentary Association
106,Mr Coutts (Griffith) [8.50],"I amattendance at this conference in Jamaica and to associate with so many people from other parts of the world. I think there were, as the Minister has said, 93 units of the Commonwealth of Nations represented at the conference. There were representatives from all parts of the world in various kinds of dress and of different colours. I want to make one observation. There is a tendency in Australia to continue to use a phrase that is completely outmoded, to refer to the organisation in question as the British Commonwealth. Nothing could be further from a true description than the use of this designation in referring to the organisation. The Commonwealth of Nations is not British. Many of the members of it, the majority I would say, resent being called British. These are nations which have emerged from colonial rule and which, in many cases, have bitter memories of colonial rule. They are trying to throw off the yoke and they regard themselves as being completely nationalistic and independent. It was an honour to sit in at the discusissues, and I believe that real cracks are sions and hear various issues raised. One of the important issues, in the discussion of which quite a number of delegates took part, concerned trade and aid. The ""have not"" nations were asking for more aid from the nations that have the wealth and the industrial capacity and who are members of the Commonwealth of Nations, principally the United Kingdom and Canada. Australia is one of those countries that are in between. It is a country that is partially the Commonwealth are displaying a tenindustrially developed and a country that is developing and needs more and more assistance. But I am naturally a pessimistic individual and I always look for a situation that could be worse than that which exists today. While there are many honourable members who feel that the Commonwealth is a grand organisation which is going from strength to strength, I believe that there are dangers in the situation at the present time. There is much evidence of cracks developing in the Commonwealth of Nations. I was fortunate enough to be invited, on the way to Jamaica, to visit three of the Commonwealth countries on the African continent. I also visited the Republic of South Africa. My visits to those places, particularly Rhodesia, Tanganyika and Zanzibar as they then were-the y have now joined to form Tanzania-and Kenya, left me with misgivings as to the future. 1 believe that Africa is a continent which will present great world problems within the very near future. Racialism is an issue that is very much to the forefront of problems of that continent. WhilstI make this observation only in passing, and I would not intentionally commit any breach of the Standing Orders, I would say that in South Africa itself there are great problems which have caused resentment throughout the African continent. I was in Rhodesia at a time when a very bitter election was being fought. Grave concern was felt and there was fighting in rhe streets. A very real problem has arisen in that country. It was a white-dominated country in which the Africans were enormously in the majority in numbers but in a hopeless minority as regards democratic and voting rights. Yet as we went further north to Tanzania and Kenya we found the reverse position. There is a growing tendency, as I said earlier, for racialism to assert itself and to overshadow all other developing in the Commonwealth structure in Africa, where there is a grave threat to the Commonwealth and to the peace of the world. Trade is perhaps the most important ingredient in binding the units of the Commonwealth today, and I believe that trade between Commonwealth countries is tending to break up. Various member nations of dency to trade with countries that are not members of the Commonwealth of Nations. The countries of the West Indies are looking more and more to the United States of America. Jamaica has recently gained independence from the United Kingdom, although it remains a member of the Commonwealth and still recognises the Queen as the head of the Jamaican Government. Jamaica is looking more and more to the United States. The economy of that country is dependent for the most part on the aluminium industry, which is wedded completely to the United States. Jamaica is, of course, a great producer of sugar and rum. The rum is exported to the United States. Other spirits, for example gin, are exported to Canada. I cannot speak of the quality of the gin that is produced in Jamaica. Jamaica is facing a migration problem, with which the United Kingdom is also vitally concerned. The problem facing the I am indebted to the Treasurer ( Mr Harold United Kingdom in this respect is that counHolt) and to the Minister for Trade and Jamaica is also very concerned about the Acting Prime Minister, for making these matter. This could cause difficulties in the facilities available to me. I am very fornear future and a weakening of the ties tunate in having been able to visit Africa. between Jamaica and the United Kingdom. There are real problems in Africa. We tend Canada, I feel, is torn by troubles interto take our views from the reports in the nally. Economically and industrially it is "" Sydney Morning Herald "", the "" Bulletin "", becoming more and more tied to the United the "" Courier Mail"" and in some cases the States, and, of course, globally it is almost extreme leftist newspapers. It is a good a part of the United States at the present thing not to be blinded by reports in these time. So, Mr Deputy Speaker, as I said papers which are of various shades of earlier, I am somewhat pessimistic about political opinion but to go and see the the future of the Commonwealth. I am not countries for ourselves. I feel better indelighted to be taking this stand, but I feel formed as a result of having gone to AfricaI must, in fairness to myself and in giving a and having seen the frightful problems that report to the members of this House who are facing the governments and the people were kind enough to send me to Jamaica, there. state things as I see them.

108,Mr Harold Holt (Higgins,"Trea Association and its significance, and perhapsand Howard d'Egville was invited to be its -honorary secretary. The necessary funds were raised and a full programme for the visitors was arranged. Tbis included luncheon in Westminster Hall, that historic shrine of parliamentary occasions and, indeed, of other great historical occasions in the long story of British parliamentary evolution. Before the visit was over a suggestion was made by the late Mr Leo Amery, M.P., that a permanent body should be formed under the name of the Empire Parliamentary Association to consist of branches in the fully self-governing dominions. Howard d'Egville was asked to be the honorary secretary of the United Kingdom branch. As early as July of that year he had drafted a constitution for the Association which was accepted and which guided the progress of the Association thereafter. I will not weary the House with all the detail of that early constitution, but it did include in its objecknighthood in the order of which he was tives the establishment of permanent machinery to provide more ready exchange of information and to facilitate closer understanding and more frequent intercourse between those engaged in the parliamentary government of the component parts of the Empire. This was in 1911. The United Kingdom branch was formed immediately and branches in the Parliaments of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Newfoundland, which was then a dominion, were formed the next year and in that of the Union of South Africa the following year, making six branches in all. Rather interestingly, having regard to the subsequent development of a multi-racial association of nations within the Commonwealth, these were associations, at that time, of branches of European race. The United Kingdom branch was active from the outset. In 1913 about 15 of its members made a tour of Canada, New Zealand, Australia and South Africa. Mr several years. It was in the 1920's that Sir Leo Amery, in his autobiography "" My Political Life"", commented that "" the detailed arrangements were handled most efficiently by our own indefatigable secretary, d'Egville"". Also, the publication of a journal on the lines of the subsequent "" Journal of the Parliaments of the Commonwealth "" was considered, and it was only the outbreak of the First World War which postponed this. The branch continued to hold its executive committee and annual general meetings throughout the war period, and in 1916 something like a conference took placea "" war visit "" it was termed-of Empire parliamentarians. Howard d'Egville took a post in the secretariat of the Imperial War Cabinet, but he managed to keep on the secretaryship of the branch. In 1918 he was awarded a CBE. for his services. In the same year he succeeded, after much persistent effort, in moving the authorities to allow the branch to have its offices in the Houses of Parliament, and it was settled in the rooms off Westminster Hall where it still remains. Sir Howard often expressed his satisfaction at having obtained from His Majesty King GeorgeV a letter of warm approval of this acquisition. Once the war was over the Association went ahead rapidly. In 1921 d'Egville, for his energy and efficiency, had conferred upon him a already a distinguished member so that he became Sir Howard d'Egville, K.B.E. In 1920 was published the first number of the "" Journal of the Parliaments of the Empire"" as it was then styled. Now it is known, of course, as the ""Journal of the Parliaments of the Commonwealth "". During the war, under the auspices of the Foreign Office, d'Egville had, on behalf of the branch, issued several pamphlets giving a review of foreign affairs. After the war ended the branch continued this practice and the result was the issue of the "" Report on Foreign Affairs"" published in the same year, at first every two months and hiier every quarter. These two publications are now in their 46th year. The first conference proper took pkice in South Africa in 1924. This was followed at two-yearly intervals by conferences in Australia and Canada. The economic depression precluded their continuation for Howard seems to have been responsible for an innovation which was to establish a principle of growth. This was ultimately to shape the present form of the Association. The original constitution laid down that the Empire Parliamentary Association should consist of branches in the Parliaments of the self-governing dominions of the Emoire. The innovation introduced was to ex'rnd membership to the legislatures of countries which were only partially independent. In 1924 a branch was formed in the Parliament of Northern Ireland. In the next year, branches were established in Southern Rhodesia and Malta, and in the following two years in the State Parliaments of Australiaa project that had long been mooted. In 1929, branches were formed in the legislatures of British India and Ceylon -vitall y important accessions to the development of the Association. Following this, came the formation of branches in the provinces of Canada and in some of the smaller colonies. Bermuda, the Bahamas, Mauritius and Jamaica all formed branches before the outbreak of the Second World War. After the war, branches were formed in several of the African and Caribbean colonies. During the 1930's, once the slump was over, the Association continued to develop. There was a visit of Empire parliamentarians on the occasion of the jubilee of King George V. Before a similar visit two years later for the coronation of King George VI, Sir Howard d'Egville had another inspiration. For many centuries of British history, it had been the custom on the New Zealand. It is perhaps of significance occasion of the crowning of a British monarch to hold the coronation banquet in Westminster Hall and, in the past, the monarch had acted as host to bring around him a body of his most senior and most distinguished citizens. This practice, however, had been discontinued since the reign of King George IV. Sir Howard conceived the idea of reviving this custom by means of a luncheon given in that same historic building to honour the new king and at which visiting parliamentarians from the Commonwealth and Empire, and other distinguished guests, would be present. This was accordingly held. At that time, the United Kingdom Branch acted as host. When Queen Elizabeth was about to come to her coronation, we discussed what might be done in a somewhat similar manner and, again, we had what I believe will be agreed was something of an inspirar tion. We considered that, rather than look to the United Kingdom to act as host on this occasion, all the Parliaments of the Commonwealth should combine. So there we were, 700 parliamentarians met together in Westminster Hall to honour for the first time in history by this parliamentary banquet a monarch coming to a coronation. It was a my great privilege to be Chairman of the Association at that time. I am sure that the House will understand me when I say that it was one of the most stirring experiences of a lifetime in public affairs not merely to have the emotional delight of being seated next to our Monarch but also to see before one 700 representatives from a total at that time of some 50 branches of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. I was interested this evening to hear from my colleague, the Minister for Air, that the Mother of Parliaments can now point to 93 branches of the Association within the Commonwealth of Nationsa really remarkable manifestation of the spread of democratic practice through so many parts of our Commonwealth. It is perhaps of some significance for us that as we discuss these matters tonight we have in the precincts, as my colleague has pointed out, the present Chairman of the General Council of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, the Hon. W. B. Tennent, whom we can perhaps classify as a fellow ANZAC, since he comes from also that seated in the gallery facing me as I speak are some of our friends from our own Territories. No doubt they will be gathering from the narrative that I am unfoldingI hope not too tediously-some thing of the story of the evolution of this great Association to which we are so proud to belong. During the Second World War, Sir Howard d'Egville went to the United States of America before the Americans entered the war. In Washington, he carried out some very valuable liaison work of a highly confidential nature. He had for some time been convinced of the importance of maintaining and improving friendly relations between the countries of the British Commonwealth and Empire, particularly the United Kingdom, on the one hand, and the United States on the other, and he conceived his particular task as doing this through the medium of their legislators. In 1943, on Sir Howard's initiative, a British-American Parliamentary Group was formed in the United Kingdom Parliament with this object, and he became its Honorary Secretary and remained so until his death. He realised that Congress was widely separated from the United States Administration, in a constitutional sen^e, and yet very powerful; hence a liaison between the two legislative bodies was highly desirable. Therefore, in 1950, he arranged with the governing body of the Association that a delegation from Congress be invited to attend the Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference in that year. This has become a regular practice and, ever since, a delegation from the United States Senate has regularly attended the Association's conferences, except on one occasion. We hope that this practice continues. After the war, the Association continued to progress, and a number of new branches were formed. The more recent history of this organisation is, I think, well known to honourable members, but, just before 1 conclude, may I add this comment: In my own Parliamentary lifetime, I have seen the transformation of the Commonwealth of Nations and conferences of Prime Ministers of the Commonwealth from a situation in which all the Prime Ministers were ab!e to meet quite comfortably in the Cabinet Room at No. 10 Downing Street. In the early years, all were of European race and had very much the same general outlook and ideas. It was not difficult for them to reach a consensus on the issues with which the Commonwealth was .concerned, particularly in the international field. now of my early years. I am coming to the point raised by the honourable gentleman. [Extension of time granted.] I thank the House for extending my time. I shall not take very much longer. However, it is perhaps well that these things should at some time be placed in the records of the Parliament for those who later may have some research interest in the development of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. The number of us who have any recollection of these events is diminishing. My friend, the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley), raised a point about Indian participation. One of the significant revolutionary stages was reached when, in 1948, India, Pakistan and Ceylon were admitted to the Association. Although the earlier character of the Commonwealth seemed to continue for some years, we were then moving towards the stage, which has now become so manifest to us, of a multiracial association of peoples. I was vividly reminded of this at two recent gatherings. At the last Prime Ministers' Conference, there were at the table 18 representatives, I think, of self governing Dominions of the Commonwealth. Only four were of European race. I had a similar experience at the conference of Commonwealth Finance Ministers in Kuala Lumpur last year. This is much more than a minority participation by representatives of European race with those from Africa and Asia. It is not merely a matter of racial difference. There are some tremendous differences in outlook and in objectives which, unless they are handled with skill, understanding and tolerance and a recognition of the interests and viewpoints of others, could lead to the early destruction of the Commonwealth. That to me would be one of the great disasters not only of a lifetime but of world history. I am convinced that we in this Commonwealth of Nations embody the noblest objectives and the highest ideals and aspirations of mankind. If we can demonstrate to the rest of the world that peoples of many races, differing so markedly in tradition, habit and appearance and in all the characteristics that separate one human being from another, can combine in a democratic spirit with common objectives, in the main inspired by the principles of democracy as they are enshrined in the parliamentary institution, and can work co-operatively together for the growing prosperity of the world and the strengthening of the prospects of peace, we will have made the greatest contribution to the world that we could in our lifetimes. I believe that this is quite a fragile plant at present. There is a disposition-a n understandable disposition-for some of the newly emerged nations in the Commonwealth from Africa and Asia to think rather of an Afro-Asian alliance than of their membership of the Commonwealth. I believe that, given time, they will discover a greater value in their membership of the Commonwealth family than in the sort of factional politics that exist in the AfroAsian alliance, which after all is divisive and at worse would be destructive of much of what we hope to achieve in the world. Whereas an alignment of the one kind is divisive and destructive, an association of",57,Commonwealth Parliamentary Association

111,Mr Beazley (Fremantle) [9.35],"The One of the problems in certain areas of theand, in the moral condition of the Commonwealth, to end corruption, oppression, race division and bitterness? I do not mean by denunciation of one another in these matters; I mean by a transformation of values-suc h a transformation of values as that which turned the corrupt British Parliament of the 18th century into the clean Parliament of the era of Gladstone and Disraeli. As the structure of the Commonwealth of Nations has become more and more elusive to describe because the removal of even the common Crown has made it constitutionally formless, the opportunities of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association have increased. As a conference of Commonwealth Parliamentarians it is becoming one of the most substantial links that there is in the Commonwealth. Potentially it can help foster ideas such as the rule of law, clean elections, constructive opposition and parlimentary authority. These things are vital in producing a sane world. Some very great experiments are taking place in the Commonwealth. Africa, with independence coming in country after country over the last five years, is the venue for what is probably the greatest experiment in human freedom. The African nations have massive unemployment problems-Nigeria, for instance, has a million people unemployed-massiv e housing problems, grave problems of nutrition-especiall y kwashiorkor, the protein deficiency condition-and problems of corruption. They have come into existence in a world of ideological conflict. Recently, Dr. Hastings Banda of Malawi claimed that Communist China had offered Â£18 million sterling for recognition and that bribes of Â£10,000 a head were being offered from the same source to key politicians. Africa needs a political leadership of almost miraculous quality, one which cannot be bought, one which can maintain passion and conviction in the face of illiteracy and social inertia, one that can maintain compassion in the face of some savagery, one that can maintain associations and alliances without subservience, and on; that can swiftly absorb political lessons accumulated by others more fortunate over some centuries. This is an immense programme. When we are critical let us remember that this is an immense programme such as our race has never been called upon to face. To effect this programme, Africa needs a vast number of people imbued with a selfless passion. That is what I meant when I referred to the need for an almost miraculous quality. If the Commonwealth chooses to be an association of powers existing for purposes higher than narrow self interest, it has before it an immense task in co-operation, and in this co-operation the methods can be intelligently studied and recommended by tbe Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. The revolution of independence required courage; the revolution of independence now requires character, for in Africa, Asia and elsewhere whole States can simply fold up through sheer corruption. A revolutionary passion to achieve independence was comparatively easy to come by; a revolutionary passion to build nationhood, to cure corruption and to make national character a priority is something else again. It is far harder to transform the values of a community than to change its constitution -harder , but more necessary. In the United Kingdom, when Wilberforce and others transformed values they also transformed the constitution. But the past plagues Africa and Asia. Mr Shastri, the Prime Minister of India, said on taking office: "" I do not have a clean slate on which to write "". I would add that none of the new States of Africa has a clean slate on which to write. They have legacies of savagery and some have legacies of slavery, but all have a state of under-development with which to contend-poverty , illiteracy, immense social need and. again, corruption. When Rajmohan Gandhi, the grandson of the Mahatma, started a moral rearmament campaign in India on the subject of corruption, on the sadism which leaves people to die in the streets and on the indifference which causes farmers in some of the best areas to farm only for their own subsistence, growing only one crop where they could grow three or four in the year, he was attacking the inertia underlying many of India's problems. These problems are, of course, not unique to India, and neither is moral inertia, but this is absolutely essential work. The Finance Minister of India says that 60 per cent, of income tax and 80 per cent, of sales tax remains unpaid. The railways lose because of multitudes travelling without paying fares. The Indian Parliament recently had before it . a report of one of its committees which described corruption in India as galloping. The report saidThe erosion of moral values and the utter disregard of ethical standards have caused the tentacles of corruption to envelop the entire life of the nation. Moral values have slumped to the bottom. Truth and honesty have become .things of the past. The common man has lost faith in the Government. Unless honesty at all government levels is ensured, the country's social strucrelation to future warture will crumble, bringing in its wake chaos and anarchy. This report was adopted by the Indian Parliament. Actually only a revolution of national character can cure this. Education is not achieving it, for education, in many -cases, is part of the corruption. A force of youth trained by Rajmohan Gandhiyouths who have made restitution for their own corruption and live a new quality of discipline-is being listened to in the Indian villages which once responded to the discipline and passion of Mahatma Gandhi. This is the kind of appeal which can reach the Indian villager. India was attacked by China and showed the will and conviction to resist, but no mere ideological defensiveness can be India's moral strategy in Asia. Asia will choose democracy if India lives it, and Communism if India does not. Unless India can develop a quality of integrity, will, conviction, courage and compassion, in a superior idea lived out that will shake to its foundations the ideology of Communism, based on coercion, China's idea will inevitably triumph in Asia. Free men with a passion for justice and integrity, lived out, are the only real answer to disciplined men with a passion for world power based on class hate. This is the essence of Rajmohan Gandhi's campaign for a moral renaissance in India. Economic plans are absolutely vital, but they can collapse before corruption. The Commonwealth Parliamentary Association can become a moral force if it takes seriously the task of guiding member governments to go to the roots of the problems of the Commonwealth. Professor D. R. Shenoy, who is one of India's representatives on the International Monetary Fund and formerly Director of Research for the Reserve Bank of India, from his examination of India's administration came to the conclusion that corruption was running at the rate of bribes worth Â£565 million sterling a year. It is plain realism to back anything that lifts national character. It is plain realism to see that, in part, Australia's security rests on the character of other peoples or falls with their weakness. My colleague, the honourable member for Yarra (Dr. J. F. Cairns), has quoted Lieutenant-General James M. Gavin of the United States Air Force as having said, in In fact this is the most probable nature of future war, a slow, almost imperceptible transition of a bad economic social and political situation into total disorder. The moral situation, the presence or absence of corruption, is obviously the decisive ingredient in the economic, social and political situation in many Commonwealth countries. The Government has recently made a gift of Â£5 million worth of wheat to India as famine relief. This is very good, and no one can disparage or belittle the gift in any way. But we need to move past the concept of famine relief to something bigger. We need to take responsibility for assisting India and Pakistan to create such a standard of nutrition in those countries that the point would be reached where no addition to the diet of that great sub-continent would lead to any further improvement in national physique. That is an optimum diet. We should aim at that optimum diet. Every ounce of technological, agricultural, nutritional, administrative, irrigation and grain storage aid should be thrown in, working with the appropriate authorities. India, with Japan's efficiency in agriculture, could feed at higher levels of nutrition five times her present population. That is a remarkable situation, as between Japan and' India. There is the possibility of the same technological transformation in India as occurred in Japan. As I said earlier, this would mean that at the higher levels of nutrition India could feed five times her present population. Mr Attlee, now Earl Attlee, when Leader of the Opposition in the Parliament of the United Kingdom, once said something to this effect about a certain colonial leader being sent to prison by the authorities in Britain: ""Ah! The man bas gone to prison. I expect to meet him at the next Prime Ministers' conference."" This should remind us how persistently we fail to recognise the people who in their own countries represent the wave of the future. One thing the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association ought to be able to do is to give us a first hand impression of ideological That is, Africatrends. You are helped to see those trends if you maximise your power to listen to other people and if you minimise entertainment, especially liquid entertainment. Let us consider for a moment the men who have been in prison. I refer to Mahatma Gandhi of India, Pandit Nehru of India, Jomo Kenyatta of Africa, Hastings Banda of Africa, Archbishop Makarios of Cyprus and Eamon De Valera of Ireland. We in the West have disapproved of Namdi Azikiwe of Africa, Kwame Nkrumah of Africa and Gamal Abdul Nasser of Egypt. Our approval or disapproval has small effect. Let us add to these people those who have been imprisoned or opposed at some time or other by France in lndoChina, Morocco, Algeria or former French Africa-me n like Ben Bella or Sekou Toure -and we begin to ask ourselves whether in the last 50 years the West has ever seen clearly who are the people in Afro-Asian countries who represent the wave of the future. The Commonwealth Parliamentary Association meetings ought to lead to some perception of those sections of Commonwealth countries from which are emerging the ideas that will shape the future. Youth becomes a force for renaissance if it is mentally alert and physically fit and, above all, morally incorruptible. Character makes possible and actually produces the new social structure that we must have. If the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association is capable of becoming the conscience of the Commonwealth in these matters, it will have an exceedingly important function to perform. Nigeria has one million people unemployed. Can the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association rouse other Commonwealth members on this question? In India there are many unemployed, including graduates. Is there a passionate concern for hungry men which will produce new methods in agriculture, fishing and pasturage? To tackle the problems of the Commonwealth is the most immense and exciting task before us. The late Peter Howard, a journalist, playstage, our answer to that question must be a wright and director of Moral Re-armament, resounding "" Yes "". speaking on 12th November last at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire, in the United States of America, saidThe average income on rhat continentis 30 cents a day per head. There is one doctor for every 17,000 people there compared with one for every 690 in this country. In tropical Africa infant mortality is over 23 per cent, of live births, compared with under 3 per cent. here. One African in seven can read or write. Less than half African children of school age are attending primary schools. The average African farmer produces 4 per cent, of the food raised by a farmer in this country. The Commonwealth Parliamentary Association needs to be an organ of compassionate intelligence. It has opportunities to study immense needs. It should be fully financed by member governments to make it a going concern. We should take on urgently, through such advice, the training of people in the emerging countries. The Commonwealth Parliamentary Association should take on these objectives. If it does not, it will simply become a forum to express the bitterness of impoverished people-the frustration of people who believe that they are slighted by race superiority. 1 do not believe that this will happen. But a positive role for the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association will not come by chance. It will come by a clean cut decision to care and to go all out for our fellow members. me great pleasure tonight to speak about the report that was presented earlier by the Minister for Air( Mr Howson). There can be no doubt about quite a lot of what was said by the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley). What he said contained a great deal of truth. As the honourable member has said, one of the difficulties confronting us is that the problems referred to are being looked at through European eyes without our trying to place ourselves in the position occupied by the African and Asian people. We must ask ourselves whether these conferences of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association are of any value or of any importance. I believe that, if we look at the overall problem which confronts the Commonwealth and the world generally st this",61,Commonwealth Parliamentary Association
112,Mr Lucock (Lyne) [9.55],"It givesEarlier tonight the Minister for Air said that these conferences were important not only to the Commonwealth but also to other nations. That is an aspect of the matter to which we must give very serious consideration. It is my own personal belief that the contribution which the Commonwealth of Nations can make to the international scene is unlimited. As we strengthen the Commonwealth and achieve a greater understanding of our own problems and of the problems and difficulties which confront other nations within the Commonwealth, we will be able to make a vital and tremendous contribution to overcoming world problems. Much has been said by other speakers about the recent conference of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, and I do not want to cover the ground that they have covered. One of the important aspects of that conference was that the Australian representatives spoke as members of the Australian Parliaments. The Australian delegation included representatives not only of the Commonwealth Parliament but also of the State Parliaments. The delegates were members of various parties. Yet we were able to present to the conference, and to delegates during our association with them at other times, the point of view of Australia and of Australian parliamentarians. That was important. I pay a tribute to the Minister for Air for his leadership of the delegation. It was admired and respected by all members of the delegation. This Parliament can be proud of the contribution he made. I wish to refer to the contributions that were made by members of the delegation in the various debates. I refer particularly to the debate on international affairs, because a certain stand and took certain action in it was in this debate that we faced the problem caused by an attack on a member of the Commonwealth. Members of the Australian delegation who spoke in this debate referred to the support that we were giving to Malaysia and to the need for the conference to give attention to what was happening in this area. These statements were appreciated by the Malaysian delegates and I think appreciated and understood by other delegates at the conference. The Prime Ministers' Conference is important but it is a conference of Prime Ministers of Commonwealth countries who get together on what we might call the leadership level to discuss problems which concern the Commonwealth of Nations and the worldI am prepared to say, however, that our Commonwealth Parliamentary Association conference is of even greater importance. I say that with all respect and appreciation of the value of the Prime Ministers' Conference. At the conference of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, elected members of the parliaments discuss various problems affecting members of the Commonwealth of Nations. They talk these problems over together and try to understand what is happening in one country compared with what is happening in another. Because they talk about these problems, they get a greater understanding of them. The time spent together before the actual conference opens gives delegates an opportunity to understand and appreciate the country where the conference is being held. In addition, because of the association with fellow delegates socially and in studying industries and agricultural areas, more things are spoken about, understood and appreciated. Let us consider another factor in regard to these conferences of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. Many problems are discussed frankly and openly. There is no shelving of difficulties. If a serious difficulty arises it is discussed and a solution is found and that is the only way to learn about these things. Newly developed countries bring forward their problems at these conferences. We explain some of the problems that we have in Australia, perhaps some of the major factors in regard to immigration. We put forward our case and explained the reason why Australia adopted that sphere. As a result, I believe the other delegates went away from the conference with a greater understanding and appreciation of the action we had taken. That is why I support wholeheartedly the suggested regional conferences. I support the idea of a closer association and more visits to the various countries of the Commonwealth of Nations so that in this sphere there can be deeper and fuller discussion of particular matters rather than a general overall discussion of things in general. The honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Duthie), speaking in a debate earlier tonight, spoke about self-interest. He of the Press of this country in its said he believed there was a greater appreciation of the need to understand the problems of other people and the need for us to assist other countries and to look to wider us as our words would have them believe. fields beyond the domestic problems of our own towns and cities. I believe a greater understanding and appreciation of other nations flows from the conferences of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. The subjects discussed are widely varied. That brings me to the subject of the onecountries, they also had to do something to party government which is found in some countries of the Commonwealth of Nations. We cannot agree with this but I think we should try to understand and appreciate the reason behind it. To us that form of government seems strange in a parliamentary democracy. However, I think we can understand some of the reasons for it. One reason is that, at the moment, with independence having just been gained, and with the need for development, progress and stability, there is one major aim. It is surely the aim of all the people in these countries that there should be eradication of disease, advancement in education and a war against illiteracy. Therefore, there is one purpose, one dominant aim, and out of this situation there comes sometimes the thought: One party for one purpose. I believe that this is a passing phase. As there comes in these countries greater stability, greater progress and greater development, so there will follow the trend of thought which will bring about, shall I say, a return to the two-party system. While perhaps we cannot agree with the oneparty system, while it causes doubt in our own minds because we see in it some things that are wrong, I believe that we should try to understand the reasons behind the actions that have been taken. In this way we can make a contribution. I remember Sir Roy Welensky once sayOur best wishes go to the Chairman of the ing at a dinner that we have to remember Association for this year, Mr Tennent. that in our countries democracy was not We know that he, the New Zealand Branch established overnight; that we have been and the people of New Zealand will do evolving and learning from our mistakes everything possible to ensure the success of since as far back as 1215. This realisation this year's conference. The only regret I should help us to appreciate the situation had was that the Jamaican conference was of the new democracies, the newly developin November, but the Australian cricketers ing countries. In this respect I believe that arrived in the West Indies in February. perhaps we have to be a little more careful I am sure that the conference was of on our own domestic scene, in our conduct tremendous value. I hope and believe that jn this Parliament. This may be true also we, as Australian delegates, ensured that F.2518/65 -R -[4 ] criticisms. We must not give to the newly developing countries by our actions, the idea that democracy is not as valuable to Restraint will benefit us. One of the major discussions concerned trade and aid. I think we are able to put forward successfully the proposition that while we in Australia were prepared to assist some of the newly developing assist themselves. They should not merely stand and receive everything, but should take what is given and use it for further development and progress. We endeavoured to give them a sense of their responsibility, as well as an understanding of our responsibility in giving aid. Trade is of major importance in the world today, not only within our Commonwealth but in the international field. I believe that through the Commonwealth we can make a contribution to international trade in its widest and deepest forms. There were occasions in the early days of the conference before the arrival of the Minister for Air, when I was acting leader of the delegation. The Minister has given me the privilege of placing on record our sincere thanks for the hospitality and kindness shown to us by the Jamaican Branch. Sometimes the hospitality and kindness we received almost overtaxed our strength because of the lateness of the hour that we went to bed after being shown the various industries and the agricultural and rural areas in Jamaica, and because of the early hour of rising to catch buses for further tours of the island. We express our appreciation to the Jamaican Branch and to all the people of Jamaica who contributed to the success of the conference and to our enjoyment. the other delegates when they left the conmember for Lyne pointed out, one of the ference knew a little more about Australia great values of these conferences is that than they did before the conference began. they are not held at government level. desire to comment briefly on the report to the conference.

Let us come together, work together and fight together, if necessary, for the things that we believe in. So long as we work to build a better Commonwealth, I am sure success will come our way. I sincerely believe that the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association can be one of the main bloodstreams that will help the Commonwealth to face successfully the troubles that may confront it in the future. members of this House have been looking forward for a number of years to an opportunity such as has been presented to us I believe they will readily agree with my tonight for the first time.

114,Mr Cleaver (Swan) [10.25],"Some of the various countries of the world.It was my privilege to visit Transkei. One of the vivid memories of this first overseas visit of mine is of my meeting with Chief Mantazima, the Chief Minister of the Transkei, this first Bantustan area of the republic. Having talked to him 1 thought that things might be working out the way they had been planned by the republic, for without a doubt the stamp of the republic is seen on this Bantustan ideal. But the very next morning it was my privilege to meet a man by the name of Mr Knowledge Guzama, a prominent member of the Opposition in the Transkei Government. Confidently and unemotionally he said that he and his Opposition party stood for a multiracial state in the republic. I was impressed with the achievements within South Africa in the field of industry. The integration of the Bantu into industry and the transfer of thousands upon thousands of the teeming multitude from slums to a very acceptable standard of housing are amazing achievements. These were but some of my impressions of South Africa. AgainI wish I had time to expand on the impressions I gained in a seven day visit to Southern Rhodesia where every courtesy was extended to me as a visitor from this country. This contact left me with a keen appreciation of the ideals and achievements of the people in the areas that I was permitted to visit, although it was apparent that lems, particularly those of the newly their philosophy and procedure might differ radically from our own. I have mentioned the integration of the African. In the field of higher education, 1 noticed in the University of Southern Rhodesia that more had been done towards the integration of the African with the European student than many other countries are prepared to recognise. We need to be reminded, too, I believe, that Kenya, now independent, has followed her conviction about a one-party state. The Opposition has merged with the Government in that country. This is but one illustration of the lack of uniformity in this modern Commonwealth about which we are speaking tonight. Leaving the African continent it was my privilege as a delegate to go to one of the real hot spots of the Commonwealth today, British Guiana on the South American continent. My colleague and fellow delegate, the honourable member for Lyne( Mr Lucock), and myself were probably thefirstAustralian parliamentary representatives for very many years, if not the first ever, to visit British Guiana. Here again there was a keen appeciation of the fact that we representatives from one of the major member nations of the Commonwealth should be there to see for ourselves what the problems were and to view the amazing achievements in industry and in many other fields. We took away with us an understanding that as a member of this Commonwealth Guiana certainly merited our sympathy, our moral support and our practical assistance, perhaps by way of aid. After leaving British Guiana we made a quick call at Trinidad. I started by talking about the value of overseas travel, and this leads me to say to the House that we were glad of the opportunity given by this conference to present the viewpoint of the Australian branches that all member nations should do their best to contribute even more freely to the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association so that, as other speakers have said, there may be, not an increase in junkets around the world, solely for the entertainment of delegates, but an expansion of fraternal visits designed to promote a better understanding of each other's probdeveloping countries of the Commonwealth. Moving quickly to the conference itself, may I underline what may have been said by other honourable members a little earlier. It was the largest conference yet to be held by the Association. The 172 delegates, with whom we were associating, came from 36 Commonwealth countries, which are in various stages of constitutional development. We should know that by now there are 22 which have gained complete independence and there are others, up to the total of 36, at various stages of attaining independence. In addition, 38 provinces or State legislatures were represented. One had only to survey, in the meeting room at the University of Kingston, this representation of member nations to see for himself the changes about which I have already spoken this evening. I want to mention, in passing, that within the council of the Association and, again, to some extent outside the opening of the conference at the university and by references in the various debates which took place, there was a deliberate attempt to exclude Southern Rhodesia from being represented in the conference. There was a demonstration by university students. With these, of course, we are familiar the world over. But this was a demonstration supported by some of the Jamaican leaders, intimating that here assistance plan which was being extended there was a distinct disquiet about a member of the Association and a member of the Commonwealth, namely, Southern Rhodesia. This grouping of African nations, with other supporters, on a domestic issue was noted with concern, and I think it is important that we should put on record that wise leadership-as referred to by the leader of our delegation-too k this matter in hand. It was emphasised that a domestic matter of this nature, particularly when it had been the subject of discussion at a Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference, when the Africans there represented recognised this position, was a situation which had no relation to the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. Domestic issues must be left to be solved outside the Association meetings. Quite corassisting in such a variety of ways. Of rectly, it was ruled that Southern Rhodesia was entitled to her seat at the conference. But this is one of the significant trends within the Commonwealth and within the framework of the Association, which we must carefully note. I now move along to the various debates which took place during the week of the conference; the international affairs debate, selves as ready to give support, even if one dealing with Commonwealth organisations and one dealing with the future functions and roles of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. I wish to refer quickly, as other speakers have, to the importance which lay behind the debate on international affairs. May I suggest that the reaction among delegates themselves was far more important than the views expressed by journalists far removed from the scene of our conference. As Australian delegates we were pleased to give practical support to our friends from Malaysia. At the Prime Ministers' Conference in 1964, general sympathy was expressed with Malaysia due to the acts of aggression by Indonesia. At the conference in Jamaica, Malaysia, through her delegates, pointed out that words were insufficient and that she needed practical help. The Australian delegates were reinforced not only by the words of our Prime Minister when he referred to the loyalty which had always been found within the Commonwealth family, but also by the announcement by the Australian Government, just prior to our meeting in Kingston, of the new defence towards Malaysia. Our friends from Africa, where unfortunately Communist China's finance and influence are all too apparent, had been very vocal for days about the assistance required from major Commonwealth countries, emphasising again and again their problems, with which we were in agreement. I am sure that no honourable member from Australia would ever discount the problems of these nations, to which the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) referred so ably tonight. There was an appreciation of the difficulties in Africa. But what we were keen to point out was that our friends from Africa could not expect the larger countries of the Commonwealth to be constantly at their call, course, in the debate on trade and aid it was revealed that there had been practical assistance at many points, and we were able to say that, on a general level, this would be continued and, in all probability, extended. But we came to the point of saying that the African nations, because of the call from Malaysia, should, in the spirit of the Commonwealth family, declare themonly moral support, although, if possible, they should give some indication of being ready to supply the more tangible assistance required by that country. I believe that the leader of the Australian delegation and other members spoke frankly and clearly in this debate and that our friends from Malaysia appreciated this sort of frankness and the expressions of support that we were prepared to give. Time does not permit me to go further regarding Commonwealth organisations. I move to my conclusion, Mr Speaker, by saying that the history of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association is interesting but it is the future which holds for us more than a challenge. The honourable member for Griffith( Mr Coutts) referred correctly to cracks within the Commonwealth. The strains can be, and have been, considerable; we dare not minimize them. We ought to take note, I believe, that sharp disagreements on international and domestic policy have occurred. At the United Nations, when that body is in session, Commonwealth countries are not afraid to debate their differences in public. For my part, the Commonwealth represents a unique association with a tremendous potential for the peace of the world. This is a potential which we must guard jealously. I want to express the opinion that it is essential to have common sense and a keen understanding of the problems affecting member nations of the Commonwealth. I firmly believe that such understanding and common sense, together with wider travel so that we can fraternise with members from the newly emerging countries, will so stabilise the Commonwealth that we treasure that it will be permitted to contribute even more effectively than in the past to the welfare and happiness of people everywhere. Mr Speaker, that a note of optimism should be brought into this discussion of human affairs. It is easy enough to spend time considering the problems of the world and then to decide that the game is hopeless. There are, of course, tremendous tensions and difficulties in the world. The Commonwealth, although it faces the difficulHowever, we should not think of countries ties inherent in an association of completely different nations with completely different attitudes, is an organisation from which many advantages flow. Those advantages are not always apparent to the people who govern but they are very apparent to the ordinary citizen who passes from one country to another. In speaking of the Commonwealth, we are speaking of an association of some 700 million people. As one honourable member opposite said, that is about a quarter of without blackboards, and there are people the world's population. About a quarter of the earth's surface is represented by the Commonwealth. Because of the affinity that exists between its members as a result of a common history within the former British which has 26,000 employees. I saw its Empire, there is a unique opportunity to machine tool works, which are the second do something in co-operation. There is a largest in, as they say, the Western world. field of co-operation which does not exist for other nations. That is why I believe that tonight we should be examining this question in a mood of optimism. It is obvious to me from my personal experiences last year that the barriers between mankind are falling down. It is easier to travel around the world today than it was even two years ago. It is possible to drive from London to Moscow and back again with not too many inhibitions. Today many persons in the world, no matter where they are and whether they are rich or poor, will offer the hand of friendship and a helping hand to somebody when he needs it. I believe that it is the responsibility of governments and organisations such as the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association to try to capture that spirit and to express it through social organisations and governmental agencies. The Commonwealth Parliamentary Association-representin g directly about 700 million people, as it does-is a very important organ in the achievement of those ends. What are the tasks that face us? First of all, there is the fact that the Commonwealth of Nations contains some of the world's greatest skills and material resources, such as minerals. Some of the nationsAustralia, Canada and Great Britain in particular-hav e within their bounds some of the world's greatest and richest technologies. But the rest of the Commonwealth contains some of humanity's greatest needs. such as India as consisting purely of needs. I spent a fortnight or a little more in India only a few months ago. I asked the Indians to show me some of their greatest problems and some of their greatest achievements. There is no doubt that the problems of a country with 470 million peopleI think that is the population-and 500,000 separate villages, are tremendous. In India there are schools without enough paper and building roads by carrying dirt in baskets on their heads. But I also saw India's aircraft factory",69,Commonwealth Parliamentary Association
115,Mr Bryant (Wills) [10.44],"I think,That shows how pervasive are the ideas that flow out of Europe. I saw India's atomic reactor and its ancillaries in Bombay and the fertiliser factories in the north. Admittedly, those things meet only a small percentage of India's needs. I gathered the impression that in India there is a great amount of human resources which could be garnered if the world, and particularly the Commonwealth, rallied to its support. I presume that the position in Africa is much the same. The honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley), in putting the point that corruption in government has been a continual and besetting sin of humanity until recent times, also gave us some reason to hope that this problem will be overcome in these nations. In places like India, of course, it. is a continual struggle for the government. Every day I was in India, almost every newspaper carried an account of people being tried for corruption. I believe that in many discussions about the Commonwealth in the past we have been so obsessed with the doctrine of power being the source of government and the thing from which all good shall flow that we have forgotten the fields of co-operation between us. It is a simple truth that for the ordinary human being the fact that there is no consistent political power which ought to carry authority over the whole Commonwealth has no significance if there are things which do him good. For instance, the co-operation between Australia and the United Kingdom and between Australia and New Zealand in the reciprocal social services agreements is much more valuable than any political authority could be. Again, British passports, or whatever you like to call them, which allow or assist people to travel around the world, are much more important than flags or political authority. The affinity arising from the English language, which is a pretty common factor throughout the Commonwealth, again is much more important than many of the trappings at which so many people look when they talk about the Commonwealth being at an end. 1 believe that it is in the spirit of co-operation between people that there lies the real hope of humanity. It is in this continuing co-operation and the expansion of it that the Mr Speaker, there is a matter that I would Commonwealth Parliamentary Association like to place before the House tonight. This has its great opportunity for mankind. If we think for a moment of some of the things in which there is wide and expanding co-operation we bring to mind the Commonwealth Economic Committee, the Commonwealth agricultural bureaus, of which there are a number, the Commonwealth Telecommunications Board, the Commonwealth Education Liaison Committtee, the Commonwealth Shipping Committee and the Commonwealth Scientific Committee. I think it is pretty evident that in all these bodies the fact is that it is much easier for the nations of the Commonwealth to co-operate than it is for nations which are not members of the Commonwealth to co-operate. So, we find in air transport B.O.A.C., Qantas and Air India working as a complete team. I rose tonight, Mr Speaker, to congratulate those honourable members who spoke so forcefully for the continuance of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and all its works, and to try to extend the idea that co-operation between mankind is a much more important fact than the simple political direction of mankind. In the field of co-operation, it is becoming increasingly easy for nations to act together. This is where the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and parliaments in particular can do great work. There is no other institution which can do quite the same task as the parliamentary one. We are able to speak in a free and uninhibited way. There is a give and take and a free play of ideas in a parliamentary institution which does not exist in governmental institutions. I hope that the recommendations placed before the 'Parliament by the members who were overseas at this recent conference will be adopted by the Government and given its full support and that humanity itself will become the most compelling and urgent consideration of all parliamentary institutions.
