Very clearly, that was a matter of concern. It The Committee supports the land application trials had been reported and material had spilt out of and agrees that these should be subject to further research. Some months ago the Committee considered that that pipeline. these trials should be conducted with treated water. It appears now however that treatment is unnecessary. One of the interesting indices of good management of any site, be it an industrial site or a On a matter of clarification, there was a question mining site, is very often the question of indusas to whether water from the holding areas trial safety and the observations that one can should be sprayed into the area or whether there make about it.

The other aspect of this environment force-that some of the safety aspects of that question is the social environment. Part of that mine management were not ideal. Clearly, in social environment is the Aboriginal community order to keep the picture a little balanced, we associated with Magela Creek. The question that also ought to observe that, when we are dealing still has to be addressed-obviously it is a matter with both a large scale mining operation and a of negotiation, good faith and time-is that that uranium concentrate, quite obviously, we have a traditional community has a very different unfairly large issue on our hands. In part of the derstanding and conception of pollution in the process of concentrating uranium, kerosene is environment than we do. It may well be that we used. So, very clearly, we have a fire hazard are able to demonstrate, both in a rational and issue as well. logical sense, that there is no quantifiable environmental pollution over and above background Let me now focus upon another aspect of radiation levels, for example, that would cause what we are talking about here.
