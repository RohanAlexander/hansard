In the case of Maryfields Primary, the debates were held at the school itself and, in the case of Mabel Park State School and Kingston College, they were held at the Gold Coast council chambers at Nerang. The debates were vigorous, rigorous and most enjoyable with the kids really taking the opportunity to get passionately involved in them. I was delighted, therefore, with the level of interest and participation by the students in these debates. We had a Speaker and all the officials, such as the clerks. More than half of the children were on one side and a little fewer than half were on the other side. vigorous debate ensued. I was able to convey to those students the important fact that on the vast bulk of the legislation that comes before the parliament there is, in fact, agreement. This is not widely known and people who watch question time and some of the other debates obviously draw the conclusion that we systematically and habitually disagree with each other. But the majority of legislation that comes before the parliament, no matter who is in government, is agreed upon. I was pleased to be able to convey that to them. I was amused by the propensity of the kids to cross the floor. The merits of the debate were thrashed out and in the exchanges that occurred some of the kids from the other side-I must say that they were prompted in part by me-thought that the argument on the opposition side had greater force and some of them crossed the floor. Nevertheless, the opposition still lost those debates. In one case the Canberra official had to say, ‘Please, no more cross the floor because we will bring the government down.’ I do not know whether this is a portent for the future when the children of Australia are saying: ‘When we hear the force of the argument, why not make those sorts of decisions and cross the floor?’ Finally, I was also amused by officials from Canberra-whom I must thank and congratulate-saying, ‘In the Labor Party’s case you are absolutely bound; in the Liberal Party’s case, that is not so.’ We have seen in recent days that there is binding on both sides.

As Mr Otto himself says, as the defence department sources most of its armaments from countries that use the imperial system, that system is going to be around for a lot longer yet. He has put this marvellous book together and it provides very easy to understand conversions from the metric to the imperial systems. As well, in chapter 3 there are tremendous tips on hard or silver soldering, cleaning metal, soft soldering, softening old glues and all sorts of other wonderful things such as that. I thought I would give him a plug here in the Main Committee of the House of Representatives, but, moreover, seriously celebrate Lionel Otto’s commitment to encouraging young people to follow in his philosophical footsteps, that effort and hard work do lead to success. I think his focus is an inspiration for a lot of young people. I would also like to detain the House for a moment to record my lament at the passing of Lady Killen, Jim Killen’s long standing wife. Almost 50 years of marriage came to an end just two weeks ago when Joy passed away as a result of a tremendous and horrible stroke she suffered following an operation in Brisbane. She was part of a generation of nation builders following the Second World War. For 28 years Jim Killen served as the member for Moreton-as he called it, his parish. His wife was a bit like a country minister’s wife, always by his side and offering assistance. I know that people around Tarragindi and Wellers Hill are lamenting her passing tremendously. I know the Liberal Party in Queensland is too. She was a founder of the Young Liberal Movement and the Women’s State Council. She will be sorely missed. I think it is right in this parliament that we record her passing today. Health: Immunisation immunisation and vaccination in our community. I will start off by giving the Minister for Health and Aged Care a plug: it is certainly true that he has made vaccinations an issue he has highlighted in his time as minister and he has certainly worked to get the rates up. I congratulate him on that, but that is about where the congratulations end. I would like to raise a couple of issues on immunisation. One is that the minister, in an answer to a question in the House a couple of days ago, gave me a bit of a clip over the ears with respect to some issues that I had raised in the Daily Telegraph on immunisation, in particular because he felt that I was spreading confusion on the question of the differentiation of vaccine combinations between one state and the other. The word ‘confusion’ actually came from an answer provided by the department to a question in Senate estimates. It was the department that was saying there was going to be confusion relating to this change and therefore there was a need for an education campaign to highlight that problem and that confusion. But the real issue is that we should not have a system whereby different states are going to be allowed to tender for different combinations that are not interchangeable. If someone moves from one state to another where there are different combinations-as, for example, it appears likely, between New South Wales and Victoria-the circumstances are that if their children are midway through a vaccination program they will not be able to change over to the combination provided in that state. They will have to arrange for the combination that is provided in the state they originated from to be brought to their new state in order to ensure that they maintain their vaccinations. That, again, comes from the department in correcting the Senate Hansard for the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee. They had used the word ‘interchangeable’ and then had to come back and say, ‘Actually, that’s not correct. It is the same equivalent in outcome.’ The clear point there being: equivalent in outcome if completed as one process, but not equivalent in outcome if you change from one state to another and end up in a situation where you are using different sets of state vaccines. The government has got to do something about that. I think it is a change which is unnecessarily",106,Representatives Main Committee
226,Mr Griffin (Bruce),"I rise today to make some comments regarding issues of15488 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 April 2000 confusing. That is not only my view, it is also the view of the AMA and it is something this minister should address, rather than just giving me a biff in parliament. On another issue that follows on from that, the minister made an announcement on Tuesday about hep B vaccinations being made available for infants. That is a great thing and, again, I congratulate the work the minister has done in this area. Of course, it was recommended in 1996 by the NHMRC and it has taken since 1996 to actually get that up. An earlier example of that is the acellular pertussis vaccine which was approved by the NHMRC; it was another 12 months before the minister got around to heralding it as a great advance. It was a great advance but the government moved too slowly on this issue. Holden, Mr Charles and Mrs Lizzie events: the turn of the millennium, the visits of President Clinton, President McAllesse, the Queen and the Duke, and the welcoming back of our INTERFET forces from East Timor. But nothing can quite prepare you for meeting a couple on their 75th wedding anniversary-not 50 or 60, mind you, but 75 years of unbroken and loving commitment. Obviously well ahead of their time, this couple said that the secret of their success had been the equality of each other in the marriage. I refer to Charles and Lizzie Holden, nee Foster, both in their 98th year, who were married on 18 March 1925 at Bullyard, near Gin Gin. True Aussies in every sense of the word, Mrs Holden is one of 10 children and Mr Holden is one of eight. Lizzie stood by Charlie as he worked in tough, backbreaking work like clearing harsh scrubland by hand, cane cutting, working in the civil construction corps during the war and, in later years, in plumbing. In fact, he only gave up driving at 97 years of age. On 18 March, complete with floral arrangement, I visited them at their Weipa Street home in Bundaberg. Lizzie, though very bright, was somewhat slowed by arthritis. But Charlie was a vision. He met me in shorts and joggers and greeted me with a handshake like a Stanley vice. He put this down to exercise over his 97 years and then instructed me on how I might lose some weight. their friends and visiting relatives. Mrs Holden’s daughter wrote me a note saying how much they appreciated the flowers. It was a privilege to give them, quite frankly. She said: I am kept busy keeping the water up to them and spraying them to keep them as long as possible so that they can still look great. Your visit was the highlight of their day, so a big thank you for coming. AllI can say is that it was a great privilege.

Unfortunately, I was not able to attend those celebrations because of my presence here in the parliament in Canberra. Carina Meals on Wheels has been operating for this full 20-year period. Over that period of time, it has distributed 380,000 meals to the residents of Brisbane’s south side. Carina Meals on Wheels was established after a community meeting convened by the then state member-and still the state member-Terry Mackenroth, on 30 March 1980. A plaque was presented yesterday honouring this 20 years of service by the Queensland State President of Meals on Wheels, Mr Ken Edwards. There was also a presentation of badges for those who had provided 20 years of continuing service to that organisation. Badges were presented to Diana Armstrong and Alan Blandford.

Beyond that, Carina Meals on Wheels owe their operation to the continuing contributions of 130 volunteers. All of these individuals are to be congratulated for sticking to an important community task and adding their shoulder to the wheel, not just when organisations are established, but when the hard work is done-when it comes to ensuring that the mission of the organisation continues through to conclusion. We should also honour the contribution by the current committee of this organisation: its president, Mr Jim Harrison; its coordinator, Mrs Gail FlemingMrs Fleming has also been with Carina Meals on Wheels almost continuously for that whole period of time; its secretary, Mrs Mary McDougall; and its treasurer, Alan Blandford. In this financial year, the branch delivered 31,527 meals. A record number of meals are being delivered as we speak. There are currently 180 clients on the books and 140 meals are served each day. Carina Meals on Wheels has already won three South East Advertiser business achiever awards. The contribution of this organisation in my community and of those who set it up and who have staffed it for such a long period of time deserves to be commended by all of us here. In conclusion, I add my bipartisan support to the comments made previously by the member for Moreton on the passing of the wife of Sir James Killen in Brisbane.

Centre for Rural and Regional Innovation to one of the fantastic outcomes of the regional summit, which was held some little time ago now at the instigation of the Deputy Prime Minister. I am referring to the proposal to develop the Centre for Rural and Regional Innovation, which I think is an absolutely fantastic proposal. The partners in that are the University of Melbourne and the University of Queensland, each of which provided $200,000, which was matched by DETYA, to fund the establishment of the Centre for Rural and Regional Innovation. The vice-chancellors of the University of Melbourne and the University of Queensland-Professor Alan Gilbert and Professor John Hay-have entered into the spirit of this venture, and I must say that it has fantastic potential for rural and regional areas of Australia. Under this initiative, the potential exists to train up to 5,000 people from rural areas over a five-year period. The whole intention of it is to empower people in rural and regional areas by building within them the knowledge with which to solve the problems which beset those areas and to do that in a way that is appropriate to those areas, and not in a manner that might be seen to be coming down from an ivory tower in a capital city somewhere. The University of Melbourne and the University of Queensland are being supported in this proposal by a range of other universities-the University of New England, Central Queensland University, Sydney University through its Orange Agricultural College, Adelaide University, James Cook University, the University of Tasmania, the University of Southern Queensland and the University of Western Australia-as well as by the CSIRO’s Division of Tropical Agriculture, the CRC for Tropical Savannas and the Australian Rural Leadership Foundation.

Second Reading Debate resumed from 8 December 1999, on motion by Mr Williams: That the bill be now read a second time. Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1999. It is a bill of no political controversy whatsoever. The only swingeing criticism I shall make is that schedule 2 has to reinstate tariffs which were removed. That is obviously occasioned because insufficient inquiry was made of those who might be affected. A minor tariff of up to a five per cent rate of duty on goods in certain areas is being reinstated. This includes certain drawing, marking-out and mathematical calculating instruments; rulers of wood or plastic and steel tape measures; certain gas, electric and liquid meters; and certain machines for balancing mechanical parts and electrical test benches. Those were items for which tariffs were entirely removed. But after later representations from industry sectors, which pointed out that existing Australian manufacturers would be adversely affected by that removal, the government is reinstating the minimum rate of five per cent. We certainly make no objection to that. Plainly, it was an unintentional error that led to the removal in the first place because the government announced that, where there were competitive Australian industries, this removal would not be applied. They are correcting an error. This legislation that comes before the parliament now merely gives effect legislatively to an announced government response of some time ago. The practical consequence has been that these tariff changes have been put in place for some time. The industry that was affected is satisfied by those responses. So the opposition makes no point other than to say it was unfortunate that insufficient checking was made in the first place so that this toing-and-froing in relation to these measures was unnecessary. The rest of the bill is of even less controversy. It does some technical and administrative tidying up of the legislation. Mr Deputy Speaker, despite my thoughtful, reflective and normally provocative contributions to this parliament, I think I would be hard-pressed to justify it to yourself and those present to try to extend my remarks much beyond the 2½ minutes that I have reached now. Certainly to take up the whole 30 minutes would stretch your patience and my ingenuity past all reasonable bounds. With those small remarks and with the decency of an effective and constructive opposition, I indicate the opposition will support these measures. chair’s patience is much greater than his ingenuity. bipartisan support for the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1999. It is most unusual for me, after over a decade in politics, to be standing up to talk on something that is not controversial and that has bipartisan support.

I would firstly like to outline the alterations. The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1999 contains three schedules of amendments. They are as follows: schedule 1, which was operative from July 1999, inserts in chapter 57 of schedule 3 to the tariff act an additional note to ensure that all textile mats, rugs and the like are classified within that chapter. Schedule 2, which was operative from 3 September 1999, reinstates a five per cent rate of duty on a range of goods in chapter 90. The rate of duty on these goods was reduced to three per cent in September 1998 following the implementation of recommendations of the Industry Commission report on the medical and scientific equipment industries. The goods on which this action is being taken are certain drawing, marking-out and mathematical calculating instruments; rulers of wood or plastic; electrical test benches and machines for balancing mechanical parts; and gas, electric and liquid meters and steel tape measures. Schedule 3, which was operative from October 1999, implements the government’s decision in relation to the tariff recommendations contained in the Industry Commission’s report on packaging and labelling. This action removes the customs rate of duty on steel, tin plate and aluminium can sheets used in the manufacture of aluminium cans. The government has been considering these duty amendments for some time now, and they all have the support from the relevant industry bodies. Why? These schedules bring a level of fairness to customs tariffs which were previously unbalanced, particularly within the scientific equipment industries. It is important to note that the change that is outlined in schedule 1 of this amendment, specifically to chapter 57, is revenue neutral as it reinstates the previous classification principles. This change has taken place mainly because of the government’s commitment to ensuring its classification of goods conforms with the international ‘harmonised’ interpretation. By ‘harmonised’ I refer to the international system of classifying goods which was developed in response to a need for a systematic and internationally uniform classification of all goods found in international trade. The actual change in schedule 1 inserts an additional note which requires importers of textile rugs, mats and similar articles to classify them as ‘other textile floor coverings’. This ensures Australia’s compliance with the international harmonised system. When the government implemented the recommendation of the Industry Commission in its review of the medical and scientific equipment industries, it stripped the five per cent duty from a wide range of goods, some of which were not medical or scientific equipment. This removal created an inequality within the industry because some producers of the non-medical and scientific equipment were experiencing an adverse effect to their manufacturing profitability. Schedule2 corrects this inequality by reinstating the five per cent rate of duty on specified goods. These goods included gas, electric and liquid meters and steel tape measures. The removal of the customs tariffs on steel tin plate and aluminium can sheet used in the manufacture of aluminium cans, as suggested in schedule 3, has been initiated for very good reason. I am sure my parliamentary colleague the member for Murray, Dr Stone, will have something to say about that because, like me, she has industries within her electorate that use a considerable amount of aluminium tin plate. The removal of the tariffs was the result of an Industry Commission report on packaging and labelling which was handed down to the Assistant Treasurer in 1996. The commission found that the Australian producers of tin plate and can sheet were internationally competitive; the removal of tariffs would enhance the performance of the user industries without significant adverse effect to metal manufacturers; the major industries that would benefit from the removal of tariffs would be the canned food and canned beverage industries. The changes that have flowed from these recommendations should result in lower input costs for the food and beverage canning industry, which should subsequently improve the 15492 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 April 2000 competitiveness of this industry and lead to increased exports of these products. I know that we all, on both sides of the House, look to that positive outcome in the future. These amendments, specifically the removal of these customs rates of duty, are further proof of the government’s commitment to lowering business costs and helping in developing competitive Australian industries, while providing consumers with improved priced products. I thank members of the opposition for their contributions and for the bipartisan way in which they have agreed to these, as has been quite rightly pointed out, non-controversial amendments to this bill. I look forward to a positive outcome as a result of the initiatives undertaken by the government. Dr STONE (Murray-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage) (10.08 a.m.)-I would like to sum up this debate on the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1999 by saying that all the amendments contained in this bill are currently in effect by way of current tariff proposals. The purpose of this bill is to enact these amendments, which are non-controversial. As we have heard from the member for Denison and the member for Hume, these are the sorts of amendments which make our Australian enterprise more competitive. They are sensible amendments. I want to thank them for their strong bipartisan support. These amendments are all about the government recognising the need to be aware of and addressing trade assistance issues on both a national and sectoral basis. We recognise once again that in order to be competitive internationally we have to encourage free trade and we have to encourage all of our industry sectors to be competitive wherever they are operating. This bill makes sure that we have done our best to be absolutely equitable on all sides. The five per cent duty has been removed from steel tin plate and aluminium can sheet used in the production, in particular, of food and beverage cans. The member for Hume referred to this as a very significant amendment for our food manufacturing sector, one of the sectors which takes advantage of our great natural resources in Australia, our clean green food production that is all the time being increasingly exported at premium prices. We have always had this substantial cost of the fabrication of the metal cans in the food processing system. This action has lowered input costs for the canning industry, is helping to develop more competitive industries and is, at the same time, providing a better priced product for the consumer. Perhaps it is no accident that last year, in my electorate of Murray, our two local canneries, SPC and Ardmona-household names in Australia-enjoyed their most profitable years on record and they are looking forward to a bright future. Amendments like this make sure that food manufacturing in Australia goes from strength to strength. The reimposition of a five per cent rate of duty on certain meters, drawing instruments, tape measures and mechanical balancing machines is in response to the concerns of some Australian manufacturers. This amendment will assist those manufacturers to maintain their economic viability in the face of overseas competition. As I said at the beginning, all of the amendments in this bill are currently in effect by way of current tariff proposals. This is a very important bill, albeit most uncontroversial in the sense that all sides of our House agree that this bill should be expedited forthwith. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Thursday, 6 April 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 15493 Primary Industries and Regional Services Committee Report Debate resumed from 16 March, on motion by Mrs De-Anne Kelly: That the House take note of the report. excellent report, entitled Time running out: shaping regional Australia’s future. I have listened to a number of the members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Regional Services speak on it and I have been very impressed with the work that has been done. I would like to touch on a number of areas in the report, certainly regional leadership and the need for road infrastructure, and possibly the issue of airports. I want in particular to relate the report to the area that I represent, Greater Western Sydney-in itself a region. I will give a brief word picture of the region, which is some 72 per cent of Sydney’s metropolitan area. It goes up to the Hawkesbury in the north, to Wollondilly and Campbelltown in the south, to the Blue Mountains in the west and to Parramatta in the east. It is a very large area. As the report indicates, there is a need for regional leadership, and I suggest that that leadership is being provided to a great extent by the Greater Western Sydney Economic Development Board. The board was established originally by the state Liberal government and has been continued by the Carr Labor government. I am pleased to have been a representative of the Labor Council of New South Wales on the original board, which at that stage was capably chaired by Mr Bill McNamara, who was a major business person in the area. The board is now chaired by Mr Bosnjak, who is also a senior businessman in the area. It is an excellent board, providing great leadership for the area. I will touch on two areas of infrastructure that the Greater Western Sydney is giving some consideration to. In particular, I draw to the attention of the chamber, and of the minister and the shadow minister responsible for road construction, the Western Sydney orbital road. Greater Western Sydney has a population of 1.5 million people and some 60,000 businesses and is now one of Asia-Pacific’s premier centres for economic development, global trade and capital investment. But economic development is still being retarded by inadequate road development. Western Sydney’s population is expected to grow by nearly 400,000 over the next 20 years, and a start must be made now to expand the road transport network in Western Sydney. The proposed Western Sydney orbital will provide a road link between the M5 and the Hume Highway at the Crossroads near Liverpool and the M2 at Seven Hills in the north. It will also connect with the M4 at Eastern Creek. I have been encouraged to raise this matter again by a recent survey conducted by the NRMA which reveals significant levels of congestion on the current route serving as the Western Sydney orbital between the Crossroads and Pearces Corner. The NRMA report states: The Western Sydney orbital would improve travel time, reduce congestion and crashes, provide better freight movement, boost employment and contribute to the economic development of Western Sydney. The Western Sydney orbital will link Australia’s major freight route, the Hume Highway, with major employment and production areas in Western Sydney and also supply intersuburban road transport movements and traffic relief across the Sydney metropolitan region. The survey reveals that the worse congestion occurs in the morning peak on the southbound run, where 27 per cent of the route experiences speeds below 30 kilometres per hour.",110,Representatives Main Committee
235,Mr Mossfield (Greenway) (10.12 A.m.),"It gives me great pleasure to speak on this15494 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 April 2000 The NRMA survey has identified congestion hotspots, for southbound travel, as Thornleigh to Pennant Hills-Duffy Road to Boundary Road-in the electorate of Parramatta; West Pennant Hills (Thompson Corner) to Carlingford-Castle Hill Road to North Rocks Road-in the electorate of Mitchell; North Parramatta (Kings School)-Russell Road to James Ruse Drive-in the electorate of Parramatta; Wentworthville-Smith Street to the M4-in the electorate of Reid; Merrylands West to Woodpark-Merrylands Road to Woodpark Road-in the electorate of Reid; Fairfield West-Hamilton Road to Sharpe Road-in the electorate of Prospect; Cabramatta to Liverpool-slow sections from Cabramatta Road to Hoxton Park Road-in the electorate of Fowler; and Liverpool-Reilly Street to the M5-in the electorates of Fowler and Werriwa. So you can see that congestion is occurring across quite a number of electorates in Western Sydney. The NRMA survey conducted in October 1999 found that the 40-kilometre journey from the F3 at Pearces Corner near Hornsby to the Crossroads took one hour, 20 minutes and 34 seconds, an average speed of 29.9 kilometres per hour. The journey in the opposite direction took one hour, nine minutes and 54 seconds, an average speed of 34 kilometres per hour. The journey time was the average time taken by 10 cars travelling in each direction in the morning peak traffic. A spokesman for the NRMA has stated: The Federal Government has tried to argue that the orbital was necessary infrastructure for Badgerys Creek Airport but it is necessary now on the grounds of congestion, freight needs, road safety and employment. I also draw to the attention of the Main Committee that, with the considerable opposition to an airport at Badgerys Creek from the public and right across the political spectrum-I have to say that certainly within the Labor Party there is strong opposition; I know from talking to some of my colleagues in the Liberal Party that there is also opposition in that party; there is strong opposition from community groups and church groups-and irrespective of what decisions the government might make on this question in the future, we do not believe the debate on the Badgerys Creek airport should have any impact at all on, and certainly not cause any delay in, the construction of the Western Sydney orbital. The enormous population growth taking place in Greenway and other parts of Western Sydney must be supported by transport infrastructure. The latest information from the Australian Bureau of Statistics proves that the population growth rate for Greater Western Sydney far exceeds that of Sydney or Australia. With around one-quarter of its population below the age of 16, Greater Western Sydney will remain a focal point for employment, investment and training for decades to come. For the full potential of Greater Western Sydney to be achieved, it must have good public and road infrastructure. I will conclude my few remarks on that subject by referring to the NRMA’s report, which states: In light of the Western Orbital’s status as a national highway the federal government should support this project. The deficiency in the road system must be addressed immediately if the Western Sydney and NSW economy is to be genuinely developed. I would like to move on to another subject that I intended to speak about this morning, and it relates specifically to the question of the proposed second Sydney airport. One of the reasons initially put forward for the airport to be built at Badgerys Creek was the employment opportunities. I believe this is really an excuse rather than a reason. The main reason that the Badgerys Creek site was selected in the first place was that at the time the site was far enough away from major residential areas to not be a political problem, yet close enough to the Sydney CBD to minimise infrastructure costs. Certainly the former argument does no longer stand up. It should be remembered that employment opportunities go to the people with skills, not necessarily to those people who live under a flight path or live near an airport. Any net job Thursday, 6 April 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 15495 growth that would arise from Sydney’s second airport, wherever it would be, would be available to all citizens, irrespective of where they live. There would also be a transfer of some existing staff from KSA to Sydney’s second airport. The aircraft industry itself is a highly technical industry rather than labour intensive one, where employment is likely to fall rather than increase over the years. Over time, there is likely to be an increase in the technical side of the industry and a decrease in the labour force. In his excellent book, Airport Economics, Leon Warren, a member of the Campbelltown Antiairport Group, points out the weakness in the argument concerning job growth. He refers to the claims of a predicted job growth as the result of a third runway at KSA. Mr Warren states: The Department of Arts, Sports, the Environment, Tourism and Territories in its environmental assessment report on the third runway, noted that an estimated 17,500 jobs could be generated in the airport subregion between 1995 and 2010 as a result of the operation of the new runway, with a further 27,000 jobs generated in the wider Sydney region. No attempt has been made to measure the employment impact of the third runway, but productivity gained and reduced employment numbers have been reported for the FAC and airlines. The FAC has reported employment reductions during the period. The annual report shows that in 1996-97 the total work force in the industry was 1,180 compared with the 199293 figure of 1,366. At the same time, passengers per employee rose from 34,271 in 1992-93 to 51,316 in 1996-97. We have seen over this period an increase in passenger movements but a reduction in the work force. What should also be understood about employment in the aircraft industry is that much of the maintenance work on aircraft can be performed overseas. I notice from press reports, even at this time, that there is a dispute in the industry. The unions are expressing concerns about the companies moving their aircraft overseas to have maintenance work done as this is taking work away from the Australian work force. Qantas currently has a large jet maintenance facility at KSA and there are a number of maintenance and service facilities at Bankstown airport. If forced to relocate to a second Sydney airport, Qantas could move its maintenance facilities to Brisbane, Melbourne or Auckland. Australia does not build international aircraft-all equipment for aircraft is imported. The maintenance of aircraft could be transferred, as I have indicated, to many overseas locations. The creation of large retail outlets at the international airport does not result in a net increase in employment opportunities for local residents. The effect is that local retail facilities are sucked into an international airport complex, similar to the effect that major suburban shopping complexes have on local strip shopping centres. The figure used by the pro-Badgerys Creek lobby group to predict employment growth as a result of a Sydney second airport at Badgerys Creek is, in my view, greatly exaggerated. Due to globalisation, the aircraft industry would appear to be an unreliable source for increased employment opportunities in Australia. The Very Fast Train project to link Melbourne, Canberra, Sydney and Brisbane has the potential to create more employment opportunities than expanding our aircraft industry. From listening to other speakers on this report, I understand there is some support for that Very Fast Train link. I certainly would like to add my support to that project. The most important impact of the failure of the federal government to make a decision on Badgerys Creek airport, if it is deferred, is the question of the reduction of funding for the Western Sydney orbital. It is estimated that, by the year 2012, Western Sydney will have a population greater than the rest of Sydney. The final question I put to this parliament is: if the federal government were looking for the first time for a suitable site for Sydney’s second, 24hour non-curfew international airport, would it put it in the middle of Sydney’s fastest growing residential area? I suggest not. all the members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Regional Services who travelled to the very far-flung parts of Australia-to the north of",113,Representatives Main Committee
236,Mr Katter (Kennedy) (10.26 A.m.),"I would like to congratulate Mrs Fran Bailey and15496 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 April 2000 Western Australia, to Tasmania, to the Gulf country of North Queensland-at very great cost to themselves, to listen to the problems, the ideas, the solutions and the suggestions being put forward by the people there. They listened and they got the message because this report, Time running out: shaping regional Australia’s future, is the first clear-cut statement of a pullback from the mad, obsessive ideology of national competition policy. I do not think there is anyone who denies that there are certain aspects of that policy that have had some beneficial effects for Australia. But the overall picture now is that to continue with that same obsessive commitment to that ideology will utterly destroy rural Australia. AndI do not think that that is an exaggeration. In western Queensland, the last census figures showed every single sector of every statistical division had lost population. That has been going on now for some 20 or 30 years. There was a good reason in the first five or 10 years, but that was just simply a change from wool to cattle that evened itself out and our population for a little while began to grow. Then in 1983 there was the election of the Labor government. I know there are certain elements of the Labor Party which were very antagonistic towards the policies of Mr Keating, who almost certainly had a driving obsession with free competition, for the sake of a better word. On the question of free competition, in the very first examination in economics that I did at university, I was failed because I had not put in the principles. When I look back on it, the lecturer was quite correct in failing me because you have to understand that, if you pursue a policy of free competition but your competitors do not, then you do not have free competition. And that, of course, is what is happening to us in Australia-that, coupled with the fact of the vast, almost overwhelming power of America. We are not like America. We do not have checks and balances. We do not have protection mechanisms such as geographical weighting of remote electorates, which every other country in the world has. That has been removed. We are now the only country in the world that has all electorates of equal size. That means we do not have the checks and balances system of the United States or the weighting and protection system that is built in to other democracies, such as Great Britain. For example, the Orkney Isles has 22,000 electors while East London has 120,000 electors and both of them have a member of parliament. In Canada, Nuntsiaq has 20,000 electors while a Quebec seat has some 100,000 electors. We do not have that situation in Australia. It is a matter of winner take all without the checks and balances system. So the big cities, Sydney and Melbourne, take all, and we get nothing. An interesting aspect with respect to national competition policy was Hilmer’s report on transport, which I think came out in 1987-the Industry Commission’s report on transport. Two of the major thrusts of that report were that, if we abolished taxi licences, we would cut $2 from the cost of a taxi fare; and then there were the tremendous inefficiencies that were built into the commuter transportation systems in Australia’s cities. The figure that he effectively put on the cost of the subsidies to the commuter transportation system was $4,000 million. During the inquiry chaired by Mrs Bailey, when I raised the figure of $4,000 million, I was corrected by two people at the table who pointed out that the figure is not $4,000 million now; it is $6,000 million. Hilmer introduced national competition policy to fix some of these inequities in the Australian system. Most certainly, we were driven to a user-pays principle in rural Australia, but there was no such driving of people in Sydney or Melbourne. Let us be realistic: no government could possibly afford to introduce a user-pays principle to the commuter transportation system. They would immediately cease to be the federal government of Australia or the state government of the state involved. So free competition came to rural Australia, but it never came to the cities. Thursday, 6 April 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 15497 In the sugar industry, we had protection from the huge subsidies of our competitors, and that protection was completely removed. For the corresponding industries of textile, footwear and clothing and the motor vehicles, that protection has remained. In other words, we applied the principle of national competition policy to rural Australia, where we do not have power, whereas in the cities, where they do have power, that principle was not applied. Even if we remove those two effects, national competition policy has resulted in the control tower and the fire brigade tender at Mount Isa being removed from the airport, and some 50 or 60 jobs being removed from what is one of the busiest regional airports in Australia. In Brisbane, we saw a magnificent $200 million or $300 million edifice being put up in order to look after international tourists. Again, the cities were able to get more money and development as a result of this policy, whereas rural Australia lost what they had. Mr Deputy Speaker, I repeat something that you have quoted in a number of meetings this week. An Australian sugar farmer is receiving about $180 a tonne for his sugar; a Brazilian farmer is receiving about $300 a tonne for his product; a Thai farmer is receiving about $500 a tonne for his sugar; an American farmer is receiving about $650 a tonne for his sugar; and a farmer in Europe is receiving $1,090 a tonne for his sugar. Mr Deputy Speaker, those figures which you have cited represent a resounding argument against the appalling stupidity of continuing with such a policy. I remember in the great debate over whether we would close all the timber areas in North Queensland-the world heritage debate-a lot of people said that we would be importing timber into Australia if we proceeded down this pathway. I did not use that argument because I did not think that we would ever be a net importer of timber into this country. That was ridiculous-if you fly in an aeroplane you will see that the whole country is covered in timber. That is less true of that third of New South Wales that has been cleared and that half of Victoria that has been cleared, but if you look at the continent of Australia they are pretty small areas, they are not the vast bulk of the surface area of Australia. In fact, my own homeland, the mid west, is now covered in trees. There are 700 kilometres-nearly 1,000 kilometres-of trees, whereas there were no trees when European settlement came to Australia. But what happened? We became, as everyone is aware now, a net importer of timber. The other day in Mount IsaI rang up to get prices for Australian medium hardwood timber and they said, ‘We don’t stock any Australian medium hardwood timber.’ I said, ‘You must have stocked some recently’ and they said, ‘No, not for six or seven years now, it’s all Indonesian and South-East Asian timber.’ I must say this, and I do not like saying things that most people would not believe, but we will be a net importer of food in this country within 10 years. There is no doubt about that. Our industries simply cannot withstand the firepower of those sugar figures that I have just given. We might hold out for a few years because we are super efficient. If you go through the sugar fields of Australia you will see the most efficient industry in the world. There are no people, it is all mechanical. It is a magical industry, it is all economies of scale-huge, giant loaders that do everything mechanically on a massive scale. But we cannot hold out in the longer term. There is just no way that we can survive that sort of firepower in the longer term. I will give one other example. We complain about the Americans because they allow only 380,000 tonnes of beef into the United States, where there are 230 million people. But Europe, with 560 million people, allows in 7,000 tonnes-just a tiny 7,000 tonnes. One of my neighbours on a cattle station that we had, Reggie Petricinion Junction Creek Station, in a good year will produce 7,000 tonnes. That is all we are allowed. We just cannot withstand that sort of firepower. They let nothing in, so they can charge very high prices for their 15498 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 April 2000 product; they get this very high price for their product, that enables them to dump that product on the world market competing against us. We cannot survive. There was a very famous biologist, for the sake of a better word, called Lamarck. Lamarck was a Frenchman. He decided that environmental pressure upon a plant or an animal would modify the genetic composition and that modified genetic composition would be passed on to the next generation. That became Lamarck’s theory. When Russia was taken over by the communists, this was a very appealing principle to them and they introduced Lamarckian principles into agriculture in Russia. So they gave no assistance to the plants whatosever. There were no pesticides, there was no fertiliser, there was not even a lot of irrigation. They believed that they would breed a tough plant and this plant would be able to prosper. After 7½ million Russians had starved to death they decided that Lamarck’s theory was not such a good idea. It was replaced, of course, for intelligent-thinking people by a more sophisticated Darwinian approach, which I think Robert Ardrey and people like Konrad Lorenz have probably modified even a little more. What we have in Australia today is a policy of Lamarckian economics. We can all survive out there with the government standing aside and watching as if it has nothing to do with those people at all. Chalmers Johnson said in his very famous book MITI: The Japanese economic miracle that the industrial policies in Western countries are ones of regulation: we stand aside and just regulate to see that it all works out fairly in the end. The Japanese industrial policy is one of development: ‘It is our job to get in there, develop and create wealth and prosperity for the people of Japan.’ Let us compare the performance of those two economies. In Australia the average income is some $20,000. When we launched this policy it took 700 yen to buy an Australian dollar and the Japanese had a comparable standard of living at about a third of what an Australian enjoyed. I am not talking about a long time ago but about some 20 years ago only, and even probably less than that. In fact, in John McEwen’s last year as the dominating figure in Australian economic policy it took 700-odd yen to buy an Australian dollar. Now it is 70 yen to buy an Australian dollar and it went down to almost 60 yen recently. This is a figure that shows how successful those people are. The last year I looked at the Japanese economy, which I think was the year before last, it had a current account surplus of around $300,000 million, the biggest trading surplus ever recorded in world history. We, on the other hand, this year have a $36,000 million deficit. Without the government providing the infrastructure items of electricity and ports and, most importantly, water, we simply cannot grow in this country. We are like the Chinese woman’s foot: bound up in bandages it simply cannot grow. I commend the report to the House. Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Regional Services for producing this comprehensive report entitled Time running out: shaping regional Australia’s future. The staff and the members of the committee are to be congratulated for it. We note that the reduction in the public sector of 40,000, reductions to the staffing of Telstra and the cuts to the branches of the banks, amongst other matters, have literally belted the regions. Another of the government’s actions should not be lost on the public. It was this government that closed the Office of Regional Development. That was one of the first actions of Mr Howard. It abrogated all its responsibilities to the market and it did not work. The government’s great faith in market forces has seen regional and rural forces gutted. Only now, when electoral defeat looms, are they even considering action. The report by the Primary Industries and Regional Services Committee on shaping regional Australia has highlighted the need for government to keep services decentralised, yet at the same time the government is doing the opposite. My electorate of Swan has a prime example of",115,Representatives Main Committee
237,Mr Wilkie (Swan) (10.42 A.m.),"Firstly, I congratulate the House of RepresentativesThursday, 6 April 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 15499 centralisation gone mad. I refer expressly to the closure of the Cannington taxation office and the move to shift its entire operation to the current ATO head office in Northbridge in central Perth. It does not make sense to me that the removal of the office of the Australian Taxation Office at Cannington can assist the department in operating at its most effective level and the move directly contravenes the recommendations contained within this report. There have been many suggestions made that it is apparent that the government has little appreciation of the strategic picture. A number of deficiencies have surfaced in the grandiose plans that the Howard government has for the community. One such deficiency lies in the human resource management policies of the taxation department. The agency will have to recruit, train and provision the staff within the taxation and customs offices nationally in an exceedingly short time frame. It is assumed that all the appropriate instruments are in placebudgetary allocations, curriculum development, training officers employed, venues hired and resources allocated-to ensure the system will work efficiently. However, I am concerned-as a result of conversations I had on a recent visit to the tax office at Canningon-that many of the current serving staff know little or nothing of the training or have not had the opportunity to have any input into the process. They are concerned by the apparent lack of attention to the detail of equipping the officers with the skills necessary to fulfil their professional obligations to the community. I will continue to liaise with the staff of the Taxation Office to ensure that the quality of the work of these staff is not jeopardised by ad hoc recruiting, poor training or inadequate accommodation. I mention this issue because in the next three months 80 new staff will be employed in Perth alone to implement the excise tariff amendment bill and the customs tariff amendment bill. The national figure is around 360. Therefore, the number of staff in the excise area alone will rise from 33 to 113. From the contact I have had with the staffing association, I understand that the staff will be employed in the main as officers of the Taxation Office. This follows the transfer of the division last year from the Customs Service to the Taxation Office. These officers will need vehicles of sufficient size for them to tour the business community. Being on the road they will carry files, promotional literature and departmental material, and they will probably need laptop computers and communication devices. Cannington represents an ideal location for these officers to reside professionally. It has generous parking and it provides easy access to the surrounding districts, with a minimum of congestion. Of course, members on this side of the House welcome any employment creation from the government, particularly given that it has shed 40,000 public sector jobs in the last three years. When offices are closed in important locations like Cannington and additional staff are to be recruited to be transferred into an overcrowded office in the city, there is justified criticism. Serious questions have also been asked about the ability of the Northbridge office to house the 652 staff currently employed in Cannington, let alone the additional 80 staff now being employed. Remember that in 1991 the Cannington office was established for certain reasons. It brought the Taxation Office out of its centralised location to the local community south of the river-it is a recommendation in this report that we decentralise government departments. The office was designed to serve the 350,000 people and 30,000 businesses in the southern residential areas. Before the Cannington tax office was established, inquiries required a 30to 50-minute drive or, for many, well over an hour on public transport into the central business district. That is, of course, if you can call the public transport system functional after Mr Court brutalised it in the same way that Mr Howard has battered the public sector. The siting of the office was based on good commercial practice due to it being a modern facility which included excellent community access from public transport routes. It also has large areas for parking which provide a good working environment for staff. I have made 15500 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 April 2000 criticisms that any transfer to Northbridge would compromise the potential for operators to function at peak because of congestion and lack of space. Contrast this with the Cannington office where these factors were taken into consideration by the Labor Party when we planned the operational requirements of the ATO, including the need for modern accessible community facilities and community access. In discussions with the stakeholders in the process, including the staff, the union, the local business community and users of the Cannington facility, I have established a number of questions that the Treasurer needs to answer. Among these questions is, ‘Has the Treasurer considered that the addition of an extra 80 specialist staff will create greater pressure on the Northbridge office and further reinforce the need to remain in Cannington?’ In addition, the Treasurer needs to advise the parliament on what has been resolved over the accommodation issues, including whether he considered the additional impact of the new staff before agreeing to the closure of Cannington. Contrary to the comments of management, queries which have not been answered exist over the lease arrangements and extensions to the central office as well as the lack of space available for staff in the new office. All these issues still remain unresolved. It is important that the Treasurer also answer questions pertaining to the negative externalities from the move. These include the increases in traffic congestion and the extra time taken in journeys for the public and staff. With thousands of extra kilometres to be travelled due to the increase in community based staffing at the Northbridge office, using the city as a base for an extra 80 officers just adds weight to the argument that the move should be reconsidered. There is another issue that also warrants consideration. It goes to the heart of the sort of environment that this government seems to encourage. That is the dingy and opaque manner in which the original decision to close the Cannington office was made. I am sure that if the government was listening to the residents of southern Perth and had a mature human resources policy, instead of treating the staff as the undeclared enemy, then they would be in a better situation to appreciate the requirements of the community and the staff that have so effectively serviced the public. Members may also recall that I have questioned what rate of commercial rent is paid at the Cannington office, a suburban complex, as against the Northbridge inner city office. I indicated that I also would have liked to have seen highlighted any calculations on the negative impacts of the centralising of taxation services. Further, if over 700 regular staff and thousands of customers are removed from the local area, what is the flow-on effect of the loss of that expenditure on the region? Discussions with interested parties indicate that the impact will be as high as around $20,000 per week, which I believe is a conservative estimate. That figure is not inclusive of the loss of office rent and associated services. This is particularly relevant, given that the area has an unemployment rate 1.5 per cent above the state average and that the annual income of the majority of the population is less than $30,000. I believe that the actual costs in transferring the operations, coupled with the hidden extras, will be so high that the true costs will never see the light of day. In summary, members on this side of the House agree that real change needs to be made in regional development policy. I call on the government to reconsider the centralisation of the organisation in Western Australia. In the light of the latest expansion, the decision has now become critical to the effective operations of the staff and their serving of the community. By continuing to embrace a decentralised office at Cannington, the ATO would continue to make ATO staff available directly to the public and provide an important, convenient access point Thursday, 6 April 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 15501 for the new offices as well as continuing to develop an important service that benefits the local community. We must not lose sight of the facts. The transfer to Northbridge would create added congestion and not allow staff and local taxpayers efficient and effective representation in their area. The Treasurer and the management of the ATO in Western Australia should abandon this proposal and keep the service where it is needed-in Cannington, with the community. If you need further evidence to support this argument you need look no further than the recommendations contained within this report. Debate (on motion by Ms Gerick) adjourned. Second Reading Debate resumed from 16 March, on motion by Mr Anthony: That the bill be now read a second time. Entitlements Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Matters) Bill 2000 is a relatively complex series of measures necessitated by the fact that the social security legislation itself is a very complex beast. The bottom line is that the bill contains a series of savings measures, a series of new forms of eligibility, which will extend and involve costs to government, and simplification measures. It relates particularly, but not exclusively, to the portability of pension and benefit entitlements. The question arises as to what happens to the eligibility of an Australian or a permanent resident receiving a pension or benefit who travels overseas or leaves Australia for an extended period. The Social Security (International Agreements) Act 1999 and the Social Security Act 1991 both contain provisions which govern the circumstances under which a person will lose eligibility, retain eligibility or have their entitlement reduced to some degree. The specific provisions relating to different benefits and entitlements have been, since 1973 when general portability was introduced, continually amended and changed to create specific requirements for different specific pensions and benefits, in such a way that we now have a morass of complexity in this area. A measure such as this is required to give greater comprehensibility and simplicity-for both recipients of benefits and pensions and the government’s administrators in the Department of Family and Community Services-in actually implementing the legislation. Many pensions and allowances have a test that requires the recipient to be in Australia. That is just a simple black-and-white test: you receive the benefit while you are in the country; you do not receive it while you are outside the country. This is based on the easily comprehensible idea that the Australian government ought to be willing to stand up and take its responsibility seriously but, if a person severs their connection with Australia, that clearly has some implication on what the government’s responsibilities are. So many pensions and allowances require an in-Australia test. Some allow temporary absence from Australia without compromising eligibility, subject to an activity test. For example, if a person who qualifies for a pension or a benefit in Australia goes overseas to work then the same activity test would apply. If that work increases their income, they may no longer be entitled to the benefit. Likewise, if they are receiving a benefit which requires them to comply under the government’s mutual obligations regime with an effort to find work test, that will also continue while they are overseas. The remaining pensions and benefits are subject to the international portability rules which, as I mentioned, are contained in two acts-the Social Security Act 1991, which is the general",118,Representatives Main Committee
238,Mr Ross Cameron (Parramatta) (10.52 A.m.),"The Social Security and Veterans’15502 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 April 2000 omnibus compendium of social security legislation; and the more recent act passed last year, the Social Security (International Agreements) Act. Those two pieces of legislation have the consequence of dividing pensions and benefits into one of two categories. Those subject to the 1999 legislation are described as the agreement pensions and allowances, meaning they are subject to the international agreements contained in the act; and all remaining pensions and allowances are described as the non-agreement pensions and allowances because Australia has not executed an agreement with the country under consideration. General portability was introduced in 1973, no doubt reflecting the fact that Australia is becoming a more well-travelled community. It is a great thing that more and more Australians at all phases of their lives, but particularly in retirement, are taking the opportunity to travel overseas. The government responded to that reality by introducing general portability in 1973. The exceptions to general portability of pensions and allowances were, firstly, the pensions that involved supplementary income assistance and, secondly, those allowances or pensions that were based on short residence. By that we mean a person who regains their Australian residence and, on the basis of regained Australian residence, applies and qualifies for a pension or a benefit and then leaves Australia within 12 months. In those circumstances, while the person may retain that entitlement to the pension or the benefit, it will not be portable. The Director-General has had power to exempt recipients from some of those qualifications where it was felt there were particular humanitarian circumstances to justify that sort of exemption. Since 1973, when that general portability was introduced, a whole range of measures has subsequently been added in small increments along the way, adding to the complexity of the regime. For example, we have this idea of proportional portability. That means that if someone receiving a pension or a benefit is overseas for more than 12 months, they do not necessarily cease to be entitled to a pension or a benefit but their entitlement is reduced according to the proportion of time they were resident in Australia during their working life. For example, if you were resident in Australia for 80 per cent of your working life then you would be entitled to 80 per cent of the total value of the pension or the benefit. This is clearly seeking to avoid the situation where a person may move to Australia late in life, qualify as a permanent resident, work for 12 to 18 months, retire, return to their country of origin and then retain an entitlement to an Australian benefit for the rest of their lives. So proportional portability was introduced to more equitably reflect the Australian government’s obligations in relation to those circumstances. Departure certificates were also introduced as really a compliance measure to allow a person to crystallise the moment at which the department makes a judgment about these things. A person could go and apply for a departure certificate before leaving Australia, declaring their intention to be away from Australia for a certain period of time, and then the agreement would be made up-front about what the consequences of that absence would be. Characteristically, without a departure certificate you would cease to qualify for a pension or benefit after six months, unless you had an exemption from the Director-General. The departure certificates were introduced as a measure to take out the sense of apprehension and uncertainty which Australians felt if they went overseas-in some cases, they would not know how long they would be away. Similarly, we introduced a regime of post-departure review. For certain payments we also limited or removed portability entirely. You can see from this abbreviated summary that we are talking here about a beast of very considerable complexity. If we then look at the variation in the application of the portability regime to different payments, we see further complexity. For example, the age pension and the bereavement allowance have historically been completely portable. By contrast, the disability support pension is completely portable where a person suffers a severe disability. Where the disability is not evaluated as being severe, the pension is only portable for 12 Thursday, 6 April 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 15503 months. Similarly, the wife pension and the special needs wife pension and the widow B pension and the special needs widow B pension are generally portable for 12 months. Sometimes, in special circumstances, they are completely portable. So what you get is the great difficulty of trying to track down these provisions in different pieces of legislation and work out what the implications are for individual claimants and beneficiaries who are asking in good faith what the implications of travelling overseas will be. So the bill concentrates all of the provisions relating to portability in one place. It makes explicit what the implications are for each pension or benefit in a very simple and systematic way. By that centralisation and standardisation, we were able to remove a range of the compliance measures, which have been introduced since 1973, which will also greatly simplify the administration of the legislation. In the bill there is a range of purely technical amendments as there have been some renumbering errors in the previous legislation-in particular errors relating to the introduction of the ANTS, a new tax system, legislation. I suppose the parliamentary draftsmen might be forgiven for one or two renumbering errors in the most fundamental reform of the tax system that we have seen since Federation. If that is the greatest difficulty that we face, I think we will all regard ourselves as very fortunate indeed. The bill before the chamber also extends the benefit of the government’s commitment to provide a four per cent increase in pensions to compensate for any inflationary impact of the GST. Almost all of that was achieved in the legislation for a new tax system but you will find a couple of anomalies where things have slipped through the cracks. That in particular relates to the retirement assistance measures, which have been in place for some time for farmers. Coming from a regional and rural electorate and having been a canecutter, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley will appreciate the special needs of farmers on retirement. The measure makes particular provision to ensure that the four per cent increase in a farmer’s retirement benefit is passed on which, outside of this legislation, the farmers would have missed out on. Similarly, those who receive an additional supplementary support payment were not included in the original ANTS legislation, so the minister has taken the opportunity as an equity matter to ensure that they are included here. Likewise, the bill provides specifically for members of the Australian defence forces who might find their allowances affected by the historical portability regime. It makes specific provision to allow greater flexibility for members of the Australian defence forces who may be sent overseas, in order to ensure that they are not in any way unfairly prejudiced. That is the guts of the measure before the House. One final area I should mention is data matching. The government has made considerable effort to ensure that those entitled to a benefit, a pension or an allowance receive that benefit or allowance, but also to tighten up the compliance regime to address what was clearly a challenge under the former government-though, frankly, with such a vast and complex regime, it is a challenge for any government-and that is to ensure that there is not abuse and fraudulent misuse of benefits and allowances. Data matching has become quite a powerful tool to ensure that the tax file number used as the operating tool or piece of machinery by the Australian tax office is also made available to the Department of Family and Community Services to match what has been declared at the tax office with the benefits being sought and received through other arms of government. This measure allows the extension of data matching to a wider range of circumstances which we believe will generate revenue savings to the government. The bill does involve, over five years, a savings of about $110 million. In the long run, every increment that we can remove from the burden on the Australian taxpayer is, to my mind, a positive thing, particularly where it can be done with sensitivity to the equity issues, and that is demonstrated throughout the bill. I commend the bill to the House. 15504 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 April 2000 payment rates, we are compelled to at least assist in supporting the Social Security and Veterans’ Entitlements Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Matters) Bill 2000 pending opportunities to amend aspects as required. The interested spectator would think that, after many years of neglect, this government could do better. There comes a time when the community begins to wonder when enough is enough. For years now, this government has plundered the social security payments of thousands of the less well off and they have battered the lifestyle of veterans. According to the Australian Council of Social Service, cuts which mainly affect low income people account for more than 30 per cent of all expenditure cuts in the coalition’s first two budgets. Under the guise of simplification, the coalition has broken many of its pre-election commitments specifically in terms of not hurting the poor, the needy and the most vulnerable in the community. Our support for the bill does not, however, diminish responsibilities for raising a number of issues today: firstly, the adverse effects that this government has had on the veterans’ community and, secondly, the failings of this government in dealing with social security matters. The bill, in reality, just tinkers at the edges. I am amazed at the length that this government will go to to save a buck, even if those savings mean hardship and loss. It will be obvious to all in this House that the bill represents a particularly complex bundle of initiatives that deal with the problems of implementing the GST. They also enforce further cuts announced in the 1999 budget relating to international portability and to an extension of the requirement to see comparable foreign payments to persons from all countries. The measures relating to international portability include the standardisation of the portability rules, phasing out of special needs pensions and the extension to two years of the short residence rule. In total, they reduce allocations over the next three years by $80 million, with administrative savings of around $16 million. The bill makes technical amendments to the provisions of the Social Security Act 1991 which provide for the pension bonus scheme and the Retirement Assistance for Farmers scheme. I am led to believe that the government intends to use this legislation to improve the lot of veterans to the tune of four per cent in a vain attempt to compensate them for the GST. We all know it will not wash. The bill also provides for the use of tax file numbers for data matching purposes, with the objective of strengthening compliance with the provisions of social security law. The Australian Taxation Office currently provides Centrelink with information on a regular basis. Data matching is carried out using identity data such as name and date of birth. The presentation of this bill gives me the opportunity to report to this House on the plight of many veterans in the community. I have received numerous representations from the veterans community over their entitlements and the shoddy way in which they have been treated by this government. The bill fails to address the fact that the living standards of many in the veterans community are declining. The enactment of this bill certainly does not alleviate in any way the harsh treatment dealt out to veterans by this government. In fact, I note in recent correspondence from the Totally and Permanently Incapacitated Federation of ex-service men and women that many members expressed dismay at the constant and apparent lack of concern by this minister and the previous minister. In a recent series of communications from members of the TPI, the following matters were highlighted as principal concerns. Firstly, there is the TPI special issue rate. The TPI special issue rate needs to reflect the realities of the year 2000. The compensation received does not compare with the actual costs of living. In comparison with the male total average weekly earnings, the TPI compensation is far lower. It is only responsible that consideration be given to addressing this issue. As Mr Eric True indicated to my office last week:",121,Representatives Main Committee
239,Mr Wilkie (Swan) (11.07 A.m.),"As we have noted the requirements for increasingThursday, 6 April 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 15505 Society has moved the goal posts on income, but the Department of Veterans Affairs has not recognised the changing game, and the losing team is the TPI veterans’ family. Whilst society’s typical family, with a two income base, has seen a progression into relative affluence, the TPI veterans’ family with one income base has seen a digression into relative poverty. Secondly, Mr True illustrated that pharmaceutical benefits needed to be reviewed. TPI veterans were originally entitled to all medication free of charge. The costs and procedures for paying for pharmaceuticals through the pharmaceutical benefits scheme have increased. Some drugs have to have the approval of Veterans’ Affairs before the doctor can prescribe these drugs. Governments have a responsibility to ensure that they are supportive of the rights of TPIs to be cared for in the appropriate manner. Once again, the bill does not include any reference to the problem in the schedule. Thirdly, Mr True is concerned that funeral benefits are not adequate. The current funeral benefit is set at $500 when a veteran passes away. The cost to the surviving spouse becomes a heavy burden. The solution would be to raise the amount. The TPIs have suggested that $1,500 would be more appropriate. Let all here also not forget that funerals will incur a 10 per cent GST. Does this mean that veterans will be entitled to an additional amount of compensation or will the government’s four per cent pension increase have to suffice? Fourthly, in communications that I have had with veterans, the issue of telephone allowances frequently comes up. At present, there are a number of ex-service people in the community who receive a telephone allowance, and the people who draw the largest telephone allowance are World WarI veterans because they are considered, due to age and disability, to be in need of a phone. It might be that the government needs to review the allowance for all veterans meeting disability criteria. I fail to see any evidence of this contained in schedule 3 of the bill. Fifthly, there is the issue of gold passes for travel. Reduced pension reduces the ability to travel within Australia. Concession rates for travel vary between states. There should be a national program with standardised arrangements and conditions. Finally, in relation to the carers pension, the TPI indicates that the allowance should be reinstated to wives/partners of TPIs. It must be remembered that wives/partners who are carers save the government money by accepting responsibility for providing care, as well as accepting the enormous responsibility for the task at great personal expense. Again, unfortunately, given the impost of the GST on the veterans community, I believe the government is remiss in not using the bill to assist these veterans. We must not forget that veterans were applauded before leaving Australia’s shores to defend Australia and support peace in the world. They should be fully supported by the government of the day for this sacrifice, especially when granted compensation at the totally and permanently incapacitated special rate. The second issue I would like to discuss pertains to social security. We all remember the $1.6 billion worth of cuts in recent budgets. They contained quite a number of measures which we in the opposition found objectionable. They do not seem to have worked particularly well. I note, from a press release from the shadow minister, the following statistics: almost a two-month increase in waiting lists for people on benefits; the abolition of earned credits and the imposition of 100 per cent effective taxation on the unemployed; 100,000 more children growing up in families where no parent works; and over $5 billion in total cuts to social services, if we include labour market programs, education, training and child care. There is no doubt in my mind that a number of the measures have had a very adverse effect on Australia’s social security safety net. In government, members on this side of the House had no more significant objective than to construct a comprehensive and social income security safety net. The tale has altered somewhat over the last four years. Members of the community have suffered inconvenience in service delivery and reductions in services. In 15506 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 April 2000 government, Labor managed to provide for needs in a way that did not impose a large burden on budgetary outlays. Our social security spending as a proportion of GDP was a bit over eight per cent. It was a relatively low proportion of GDP by the standards of most developed countries, particularly European countries. Yet we were able to reconcile that relatively low level of spending on a system which, by and large, was relatively effective as a safeguard against poverty, compared with systems in other countries that consume a far higher proportion of GDP. How did we manage to achieve this? We placed an enormous emphasis on effective targeting of assistance. This is an area that consumed a huge amount of policy making time when we were in government. It is the way to reconcile an adequate social security safety net with a relatively low level of taxation to GDP. I fail to see any evidence of these strategies in the Social Security and Veterans’ Entitlements Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Matters) Bill 2000. Evidence suggests that we also avoided a great deal of the so-called churning that goes on in many European countries where payments are made to people on comparatively high incomes and then recouped by other means, principally through the tax system. I think that that was a very important achievement. The end product was a social security system that was amongst the most efficient in the world. As I have said previously, it was efficient in terms of its targeting. Of course, many would argue that this government also targets. If you are poor, a veteran, need an education or have a disability, then you are certainly a target. A great bulk of the assistance when we were in government did go to people who would otherwise have faced severe difficulties, and relatively small amounts were wasted on people who did not need that assistance. From the rhetoric offered by the minister for employment services, however, you would think that there are tribes of unemployed languishing on the beaches of this nation. We were also an efficient system in another respect. That was in a purely administrative sense. In 1995 a group of academics based at the ANU did a comparative study of social security systems in different countries. They reached the conclusion that, of the group of 10 developed countries they studied, ours had the second lowest administrative costs as a proportion of outlays. The significance of that is that we were able to do that notwithstanding having placed a great emphasis on targeting, which you would expect to impose some sort of administrative burden. The other area we focused on, particularly in the latter part of our period in government, was minimising barriers to people receiving assistance participating in the work force. I see no incentives in this bill. I do see, however, another $80 million over four years being taken from the expenditure on those most in need. Therein lies the heart of the matter. In implementing policy, we were not simply confining our attention to those on unemployment benefits. We were also very concerned to maximise the opportunities and to minimise the barriers to participation in work by people on disability or sole parent pensions through programs like the disability reform program and the jobs, education and training scheme, JET. We put very great emphasis on improving that access. We restructured the whole scheme of assistance to people on unemployment payments in the context of the Working Nation statement. We redesigned the income test to try to eliminate a situation where people could end up, if they raised their earnings from private exertion, losing dollar for dollar in social security entitlements over a very wide income range. That obviously was unacceptable and we redesigned the income test to address that. We also brought in other measures to avoid people being trapped in a state of dependency on social security payments. The introduction of the parenting allowance had, as a key part of its rationale, the elimination of cases such as that where one member of a couple who are both unemployed with dependent children might be offered a low paid job full time. Under the pre-July 1995 income test structure, people would go backwards financially as a result of Thursday, 6 April 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 15507 one member of that partnership or couple taking up a low paid full-time job. By contrast, I see a prominent community service organisation’s press release, ‘Government solves hardship by schedule 3 of the Social Security and Veterans Entitlement Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Matters) Bill 2000’. I do not think so. Other things we did included the introduction of employment education entry payments to help people who might have the option of a job but are precluded from taking up a job offer because they cannot buy suitable clothing or work wear. In the case of people with disabilities that is a particularly serious problem. It is also a problem for people on unemployment benefits. We brought in earnings credits so that people with regular earnings through casual work do not suffer a major disincentive through the operation of the income test. We also introduced, quite late in the piece, the possibility of people on unemployment payments receiving lump sum advances to help them begin to acquire clothing or tools or whatever where the absence of those might be impeding their taking up full-time work opportunities. There was a whole raft of measures, which we implemented over a period of years, to try to tackle the problem of disincentives and barriers to people on social security participating in the work force. We also placed considerable emphasis on compliance measures. When in the mid-1980s there was no doubt that the whole compliance regime and antifraud regime was somewhat slack, a good deal of effort was put into addressing that problem. Our system was reviewed in 1993 by an internationally recognised expert, Professor Weatherby of Harvard University, who concluded that the slackness which had existed had been largely corrected. He said that to go too much further than we were proposing to do at that time would start to raise serious problems about unreasonable infringements of civil liberties and real questions about the cost-effectiveness of further measures. I would like to see Professor Weatherby’s review of this government’s record. I think a great deal was achieved in bringing about a more adequate social safety net, making sure that it was efficiently targeted and administered, and overcoming barriers to work force participation by people getting social security payments while at the same time taking effective steps to minimise fraud and abuse of the system. The Working Nation statement was a very major effort in the latter regard where we announced a very substantial increase in assistance for the unemployed through labour market program assistance. However, at the same time we said that, if we were going to have that very large boost in assistance to the unemployed, we did think it reasonable to introduce a tightened scheme of reciprocal obligations. In the context of the Working Nation exercise, within the government at the time we had quite a debate about the appropriate level of tightening and severity of penalties for people not complying with administrative or activity agreements. There was significant tightening, but it was done in the context of a comprehensive package of further measures designed to assist the unemployed find work. This bill contains no such vision. It is a very different situation to be tightening reciprocal obligations under those sorts of circumstances compared with doing it in a situation where you are doing the exact opposite. This bill will just exacerbate the effects of the billions ripped out of the social security budget in the last four years. The government introduced the youth allowance from January 1998 by merging all major forms of income support for young people, including the youth training allowance, the Job Search allowance, the Newstart allowance, Austudy and Abstudy. The youth allowance is means tested on parental income and covers young people aged 16 to 20 and students up to age 25. These changes should be considered in that context. Abolishing a minimum rate of youth training allowance and cutting off payment to 18-year-olds on the basis of parental income opens the door to doing the same for young people up to 25 years of age. The arrangements introduced by Labor gave pensioners and the unemployed an incentive to take up casual or temporary work that became available by allowing them to supplement 15508 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 April 2000 their payments without immediately or necessarily reducing their level of assistance. Now people may be deterred from taking up this kind of employment, making their attachment to the labour force even more marginal. A total of 122,000 customers a year receive reductions in payments for periods of time, saving $259 million over four years. I conclude by indicating that the Social Security and Veterans’ Entitlements Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Matters) Bill 2000 has been a lost opportunity for the government. It could have used the parliament for positive outcomes for both the veterans and the social welfare fraternity. It did not. Instead, we have a mechanical bill linking increases in payments to members of these communities with compliance mechanisms for international portability. I have endeavoured to highlight that these communities need more. They need the government to rethink its position on the past reductions in services for veterans and social security beneficiaries. Above all, the government needs to construct a vision for the future, not just a new tax and not the continuing obfuscation of social security. Security and Veterans’ Entitlements Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Matters) Bill 2000. This amendment gives effect to a range of 1999 budget savings measures and other matters. The bill seeks to make changes to international payment rules, including portability and qualifying criteria. Whilst this measure is said to be aimed at standardising portability rules across payments including those for veterans, which in itself is not an objectionable goal, the government expects to get savings from doing this. This may provide an opportunity for the government to use the simplification process to cut people’s access to benefits. The government has also included changes to the use of the tax file number to strengthen compliance during data matching. The opposition has no objection to this as it will improve compliance. Another change contained in this bill ensures the four per cent pension GST increase is extended to those participating in the pension bonus scheme. However, pensioners, including veterans and self-funded retirees, will be severely disadvantaged by the GST package compared with those on higher incomes. Pensioners and self-funded retirees, for example, spend most of their income on basic items such as food, clothing and electricity, whereas higher income earners spend more on luxuries. The price of luxuries will come down under the GST because the wholesale sales tax will be abolished, but the price of many basic items will go up. In short, the cost of living for veterans, other pensioners and self-funded retirees will go up by more than the cost of living for wealthier people. Pension increases are linked to either 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings or CPI, whichever is the greater. The GST should push CPI increases ahead of male total average weekly earnings increases and become the benchmark for future increases in pensions. The government has argued that the compensation arrangements will see the pension kept ahead of any increases in the cost of living. However, this position is flawed because, first, increases are pegged to CPI, which means the average inflation of a basket of goods, not the spending patterns of pensioners. Pensioners are likely to spend more on items that will increase by more than the average. In other words, the CPI pension increase is likely to underestimate the GST price hikes actually experienced by pensioners, leaving them shortchanged. Second, pension increases are paid in arrears, six months after the CPI increases are recorded. During the half-year lag between the increases in prices and the adjustment of pensions, people will be left short. Pensioners and self-funded retirees spend all of their income and run down their savings, whereas higher income earners spend only part of their income and do not pay GST on their savings. Higher income earners get the biggest income tax cuts. The top 20 per cent of income earners gets around half the income tax cuts, but full age pensioners do not benefit from tax",124,Representatives Main Committee
240,Mr Gibbons (Bendigo) (11.25 A.m.),"I rise to participate in this debate on the SocialThursday, 6 April 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 15509 cuts since they do not pay any income tax. Self-funded retirees paying income tax will receive some benefit from an increase in the taxation threshold from $5,400 to $6,000 a year and from reductions on the marginal tax rates, but not as much as high income earners who will get the lion’s share of the tax cuts. For these reasons, Labor believes veterans, age pensioners and most self-funded retirees will be considerably worse off under the GST. There are also a number of other technical changes to the associated social security legislation. The majority of these measures are of a minor nature. As I mentioned before, the changes standardise and centralise provisions in the Social Security Act 1991 relating to domestic residence requirements and overseas portability of social security payments and other related payments. Also, they complete a regime for providing compensation to social security payment recipients in respect of the goods and services tax; generalise an existing requirement for claimants and recipients who obtain comparable social security payments from foreign countries; simplify domestic residence requirements, particularly exemptions for refugees and holders of certain classes of visas; provide for data matching and social security payments, using tax file numbers; and remedy numbering anomalies in social security related legislation. Many of the pensions and allowances-and pension rate calculators-in the pre-existing Social Security Act 1991 contain a requirement that the claimant or recipient must be ‘in Australia’. Some pensions and allowances allow temporary absences. Thus a person may be overseas for a limited period while still being considered to be ‘in Australia’ and may therefore continue to qualify, subject to other requirements such as the activity test. The remaining payments are largely subject to international portability rules that allow a recipient to be paid, or a claimant to qualify, while he or she is overseas. Some payments are made portable by the operations of the Social Security (International Agreements) Act. Others are made portable by specific provisions in the Social Security Act. The proposed changes address these areas and the opposition supports these minor changes, but the Howard government needs to adopt a far more compassionate approach to other veterans issues. I refer mainly to the eligibility criteria for the gold card. On8 February last year I briefly raised in this parliament the matter of the unfair criteria used by the government in allocating the Veterans’ Affairs gold card. I would now like to outline in some detail examples of ex-service people in my electorate of Bendigo who were informed by the Department of Veterans’ Affairs, in writing, that they may be entitled to the benefit, only to be informed that they were ineligible under the criteria set out by the Howard government. These people, all over the age of 70 years, volunteered for service because their country needed them, and most are suffering health problems as a result of that service. To their surprise they were informed they were not entitled to get the same benefits that other service men and women are now receiving. What an extraordinary way to treat people who unselfishly put their country ahead of their own interests. Mr George Blythe is just one example, having joined the Australian Navy 18 months after the end of the Second World War and served on a minesweeper at the tender age of 17 years. A previous bill expanding the old gold card criteria failed to take into account people like Mr Blythe. The criterion of wartime is based on the incurred danger test that occurred between the period stipulated by the Veterans’ Entitlements Act as being 3 September 1939 to 29 October 1945 inclusive. At the time of that debate, my colleague the member for Reid, as shadow veterans’ affairs minister, emphasised the point that, under the amendment, veterans serving in subsequent bomb and mine clearance work are not considered World War II veterans for the purposes of the gold card. He called on the minister to explain why, and whether it was just an oversight. In his right of reply, the minister failed to give a satisfactory response. 15510 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 April 2000 Clearly, Mr Blythe, who served in mine clearance work, fits into the government’s category of ‘unforgotten veterans’. During the qualifying period, he was obviously too young. He informed me that he would have signed up much earlier had he been old enough, and he in fact completed his medical much earlier than the time stipulated. He joined as soon as it was legal to do so and spent 12 years in the Australian Navy, serving on HMAS Swan, a minesweeping vessel, as well as having a post in the occupation forces in Japan. Whilst Mr Blythe served on the Swan, he and other crew members had to recover the bodies of four dying seamen from the waters near the Great Barrier Reef after a mine exploded during a sweep and sank HMAS Warrnambool. The four sailors died aboard HMAS Swan and the body of another was never recovered. As I have told this House before, the mines did not know that the war was over. Mr Blythe spent nine years at sea living in cramped conditions and eating off the floor of the vessel. I have had further representations from Mrs Helen Herrick, the Honorary Secretary of the Bendigo Ex-service Women’s Club. Mrs Herrick is concerned over the inflexible guidelines that prevent many ex-service women-who gave exemplary service as anti-aircraft gunners, searchlight operators, wireless operators and cipher assistants, and in a whole range of other duties, all of which were unselfishly undertaken at a time of great peril in this nation’s history-from receiving a gold card. AgainI urge the government to reassess the criteria used in granting the gold card, to allow these people who served in hazardous occupations after the war to apply for and receive the same benefit as those who served in the 1939-45 war. I believe the government has a moral obligation to ensure that the people who served in these sorts of situations are treated exactly the same as those who fit the government’s criteria. Not to ensure it would provide a classic example of the need being far more than this government-which is not renowned for its compassion-is prepared to meet. If that is so, the government should be condemned for it. Social Security and Veterans’ Entitlements Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Matters) Bill 2000. The purpose of this bill is to standardise and centralise provisions in the Social Security Act 1991 relating to domestic residence requirements and overseas portability of social security payments and other related payments; to complete a regime for providing compensation to social security payment recipients in respect of the goods and services tax; to generalise an existing requirement for claimants and recipients to obtain comparable social security payments from foreign countries; to simplify domestic residence requirements, particularly exemptions for refugees and holders of certain classes of visas; to provide for data matching and social security payments using tax file numbers; and to remedy numbering anomalies in social security related legislation. As other speakers on this side of the House have said, the opposition generally supports this legislation, although I am aware of concerns about the amount of time that has been given to the opposition for scrutiny prior to, and since, its introduction. So we reserve our right in the Senate, as I understand it, to consider the matter further. This is essentially a technical bill which covers a range of different activities and payments that relate to veterans. In the debate so far this has allowed people to be relatively wide ranging in their comments on this matter. I would like to raise one particular issue in that context. I note that the bill mentions the goods and services tax, and I will use that as an opportunity to talk about aspects of that in the context of veterans. I was recently at a meeting of the Complementary Health Care Council in Melbourne where former RSL national president Sir William Keys was a guest speaker. On that occasion, Sir William raised a number of issues regarding complementary health care products, particularly in relation to veterans and the circumstances they face. A press release from the Complementary Health Care Council on that occasion states:",128,Representatives Main Committee
241,Mr Griffin (Bruce) (11.35 A.m.),"I will be relatively brief in my comments on theThursday, 6 April 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 15511 Former RSL President Sir William Keys today expressed strong concern over the Government’s decision to impose the GST on complementary healthcare products that are important to the health of veterans. ‘Many veterans are elderly and on modest incomes. They will be particularly hard hit, as are those who are managing a chronic condition by using complementary healthcare products. ‘It also imposes a tax where none currently exists, which is unfair and impacts on our diggers who have served us so well.’ Sir William recalled the value of complementary healthcare such as traditional Chinese medicines, vitamins, minerals, anti-oxidants and western herbal medicines in helping to beat his prostate cancer. Many veterans use complementary health care products to manage conditions that may be related to war service, including those related to alcohol and tobacco use, chronic pain and especially stress. Some of these complementary health care products are covered by Veterans’ Affairs but the majority of the most useful are not-for example, solpomedol in the treatment of prostate cancer, St John’s Wort in the treatment of depression and antioxidants in the management of inflammatory disorders of the joints and the skin. It is poor health policy to discourage people from seeking to maintain good health or to encourage them to rely on expensive drugs because they are listed on the PBS and therefore subsidised. I think this particular issue in the context of the veterans community does highlight that there is a problem in relation to the health care of veterans. There is a problem in the general community, but there is a problem particularly in relation to veterans in this case. Beyond that, as other speakers have mentioned, there is a range of issues concerning veterans which this government has not taken up in recent times-issues around the question of TPIs which were mentioned by the member for Swan and also in relation to gold cards which were mentioned by the member for Bendigo. The real issue here is not so much what is in this bill but what could have been in this bill and the circumstance that the government should really be looking at addressing some of these wider issues. I know from correspondence I have received from various parts of Australia on veterans’ issues that there seems to be a large amount of disquiet within the veterans community with respect to the minister and his performance. I note that the TPI group in Western Australia passed a motion of no confidence in the minister, which I think the member for Canning would be aware of. I think that highlights that there are some real issues to be addressed. With respect to this particular bill, it will go forward from today and will be considered by the Senate. As I said earlier, the opposition, as I understand it, will be considering the matter in more detail probably at that level, but no doubt the guts of what is there will in fact pass into law. That is probably a good thing. But the issue here, and the issue that I wish to raise today, is about saying that there are some things that the government has to look at in the veterans’ community and it ought to be looking at them now in order to ensure that those who have served this country well in times of war in years gone by get their proper recognition by the government of the day. Ms BURKE (Chisholm) (11.40 a.m.)-I rise to speak on the Social Security and Veterans’ Entitlements Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Matters) Bill 2000, which gives effect to a range of 1990 budget saving measures. Sadly, again most of this relates to savings as opposed to looking after these people. The specific changes relate to international payment rules, including portability and qualifying residence; changes to the use of tax file numbers, which strengthen compliance during data matching; changes ensuring the four per cent pension increase is extended to those participating in the pension bonus scheme; and technical changes to associated social security legislation. As most people speaking on this bill have pointed out, it is actually a fairly complicated area. I suppose that is the nature of the area of 15512 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 April 2000 social security and also the area that the government has impacted upon by the introduction of a radical new tax, which makes everything a bit more complicated yet again. In speaking on this bill I feel I must point out that, once again, the government has been deficient in its handling of its legislative agenda. It has shown its usual contempt of the parliamentary process by not allowing the opposition sufficient time to consider the bill and its implication for the people it will affect. This allowed for no discussion with the group that will be affected and for no appropriate consideration by the opposition of all the issues. Whilst the ALP will be supporting the bill before the House today, we point out there are several concerns in respect of the portability arrangements for DFACS recipients, and these arrangements perhaps could have been better worked through if we had had time to actually consider the bill before us. One of the issues the ALP is in support of is the use of tax file numbers as a primary source of data matching. Whilst it is welcomed, it does presuppose that the tax file number is sound and is an integral source of information on personal identity. This is at complete odds with a recent Audit Office report which has uncovered that there are currently 3.2 million more tax file numbers than there are Australians. While some of this can be explained away by the existence of company trust TFNs, we cannot account for 3.2 million extra tax file numbers. So whilst there are benefits in data matching, we need to ensure that what we are data matching against actually has some integrity. The ANAO report No. 37 for 1998-99 on the management of tax file numbers-which is currently being reviewed by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration-has discovered that there are actually some serious deficiencies with the tax file number. I am hoping that this bill and others and the audit report will impress upon both the Australian Taxation Office and Treasury-who, I hasten to say, showed the recent public hearing a fair degree of contempt when it came before us and had not even read the audit report-that the ATO should take urgent action to ensure the integrity of the TFN system and its implication for the ABN system and how this will impact upon the operation of the GST. So while data matching is supported and should be encouraged to ensure that there is compliance, we actually must be matching against something that has integrity, and currently the system does not. Whilst this act also relaxes certain qualifications for reserve forces to attend training courses outside Australia-and this is probably welcome-it does nothing to rectify the damage done to the reserve forces by the second wave IR legislation, which removes reserve force training from awards and has made it impossible for people to undertake reserve activities and to serve their country. I think that is something that needs to be looked at. I, like other people, also welcome the independent review of the service entitlements for South-East Asian service from 1955 to 1975. It is my understanding that the opposition, through the Senate’s estimates and question time, has sought to highlight the discrimination against service personnel. The opposition has argued that veterans who served in the Naval Far Eastern Strategic Reserve during the Malayan Emergency, at Ubon in Thailand and as ground crew in Vietnam all have strong cases to be eligible for full service benefits. I have no doubt that there are veterans and their families living in my electorate of Chisholm who will greatly benefit from the implications of the recommendations straight away. Speaking of veterans, Chisholm is blessed with a vigorous and active veteran community. We have the Box Hill RSL, the Clayton RSL and the Oakleigh RSL. They are integral parts of the local community and I make it my business as the local member to give my full support to their activities. Late last year they helped me organise a signature book to be sent to Australian troops serving in East Timor. I had a book at my office and circulated three amongst the RSLs, enabling hundreds of signatures to be obtained across the electorate and Thursday, 6 April 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 15513 sent as a message of support to our troops in East Timor. This was a wonderful thing, and we had a lovely letter back from the armed forces in Timor welcoming that book. It was a great thing to circulate amongst my electorate. It is interesting to note, from a response I had to a question on notice to the minister last year, that we have 2,102 veterans residing in Chisholm who are receiving benefits. I have had the opportunity to meet with many of these veterans who have been involved in almost all of Australia’s engagements and conflicts. There are many issues that they often need assistance with in terms of their benefits and entitlements. It is an area that is very confusing, as I am sure most people in this place will know. WhilstI deal with as many as I can, I am blessed in Chisholm with having very capable RSL officials, such as Peter Davison in Box Hill, Ray Scott from the Clayton RSL and the stalwart Arthur Larson in Oakleigh, to whom I can refer most pressing matters. They generally have an answer quicker than most government departments on these issues. They all do a tremendous job in advocating on behalf of their members and they go beyond that: they are fantastic community advocates and they do a lot of work above and beyond their work for veterans. UntilI became an MP I never realised the amount of work done for veterans and their families by the local RSLs and war widows organisations. These organisations will have their work cut out dealing with the effects of the GST on veterans’ entitlements. Not only will recipients on fixed incomes find that the GST compensation still leaves them out of pocket; they will be hit by the application of the GST on complementary health care products. Sir William Keys, former RSL president, has raised the salient point that many veterans are older people on modest incomes who suffer from a range of chronic illnesses which can now be treated by complementary medicines. The tax on complementary medicines will affect many Australians who use these medicines, but will have a disproportionate effect on the veteran community. Once again, we ask the government to lift the burden of taxation from these medicines for the benefit of all Australians and, most acutely, for veterans. There is a further issue I wish to raise in relation to Vietnam veterans. There are still many outstanding issues as to the health care needs of Vietnam veterans and their children. Whilst much scientific evidence is available, there is still no answer on what future directions should be taken to address these issues. I ask all members of parliament to address the physical and psychological problems of Vietnam veterans and their children as a matter of urgency. I would like to draw to the attention of the House a petition that is currently being circulated amongst veterans in the wider community. I will read what the petition is calling for: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws the attention of the House to the need for urgent assistance for Vietnam veterans’ children due to their fathers’ exposure to 31 toxic chemicals and antimalarial drug Dapsone during the Vietnam war. Your petitioners ask the House to support decisions in Volume3 Validation Study on Morbidity of Vietnam veterans and children, revealing: Increased levels of spina bifida in children of veterans Veterans’ children’s death rates above those expected based on Australian community standards Cancer ... Cleft lip/palate ... Suicide rates three times more prevalent in veterans’ children Extra body not assessed due to no corresponding community date ... There are so many issues of health needs for Vietnam veterans and their children that are going begging and that need to be urgently addressed by this House. I call on people to support the petition that is currently being circulated. 15514 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 April 2000 Finally, I would like to touch on the issue of social security entitlements that were amended by this bill. In my electorate I have quite a large population of aged pensioners, totalling over 7,000 in the suburbs of Box Hill, Box Hill North, Burwood and Ashwood. I spoke on the adjournment about my fears that pensioners would lose out under the GST with the pittance being offered as compensation. I also expressed alarm at the government’s increasingly negative portrayal of all welfare recipients as a burden on the system we can no longer afford. To examine the government’s form on this you only have to look at the massive cuts to social security they have ushered in during their time in office. As described by my colleague the member for Lilley in his submission to the welfare review, the Howard government have cut $5 billion from social service programs such as labour market programs, social security SD\PHQWV FXWV WR GLVDELOLW\ DOORZDQFH WKH OLVW JRHV RQ²DQG WKLV ELOO LV WU\LQJ WR surreptitiously make more cuts. This has created an enormous social deficit. The government are comfortable in talking about budget deficits, but refuse to acknowledge the social black hole they created as if it is somehow less relevant. Whilst we generally support the measures in this bill pertaining to portability of benefits, the government stands condemned for its handling of the sensitive issues surrounding welfare recipients. Trumpeting cheap, ‘blame the victim’ language is no substitute for good policies that provide both a buffer and hope to the many Australians who rely upon the government for income support. Finally, I place on the record, as we are coming up to ANZAC Day, the importance in my electorate of celebrating ANZAC Day, not just for the veterans community but for all Australians. In Chisholm, we are blessed by the presence of Mr Roy Longmore, who is one of the three last surviving Gallipoli war veterans. While Gallipoli was a time of great significance for Australia on the world stage, it resulted in 25,000 Australian casualties, including 8,000 people who were killed or died of wounds and disease. Such is the horror of war, and it is why we need to ensure that those who served our country and lived through these incidents are given the best possible access to benefits, allowances and medical care as they reach their twilight years. thank members on both sides of the House for their contribution to the debate on the Social Security and Veterans’ Entitlements Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Matters) Bill 2000. I make special mention of the contribution by the member for Parramatta-indeed, his contribution to many debates. This bill gives effect to measures announced as part of the 1999 budget relating to the simplification of international payments relating to portability and the use of tax file numbers in data matching of employment declaration forms-EDF-the prescribed payment systemPPS-and the reportable payment system-RPS. The bill also makes some minor amendments relevant to the four per cent concession for social security payments associated with the introduction of the government’s tax reform package. Schedule1 of the bill amends the Social Security Act 1991 to allow for changes in international portability provisions. At present the rules relating to portability vary from payment to payment. The measure will standardise these rules as far as possible subject to the qualification rules that apply to each payment. This bill will also provide for the standardisation of portability rules, the consolidation of working life residency rules and the phasing out of special needs pensions and extends to two years the short residence rule. Uniformity is a key feature of the portability requirement of this measure. Portability of a payment overseas is conditional on continuing qualification and, where qualification is maintained, all payments will be portable for up to 26 weeks. Currently, a person claiming or receiving a social security payment may be required to make an effort to claim a comparable",130,Representatives Main Committee

This bill will extend this requirement to all countries. However, so as to encourage people to come forward and disclose a potential entitlement to a foreign payment, a social security amnesty will operate until January 2001. This amnesty will be limited to income from foreign pensions. During the period of the amnesty, all Centrelink customers will have the opportunity to declare their foreign pension income to Centrelink without risk of penalty. As part of the bill, minor amendments will also be made to the provisions relating to qualifying residence rules for Australian entitlement, with a view to achieving better consistency. I turn to the data matching provisions in the bill. Currently, the ATO regularly provides Centrelink with data, with data matching being carried out using identity data-for example, name or date of birth. There are difficulties in identifying customers who have inadvertently or deliberately provided different personal details to the ATO and Centrelink. These measures provide for the tax file number to be used as the primary matching key, with the objective of strengthening compliance with the social security law, particularly the provisions dealing with the income test. The Privacy Commissioner has been consulted in respect of the changes. Matching will be undertaken in accordance with the commissioner’s guidelines. As part of the tax reform package, social security pension rates are to be increased by four per cent from July 2000 to compensate for the effects of the GST. The four per cent increase in pension rates will take the form of a pension supplement and will be added to a person’s maximum basic rate of pension. Amendments were undertaken in the A New Tax System (Compensation Measures Legislation Amendment) Act 1999-the compensation act-to incorporate the pension supplement into social security law. Amendments need to be made so that the four per cent increase will also be applied in the calculation of a person’s pension bonus and in working out a farmer’s maximum basic entitlement for the purpose of the retirement assistance for farmers scheme. Earlier today in the House, in talking to this part of the bill, the member for Lilley once again proved his failure to understand the real benefits of tax reform and the associated compensation to pensioners and retirees. Pensioners will always be better off having received a savings bonus. The two savings bonuses that will be paid as part of the new tax system will help to maintain the value of savings and the retirement income of older people. This is particularly welcome in my electorate of Richmond where, in the Tweed, over one in four people are over the age of 65 and a higher proportion are over the age of 55. The member for Lilley claimed that pensioners will be worse off by receiving their savings bonus. The clear facts are that pensioners can receive a bonus payment of up to $1,000. Pensioners can decide to invest this bonus or they have the choice of spending this money. On top of the savings bonuses, the government will also be providing other forms of generous compensation, including the 2.5 per cent increase to the assets test threshold and reduced personal income taxes through a number of measures in the tax system-including higher income tax free areas, reduced marginal rates of tax, more generous treatment of franking credits and the abolition of provisional tax. This bill will provide for a much simpler way of dealing with portability and residency requirements for social security payments. It will do this by standardising provisions relating to domestic residence and overseas portability requirements. The bill will also complete a regime for providing compensation to social security payment recipients in respect of the new taxation system. It will also provide for more robust systems of data matching social security payments through the use of a tax file number. 15516 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 April 2000 Once again, I thank members for their contribution to the debate and I commend the Social Security and Veterans’ Entitlement Legislation (Miscellaneous Matters) Bill 2000 to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Primary Industries and Regional Services Committee Report Debate resumed from 16 March, on motion by Fran Bailey: That the House take note of the report. this is a subject which is close to your heart because of where you live and the nature of your political affiliations. Looking at the report, I am sure people will see that it has generally been done in a very comprehensive way. With great respect to my colleagues who are on the House of Repesentatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Regional Services, the people on it certainly come from a broad spectrum of the Australian community. I think that some of them would have had very little personal experience of living in a region outside a major metropolitan area; nevertheless, they have produced a report which has far-reaching implications. However, I think the report is limited, and I think it is limited by the scope of the inquiry. I noted with some interest the list of people who had given evidence before the committee and the various parts of Australia to which they had travelled to take evidence. I have to express my concern because they have not taken evidence from areas I regard as extremely important. Whilst they traversed parts of North Queensland, they did not visit the Northern Territory, the northern part of South Australia or anywhere in Western Australia north of Geraldton and Carnarvon. A huge portion of Australia’s landmass was not visited by this committee. No evidence was taken from those areas by this committee, so it may not have contemplated the issues which are relevant and important to those communities. WhilstI think it is appropriate for a general policy framework to exist, and for the committee to make recommendations in the form it has, I do not think it is appropriate that when it is writing these sorts of reports it does not reflect on the fact that one size does not fit all. In the context of northern Australia, I can say very clearly that many of the recommendations in this report will not fit. When I hear discussion in this place about regions and the bush, it is not the bush I know. It is not the regions I know. It is not the sparsely populated areas of northern Australia. I think that is a failing in this report. I want to demonstrate how it is failing. I note, with interest, the report’s recommendations on telecommunications. Whilst these recommendations may be appropriate-and I am not certain about that-for western New South Wales or south-west Queensland or regional Victoria or the northern part of Tasmania, I do not think they are appropriate in the context of the Northern Territory. I do not think they are appropriate in the context of remote areas of Australia generally. One of the issues which stands out to me in reading this report is that, in the context of telecommunications, there is a very clear view that somehow or another the tendering out of the telecommunications USO will benefit regional Australia. I have to say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, as someone who has an interest in this matter, that I do not think that is the",134,Representatives Main Committee
243,Mr Snowdon (Northern Territory) (11.58 A.m.),"Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, I know thatThursday, 6 April 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 15517 case. What this report confirms to me is the absolute and fundamental necessity to retain a majority shareholding in Telstra and to ensure that Telstra has the responsibility of delivering the USO across Australia. That does not say that arrangements cannot be made about particular sorts of technologies and particular companies participating in the delivery of those USOs. Large areas of northern Australia have just a basic telephone service in some cases-and in some areas not even that. The only telephone service for a community of 50 or 100 people is one public telephone booth under the current arrangements. Given the dispersed nature of those places, who do you think might provide those communities with appropriate telecommunications infrastructure? At what cost would it be provided? It is all very well for those who are advocates of the tendering out of Telstra’s services to argue that they can compete in the provision of capital infrastructure. But at what cost? I argueand I think there is a great deal of merit in this view-that if Telstra is taken out of the field because of competitive tendering arrangements, ultimately you will see not only a dramatic fall-off of the infrastructure and services that exist but in some places the developments we hope would accrue to those communities as a result of the USO will not happen. If you look at the telecommunications industry, it is very clear that those people who are competitors in a deregulated market are organisations which are after the cream. They are not interested in providing infrastructure in areas which are loss makers and they are not likely to be interested in areas which are loss makers if a proposal were ever implemented which provided for the tendering out of these services. I fear for regional Australia-not least the part of Australia that I live in-if these sorts of proposals are brought to fruition, as I know that this government’s agenda is that they should be. I am most concerned at what this will mean for the communities across Northern Australia. I note that when debates have taken place previously in this place those people who have been most outspoken about this particular issue are indeed members of your own party who live in Northern Australia, who understand-at least I hope they understand-the implications of this particular policy proposal on their communities. They, like me, have a great concern about what this will mean. They do not live in Batemans Bay, they do not live in Orbost and they do not live in Launceston. The people I am talking about, whose services I have regard for and must have concern about, live in very small, remote Aboriginal communities. You would get the picture if you were listening to the debates in this parliament that regional Australia is all about pastoral properties, farms and that sort of thing. Northern Australia is not like that. The bulk of the population who live across Northern Australia and outside of the major urban centres live in small, remote Aboriginal communities. I do not think that the policies and the proposals which are in this document on shaping regional Australia come anywhere near addressing the concerns of those communities. I have a view about this, which I have had for some years, that having the big vision is certainly smart; you have got to have it. But understanding regional difference is also important and I do not believe this document sufficiently contemplates regional difference. What we should be doing when we are developing policies on regional Australia is understanding difference, understanding diversity and understanding the needs that different places have across this nation. To do that requires a new approach to providing infrastructure and services to remote Australia. WhatI would like to see is something built on some proposals which I made public in 1996 about the development of regional agreements between collections of communities and government about the provision of services, whereby the government would contract with these regions for the provision of services, where they understand that state governments do 15518 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 April 2000 not necessarily deliver what they are supposed to. In the case of the Northern Territory that has been writ large and made very clear by recent reports into education. We have to ensure that those communities get the rights which they are entitled to. I hear a lot about an issue advanced currently by the Prime Minister in the name of practical reconciliation. Let me say to the Prime Minister, and to all those who might be interested in this subject, that practical reconciliation is providing people with their rights as citizens. Every Australian citizen, every Australian person, has a right to a decent education. Every Australian person has a right to a decent health service. Every Australian person has a right to community services. The only people who largely do not get these services in this community are Aboriginal people who live in remote communities. The Prime Minister says this practical reconciliation means providing remediation in education, remediation in health and remediation in community services. What the Prime Minister should be doing and what this report should reflect is that these people are being denied, and have been denied by governments for a long time now at the state and territory level, their basic citizens’ rights of access to employment, education, health care and infrastructure. The provision of those services is not practical reconciliation. It is just providing people with the rights they expect, and should expect, as Australian citizens. One of the other issues which this report traverses is roads. I note with interest a couple of the recommendations, one of which refers to the notional allocation of a proportion of fuel taxes towards roads infrastructure. I do not oppose that idea-it is probably very good-but, again, I do not think it contemplates at all the nature of the task. The provision of regional roads in the north-west of Victoria, the south-west or the south-east of Queensland or the north of Tasmania is nothing like the road task which exists across Northern Australia. We are talking about hundreds of kilometres of dirt roads. We are talking about linkages between communities, where transport carriers have refused to travel across those roads and transport the essential infrastructure, the goods and services that those communities should be able to expect. And they have done that because of the poor state of the roads. On 15 MarchI pointed out in this place the costs of running a road train across the Tanami Road. The Tanami Road is a very important road in Northern Australia because it leads from Alice Springs, effectively, to the gold province in the Tanami-with a large number of gold mines but also a large number of Aboriginal people living in remote communities such as Yuendumu and Nyirripi. I am told that the cost of running a road train across this road is roughly twice the cost of running a road train up and down the Stuart Highway. A prime mover is worth $350,000. The costs of running these vehicles are enormous. The people who will end up paying the cost of these vehicles running across these roads are in the end, of course, the people who live in these small, remote communities. This report goes nowhere near contemplating their needs. This report is deficient because it does not understand or appreciate the needs of people who live in these parts of Australia. People in this place would be wrong to believe, for whatever reason, that when you talk about regional Australia you can use a catch-all phrase which will mean everywhere in regional Australia. What we need in this country is an analysis of regional difference, an analysis of regional need based on real needs, the specific needs of those regions. We should be looking at analysing a distribution of regions across Australia and ensuring that they are funded appropriately. That requires this government and any future government taking a different approach to the way in which they fund these communities through state and territory governments-in my view, funding a large number of them directly on the basis of need, on an analysis which could be done for them by the Commonwealth Grants Commission, and bypassing state and territory governments. These are ideas which I have canvassed before and I will be publishing them in one form or another in the near future. Hopefully, they will add to the policy debate about the needs of regional Australia. Thursday, 6 April 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 15519 Debate (on motion by Mr Pyne) adjourned. Motion (by Mr Pyne) proposed: That the Main Committee do now adjourn. Telstra: Emergency Paging Service another service from regional Australia, in spite of the Prime Minister’s commitments to regional Australia during his recent trip around that part of the world. He said there will be a red light flashing in his office every time a regional service appears to be going to be withdrawn. The electricity company providing the power for that light must be a privatised company because that light is not working even though Victoria’s emergency service organisations have been informed by Telstra that their emergency service organisation paging service is to be discontinued, putting the effectiveness of these organisations at considerable risk. The CFA, for example, has some 600 alphanumeric pagers and over 300 tone pagers around the state of Victoria with around 1,250 individual fire brigades using the equipment. The CFA has around 1,200 ERS7 systems across that state providing over 6,000 primary and backup emergency core answering points for brigade members. The ERS7 system is also scheduled to be phased out over the next three years. Paging systems are the most effective way any emergency service organisation can alert their people in the field. One message can be transmitted simultaneously to multiple receivers. This provides the organisations with an instant call capability, unlike the mobile phone network where each station or person has to be contacted individually. Remember that these firefighters are predominantly volunteers and quite often they are in work environments where they are not permitted to take mobile phones, such as hospitals, et cetera. For example, in the house fire or bushfire situation a quick alert and response time is absolutely crucial, with a potential loss of life a likely consequence. Telstra has not put forward any alternative system or technology to replace the systems now in use, preferring its competitors to take up this marginally profitable service. The CFA alone spends some $4.5 million per year with Telstra and have not been given the slightest consideration in the phasing out of paging services. If Telstra considers a $4.5 million per year client not important, what hope do individuals or small businesses have in regional and outback Australia when they complain about lack of service or a long wait for connections? People in regional Victoria rely on a large number of volunteer firefighters to give up their time, and often these firefighters place their own lives at risk to provide a vital firefighting service to their communities. The very least Telstra can do is to provide them with an appropriate and effective alert system to enable them to respond in the shortest possible time. Emergency service organisations are not the only users of Telstra’s paging systems. Doctors also use the system because it allows them to be contacted for emergencies whilst they are close to very sensitive electronic medical equipment. Mobile phones, again, cannot be used in this environment because they interfere with that sensitive medical equipment. When will the minister and the government intervene and direct Telstra to act in accordance with the wishes of the people who own it and assisted it to become one of the most successful communications carriers in the world? Telstra, in the year 2000-this company which is owned by the Australian people-chooses to opt out of providing emergency paging systems because they are not profitable. I also remind the chamber that Telstra is heading towards a profit for this financial year in excess of $4 billion yet they do not want to be involved in a vital paging service which can actually save lives. We hear so much about Telstra’s much trumpeted universal service obligations, but what about their good",136,Representatives Main Committee
244,Mr Gibbons (Bendigo) (12.13 P.m.),"I rise today to talk about the withdrawal of yet15520 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 April 2000 corporate citizen obligations? Telstra does not seem to understand the term and continues to ride roughshod over the wishes of the people of this country, people who need and rely on their products and their services. I call on the minister for communications to intervene and to use his influence to ensure that Telstra continue to provide these services because, if they cannot find the ability to provide the service for the $4.2 billion profit, then I think that is a classic argument to retain all of Telstra in total government ownership. Para Hills Soccer Club Northfields RSL Sub-Branch Games. Colleagues may have noticed that yesterday I had the honour of wearing a Para Hills Soccer Club night soccer guernsey in our great parliament. The guernsey was presented to me by the Para Hills Soccer Club secretary, Charles Kelly, with permission from club president, Keith Payenbrock, last Saturday at the clubrooms at ‘The Paddocks’on Bridge Road, Para Hills. My electorate of Makin, one of few across Australia, has two soccer clubs-not one but two-which have been chosen because of their outstanding facilities, organisational ability, and cooperation between key stakeholders-local council, state government and, of course, federal government-to host several Olympic soccer teams during the Olympic Games. Many people at Para Hills are extremely excited, and are looking forward to this tremendous honour and opportunity. I would like to pay tribute to the hard work of the many volunteers and all of the mums and dads of our soccer stars who make the running of the club so successful: people who work the bar, the canteen and the barbecue; people who run the raffles and organise the fundraising events; the coaches and the team managers; and, as I said earlier, the mums and dads who get their kids to training sessions and the matches which are played at many different venues. Without all the above mentioned people willing to help in the way that they do, Para Hills Soccer Club would not be so successful. A special note of thanks must also go to all of the sponsors who make the running of the club so successful. On a separate matter, but with more good news for my electorate of Makin, the Northfield RSL Sub-branch will receive a $5,900 grant from the federal government to improve wheelchair access and upgrade club activities. Honourable members-That’s generous! Scott, approved the veteran and community grant administered by the Department of Veterans’ Affairs. The veteran and community grants help develop projects that provide practical support to veterans and ex-service communities across Australia. Projects funded are wide-ranging and include providing capital funding for residential care facilities, promoting health issues, encouraging healthier lifestyles, fostering social and personal support services and improving access to community care services. The Northfield RSL Sub-branch will be using this grant to construct a wheelchair ramp with handrails and to upgrade toilet facilities. The grant will also be used to replace the tables, indoor bowls mats and pool tables and purchase a barbecue hotplate. This grant demonstrates the federal government’s commitment to meeting the needs of the people of the Makin electorate. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate John Dodd, the Secretary of the Northfield RSL, and all of his colleagues, for the hard work in preparing the submissions to secure the funding for this construction.

247,Mr Tanner (Melbourne) (12.21 P.m.),"Several weeks ago, I and many other membersThursday, 6 April 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 15521 a just tribute, it was entirely merited and it was very good to see that the entire Australian community has acknowledged the tremendous work and the great courage that has been displayed by our forces in East Timor. WhatI wish to do today is to pay tribute to another group of heroes, very much a forgotten group of heroes, mostly from the Australian defence forces but also with some police involvement, and that is the Australians who have participated in and continue to participate in Operation Bel Isi on Bougainville. Currently there are about 250 Australian personnel, most of them military, serving in this peace monitoring operation that has now been going on for two or three years. Most significantly, these personnel are unarmed. So we have Australian military personnel and police personnel in one of the more dangerous locations in the world, unarmed, monitoring the peace process. To me, it is true courage, genuine courage, that in such a dangerous situation, where there has been considerable loss of life and turmoil in recent times, these Australian heroes are there unarmed ensuring that peace can be maintained. Australia provides the commander of this force and approximately 80 per cent of the overall personnel and also substantial logistical support, helicopters, landing craft, trucks and the like. The role of Operation Bel Isi is to monitor the cease-fire, to ensure compliance and to promote confidence in the cease-fire, to instil confidence in the local inhabitants and to help train local police and associated personnel. To the best of my knowledge, nobody else has yet paid tribute in the parliament to the participants in Operation Bel Isi. I thought it was appropriate, Mr Deputy Speaker, that we should pay such a tribute because, however much we rightly focus on the exploits of our troops in East Timor, we should not forget that there are Australian personnel performing similar functions in other parts of the world, often involving great courage. I would like to conclude by reading some extracts from an article written for an ADF magazine by Lieutenant-Colonel Stephen Joske, who was a commander of one of the rotations and is somebody I have known for a very long time. I will quote some of his statements: It was a dynamic situation. We were interfacing with people on the ground, in the villages, the marketplaces and the countryside. There had been a number of false starts towards restoring peace in Bougainville, the last one in 1994 and the people were naturally suspicious about our overall intent and at least at the executive level, were initially reticent to engage with us. They thought we may come in, raise the flag and their hopes and then leave. In addition there were many around the island who had no idea why we were there. It was not surprising therefore that they were suspicious of “these people wearing military uniforms with bright yellow hats and armbands”. However, the people who were expecting us were overjoyed that someone was there to help them restore peace. Still, at first we didn’t know what to expect. The day we arrived we started on a 167 kilometre journey down the east coast of the main island. Would we be ambushed, or worse, shot? What about mines, broken bridges, swollen rivers, crocodiles? ... The country we passed through on our journey was lush, with dense, tropical vegetation, an omnipresent mountain range shrouded in mist, and a coastline with crystal waters and palm trees. Jungle tracks were rudimentary and most bridges had been sabotaged, their decking used by local people for their cooking fires. Often all we had were 2 inch thin railway lines to carry the landrovers and trailers across 200 metres of slippery, wet bridge. We progressed inch by inch, terrified of losing valuable communication equipment. Often there was not even a rudimentary bridge and we had to ford rivers which were starting to fill with early monsoon rains. The inevitable happened. One vehicle stuck fast in the rapidly flowing, muddy water. However, everyone knew exactly what to do. Winches were organised and within 40 minutes the truck was rescued, safe on the river bank. At the end of 12 hours we had travelled only 160 kilometres. It was exciting, it was exhausting, it was real testimony to the training of the Australian soldiers. I can only endorse the conclusion of Lieutenant Colonel Joske’s article, which reads as follows: 15522 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 April 2000 The Bougainville experience has been and will continue to be extremely rewarding for Australian soldiers, many of whom have been deployed away from Australia, into a potentially dangerous situation, for the first time. They have developed leadership skills, learned perseverance, patience and ingenuity, and have had the opportunity to use skills, learned in Australia, in a real contribution to peace. These are true Australian heroes who have not received the recognition that they deserve. I think that going into such a dangerous situation unarmed in order to monitor peace takes genuine courage, and I applaud them. Petrie Electorate: Redcliffe Peninsula Ms GAMBARO (Petrie) (12.26 p.m.)-I rise to speak about the recent elections held for the Redcliffe City Council in my electorate of Petrie. Firstly, I congratulate Councillor Alan Boulton on his re-election as mayor of Redcliffe and all of his councillors who were all returned. That is absolutely unprecedented in the history of the Redcliffe City Council elections. Anyone who is familiar with the area would have noticed the great changes that have been going on in Redcliffe. An extensive advertising campaign has renewed tourist interest in the area and now we have a huge number of day trippers from Brisbane visiting the peninsula every weekend. Mr Deputy Speaker, Redcliffe, arguably, has the best seafood in Queensland. I know that you are quite often in the chair when I speak about the seafood delights of the area, but the local restaurants and cafes that serve the excellent Moreton Bay bugs, mud crabs, prawns, whiting and numerous other types of fishRedcliffe seafood festival and the sun girls competition recently attracted 20,000 visitors to a Marcia Hines concert on the foreshore. We have brought back the sun girls and they are ambassadors for the city. Local businesses have been doing very well from the increase in tourist numbers and many new developments are going ahead on the Redcliffe Peninsula. It is interesting to note in this climate that the state member, Ray Hollis, who is also the Speaker of the Queensland parliament, who should be supporting employment and growth in the area, has criticised Mayor Alan Boulton’s administration for their excellent initiatives on the peninsula. I was quite appalled to hear some of the comments by Mr Hollis, who seems set on returning Redcliffe to the bad old days when Redcliffe was a depressed area. It is interesting to read the letter to local residents from the state member, Ray Hollis, criticising the Redcliffe City Council for their hard work promoting prosperity and growth on the peninsula. Most of us are very pleased to know that we have a council which is determined to attract investment and subsequent local employment to an area that has seen some very hard times in the past. In fact, it was not long ago, when I became the federal member, that Redcliffe was called ‘Deadcliffe’-a terrible name which I hope we will never go back to. Mayor Boulton and his council have worked hard to reduce crime rates in the area, develop the foreshore, upgrade and build the new jetty, and produce television advertisements which promote Redcliffe as a terrific place to visit, through the vision business advisory group that has been set up. The people of Redcliffe recognised the hard work done by this council when they re-elected them a couple of weeks ago. It is a shame that our state member has blamed the council for a number of things. He has also blamed the council for increased property values causing an increase in rates and rents for low income earners and pensioners. He must not have read his own government’s property valuations when he said that, because they came out two days after the Brisbane City Council elections-surprise, surprise-and the values for most areas of Brisbane were hiked up by as much as 36 per cent. Unfortunately, on the",140,Representatives Main Committee

So the state member for Redcliffe was wrong, wrong, wrong again. Those of us who are working very hard on a local and federal level to improve growth and employment, particularly for our young people, are absolutely appalled by the comments of the state member. As I go about talking to local business people, they tell me that they are pleased to see increased trade and investment in the area. They are putting on more jobs; they are giving young people an opportunity. The Redcliffe Peninsula is thriving and it is on its way upwards. There is only one place to go-upwards. The people of Redcliffe Peninsula would be better served if their state member did something for them-if he took the trouble to convince his own state government to do a few things, such as increasing the money spent on the long neglected Houghton Bridge. In conclusion, I congratulate Mayor Alan Boulton and his team on his re-election. As the federal member, I look forward to helping him in every possible way so that we can make the area a better place, improve the job prospects of our young people and make sure that investment continues to grow on the Redcliffe Peninsula. Aboriginals: Reconciliation Ms JANN McFARLANE (Stirling) (12.31 p.m.)-I stand here today feeling sad and quite ashamed about what has happened with reconciliation in Australia. I want to talk a little about my experience in working with and being a friend of many Aboriginal people and also about the concerns raised by many people on what is happening in the electorate of Stirling. For a framework, I draw your attention to the annual report of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation for 1998-99. The Chairperson’s introduction says: The Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation enters the final eighteen months of its life with confidence that the people’s movement towards genuine reconciliation between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and the wider Australian community continues to be a powerful influence in Australian society. The momentum towards reconciliation has become unstoppable, notwithstanding the difficulties and obstacles that always lie in the path of processes involving fundamental changes in social institutions, attitudes and behaviour. Chapter1 is headed ‘Council’s tasks-Enabling legislation’. It states: The Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation was established, with unanimous cross-party support, as a statutory body under the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation Act 1991. The functions and powers of the Council as prescribed by that Act are set out ... It then goes through the preamble to the act and explains the rationale for reconciliation in Australia. It then goes to the council’s strategic plan for 1998-2000-the period we are in. The first goal is documents of reconciliation; the second goal is partnerships in reconciliation; and the third goal is the people’s movement for reconciliation. Many people have expressed to me their view that, if we are going to move on in Australia and have a positive outlook in the new millennium, then there are many issues we must address-and reconciliation is high on the agenda for many ordinary Australians even though they may not be a vocal voice. I want to draw the House’s attention to an experience that I have had. I know Doris Pilkington, the woman who wrote the book Follow the Rabbit-Proof Fence. Her Aboriginal name is Nugi Garimara. This is a wonderful, inspirational story of her mother and two aunties who were taken from Jigalong mission in 1930 down to Moore River Native Mission. In those days Aboriginals were valued. On page 16, it is stated: The British colony was said to be an excellent settlement for hiring labourers and most colonists preferred Aboriginal workers to others. “Black servants, I find,” wrote George Fletcher Moore in his Diary of Ten Years, “are very serviceable in this colony; on them we eventually depend for labour, as we 15524 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 April 2000 can never afford to pay English servants the high wages they expect, besides feeding them so well. The black fellows receive little more than rice-their simple diet. Aboriginals were valued in the community and were valued as workers. They could contribute to the colony. I will talk a little about Nugi’s mother and two aunties. They were three half-caste girls who the community were looking at. The Aboriginal protection people thought that it was best to remove them from their families and raise them so that they had white people’s ways. This book talks about the three girls. On page 41, it is stated: The girls were fortunate to be part of a loving, caring family, who tried to compensate for all the nasty insults and abuse by spoiling them and indulging them at home. Their grandfather even went so far as to take them on walkabout in the bush when he ground black charcoal into fine powder and rubbed it into their bodies, covering them from their faces right down to their toes. This powder, he promised, would solve all their problems. It would darken their light skin and end all the teasings and tauntings, but most importantly, it would protect them and prevent them from being taken away from their families. What eventually happened to these three half-caste girls-as I will call them although they are identified as Aboriginal and belonging to the Jigalong community and the people there-was that in 1930 Constable Riggs, a protector of Aboriginals, took them a long way by sea down to Moore River Native Mission outside Perth. This book is the story of how these three girls, a 14-year-old and two younger girls, escaped and followed the rabbit-proof fence all the way back to Jigalong. It is one of the most wonderful inspirational stories because these girls took a journey that many white people could not have taken without horses, servants and whatever. The girls returned to their community. They were taken again. Again one of them escaped and followed the rabbit-proof fence as the desire to be reunited with her family was so strong. These stories are inspirational. I hope the Prime Minister might take the time to read this book and show some leadership in getting reconciliation back on track, accepting that taking children from their families caused devastation at many levels in the communities and to the people and is with us today. Unless we address it, Australia is going to continue to be a sad and sorry place to live in. Kurnell Peninsula: Sandmining environmental issues that face the Kurnell Peninsula and the surrounding marine habitat. The first was the problem facing the Towra Point Wetlands. Erosion of the coastline, the ingress of salt water into a freshwater lagoon and consequent displacement of the bird population there has occurred because of the construction of the third runway. The second issue was the disappearance of the oyster leases which were in the Georges River running into Botany Bay. The third issue was the pollution of neighbouring Cronulla through sewage output into the ocean and the waterways at Port Hacking. The fourth issue was the disappearance of sandhills at Kurnell due to careless sandmining operations. I am pleased to report that a great deal of progress has been made with regard to Towra Point Nature Reserve, helping oyster farmers and improving sewage treatment off Cronulla. Environment Australia and the National Parks and Wildlife Service committed to a cooperative effort to address the management of Towra Point. Funding from the National Wetlands Program and support from the Wildlife Service led to two projects being funded by the federal government, a review of the 1986 plan of management for the reserve, and investigation into options for addressing shoreline erosion. An amount of $100,000 was allocated by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage. Recently, a further $25,000 was matched by the New South Wales government. Environment Australia has established the Botany Bay Intergovernmental Ministerial Group, which will meet over the next four to six weeks to discuss environmental issues in the bay. I am delighted the group will be looking at combating the QX parasite that has decimated",142,Representatives Main Committee
250,Mr Baird (Cook) (12.36 P.m.),"In my maiden speech 18 months ago I highlighted fourThursday, 6 April 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 15525 our local oyster industry. I would also like to commend Senator Rod Kemp for his hard work in brokering a deal between the New South Wales Oyster Farmers Association and the Australian Taxation Office to ensure that oyster farmers will have an extra year for their transition into the new tax system. In 1995, the state Labor government promised the people who used the beaches off Cronulla an upgrade to the Cronulla sewage treatment plant to provide tertiary treatment. It has taken years for delivery on that promise. I might add that it is only because of the constant pressure brought to bear by the state member for Cronulla, Malcolm Kerr, that movement has been made towards the achievement of this goal. The consortium brought together for this project is on target to complete the plant upgrade in March 2001. Unfortunately, the issue of the sand hills at Kurnell is one in which little headway has been made. Anyone not from the area who has seen the movie Forty Thousand Horsemen, which was shot in the undamaged parts of the Kurnell sandhills on the shore at Botany Bay, will have a picture of this area of Sydney. If James Cook was a torchbearer in the Kurnell leg of the Olympic torch relay this September he would hardly recognise the place since he was there last in this month 230 years ago. I am sure he would be disturbed by the levelling of all but two of the massive sand dunes. Likewise, botanist Joseph Banks would be perplexed to record mangrove erosion and that the forests of mahogany and blackbutt have been felled and replaced with infestations of pampas, bitou bush and lantana. Breen Holdings and the Holt Group have been mining the sand for decades. When I was a young boy I used to play frequently in the sandhills of the area. I fondly recall a school excursion that went to re-enact the landing of Captain Cook when I felt that I was somewhat miscast to represent one of our indigenous people-of course with a lot of assistance in terms of cosmetics to change the colour of my skin. It shows how much we have moved in that time to consider that we had that re-enactment at that time on that basis. The fact is that we have a land area which has been decimated. It had blackbutt timber on the area, then it had sheep. The dingos and footrot wiped out the sheep population and then cattle were brought in. The cattle eroded the grass that was on the sandhills to a point where there was nothing left but the sand. These were magnificent; they were used in films and for all kinds of things. Then they moved into mining. Not much is left of the original sandhills and we have, in fact, simply holes in the ground in many areas that are being filled by all types of substances brought in from other areas. It is a great tragedy. I am seeing Philip Holt, the current owner of the land area, and we are going to look at what can be done to rehabilitate this very important and historic area of Sydney. Aged Care: Riverside Nursing Home the article by Darren Gray in today’s Melbourne Age which puts the events of the Riverside Nursing Home into some perspective. What it says is that under Labor Riverside was not the place where we would want our loved persons to be. Labor has proven to be impotent in its efforts to protect the well-being, the dignity, the health needs and the personal support requirements of residents at Riverside. All one needs to do is to look through some of the standards monitoring visit reports from 1993 to see a litany of concerns raised by the then department with the operators of the facility which led the department to recommend the closure of the facilities. Where was the Labor government? Where was the Labor administration under Carmen Lawrence and her predecessor, Brian Howe? Did they close Riverside? No. Not because there was a lack of compelling evidence that it needed to be closed, and not because there was not a list as long as your arm of concerns about how residents were being treated and the condition of the facilities, but because there was a lack of will. They were not prepared to make the hard decision to close Riverside in the interests of",144,Representatives Main Committee
251,Mr Billson (Dunkley) (12.41 P.m.),"I rise today to draw the parliament’s attention to15526 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 6 April 2000 the residents that were there. The reason being offered was that there was no alternative accommodation. Minister Bishop deserves the credit and the support of the parliament for taking decisive action in the interests of the residents of Riverside to find appropriate accommodation and to move on with this sorry history of neglect of senior and frail citizens of our community at Riverside. We cannot forget where we have come from. When the first physical assessment of residential aged care facilities in this country was carried out by this government, 227 of those facilities identified as substandard were in Victoria. What do Labor want to do? They want to go back to the very same regime that allowed those circumstances to emerge, that permitted so many facilities to be of substandard physical condition and that allowed this sort of substandard care for the ageing and frail residents and people’s family members-the loved ones-to endure in those later years. There is no point going back to that old system; that old system failed. That old system brought about the concerns that are itemised in the standards monitoring visits reports going to the very heart of the dignity, the physical needs, the health care, the supervision and the condition of the facilities at Riverside that Labor failed to act on. When this government was elected, we started to see some improvement at Riverside because the proprietors got the very clear message that the coalition was concerned about the care and the dignity of our most frail and oldest Australians. They have failed to meet those standards and it is a credit to the government for acting decisively to deal with the residents’ interests. Main Committee adjourned at 12.44 p.m. Thursday, 6 April 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 15527 Thursday, 6 April 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 15529 The following answers to questions were circulated: Private Members Business: Office of Parliamentary Council Assistance (Question No. 1192) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Attorney-General, on notice, on 17 February 2000: (1) What capacity do Senators and Members have to seek assistance from the Office of Parliamentary Counsel (OPC) in the drafting of private member’s bills. (2) When OPC provides services to draft private member’s bills, is this done with his knowledge and consent. (3) Has he given consent to OPC assisting with the drafting of private member’s bills since he became Attorney-General; if so, (a) for which bills, (b) on what basis was approval given to OPC and (c) what was the cost of the assistance. I am advised that: (1) The Office of Parliamentary Counsel (OPC) is available to provide assistance to Senators and Members in the drafting of private members’ Bills, subject to the demands of the Government’s legislation program. For instance, under Program Management Budgeting, OPC’s objective was expressed along the following lines: To enable the Government to carry out its legislative program, and (subject to Government priorities) to assist private members with their legislative requirements, by drafting Bills and amendments to Bills and supplying them to Parliament. In general, the demands of the Government’s own program rule out OPC assisting in the drafting of private members’ Bills. However, from time to time OPC drafters give informal advice on particular issues to staff of the Parliamentary Departments involved in drafting private members’ Bills. As well, OPC drafters sometimes draft, or redraft, proposed non-government amendments to Bills at the request of Ministerial or departmental staff, and those staff sometimes supply the amendments to the sponsoring nongovernment Members or Senators. (2) I would not normally be informed of OPC involvement in the drafting of private members’ Bills or amendments as described in answer to question (1). In the unlikely event that First Parliamentary Counsel considered it might be appropriate to make a significant commitment of drafting resources to a private member’s Bill, I would expect her to raise the matter either with me or with the Parliamentary Business Committee. (3) I have not consented to OPC assisting with the drafting of any private member’s bill since I became Attorney-General. However, as mentioned in OPC’s 1998-99 Annual Report, OPC did draft a private member’s Bill (the Adelaide Airport Curfew Bill) during that year. The Bill was originally drafted in 1998 on the instructions of the then Department of Transport and Regional Development, and was also mentioned in OPC’s 1997-98 Annual Report. The Department had been authorised by the Government to assist the Member concerned in connection with the Bill, and approached OPC about drafting assistance. Since the Bill was to draw heavily on the Sydney Airport Curfew Act 1995 that OPC had previously prepared, it required minimal drafting resources to prepare. The minor revisions of the Bill done after the 1998 election also required minimal drafting resources. On each occasion OPC was able to make those drafting resources available without significantly interfering with normal drafting work. Having regard to the Government decision and to the minor use of drafting resources, First Parliamentary Counsel took the view that it was appropriate to make drafting resources available but that there was no need to raise this matter with me or with the Parliamentary Business Committee.",145,Representatives Main Committee
