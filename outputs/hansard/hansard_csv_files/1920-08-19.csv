I understand that action has been taken against the Federal Government, or the Minister for Trade and Customs, in connection with this matter, and I wish to know whether it comes within the same category as a case sub judice. If so, is the discussion in order ? son) -If the matter is not already before the Courts, or pending knowledge of that; hut if that is so, the honourable member for Flinders will not be in order in proceeding. action being taken, and I am merely raising this pointgiven to understand that a writ has been issued in the matter. In that case, the honourable member will not be in order in proceeding to discuss a case with which the Courts are about to deal. not in any way challenging any action of the Government? It is necessary to collect Customs duties to-day, ancl to continue to collect them; and all I wish to discuss is the basis on which those duties shall be assessed. I make no sort of reference to anything connected with the legality of any action of the Government in the past, or any action the Government may take in the future. No question of that kind is involved in my motion; I merely raise the question of the administrative rule we are going to follow in Australia. member proceeds on that line, he will be in order. not ir. any way touch on any question that can come before the Courts, but refer only to such a question that Parliament may discuss. I have spoken on the subject before, and do not wish to weary honourable members; but I may remind them of the present basis on which the calculations are made by the Customs authorities in determining the duty to be paid on any article. The present procedure is that, where any goods are invoiced in a foreign currency-to take an easy example, that of France-the Customs authorities take the numbers of francs which the goods have cost, and turn them into pounds on the par or gold basis of exchange, namely, 25 francs to the £1. exchange. is not the term generally used in popular discussion. The goods may have been bought for 5,000 francs, and when the account is settled for the goods the rate of exchange is taken at 50 francs, and £100 is paid. But when the goods arrive in Australia, the Customs authorities do not credit the statement that they have cost £100, but say that they cost £200, and proceed to levy duty upon the £200 at the rate Parliament has fixed. That naturally leads to goods imported from a country with a depreciated exchange costing a very large amount in comparison with the amount actually paid by the purchaser. The other side of the case is that some other countries, such as America, have an appreciated exchange, and the result is that such countries pay less in duty on goods imported to Australia than the rate Parliament has authorized to be collected. For instance, if the American rate of exchange is $4 to the £1 and goods are bought on that basis, $400 will buy only £100 worth of goods. When the goods arrive here, the Customs authorities refuse to accept them as having cost £100; but say that the cost was only £80, because the rate of exchange is $4.85 to the £1. Thus, on goods from countries which have a depreciated exchange duties are paid in excess of the rates fixed by Parliament, whilst on goods from countries which have an appreciated exchange, the duty paid is less than the Department is entitled to collect. Never before in the history of the world have we had fluctuations of any magnitude in exchange. During the period of the war all nations took steps to keep up their own exchange. As honourable members know, Great Britain sold millions of pounds worth of foreign securities owned in Britain in order to keep the exchange stabilized. Other countries took similar steps. I have here the rates of exchange, high and low, of various countries, during the war period, on the date of the",21,Adjournment Formal Foreign Exchange And Customs Duties

I do not appreciate the point of the honourable member's question. United States greatly exceed those from France and Italy. figures. The only other point to which I desire to refer relates to the basis on which duties have to be paid. Duties have to be paid, as honourable members are doubtless aware, on the home consumption value of the goods. The argument has been used that if an article costs 50 t francs in France, regard should be had only to the franc, and that the cost anywhere else is immaterial. It seems to me that there is one consideration which proves that argument to be absolutely wrong. For reasons which I shall give, we cannot consider the franc alone, and what it represents in France. stance, a woollen article purchased in France is composed of wool .bought from Australia, and for which France has had to pay Australia in francs on the adverse basis of exchange to France. That being so, the wool costs the French manufacturers more, and when it comes here again in manufactured form surely they are entitled to be considered on the basis levied on the existing basis. This means of what the. value of the wool is in the currency of the country where it was orieinnllv bought. stance. position by referring to silk and many other materials. Whether the article has come from outside or has been manufactured entirely in France, its cost has been increased by things used in its manufacture and imported from other countries where the exchange is against basis.

Coal, for instance, has to be imported by France, and is one of the things in respect of which she has to pay on the that has been paid for that commodity is represented in the goods in the manufacture of which it has been used, and which are coming out of France. It is grossly unfair to say that France shall pay-as the honourable she is required to do-for the things she imports on the adverse basis of exchange, and that when those materials come out here in manufactured form we should collect Customs duty on a basis which ouce more tells against the French manufacturer, and practically makes it impossible for him to trade. ways. deavoured to clearly set out the position.

Extension of time granted. be regularized if we are going to create these artificial barriers. We can regulate them only by allowing trade to run along its natural channels-by allowing it to go to the countries which can handle it, and For ingiving them the opportunity to regulate their own exchanges by the exports which are coming from those countries. Having spoken to people in nearly every trade in Australia, I can tell the House with confidence that it is impossible for Australia to place orders in Italy, France, or Belgium-while the exchange position is as at present, and while our Customs duties are the driving of more trade to America and Japan, and-ignorin g every other consideration-if carried far enough will merely add to the loss of Customs revenue which is takinrr place to-day.

55,Mr Bruce,"The exchanges can neverthe fair thing. I cannot conceive of the present basis being regarded as equitable. This is a matter to which the House should give its very serious consideration. The House should insist on something being done. I understand that the Minister alone has the power to take action. Section 157 of the Customs Act of 1901 provides thatWhere the genuine invoice sliows the value of the goods in any currency other than British currency, the equivalent value of the goods in British currency shall be ascertained according to a fair rate of exchange to be declared in case of doubt by the Minister. I venture to say that we are not giving to-day the equivalent value of the goods in British currency. In many cases when we start to collect our Customs duties we are giving something like double or treble the value. One other point which has been stressed and should be answered is that all these different countries have different values for goods. Because an article costs, say, so many francs in France it is suggested that that value is higher than the value of the same article somewhere else. Every day it is becoming more and more evident that the world is beginning to trade on the basis of what you can give in the equivalent exchange. A man who wishes to purchase certain goods asks whether he can buy them in. France with her exchange or in America? Prices the world over are beginning to regulate themselves on that basis, and will be so regulated more and more as the demand for goods of which there is a shortage the world over is met, and ordinary trading .competition comes about again in individual countries among their own merchants, and internationally, between countries. This is a matter that requires very careful consideration if we are going to do the best for Australian consumers, and are to fulfil an obligation which I feel rests on us to give fair and equitable treatment to all nations; but, above all, to give such treatment to those nations which rendered us the greatest assistance during the war. for Trade and Customs) [3.21] I am sure that the House heard with the utmost interest the speech of the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce), and I wish that it were possible, in the short time at my disposal this afternoon, to traverse the [151]-2 whole case, and to put the position fully from another point of view. I cannot state the whole case, however, because, as I mentioned a little while ago, an action at law has been brought against the Department, and I cannot deal with the legal questions involved. It is an action which challenges the right of the Customs Department to'claim duties on the basis about which the honourable member for Flinders has been talking. Queensland. It challenges the whole basis of our collection, and particularly the interpretation of section 157. The duty of the Minister is, of course, to see that the law is carried out by his officers; he has sworn to do that. The honourable member for Flinders has shown that if the Department were to adopt the practice which he asks us to adopt, it would get more revenue. We know that that is so, and it shows that in the action we are taking we are not reaching out after revenue, but are standing by principles which we think the law compels us to observe. If it were not for that, the position would be altogether different. If , as the honourable member has suggested, it were in the power of the Minister to alter the system, and we believed that the principles by which we stand enabled it to be altered, we might move in the direction suggested. take action himself, he could have brought the question before Parliament. ter. Until the case to which I have alluded is settled, I do not think the law should be altered. We want to have the law determined, because, if the Customs Department is wrong, about £1,000,000 more of revenue will have to be collected, and the commercial community will have to pay it. If we have not collected this revenue, but should have collected it, the commercial community will be called upon to pay it. That, however, is not the question which I wish to discuss this afternoon. I believe that underlying the cases which the honourable member cited, and underlying practically all the illustrations that I have seen, there is a fundamental fallacy in the reference to £100 worth of good3, and not to the quantity of goods that £100 would buy.

But what I am satisfied is happening in countries with a depreciated exchange is that, as the exchange depreciates, manufacturers raise the home-consumption price; all the time as the franc depreciates, the French manufacturer is raising his home consumption price; and as. the honourable member says, that is the basis on which we are calculating thw duty. The peculiar position of the markets outside in the world to-day is such that the manufacturer finds that he can still ask the outside price that other countries are asking. I ask the ""honourable member whichpolicy will' sooner right the exchangea policy of continually raising the home-consumption price, and keeping the French and Italian goods at the world's level, or taking advantage, as it were, of the depreciated exchange to send goods out at the depreciated rate of exchange. Extension of time granted. submit for the consideration of the House, is that as the world's supplies become nearer normal, tpie countries with a depreciated exchange will be unable to get as ready a market for their goods as at the presenttime. W ill they not take advantage of the depreciated rate of exchange bo dump their goods wherever they like? I have shown clearly that what we are doing does not interfere with either the protective policy of the country or the preferential rate for Great Britain. I do not say they are doing it to-day, but those countries may take advantage of the depreciated rate of exchange to absolutely destroy not only the protective policy of this country, but also our preferential trade with Britain. France aud those other countries find throughout the world a ready market for their goods at the prices they are charging to-day; and I venture to say the French manufacturers, by raising the home consumption prices to the extent of the depreciation of the foreign exchanges, [3.43] -The question brought up by the are making fortunes, or ought to be. and say it costs exactly the same amount bo produce the article; then you say, "" Now there is a chance for the French to keep on gradually increasing the home consumption price, and to make fortunes."" That is not so. presuming the cost is the same in both countries, the country with the depreciated rate of exchange, notwithstanding the costi n that country, can dump goods in foreign countries. After; all. is said and done, the purchase of the bill of exchange is not a transaction directly between thebuyer and. seller of the goods. The purchase of the bill of exchange is a transaction which takes place betwjeen the seller of the goods and a third party; indeed, it is not even between the seller and the third party. W h a t happens is that the 1 maker or manufacturer takes this b ill of exchange to his hanker and gets the f u l l face value, whatever it may be, in. the currency of the country. The banker then proceeds to sell the bill of exchauge ko somebody else, to whom the purchaser finally pays the money. But does the fact of a t h i r d party intervening in a totally different transaction really affect the question I am arguing? I do not think so. I have here a very interesting calculation, showing exactly how the duties work out as between the various countries, but I do not wish to impose on the good nature of the House by reading it this afternoon. I hope to be able, a l it t l e later on, to put it in tbe possession of honourable members; and in the meantime I suggest that whatever we de at the present time it is most inadvisable, unti l the law is finally settled, and we know exactly where we are, to interfere or deal with this question at all. Whenever the question is dealt with, it must be in such a way that there will be no' doubt whatever as to the maintenance of the protective principles of our Tariff and our preferential position with Great Britain. These must be secure, whatever any country with a depreciated exchange may finally determine to do when it finds itself in the position, as it will be some day or other, to dump goods on the rest of the world. honourable member for Flinders( Mr. Bruce) is very complicated, and one in regard to which the Customs Department has a grave responsibility.

Sir BiOriERT BEST -There is no doubt that that is taking place, and the British Board of Trade has in certain circumstances endeavoured to protect the country against such practices by the in stitution of a licence fee on all importations from countries which have a depreciated exchange. We all have the utmost sympathy for France, Belgium and Italy. It may be that we are showing our feelings in a strange way, but, after all, this matter must be looked at from a purely business stand-point.

The equivalent of £300 in Italy is £804. mation ihere. through giving America .the advantage of estimating the exchange at 3.85 dollars to the £1. I am reminded, in passing, that the French manufacturer buys Australian wool, and pays for it, not at the rate of 25 francs to the £1, but at' 50 francs to the £1. When the manufactured article is returned to Australia, however, and the value is reconverted at current rates .of exchange, it has ,to pay an extra heavy duty. Reverting to motor cars, if a machine worth £300 sterling were imported from England, and the duty were assessed at 10 per cent! on the value in the country of origin, the duty would be £33; on tie car from America the duty, ,-at 20 per cent., would be £66; and on the car from Italy, at 20 per cent., £66.

But by the present system we are depriving 'Great Britain of the 10 per cent, preference which Parliament intended to give. I realize that the discussion that has taken place this afternoon will not carry us much further forward. The honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce) was certainly quite justified in raising the question, since it affects our business dealings in regard not only to silks and woollens, but motor cars and many other imports. For instance, monumental masons insist upon using Carrara marble from Italy. It is a clear, white marble, the like of which is practically unobtainable elsewhere; and if it were first shipped to England and brought here as coming from England, the English agents would reap an advantage which ought to go to the persons working it up in this country.

This question has now been under consideration of the Minister for some time, and the mere fact that litigation in regard to the legality of the action of the Department is pending should not operate as an excuse for further delay in coming to a decision. If our taxation in respect ot' imports from certain countries tells against those countries as compared with others, then I believe the Minister should, at the earliest possible moment, bring down remedial legislation. When the French Mission visited Australia .a little while back, they were met by the representative people of the Commonwealth, and the promise was made that we would do everything within our means to build up trade relations with the French, who had fought so nobly with us. The Customs Department, however, is being administered, so far as this matter is concerned, in a way that does not carry out the promises that were then made. We should provide for fair trade with France, Italy, and Belgium; but I find that we are giving a most decided preference to Japan and the United States. I have here a list-take n out in June last, and allowing for the exchange rates prevailing at that period-whic h shows that, assuming that the duty payable on certain goods coming from France, Italy, the United States and Japan, was 50 per cent., the duty actually payable on goods imported from France, owing to the exchange being so much against that country, would be 138 per cent. In the case of goods coining from Italy, it would be 167 per cent.; only 39 per cent. in. respect of goods coming from the United States of America, and 40 per cent, in the case of Japanese goods. I am satisfied that it was not the intention of this Parliament that such an advantage should be given to the United States of America and Japan, as against Italy, Belgium, and France. ber's figures are on the assumption that in each case we get the same quantity of goods for f 100. a citizen of the Commonwealth desires to purchase an Italian motor car at a cost of £200. Ho sends his £200 to Italy, and that in Italian exchange would be 17,000* lire. His bank would exchange that £200> for 17,000' lire, and when his car reached Australia the Minister, according to the present -practice-, would say to him, "" This car cost you not £200; but 17,000 lire, or, on the basis of par mint values, approximately, £670, and we will charge duty on that amount. in England of a similar car of English manufacture? would be sqmething like £200. orable' member is in error. decided to collect duty, not on the £200 paid for the Italian car, but on the 17,000 lire, would he accept payment in lire? in the currency 'of the country in which, it is payable. to my mind, is fictitious. I am convinced that honourable members will not be content to allow imports from countries which fought with us throughout the war to labour under'this disadvantage. I have not one word to say against the United States of America or Japan. If the preference were small, the position would be different, but the figures given this afternoon by the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce) also show that we are suffering an enormous loss by way of Customs, revenue, and I fail to see why any advantage should be given to the United States of America and Japan, as against France, Italy, and Belgium. I hope that there will be no further delay on the part of the Minister in dealing with this question. Over two months have elapsed since he promised to attend to it , and to come to a definite decision. If the honourable gentleman desires to continue this system of collecting duties, then the sooner the whole question is brought before the House in a way that will enable us to come to a determination the better for all concerned.

That being so, if the Minister says he is satisfied with the present method, I think the House should take action to show its disapproval of undue preference being given to the United States of America and Japan, as against the other countries I have mentioned. I sincerely hope that the Ministeri n the very near future will announce a drastic change. -We are making a mistake this afternoon in confining our attention to exceptional cases.

There are two sides to this case. am alwnvs prepared to make an effort to remedy that which is unfair, but I have yet to learn of any legislation passed by this, or any other Parliament, under which an injustice has not been suffered by some person or persons in the community. We cannot legislate to meet special cases. The United States of America is a country so nearly akin to our own so far as the habits and aspirations of its people are concerned, that if any preference were to be granted, I should give it to goods coming from that country rather than to imports from France, Italy, and Belgium, where some of the working conditions are very different from our own. Are we to expose our industries to such competition? My motto is, "" Australia first, and a long way first. "" A f t e r we have done our best for Australia, let us do our best for other countries which, in their aspirations, their social and wages conditions, most closely approximate to our own. As showing how son.10 writers view this matter, I quote the following paragraph :-If the method of calculating duty were altered in the way desired by the importers, one of the most serious and insidious attacks upon our Protective Tariff would be crowned with success. The Australian manufacturer would be exposed to undercutting by foreign manufacturers, and Australian development would be retarded for the benefit of the foreigner, who is concerned only with the restoration of his own trade, and is not in the least interested in the progress of Australia. honourable member quoting?

Unless we are prepared, as the true protectors of Australian industry, to raise our Tariff sufficiently high, America w ill export to Australia more largely than she has ever done. She is making her plans accordingly, and, starting off with this advantage as against Italy, France, and Belgium, she is in a better position than ever to increase her exports to this country. To-day the English-speaking races are more closely in touch than ever before in their history, and if to keep them so preference must be given against Italy, France, or Belgium, it should, in my opinion, be given. I think that the Minister has been fair. I cannot conceive of Parliament being asked to discuss a question that is to all intents and purposes before the Courts.",34,United States Op America

We are told by the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce) that we lose over £1,000,000 of revenue in connection with these importations, and I wish to know how the Customs Department bases its charges and collections on American imports. I followed the M in ister's statement regarding the £ 1 0 units, and agreed with his deductions. But suppose I bought a £500 motor car in the United States with a view to putting it on this market at a certain price, I should have to pay another £100 by way of exchange. cent., I understand. I wish to know why the Department would not charge duty in respect of the importation of such a car on a valuation of £610, which is actually what I would have to pay. If I bought a £500 car in Great Britain, the sum I paid for it would represent its total cost to me, putting aside freight and similar charges; but if I imported a car of the same value from France, it .would cost me only £250, while if I went to America for it , it would cost me over £600, and I ought to be called on to pay duty on that amount. If the Government is not collecting duty on the actual cost of the goods imported, and if the law will not allow it to do so, there is something wrong. question, we are verging upon the discussion of a matter which is sub judice; but on this occasion, it suits the Government to allow the debate to continue; if the decision that was given in regard to the discussion of another matter, in connection with which the name of a certain reverend gentleman was mentioned, were given effect, we could not continue the debate. I agree with the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce) that the people of this country'are being robbed when duty is not collected on the f u l l cost of the article imported. If duty is not charged on the cost of an article purchased fro m the United States of America plus exchange, the Department ought not to penalize importers from France by its exchange arrangement seems unjust to the people of Australia, in causing them to lose revenue; and unjust to the importers from France, Belgium, and It a l y .

I am sure that those gentlemen will be readily disposed to make available the data they have secured as a contribution to the progress of Australia's aviation, in which they have been taking such a distinguished part. 2. The Government realize that the development of civil aviation has an important relation to air defence, and proposals' in regard to this will shortly bo submitted to Parliament. Meanwhile, the Minister for Defence is engaged in an examination of the extent to which the Commonwealth will be associated with the organization of these activities with a view to ascertaining the lines upon which In discussing this action might proceed, and the field which would be left to State, municipal, or private exploitation.

Of course, if it does go the other way, it w ill work to the advantage of the primary producer; but we can say, w i th a great deal of certainty, that it w ill not.

190,Dr. Earle Page.,"Later, I shalldetailed the method by which the agreement was arrived at. The Government did nothing in the matter; it was two delegates of the producers who went Home and arranged the following contract :The Pool, with the Government approval has sold the exportable surplus of butter from the 1st of August, 1920, until the 31st March, 1921, as under:Price, 240s. per cwt. for 90-grade butter, with Is. per point up or down, with 3s. per cwt. additional for unsalted butter. Payments are to be made at the end of fourteen days after being placed in cool storage ot port of shipment or against storage warrants. Storage -The cost of storage in Victoria to be paid by the sellers for an average of six weeks; after that to be paid by the Imperial Government. Commonwealth Grader's Certificates issued when the butter was graded to be final. The East, and South Africa -The normal trade of tlie Enst is to be provided for. and up to 50 tons monthly to be released for shipment to South Africa. The price asked for was 252s. per cwt., but after bargaining a compromise was arrived at, as set out in the agreement. However, it is confidently anticipated that an increase w ill be granted by the Ministry of Foodi n Great Britain. contract ? that increase? will get it . honourable member learn that? which appeared in the press a few days ago stated that it was the definite desire of the Imperial Government to give the highest possible price, in order to encourage the fullest production in every sense. We have heard a great deal about placing an embargoupon the exportable surplus of butter, but what has always been the position ? The price of butter is high during the winter months in Australia, and keeps high u n t i l November or December, and then gradually, and sometimes suddenly, falls, owing to the fact that the later shipments from Australia come into a flushed market in Great Britain. In 1912, the highest price for Australian butter in London was reached in January. It was 134s. per cwt. This was fol lowed by a rapid decline u n t i l the middle of the year. In 1913, the price rose u n t i l it reached' 128s. in November, and then it slumped u n t i l the middle of 1914. Eveni n 1915, during the war period, the price reached its highest point in December, and then fell, and remained low unti l the middle of 1916. That is the normal position,^ and what we must expect, because Danish butter, which has always supplied the bulk of British requirements, w ill be available next year, as it was before the war. Honourable members of the Country party are opposed to placing embargoes on export, but when practically every cooperative society throughout Australia has decided to pool its butter, and accept the price offered by the Imperial Government, we think it is scarcely right for honourable' members on the Labour benches to seek to take steps which would permit a proprietary concern to sell its butter outside the Pool until October or November at a big price, and then ask to be allowed to come into the Pooli n January or February, when the price may be lower than 242s. per cwt. outside the Pool. There has been considerable criticism in regard to the personnel of the D a i r y Produce Pool. We have heard talk about "" middlemen,"" the avowed enemies of everything Australian, and everything decent and just. Mention has been made of Mr J. W . Sandford, who, as well as being a large merchant, happens to be the owner of the largest butter factory in A cablegram South Australia. Isi t conceivable that he would be desirous of securing less for the butter of the producers he represents in South Australia than can he got from the Imperial Government? he is interested in a distributing business in Great Britain.

The Queensland Labour Government, I understand, has fixed the price of butter, not at 240s. per cwt. as under this contract, but at 228s. per cwt. ? some time an exceptional surplus of butter. tional season in Queensland. practically every dairy farmer in Southern Queensland and Northern New South Wales was trying to secure a reasonable return for his produce to enable him to recoup his drought losses, Labour interests were sufficiently powerful to reduce the price by something like 20s. per cwt. in New South Wales. The same thing will happen again if Labour has its way, and that is why, in season and out of season, we urge that despite what is said by the Labour party, it is necessary that there should be in this House and in the count r y a strong body of producing representatives who w ill insist upon a fair deal for the primary producer. BiU is designed to give legislative power to an honourable agreement that has been made between the butter producers of Australia and the Imperial Government, and recognition by this Parliament seems to ibe necessary to insure that all butter the ( Mr producers in Australia shall stand up -to their obligations under it .

An y policy that does not give the butter producers, and all other producers, at the very least tihe world's parity for their commodities w ill not do justice to them. I congratulate the honourable member for Swan( Mr Prowse) on his choice of such classical words as "" blacklegs"" and ""scabs.""' In supporting the amendment moved by the honourable member for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney) that the I farmers shall obtain the world's parity for their exportable surplus of butter, I desire at the outset to refer to the statement made by the honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) that there is 'no evidence of the fraternity of labour in the proposal of the Labour party to make the labourer in England pay more than he would otherThere seems to be no wise do for his butter. If we had any I guarantee that the labourer in England would reap the benefit of any reduction no fault could be found with the honourable member's complaint. I would remind him, however, that the British Consumers in workingclasses derived no advantage from the fact that the price paid for Australian produce in England during the war was considerably less than that paid for the same commodities from other countries. Bread made from Australian wheat was' sold to the English labourer at the same price as that charged for bread made from wheat purchased from the United States of America, Canada, and the Argentine at nearly double the price that we received. It will be the same so far as our butter is concerned. We realize that if the Australian butter The producers of butter in producer obtained for his exportable surplus less than the world's parity, no advantage would be secured by the British labourer.

But the primary producers have suffered quite long enough; and even if the consumer does pay a little more, what does that matter so long as the return goes into the pockets of those who earned it ? That is what we are here to secure. Mudgee? Mudgee just what I am saying here. what was in the newspaper report. was in the newspapers; but I have always held that it was time that the primary producers were given a voice in the disposal of their produce. Now, when for the first time sometliiusr dpfinite is soiurht to be done in this direction, we find all sorts of chanres burled against men who have banded themselves tosrether in order to get fair play. In dealing with the dairv farmer we have to consider not only his wasres. hut also a return fo^ the whole of bis family. Unlike the worker in the city, who does his daily work and takes his wages home at the week end to his family, every single soul on the dairy farm does his or her share. The men, women, and children all help in producAgreement Bill. 3671 tion; and in assessing values the work of every one has to be considered. The dairy farmers have now got together, and through their organization have asfed the Government to give them some recognition. But when that is proposed there is a howl of protest from the Opposition. We are told by honourable members opposite that they are quite prepared to allow the farmers a fair return for their exportable surplus. They are quite prepared to let tbe farmers get higher and higher prices; but are they prepared to permit the same in relation to the dairy produce sold in Australia? It is no use talking of 'encouraging production for overseas markets if we deprive the producers of their home market. of their trade. have had the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Ryan) giving us a list of his colleagues who represent primary producers, though he is the man above all others who has depressed the price of primary products in Australia. He claims that his party is ready to do something in the interests of the primary producers; but there are men of my acquaintance who have been driven out of Queensland because of the impositions placed upon them by the honourable member for West Sydney when he was Premier of that State. In face of facts like these, the honourable member tells us that he is prepared to champion the cause of the primary producers. He finds fault with the Bill, which represents an arrangement between tbe producers themselves and the Imperial Government, under which the producers will have some chance of controlling their own affairs, and not only getting a better price now, but being assured of a price for twelve months ahead. This latter is quite a new advantage to tbe farmer, who has always been dependent on the sea°ons and fluctuating prices; never, from year to year, or month to month, could he be sure of a price; but now there is an agreement under which he has the advantages I have indicated. Tbiq Bill will give an impetus to dairy-farm.ing and production such as never before existed, and the primary p^dneers will feel convinced that the National party really has their interests at heart",47,Moloney Bu T He Is Tothe Primary Producers

As an attempt at humour, it was certainly excellent, so excellent, indeed, that the honourable member stands as a worthy rival of Mark Twain. It must be gaid, however, that his remarks were not quite so enlightening as tbey were amusing. The honourable member said that, after listening to honourable members on this side, he was satisfied that we did not possess a knowledge of the needs and requirements of the primary producer; but, observing his Bmile, we knew that he did not mean one word of what he said. Every one recognises that if there is one party standing for the primary producer in this, or any other country, it is the Australian Labour party. We, on this side, are opposed to the principle of the Bill because we say now, as we have said for years, that it is time the producer had a fair deal so far as the sale of his produce is concerned. member for Cowper a primary producer? ig now time we got back to normal conditions and the primary producers were given a fair chance and not restricted in any way as to where they shall sell their produce. strict them? member does not understand how, I am not responsible. The Labour party contend that the producers should have a free choice so far as oversea or any other markets are concerned. The members of the Country party during the elections declared they were coming here to preserve the interests of the primary pro-, ducers, but I am sorry to say they have not done so. It is pleasing, however, to know that the scales, have fallen from the eyes of the electors-, who realize more fully every day that there is one, and only one,, party to look after their interests, and that is the Labour party. How can any one maintain that this Bill1 producers when it is realized that during the last four years they have been robbed of, approximately, £400,000,000 of the value of their produce in oversea sales? I notice that the "" cabbage soldier,"" the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Fleming.) laughs, but it is no laughing matter for the producers, not two per cent, of whom wish to see legislation of this nature. It is said, particularly by those who claim to represent the producers, that this Bill is introduced at tbe desire of the producers themselves-as a recognition of the organization of the farmers. But so far as I .can see, those honourable members cannot tell the House what organization does. repre> sent the primary producers. Some tell us that the producers are represented by the Farmers and Settlers Association, while others say that tbey are represented by the Primary Producers Union; but it was stated very clearly by the honourable member for Werriwa. ( Mr Lazzarini) that the so-called primary producers' unions and associations in New South Wales and every other State are dominated and run by middlemen, stock and station agents, bank managers, and others who are the producers' natural enemies. The farmers and other primary producers were duped and deluded into sending members here who, they thought, would represent them, but who, as events prove, do not represent them at all. Those members, on the contrary, stand loyally by the middlemen, and just as loyally by the occupants of the Treasury benches, who are the recognised friends of middlemen. If a contract has been made for the sale of this butter, why is it necessary to pass the Bill? No explanation has been given why the producers' market should be restricted, and the fact must be emphasized that no restriction whatever should be placed on the disposal of their produce. It has been said that those engaged in dairy-farming work exceptionally long hours, and a harrowing picture was painted by the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Fleming)",48,Moloney Bu T He Is Tothe Primary Producers

It is true that all producers on the land work long hours, whether engaged in general farming, dairying, or any other branch of agricultural work, and I admit that the wife and children of the dairy farmer work hard; but that is only an additional reason why they should receive the greatest possible reward for their produce. I oppose the B ill because it restricts the. field of operations in the sale of produce, because it is unnecessary, and because tbe general farmer does not believe in it . He realizes that during the last three years, in the overseas trade, be has not been f a i r l y treated by the Government and other so-called representatives of the primary producers. Representing, as I do, every section of the worker, whether dairy farmer., wheat farmer, or general manual worker, I am opposed to the measure, and intend to vote against it . Some of the remarks made by members of the Opposition call for a reply. They have compared the butter agreement to other sales of primary produce during the war. There is an immense difference between the two classes of transactions, as I shall show by a detailed comparison. In the sale of the Australian wheat crop the growers were not consulted, particularly in the earlier part of the war. The original Wheat Board consisted of the Ministers of Agriculture for the four wheat-producing States with the Prime Minister as chairman. In addition there was an Advisory Board, comprising the well known agents and shipping firms of Darling and Co., Bell and Co., Dreyfus and Co., and Dalgety and Co. two bodies negotiated w i th the Imperial Government and made the contracts for the sale of the wheat; the rank and file had no say in the matter. for representation and the 'Commonwealth' refused it . butter transaction is on a different footing. The Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr 'Greene) endeavoured to organize the dairying industry on a co-operative basis, and he put before the organized dairymen what I regarded as a very good proposal. As, however, the.ischeme emanated from the Government, the dairymen were suspicious., and rejected it. The Minister then said, "" V e r y well, if you wish to conduct the business in your own way, do so."" Representatives of the industry assembled and appointed two of their number to go to England to negotiate the sale to the I m perial Government.

That would play into tbe hands of middlemen in tbe way the honourable member has indicated in connection with dried fruits; tbe middlemen would reap a profit to the detriment of tbe primary producer. able members opposite have prophesied that tbe. butter market overseas will rise. I admit frankly that the market may rise, and that tbe dairymen may then regret having made this agreement; but I still support tbe agreement, because the dairymen, having made the bargain, have asked us to give it legislative sanction.

They wish to prohibit the export of butter within certain limits, because, if the price overseas does increase, tbe butter that should go into local consumption will be purchased by middlemen and sent overseas. In other words, there are amongst tbe primary producers certain men whom honourable members opposite would call "" scabs "" on their organization, and who will stick to this agreement so long as it is tbe more profitable arrangement, but immediately they think it more' profitable to abandon tbe agreement and "" scab "" on the rest of tbeir fellow producers, tbey will do so. whom we call "" scabs "" work for lower wages; those whom the honourable member calls "" scabs "" are those who will ask for higher prices. member has answered his own argument. of tbe House in championship of tbe cause of the primary producers, one cannot help wondering at tbe significant interest which is being displayed in tbe producers since they started to organize.

One thing which has influenced me in coming to a decision is the remark made by the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Greene), to tbe effect that Mr Sandford, of Adelaide, was quite in favour of this agreement. tbe interest of Mr Sandford and those associated with him to get the biggest price possible for butter.

If we stand by the amendment, which provides that tbe primary producer should obtain the world's parity for bis exportable surplus, we shall do much to encourage the extension of the industry. I have here a statement by MrA . H . Renard, author of ABO of Scientific Feeding, & c , which, since it deals with the importance of the industry to the nation, I desire to place on recordIt cannot be too often, or too strongly, emthat, compared with some European phasized that the stability of the dairying inI thank the honourable dustry is of absolutely paramount importance to the progress and prosperity of the Commonwealth. It is the greatest money-maker and distributer of ready money among primary industries. Its expansion on permanently sucThen we had the cessful lines is, without any exaggeration, a matter of national life or stagnation. Dairying is the master-key of all Australian industries, because, in the special circumstances, an the statements do not agree. abundantly large production of milk, enabling a large consumption at a moderate price, is the controlling influence on the physical and mental health, vigour and development of the Australian nation -Furthermore, this great industry holds the solution of the burning problem of the reduction in cost of living, because it produces milk, butter, and cheese, and powerfully assists in the economical production of beef and pork and bacon. .Finally, this single industry, being susceptible of immense expansion and intensive development, on safe and profitable lines, is fully capable of solving the vexed questions of the increase in population, closer settlement on tbe land, drift of rural population to the cities, and a huge export trade. I endorse all these statements, with tbe exception of that in which the writer speaks of the dairying industry as being the greatest of money-makers. My observation of those engaged in the dairying industry leads me to believe that, having regard to the labour tbey put into it , they do not receive the returns which can be secured in many other job in the world. ( Sir Joseph Cook) and I are in agreejobs. Another reason why I desire that the primary producer shall obtain the world's I am not going to permit parity for his exportable surplus is that in that event the home consumer could also be protected. Earlieri n the debate, tbe Treasurer tried to make it appear that our party wished to "" have it coming and going""-that we desired that the .primary producer should obtain, the highest price for bis produce, and that the consumer should get it at the cheapest rate. I have no such desire. Tbe thought running in my mind is that if , in respect of the exportable surplus, we make it our duty as f a r as possible to obtain for those engaged in this industry the world's parity, we shall give encouragement to them to enter into the business extensively and scientifically.

B y obtaining for our dairy farmers the fullest return for their surplus production, we shall induce them to enter more extensively and scientifically into their industry. B y the adoption of more scientific methods, they w ill obtain greater results, and the Home consumers w ill thereby* benefit considerably. make another quotation from Mr Kenard. The facts that the writer brings out are worth recording, and may give an impetus to those in the industry who have not given f u l l consideration to the application of science to it . He saysDairying can be made a gilt-edged medium of investment, and brought to almost an exact science by the use of scientific methods of feeding made to which I desire to refer. The the cows and the land. The profitable nature of the rational scientific feeding of land and stock has been proved beyond question. The average production of butter per cow in the Commonwealth is authoritatively given as 165 lbs. It should be, and can be, raised to 265 lbs. per cow within the next ten years. The Danish dairy farmer raised the average production of butter per cow from 175 lbs. to 200 lbs. in five years, and to 260 lbs. in ten years from the date of the commencement of the campaign for the adoption of scientific method into the feeding of Denmark herds. Who will say that the Australian cannot do better than the Dane when he puts his mind to it? In the earlier portion of my remarks I referred to the importance of this industry to the nation, and I should like for a moment to deal with a matter affecting the consumer. Only last week there was placed in my hands by a chemist a circular which he bad received setting out that that splendid article, lactogen, which has been retailed to tbe people of Australia at 6s. per t in, is now to cost 9s. per tin . In other words', there is to be an increase of 50 per cent, in the price. This is a very important matter, and I propose to ask the Government to-morrow whether tbey are prepared to subsidize those who produce lactogen so that without any loss to the primary producer its price may not be increased to the consumers. I hope tbe Government w ill be able to make some arrangement whereby tbe cost of this commodity, which is so necessary to the child of tbe mother who is unable to nourish it in the natural way w ill not be raised. The burden of the increase must press most heavily upon the poorer classes of the community. B y tbe employment of help in her home a wife, even in strenuous circumstances, can very often f u l f i l her f u l l maternal duties. But the wif e of a working man, who cannot afford help -wh o has to attend to her own houses hold duties u n t i l almost the moment of her accouchement, and who, three or four weeks after her child is born, has again to do a f a i r share of the work of To emphasize this point, I shall the bouse-need s special assistance in nourishing her offspring. It appears to me, therefore, that this increase in the price of lactogen w ill be an additional burden on the shoulders of those least able to bear it . I do not wish to take up the time of the House unduly, but during the course of the debate certain statements have been kay), for instance, said that he noticed that great interest was "" n o w "" being taken in the farmers by honourable members of tbe Labour party. I am glad to have that admission from a member of the Liberal party ; but there was no occasion for the honourable member to use the word "" now,"" as for years past the Labour party has made it its duty to watch the interests of the primary producers, and to encourage their industries in every way. I also notice that the representatives of the Corner party made similar comments, and that the honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Gibson) used words to this effect:"" A greater interest in the farmers is evident in the House on the Labour party's side than when I came here eighteen, months ago."" I desire to remind the honourable member who made the statement that,, during the past eighteen months, and since he first entered this Chamber, there has been a general election, the results of which clearly indicated that the members of the Labour party have always been active in assisting the primary producers, because five additional members from primary producers' districts have entered the Chamber as direct supporters of the Labour party. know that the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) is now seeking to interrupt me in an endeavour to defend the Corner party, and",53,Joseph Cook Th E Honourable Ment Dairyin G Is One Of The Hardest Of

I am supporting tbe B ill with a good deal of misgiving, but I have no intention of supporting the amendment for reasons I shall give later. For some time. I have been extremely desirous of getting away from Avar conditions, and as conditions are now becoming normal, measures such as this should not be necessary. bably there should be some Government supervision in matters of this kind, but there appears to be a tendency on the part of certain Ministers to t r y to retain as long as possible some of those powers which were exercised under the War Precautions Act. It is generally recognized that the sooner we revert to normal conditions the better it will be, not only for the primary producers, but for the community generally. I intend to throw down the gauntlet to the Government in connection with propositions of this character, because there has been too much Government interference, with resultant heavy losses to the producers. I want them to understand that, unless definite requests are made by the producers for legislation of this character, they are acting in a manner that will place them in difficulties and jeopardize tbeir position as occupants of the Treasury bench. ment moved by the honourable member for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney) is that, while be seeks to giA'e the producers an open market for export produce, bis party has never been inclined to do so in connection with produce sold within the CommonAvealth. I think it is generally admitted that the work of a dairy farmer is extremely arduous, as many of them have to work from daylight u n t i l dark for seven days a week. During a recent visit to the Colac district I was informed by dairy farmers that the cost of fodder and other requirements, as well as the increased cost of labour, Avas such that butter at tbe present price was not so profitable to handle ns when it was Is. 2d. and Is. 3d. a lb. We all know that there has been a decrease in our dairy herds, and that tbe butter production has fallen off considerably. During the last few years there has been a change in connection with tbe butter industry, nnd in such districts as Warrnambool very little butter is now being manufactured. In some of our principal dairying districts tbe milk is being sold to Nestle's factory for condensing and other purposes. When at Colac recently, I noticed that large quantities of milk Avere coming to the factories, and, instead of the skimmed milk being taken away for pig3, a large quantity Avas being used in making casein, and in tbe 'manufacture of Lactogen and other milk foods. UnProless we are prepared to pay a f a i r l y high price for butter, it is quite possible that those now engaged in tbe industrywill go out of it . Not one member opposite would answer the question, "" Should tbe producer .be given an open ancl free market in Australia?""' According to the Queensland neAvspapers, tbe price fixed for butter on 12th August last by the Government of that State was £ 2 2 8 a ton, although on that date £240 a ton was being given for it in New South Wales and Victoria. In other words, the Queensland producers were getting £ 1 2 per ton less for their butter than those of the other States. case now ? has been increased in Queensland during the past few days to £238 per ton when put up in 56-lb. cases, and to £240 a ton Avhen put up in 28-lb. cases. My objection to the amendThe view I hold is that the producer, -Avhethe r of meat, wool, hides, butter, or any other produce-shoul d obtain on the home market the world's parity for his produce. He is the man who takes all the risk, and those who desire the prosperity of the country will insist that be gets tbe Avorld's parity by way of reward. Honourable members opposite give us no assurance that with a clear and open export market the producer would be able to obtain the world's parity for his butter here. We know that their intention will be to fix the price of butter locally. For that reason a representative like myself could not hand over the control of this country's affairs to a party which would fix prices locally. When we put through a B ill providing for the Butter Pool, I was satisfied that the views of the producers had been fully represented, and that it was not merely a measure for giving Ministerial control. I would always -""refer to be without Ministerial interference; but it is necessary in this case to get into touch with the",55,Joseph Cook Th E Honourable Ment Dairyin G Is One Of The Hardest Of

If the New York office that it is proposed to open will do no better for us, we had better save our money by not opening it . A big change should be made in the London office. The Minister told us that he had cabled to London for certain information, and had received no reply. We should insist on getting the information that we need. We pay so' much for the upkeep of the High Commissioner's Office that we should expect from that office results which would assist in the building up of our industries. amendment to bring that about? the Estimates, I am prepared to take action. things on the proper occasion. Had the honourable member a greater knowledge of the proper working of Parliament, he would realize that the time for discussing this matter is when the Estimates are before us. I do not know why the "" said agreement,"" which is referred to in the B ill , has not been added to it as a schedule. The butter producers desired an open market at Home, and sent representatives to England with the instruction to do the best they could to get it . Having failed, these representatives appear to have done the next best thing, with a view to obtaining a fair price for the butter exported. My desire is to keep our industry unhampered by Ministerial control. I have been told by persons connected with the dairying industry that when an endeavour was being made to arrange a price in connection with a. previous contract with the British Government, the butter producers of Victoria had their agent at Home, who was in consultation there with our Prime Minister( Mr Hughes). The latter cabled to Australia asking for a free hand, and saying that without it he could not carry on the negotiations. He got a free hand, and, according to what I have been told-and I have reason to believe that it is truehe fixed a price considerably lower than that which was given for butter from other countries. I cannot conceive that the Imperial Government would wish to give us worse terms than other countries; and after the great sacrifices we have made, we should insist upon receiving prices as good as, if not better than, those paid for commodities from other countries. But we cannot afford to lose the B ritish market, to which the greater part of our butter has been sent for more than a decade, and the butter producers having said that tbey are content with the price that has been agreed upon, we should support the measure which sanctions their agreement. As I have said, I do not desire Government interference in tbe fixing of prices, or in the making of contracts for the sale of our commodities abroad. 1S0 f a r as possible, business men should be allowed to manage their own W ill you move an affairs. Ministers have quite enough to do in carrying on the ordinary administration of their 'Departments, and, in m y opinion, should., as much as possible, keep their fingers off other people's business. The one object of tbe B ill is to control the exportation of butter. I understand that representatives of the farmers have entered into an agreement at Homef o r the sale of our butter there. If the Government was not consulted about that agreement, why has it brought in this B ill to sanction it? The honourable*member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) says that be does not desire Government interference or control, and I hope that the House w ill take h i m at bis word by rejecting tbe B ill , and letting this agreement stand on its merits. I hope, too, that the honourable member w ill give effect to his views by his vote. Are none but the producers of butter interested^ in this matter? If a body of unionists made an agreement with, say, the boot manufacturers, to charge a certain price for their labour, while the manufacturers were to put up the price of boots 100 per cent., would it be said that no one else was interested?

382,Sir Joseph Cook,"The honorablethe primary producers of this country had an opportunity of approving this agreement. orable member think that? look down the list of the names of those who are to constitute this Dairy Produce Pool Committee I find there the names of middlemen and agents wbo have never produced an ounce of anything, except hide and impudence, in their lives. Sir JOSEPH: COOK -Does the honourable member thank that a politician should criticise other people's bides? doubt, speaks from a wealth of experience upon that matter. Mr Bascbe, for example, is an exporter and agent in Sydney. We know him to be one of the biggest middlemen in New South Wales to-day. Yet he is put forward as a representative of our primary producers. ThenI should like to know who appointed the two delegates who have proceeded to Great Britain. Were the primary producers called upon to vote for their selection? Mr 'GIBSON -Yes, through their organizations. supplied to each member of those organizations with the names of the candidates upon it? Certainly not. is quite wrong. Every one of these men was selected by ballot. Minister say so when be introduced the measure? good deal of hostile criticism bad he been candid upon tbe matter. every member of tbe Dairy Produce Pool Committee bad been selected by the primary producers themselves. the honourable member was not in the chamber at tbe time. the representative of a large industrial constituency, I bold that the interests of trade unions are wrapped up in tbe interests of our primary producers. too, are inextricably interwoven with the interests of our primary producers the interests of tbe workers in our cities. Only the aid of the latter makes it possible for our primary producers to export tbeir surplus products. Without our seamen, our coal-miners, our dockers, and our shipbuilders it would not be possible for a single ounce of our primary products to be exported overseas. Consequently, we look to the primary producers to giye us a fair deal, and we will then see that they get a fair deal in return. Our interests are absolutely identical. The genuine primary producer needs to keep his eyes open lest be should find himself in tbe bag of the middleman. To my mind, the acceptance or otherwise of the agreement which has been entered into with the Imperial Government should rest with our primary producers themselves. When the Bill reaches Committee 1 intend to move an amendment to the effect that the measure shall not become operative until it has been referred to our primary producers for an expression of their opinion upon it. Certainly middlemen should not be permitted to determine whether or not the proposed Dairy Produce Pool shall be established. I listened with very great attention to the explanation given by the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Greene) when submitting this Bill for our consideration, and I was indeed surprised to learn, as he unfolded his statement, that the agreement is not embodied in it. Tbe measure contains nothing which will enable an outsider 'to grasp what was the intention of Parliament in assenting to it.

399,Mr Gibson,"What has the honorableto do with this Bill? members are continually referring to tbe condition of affairs in Queensland. Can tbey tell why the Queensland Labour party, led by tbe present honourable member for. West Sydney( Mr working under a similar provision in conRyan), has at successive elections annihilated the Liberal party and the middlemen who are represented on the Government side to-day ? The primary producers of Queensland registered their opinion of Labour government, and, after all, that is the best test. I am very sorry indeed that we should be asked to agree to a Bill introduced in such a haphazard fashion; -but I expect nothing business-like from tbe present Government. The Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) has had no business training, not one per cent, of the business men throughout Australia have any time for him as a manager or arranger of business deals. The haphazard method in which this Bil l is brought forward is only another evidence of the incapacity of the Prime Minister and those who keep him in power. There has been some reference to cable messages. I believe tbe honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) said something about a cable he bad up his sleeve, in which it is promised that the primary producers, of whom I am one,, shall receive some amount above the fixed price if tbe market rises. If the producer is to receive tbe full world's parity, why embody in the agreement a fixed price of 240s. per cwt.? I am very pleased that tbe honourable member for Wimmera( Mr which would have given the people a Stewart) supports us when he' states "" that in all probability within the next ,six months the primary producers will regret having made this agreement."" Is not such a statement from an honourable member on that side the strongest possible condemnation of the Bill? The honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Austin Chapman) has by interjection -of what he thinks of the agreement. Then why persist with the Bill when honourable! members admit that there is likely to be serious trouble and loss in carrying out the agreement? I endorse the stand taken by the honLazzarini), Hume( Mr Parker Moorable member for Dalley( Mr Mahony) loney), Angas( Mr Gabb), and myself, in regard to the interpretation of that clause of the agreement which Honourable says that the sellers "" shall accept all risks to the butter up to tbe time of shipment, except deterioration of quality due to length of storage."" Let honourable members be warned by our experience in nexion with the wheat sales. Wfwere told that the wheat must be put into the Pool. As soon as we did that we lost control of it. So, too, when the butter goes into the Pool, tbe dairy farmers will lose control of it. It will.be under the management of officials, and whilst the producers can do nothing, they must bear all the losses. If I am to be liable for losses, I wish to control my produce. Is there a business man in the country who would agree to allow bis goods to go out of his control whilst responsible for all risks and losses? . If there is such a man, he will not remain in business long. Many primary producers are in their present bad financial position because, unfortunately, tbey have listened to the glib tales of those who represent the middlemen on the Treasury bench; and tbey have not been able to enforce business deals from the Government that has persecuted them during the last four years. We have only to look at the result of Nationalist administration in New South Wales; the last elections are eloquent upon that point, and what is true of New South Wales will be true of other States as soon as the people have a chance of voting intelligently as to who shall represent them in Parliament. If there bad been in operation an electoral system chance of registering an. intelligent vote M. Chanter) -Order!

We desire the primary producers to obtain tbe world's parity for tbeir exportable surplus, so that the greatest possible amount of money may be coming into the country, instead of, as has been tbe case during the last four or five years, tbe interests of producers got to the Old Country? Tbe the Australian producer being made subservient to the interests of tbe people of other countries, to the detriment of the whole of our people. Monaro) [9.45] I am in somewhat of a dilemma in connection with this Bill. I represent probably the biggest 'butter-producing district in New South Wales. It is certainly the district in which the bestis so, how does the Minister account for butter is produced, although the greatest quantity may not be produced there. This Bill is based upon an agreement .about which we knew nothing when the measure was introduced. concerning it has had to be extracted from the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Greene) as a dentist extracts a tooth. We are told now that there is an addendum to the agreement., I remember that while we were able to make an agreement with regard to tbe sale of our wool, We discovered, later on, that tremendous profits were made by its re-sale abroad, which should have been returned to our wool producers. It seems to me that we are almost bound to ratify this butter agreement; but I am rather afraid that the dairymen of this country will be placed in tbe same position as our wool growers were placed under the wool agreement. We have been led to believe that the agreement has been made by representatives of the dairy farmers of this country; but tbe honourable member for Gwydir( Mr Cunningham), who is himself a primary producer and a dairy farmer, judging from his speech, had no knowledge of the making of this agreement. He expresses doubt as to whether it represents the views of tbe primary producers. I am satisfied that the honourable member believes what he has said, and speaks honestly in the interests of tbe producers of this country. We have been informed that the agreement was brought about 'by representatives of the dairy farI do not want the dairy farmers to have mers assembled in conference, and elected by the primary producers, and that the Bill is intended practically to ratify what they have done, and to compel the dairy farmers of Australia to keep the conditions of the agreement. If that be so, what are we to think of the remark that the agreement was practically made before the representatives of tbe primary Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Greene) shakes his head, but that does not appear in Hansard; and I want some assurance to be recorded in Hansard that tbe agreement is one between the dairy farmers of Australia and the Food Controller in Great Britain. the fact that a cable has been received to the effect that it is probable that a higher price than 240s. per cwt. will be paid for our butter? has -been received by the Government. anybody?

It is a bad thing that the British Government should be accused of squeezing the primary producers of Australia as they have been accused in connection with the operations of the Wool Pool. That must create a feeling of unrest. No one can accuse me of not being absolutely loyal, of not standing by the Empire, or of not playing the game, but I am quite prepared to ask what right the British Government have to say to the producers of butter, wool, or wheat in Australia that because they have control of transport they will take from them some of their hard-earned profits. titled to do anything of the kind, and if we had business men conducting the arrangements it could not occur. Thati t has occurred must be tbe result of bungling. If an extra price is paid, the farmers have a right to get that price, less the expense of placing tbe butter before the British consumer.

We have the assurance of the Minister, and, generally, that is good enough. my experience, at any rate. I am assured that the agreement was made by representatives of the dairymen, and in their interests. I accept the assurance of tbe Minister that the best price will be obtained. We all know Mr Sinclair, and know that he will do the best that he can for the dairymen. I am assured that whatever price is obtained, that price, less expenses, will go to the man who produces the butter, and that satisfies me. I regret that so much time has been taken up iu debating the Bill, because information in the possession of some honourable members was not given to the House generally. We are not playing marbles, but are dealing with one of the great primary industries of Australia. The dairy farmers work late and early. They have no holidays, no furlough, and no overtime, and they are subjected to all sorts of innuendoes about the treatment of those they employ. We have had a reference to the treatment of dairymen's children, which is an infamous libel and slander iipon them. I can take the children in my district, aud in the district of Richmond, represented by the Minister for Trade and Customs, and the district represented by the honourable member for Gwydir( Mr Cunningham), and compare them with They are not ensome of the children of the city. That is the answer to such slanders. There are, no doubt, taskmasters in the country as well as in the cities, but .country children will compare more than favourably with city children, and they enjoy the advantage of God's pure air which is not enjoyed by the children of the cities. When we come to consider the Bill in Committee, we can make sure that the best price will be obtained for our butter, and will go to the primary producer. It is a practical certainty that the price will increase, because the price of everything hard time as well as the producer. He",65,Joseph Cook Th E Honourable Ment Dairyin G Is One Of The Hardest Of

In this way only can Australia become great and self-contained and take her place among the nations of the world. and with that object in view we shall guarantee to tbe producer a return which will secure to him a price for his products that will cover the cost of production and allow a reasonable margin of profit.

The honourable member for Robertson made an interjection with regard to meat. If the exporters of meat were given the f u l l world's parity for the exportable surplus, then, even allowing for the price which was. paid to the meat -companies of Queensland for meat for local consumption, there would be a better return to the producers of meat, and the local consumers would be provided with meat at more' reasonable rates.

Mr Sinclair, but I have every confidence in him; and Mr O'Callaghan is a Government officer intimately acquainted with all the ramifications of the trade.

Tbe butter may be put in ing butter in cool storage? question of storing butter. This is one of the most difficult questions which has to be dealt with. Its settlement requires a most intimate knowledge of the trade and a very complete survey of the position in the country, so that, unless a man has had a lifelong experience of the business, be does not know when he should start to store. Even then the best judges sometimes go wrong. Let me give the Committee just two instances of what I mean. The year before last, the committee decided that it was desirable to start storing operations very early. Consequently, they stored a lot of butter; but of the 30,000 odd cases which were stored in Victoria it was not found necessary to use one. We had a surplus of butter that year in this State. There is such a tremendous difference between the seasons that it is a most difficult thing to determine when the storing of butter should be commenced. It is tbe one thing above all others that the man in the street cannot give any information about. say that when there is an abundant supply of butter, and the man in the street is present at tbe meetings of the committee, and hears it making arrangements for storing that commodity, he has not sufficient intelligence to know whether tbe adoption of that course is right or wrong? we may have an abundant supply of butter. But does the honourable member suggest that he can tell exactly tbe period when we should start to store it ? Butter deteriorates with storage, no matter whai the conditions of that storage, may be. If we store butter for six months before we require to use it ment, would tbe suppliers lose by the adoption of that course? would. . . occupy 'time 'unnecessarily. But let m* explain why tbe producer would los» whilst the consumer would not gain anyr thing. The price of butter' depends upon cold storage at 92 points. If it is stored at less than that there is not the faintest chance of it coming out in the best posr,' sible condition. But, instead of it coming out at 90 points, it would probably come out at 84. We should theri have to put that butter into the Imperial Pool, and, instead, of getting for it '2s'. rriore than the 240s. per /cwt., which is set out in the agreement, we should get 6s. less. The butter Would be of such low grade that it would be idle to put it upon the local market.' What is more, the six months' storage would make such a tremendous addition to the price of it that the consumer would not benefit in tbe slightest degree, because interest would have to be paid upon the butter for six months, plus the storage charges. That means that it would require to command such a price that the consumer would not look at it.

After a close association with this trade, -extending over a number of years, I say that tbe one thing to which co-operative societies have devoted more attention than any other is the arrangement of their storage in such a way as to Insure that tbey will have a sufficient supply of butter during the winter months to meet the' demands of their consumers. It does not suit them to run out of butter. They do not want the proprietary men to come in with stored butter and thus to secure their customers during the winter months. As the co-operative interests upon this Pool more than counterbalance the proprietary interests upon it , I am satisfied that it will follow the policy which has been followed for years by insuring that the consumer shall be fully protected.

He is not there to relabour and capital are represented, and port upon the export of butter. He is there in the capacity of an expert upon the quality of butter. He is a most capable man. But we require upon the committee a representative of the consumer. No doubt there has been a lot of grumbling at various times about the price of butter in Australia. Sometimes when there has been an alleged scarcity of that commodity in Sydney the secretary of the cold storage depot there has informed me that the place was full of butter. Of course, the object of creating an artificial scarcity is to put up the price. Under this agreement no man will be able to sell butter for export, except through the Pool. member read in the press to-day that a minimum price is asked for coal, and a minimum wage for the worker; why should not the farmer also get a minimum wage? should not, but there is a danger of gambling in butter. been a rise in the price since the Pool has taken control the Pool has known the whereabouts of every box of butter, and has always levied on the holders the additional price, and placed the money in the Pool. . where every box of butter is, and there is more butter in Queensland than c i r be consumed in that State, why is New The New South Wales Government would not increase the price for local consumption, and no butter was sent from Queensland. will the Government have control of local consumption ? cient for local requirements? the publ'c on the labour tribunals?",76,Pairs

It is obvious that its purpose is to secure that tbe consumer sball be represented on the Pool. The Minister, when speaking on the second reading, referred to Mr Sinclair as having one to London as O one of the delegates to represent the producers. same gentleman is to represent the consumers. It is difficult to know where the Minister stands. The Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) accused honourable members on this side of advocating low and cheap prices for the consumer. I do not like those terms, and, after all, it is by the use of misleading terms that a good deal of propaganda against the policy of the Labour party is carried on. As a student, I was taught that one should speak not only to be understood, but so that he cannot be misunderstood. I can quite understand what an honourable member, speaking from this side of the House, means when he refers to low prices, and what a Ministerial member means when he uses the same term. It is a term that can be understood, b u t it can also be misunderstood, or if it is not misunderstood, it can ,be misrepresented. The policy of the Labour party is founded upon the emancipation of human labour from a l l kinds of exploitation. If the producer has to sell his commodity at less than the cost of production, his labour could the repreis being exploited. No member' on thi9 side of the House advocates that.

The electors of Indi will have to be told that he has slipped to a very great extent since ducer shall not be pooled that honourable he entered Parliament. If everything that he s^id were true, it would not afford him the excuse for which he is seeking to vote against the proposed new clause. Those associated with. him were loud in their clamour for the representation of the primary producers on the Wheat and Wool Pools. Yet now that the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Mahony) has moved for the insertion of a new clause, which will give the dairy farmers full representation on the Dairy Produce Pool, this gentleman, who says that he was sent here to represent the primary producers, quibbles, and makes every excuse for voting against it. Those who understand the requirements of the primary producers cannot cavil at the clause, which I trust will be carried. The rank and file of the dairy farmers, through no fault of their own, know no more about this agreement than did the small wool-growers about the contract for the sale of our wool, for which the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) tried to shift his responsibility on to the shoulders of the ex-Treasurer ( Mr Watt). member is going beyond the clause. out of order ? I can only account for your ruling by the lateness of the hour. able gentleman to withdraw that remark, and to apologize to the Committee for having made it. not think it any wonder, because of the lateness of the hour, that any of us might be affected. I withdraw the remark so far as it applies to every one, including the Chairman. Those on this side have always stood for giving full and ample representation to the primary producers on all Pools dealing with the disposal of their produce. member 'will avail himself of the opportunity to discuss the amendment. I do not object to the action of the honourable member for Indi in discussing it ; I only take exception to his insulting remark. I do not take exception to his showing where he-really stands. The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Ryan) has just -mentioned; by way of -interjection-and I quite agree with him-that this Bill affords an example of how the Government pools the primary producers. It is in order to see that the primary promembers on this side are seeking the insertion of a clause which will provide some measure of protection to dairy farmers. Of course, it -is too much to expect the votes of honourable members of the so-called Country party; but, personally, I prefer their seats to their votes. Chanter) -Order!

Here, the Government proposes to take away a product from its producer, and to say what price he shall receive for the greater part of it, but without giving him an opportunity to say whether or not he agrees. If the principle of first consulting the parties I hone that every honourable chiefly concerned had been adopted in respect of other Pools of Australia's primary products there would have been avoided confusion and' chaos resulting in loss to the people of Australia.
