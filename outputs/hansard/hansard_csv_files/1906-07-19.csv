At the same time, certain modifications in the f u l l dress Commonwealth uniform were made by the Military Board, thereby reducing its cost. 1.

12,Mr Mauger (Melbourne Ports),"a return laid on the table of the House last session. in that return was, first, the receipts from military canteens throughout the Commonwealth during the preceding twelve months; secondly, the expenditure during that period upon the establishment and maintenance of the canteens; and, thirdly, the profits, if any, on the sale of intoxicating liquors in the canteens, and the manner iii which those profits had been applied. does not propose to abolish the Parliamentary refreshment bar? under consideration, but, if my honourable friend has the courage to make the proposal, I shall be glad to support it . receipts from military canteens throughout the Commonwealth during the period between the ist July, 1904, and the 30th June, 1905, amounted to .£15,032 18s. The return is .by no means complete, because it is stated that it is impossible to determine how much of that amount was derived from the sale of intoxicating liquors only, the sum representing the total receipts from the sale of intoxicating liquors, as well as other drinks, and cigars, tobacco, and other refreshments and provisions. diture of the canteens, including the purchase and maintenance of stock, was ,£13,778 17s. 8d., and the profits, "" if any,"" on the sale of intoxicating liquors, £ 1 , 3 0 6 2S. 7d. doubtful sort of ' return. complete and unsatisfactory, and seems to have been devised to hide the facts rather than to give the information sought for.

It may be asked, Is there a precedent for the abolition of canteens ? Has any other country done what is proposed? What is being done in this matter in Great Britain, the United States, and Canada? I believe in making precedents where they do not exist, if it is necessary to depart from old established practice. Australia has led the way in adopting voting by ballot, adult suffrage, and many other reforms, and, if we had no precedent to guide us, it would be a good thing to set an example to the world in the abolition of canteens. But we have the American experience to guide us, which is exceedingly interesting and instructive. As far back as February, The first ooint which I 1881, President Hayes issued the following order:In view of the well-known fact that the sale That is shown by some of intoxicating liquors in the army of the United States is the cause of much demoralization among both omcers and men. and that A t Queenscliff, Gunner J.

21,Mr Mauger,"Yes; but it is radithe Secretary for War is urged lo take suitable steps to reduce the sale and abandon the practice. So far as I can understand, that order had a temporarily beneficial effect. For a considerable time, strong efforts were made to reduce the consumption of drink, and to remove the inducements held out to the men to partake of strong liquors. The improvement, however, did not extend over a very long period, and the American Government then decided to legalise and regulate canteens, and place them under the direct control of the military authorities. the canteen was formally recognised by the Government, and among the conditions imposed were the following: To supply general articles for the soldiers' use-gymnastics , billiards, &c. The sale of ardent spirits was strictly proThe sale of beer superintended by a commishibited. Beer and light wine being allowed. That was a distinct step in advance. The military and medical authorities, in common with temperance advocates, recognised that drink was demoralizing the American soldiers; that it was destroying their physical constitution, and undermining their discipline. is now proceeding in Victoria against gambling, it is also interesting to note that the following order was also issued :Gambling or playing any game for money or any other thing of value is forbidden. That order had a very good effect, and gambling became practically unknown hi the American Army. Officers and non-commissioned officers testify that this rule in connection with the canteen has worked beneficially. gambling? tioned that matter incidentally. has never heard of gambling as an evil among Australian soldiers? -is an evil among all sections of the community. any better or worse than others. A l though the sale of ardent spirits was prohibited in the canteens, the consumption of wine and beer went on to such an extent that in 1890 fhe following prohibition of canteens was passed by Congress by a very large majority: No alcoholic liquors, beer, or wine shall be 'magnificent and trenchant report, but sold or supplied to the enlisted men in any canteen or post-traders' store, or in any room or building at any garrison or military post. From the very outset, this law was almost a dead letter. It was found to be defective, and the Attorney-General of the United' States reported against its application. It was generally disregarded, and the canteen became degraded to the position of an open public-house bar. The opposition to the canteen first appeared in army circles. This is a point to which I should like to direct the special attention of honourable members. In 1890 the Army and Navy Journal began to publish severe criticisms of the canteen system, and two In 1889 years after, ColonelH . C. Corban, now Adjutant-General of the United States Army-a n indisputable authority-state d in his report:The saloon feature of the canteen should be done away with without further experiment. sioned officer, and served by non-commissioned omcers and soldiers is not conducive to discipline. That is what I urged in directing attention to the fact that when a gunner was giving evidence in connection with the inquiry to which I have alluded, he appeared In view of the agitation which to be anxious to shield his officers. Colonel Corban continuesThe men who drink spend the greater portion of their wages in beer. Honourable members will notice that beer and light wines were dealt with in the report. Colonel Corban then deals with the argument which has been used in some quarters in favour of continuing the canteen. It has been urged that if you do not supply the soldier with drink in the camp or barracks he will go to the nearest public-house, where, being free from supervision or regulations, he will be very much more likely to drink to excess than if he were kept to some extent under observation. drink in a canteen they, will very soon go outside to obtain more. this very pregnant remark, which I ' would specially impress upon honourable members. I do not know that soldiers are who may think that the canteen is a help to sobriety. He saysThe argument that the soldier would get drink elsewhere will not stand the test of reason, nor justify the Government in approving the system herein complained of. Drunkenness should be reduced to a minimum. This can# not be done by an open invitation to drink. I have not time to quote the whole of this Colonel Corban goes on to point out that it would be just as reasonable for a father",15,Canteen Bill

27,Mr Mauger,"Colone l Corban makesand mother to encourage their children to drink at home in the hope that they would become temperate and keep out of public houses, as to supplv soldiers with drink in barracks. He shows clearly that ""The sight of means to do ill deeds makes ill deeds done."" the soldier to partake of intoxicating liquors at any time of the day or night upon Sundays and week days, is an encouragement to drink, and there is no. doubt that the facilities afforded are availed of. From statements made, to me by non-commissioned omcers and soldiers at present in our military barracks, I judge that young mien, who are practically total abstainers, enter our Queenscliff barracks, and before very long become habitual drunkards. The alcoholic taste is encouraged. drunkards "" is too strong. m)ent on the authority of men on the spot. I am sure that many fine young men, with splendid physique, sound morals, and good prospects, are converted into drunkards owing to the temptations to which they are subjected, through the instrumentalitv of thc canteen. When I asked my informant, a non-commissioned officer, if he would 1 be prepared to give sworn evidence in support of his statements to me, he stated that if I could assure him that his position would not be impaired, and that he would not stand the risk of being, reduced , or ""of becoming marked by his officers, he would be quite prepared to state, on oath, what he communicated to me privatelv. My own experience goes to show that if you afford facilities such as are offered by the canteens, vou are bound to work great mischief. Colonel Corban saysThe argument that the soldier would get drink elsewhere will not stand the test of reason, nor justify the Government in approving the system herein complained of. Drunkenness should be reduced to a minimum. Here follows a pregnant sentence, to .which I would specially direct the attention of honourable membersThe exchange with an open saloon would be a first rate thing to recommend for adoption in the army of the enemy. From what I have read I judge that the secret of Japan's phenomenal success in the late war lay in the fact that her soldiers were sober. They were not given to the use of intoxicating drinks, and therefore their minds were always clear and free. The testimony of leading soldiers and medical men goes to show that the successful fighter in the field of battle, as well as in the industrial world, is the man who keeps hisbrain clear. the German army? authorities have attempted to reduce the consumption of drink by offering premiums and rewards, but they have not excluded it absolutely General Howard, who was in command of the War Department of theEast, stated in his report to the Secretary for War in 1890Commanding officers have generally, agreed', with me that it would be well to abolish the sale of beer altogether. In his report of 1893, Surgeon-General: George M.. Sternberg made an attack on the canteen. He saidThe young men who would not leave their barracks for intoxicants of any kind areled into bad habits -by the ease with which beer may be obtained, and the official sanctiongiven to its use. That emphasizes the statement. I made withregard to the Queenscliff Barracks, to theeffect that the facilities for obtaining intoxicating liquors at any time of the day or night encourage the soldiers to purchase it, and lead to their contracting bad habitsbefore they know that they are being injured. That is the experience all over the world. NowI wish to come to the prohibi1 tory period. In 1899 the following order was issued by the Naval Department of the United States of America. Honourable members will notice that it is conclusive,, penal and mandatory. Navy Department, 3rd February, ISQQ. After mature deliberation the Department hasdecided that it is for the best interests of the service that alcoholic liquors on board ship, or within the limits of naval stations, be prohibited. Therefore after the receipt of this order' commanding omcers are forbidden to allow any malt or alcoholic liquor to be sold or issued' to enlisted men, either on board ship or within the limits of navy yards, naval stations, or barracks, except in the medical department. JOHN D. LONG, Secretary. This order was issued in 1889, and from the latest reports presented by the War Department to CongressI learn that it hasproved effectual in reducing drunkenness, encouraging, temperance, and assisting thrift. Further, the number of naval' court martials has been decreased as theresult of this very striking and important",16,Canteen Bill

31,The Very Fact That It Is Open To Mr Mauger,"Partially only. Theorder. I now come to the time when the existence of canteens was absolutely prohibited in America. It was as late as igoi that Congress, by a large majority, reenacted its . former measure in language which officialdom could not evade. following is the law of America in regard to canteens at the present time: The sale or dealing in beer, wine, or any intoxicating liquors by any person in any post exchange, or canteen, or army transport, or upon any premises used for military purposes in the United States, is hereby prohibited. Secretary for War is hereby directed to carry out the provisions of this section wilh f u l l force and effect. That law was very strenuously opposed at the time of its introduction. The whole force of officialdom was arrayed against it,, and efforts were made, both in Congress and by naval and military officers, to secure its ineffective working. 'Eut the results have been eminently satisfactory, and tbe latest reports show that drunkenness has decreased, that the number of court martials has been reduced, that the men are tetter in health and pocket, and that discipline has been vastly improved. In a letter sent by the Secretary of War to Surgeon-General G. H . Evatt, it is stated that not only has the law been in every way successful letter ? March last. In this communication to Surgeon-General G. H . Evatt, C.B., the Secretary of War says that the prohibition has been eminently successful. He also points out that the American Government were not satisfied merely with prohibiting the sale of wines, spirits, and beer in canteens. They have gone a good deal further, and have voted very considerable sums of money for the purpose of providing billiards, gymnasiums, and all kinds of recreation for officers and men. The details of this action are exceedingly interesting. proved upon '30th June, 1902, Congress appropriated 500,000 dols. for the construction, equipment, and maintenance of suitable buildings at military posts and stations, for the conduct of post exchange, school, library, reading, luncheon, and amusement rooms and gymnasiums. 1903 an additional sum of 500,000 dols. was appropriated for the same purpose, and in the following year a further appropriation of a similar amount was_ made. Last year the sum appropriated In this connection was 35,000 dols., making a total °f IJ535>OOO dols. In other words, the canteen has been made a public-house without the drinka place where men can read and derive amusement, and where they can The spend their spare time without being in any way injured. But the American Congress has gone still further. It has taken a step somewhat similar to that recommended by our Old-age Pensions Commission. It has determined that no old soldiers' homeThe there are many homes for old soldiers in America-shal l be in any way subsidized by the American 'Government if it permits a canteen to be established there, or allows its inmates to secure intoxicants. It will thus be seen that not only have the American Government abolished the canteen, but they have voted large sums of money to supply a substitute for it. In addition, it has been enacted that no home for old soldiers shall receive Government support if it provides its inmates with intoxicating liquors. I hold in my hand a very interesting testimony from Colonel Ray, the Commanding Officer at Fort Snelling. It is contained in a report which was presented to the War Office, in March of the present year. When questioned as to the effect of the abolition of the sale of beer and' wines in the army he saidNor do I find that beer is any more necessary for a soldier than it is for the employees of any great corporation, and I find that retail beer saloons are just as much a nuisance on a reservation and called a canteen, as they are off and called a saloon. He then goes on to sayThere wns no disorder in the post, that the discipline existing among the troops was not of the character developed by beer, and that the statement that disorder existed owing to the abolition of the canteen was not only false, but was an insult to every officer and enlisted man of the command, in implying that the laws of Congress, either lo establish or abolish a canteen, could not be enforced in any part of the army of the United States without disorder. In the Act, which was apOnehonorable member has asked what is being done in this connection in other parts of the world. I might inform him that America leads in this matter, but Canada is following closely in her footsteps. In the German army, orders are continually being issued directing attention to the evil effects In arising, from soldiers partaking of strong drink. In Japan, the sale of strong drink is absolutely prohibited so far as the Government and military authorities are concerned. The leading medical men connected with the Army in Great Britain are also",17,Canteen Bill
32,Mr Crouch,What is the date of that,18,Canteen Bill
33,Mr Mauger,"It is dated the iothawaking to a sense of their 'duty in a most remarkable way. The most striking utterance in this connection is that of Sir Frederick Treves, who, it will be recollected, accompanied the British troops in their, march to Ladysmith. I will not detain the House by reading the whole of his remarks, but the following extract is particularly pertinent to the question under consideration :As .a work producer, alcohol is exceedingly extravagant, measures, it is apt to lead to a physical bankruptcy. It is well known that troops cannot march on alcohol. I was with the relief column that moved on to Ladysmith. It was an extremely trying time, apart from the heat of the weather. In that column of 30,000 men, the first who dropped out were not the tall men or the short men, or the big men, or the little men -bu t the drinkers, and they dropped out as clearly as if they had been labelled with a big letter on their backs. BeforeI conclude my remarks, I wish to direct the attention of the House to a very striking illustration of the extravagance that is induced by the Government recognition of military canteens. I am confident that if* the people of Great Britain could realize what is involved in it, they would immediately demand a change. My authority for the statement which I am about to make is the Daily News, which publishes an account of the sale of liquor, which was left over after the South African war. The article in question statesTurning to wines, there were 1,500 cases of Allsop's ale, containing, it was calculated, 96,000 bottles, while there were, roughly, 1,600 cases of champagne did not drink that? article illustrates some of the results of the system of supplying drink to the officers of the army-drin k for which the British public have to pay. It continuesThere were roughly, 1,600 cases of champagne, to say nothing of a large quantity of other wines, liquors, cigars, and groceries, the list of which reached the auctioneers too late for insertion in their catalogue. Such were the crumbs only which fel l from the British Officers' mess. What must the feast have been like? Dailv News. I contend that in this matter, medical and social science are upon our side, and that the experience of the American people goes to show that both our soldiers and the community generally, have 2 everything to gain by carrying the B ill which I have the honour to submit for the consideration of the House. I am sure that in '.passing the measure, honourable members will be keeping themselves in touch with the most advanced moral sentiment of the day, and I sincerely hope that they wil] agree to its second reading and speedily make it the law of the land. am associated with the honourable member and like other extravagant who has just resumed his seat in the intro : duction of this Bill, I desire very heartily to support it . member second the motion for its second reading ? sible, with the honourable member, for the introduction of the Bill. I have no desire to unduly occupy the time of-the House in discussing it, because the honourable member for Melbourne Ports has made out a sufficiently strong case to appeal to all thinking men. It must be admitted that the men who abstain from alcoholic stimulants usually possess a much better constitution : than do those who become steeped in alcohol. The effect of the use of alcohol is to reduce the stamina of men and to undermine their constitutions. The other day I was met with the objection that the abolition of military canteens would deprive those who are now employed in them, and who are not engaged in military service, of their occupation. I have no desire whatever to see any man displaced from his employment, but I do not think that the passing of this Bill will have that effect. Certainly, I ' should like to see those who find employThe ment in military canteens direct their energies into some more beneficial department of industry, in which they would accomplish more good for themselves and for the^r fellow men. That the existence of these canteens is a real evil, nobody who has visited military canteens in encampments and barracks, under certain conditions, and at certain times, can doubt. It may be that of late years the extent to which the vice of drunkenness prevails is not so great as it was. For that we have reason to be thankful, but we should endeaI t was published in the vour as far as we can to remove from military men the temptation to employ their leisure in having recourse to stimulants.

40,Mr Johnson,"Yes, sir. I ami responman, which was alleged to have been caused iby Sunday drinking. graph is as follows: An inquest was held by the City Coroner concerning the death of a carpenter lately residing in Paddington, on Sunday. The deceased had been drinking on Saturday night, and on the following morning visited the canteen at the Victoria Barracks, where it is said he had a drink or two. He subsequently went to a wine shop in Dowling-street, and had about three glasses of wine. He became very ill , and so serious did his condition become that he was 'taken to the Sydney Hosg'tai, but on arrival at that institution life was pronounced extinct. The Coroner said that it was evident that the deceased, who was drunk on Saturday night, was supplied with liquor at the canteen and wine nt the shop despite the Sunday Liquor Act. He found that death was due to alcoholism. Why are not the dispensers of this "" liquid damnation"" proceeded against for doing this "" hurt to one of his Majesty's subjects"" ? It is time that such doings should be put a stop to. I am not prepared to say positively that this man was supplied with drink at the canteen on the Sunday in question, but the coroner, who doubtless had all the evidence before him, seemed to believe that he was. It may be that the drink so supplied did not accelerate his death; but, on the other hand, there is a strong probability that it had something to do with it. law of the lancl prohibits the sale of intoxicating drinks in public houses on Sundays, it should certainly apply to military canteens. nise that intoxicating liquor, whether imbibed in excess on Sunday or any other clay, is equallv injurious. There seems to be an impression amongst a certain class of the community that if drink be. not supplied in military canteens, there will be a strong temptation for soldiers to break barracks, and that they will be supplied, perhaps, with inferior d'rink in low-class hotels. that would be an offence for which they would be punished; so that they would not do so very often. about to say that there might be some cases of the kind, but I do not think that such an argument has any general application. The rules and regulations of the service would militate against such a practice, and such cases, if they ocurred, would probably be isolated ones. trouble is that after the duties of the day are over, the men, for want of other forms The paraof amusement, have a tendency to spend their leisure in the neighbourhood of these canteens; that they do so merely for bhe purpose of passing their idle hours in convivial company, and that they are thus encouraged in the practice of drinking. Some young fellows from the country, who join the forces, are often led into temptation in that way. I am assured that they join the forces as raw recruits, with no special liking for alcohol, but that they go into the billiard rooms, which are usually adjpining or in the proximity of the canteens, and that the penalty of losing a game, by use and custom, is that they must ""shout."" It is with the practice of "" shouting "" that the .evil of intemperance begins. It is said that the majority of the offences committed in barracks are traceable to the fact that the offenders have first become inflamed with alcoholic stimulants. I have here a statement by a. military man of some years' experience, whose name I am not at liberty to disclose, but he is a man of some authority. In reply to my request that he should state in writing what he considered to be the evils associated with the sale of intoxicants in canteens, he wrote me a letter, and I propose to quote that portion of it which refers directly to those If the evils. He saysThe disadvantages of the institution are that young fellows, as recruits from country districts, in joining mingle with those from whom it is A t the same time, one must recogtheir constant endeavour to secure as many free drinks as possible. K3nd acts are done to gain the confidence of the young soldier with the sole intention of bringing him to the bar counter to satisfv their thirst. As a rule, they are pressed at first to take some small lubricant, and which I know in some cases has been extremely distasteful ' at first, but occasional indulgence gradually transformed the youth into a confirmed drinker. Of course, there are exceptions to every rule, but I am speaking of the majority that f a l l a victim to the evils derived from the liquor bar. All places of recreation are either adjoining or in If they broke barracks very close vicinity to the bar. which is highly detrimental to the welfare of any young fellows. Moreover, in my opinion if there were no canteen young men would go in considerably more for educating themselves intellectually, and naturally would live in greater harmony. An artilleryman at the present lime requires far clearer intellect than in days gone by, for the science of modern armament requires all the skill and care that a sober man can put into it, without his wits being deadened through the influence of liquor. Fully two-thirds of the crime among soldiers originates directly or indirectly from the sale of liquor, I understand that the as every facility is offered to procure it.

I personally know of young soldiers who, if liquor were available in camp, would certainly become the worse for it. These same men attended the camp at which there was no canteen, and 'did their work exceedingly well, and were much more creditable to the Force than they would have been if liquor hadteen bbtainable. The testimony that we haye had placed before us as to the lines upon which canteens have hitherto been conducted, shows that they ought to have ""been abolished long ago, and I hold that liquor should be entirely excluded from military encampments. pass legislation to meet a case such as that referred to by the honourable member for Wentworth. We cannot prevent the soldiers in the Victoria Barracks, Sydney, from having easy access to public-houses, but we can at least deprive them of some of the facilities which are now offered to them to obtain intoxicating liquors. I am very glad that the Government are supporting the B ill , because I believe that it will tend to the benefit of our soldiers. Captain Mahan, the great American naval authority, is decidedly in favour of the abolition of liquor from military camps, and it is a matter for regret that, although the United States Senate passed a law abolishing canteens, the President did not give effect to it. I quite agree with the honourable and learned member for Corio that intoxicating liquors should be entirely excluded from military encampments, because if we prevent the privates from obtaining drink, we should place a similar embargo upon officers. must recognise a great difficulty would atplacing, the members of our soldiery, whetach to completely carrying out his desire ther permanent or citizen, under the same in that direction.

I am glad that the against the mischiefs that we fear-more , Commonwealth Government have shown a I think, than the mischiefs that exist' strong disposition to discourage the sale of intoxicants, but I do not think that we s'hould be quite satisfied until we have cleaned up our own canteen. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports made a very able speech, and I trust that the B ill will be passed. We know that alcohol has a most demoralizing effect upon our soldiers. Lord Roberts, when he was in South Africa, wrote to the people of England and Australia begging them not to give drink to our young men when they came hack from the war. It is well known that 65 per cent, of the crimes committed in connection with the Army are directly attributable to drink, and I feel sure that we shall bring, about a great moral improvement and take an important. step forward if we pass the measure now before us. may be within the recollection of some -honourable members that this matter came up for consideration during the few months that I had the honour of being Minister of Defence. A t that time. I undertook to amend the regulations relating to canteens, with a view to ascertaining if certain admitted evils might not be more effectively coped with. These regulations were drafted, and, I may say, in passing, met with the approval of the various temperance bodies and others who were interested. I must admit, however, that they have not achieved as f u l l y as I should have liked the object with which they were framed. I confess, further, that, being strongly in sympathy with the movement to prevent canteens from becoming a source of temptation, I have to consider whether, in view of the fact that regulations which practically go as far as regulations can without absolutely prohibiting the sale of liquor, have failed, we are not forced to take the decisive step. of prohibiting the conditions as the rest of the community I admit the difficulty, but with regard to the purchase of liquor.

I do not think that the Australian Army, either permanent or citizen, consists of a host of hard drinkers, as the remarks of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports might lead the casual listener to think. The great majority of the men in our Forces, like the great mass of the community, are a very sober, law-abiding set of people. There are among soldiers, as among other classes, some men who take more than is good for them; but, speaking, of them as a body, I have no hesitation in saying, after -a very lengthy experience of citizen soldiers, that their temperance is very noticeable. As an officer commanding a regiment, I have had something to do with canteens, ancl I frankly admit that the Commanding Oflicers will be relieved of a certain amount of anxiety and responsibility if the matter of dealing their hands. I did not have a canteen in connection with my regiment. I did not want it myself, ancl T did not think my regiment wanted it. On the whole, the weight of evidence shows us that there is no choice between the risk of exposing some members of the forces to the temptation to drink unwisely, and abolishing the danger altogether. bavins: tried an experiment which met with the approval of those interested, but which did not prove so satisfactory as one might have hoped, I propose now to support this measure. -quite agree with the attitude of the Government on this question. We have decided that as far as possible we shall relv for our defence upon a citizen soldierv, ancl that the training of our soldiers shall commence at as early an age as practicable. Under these circumstances, we cannot begin too soon to insist upon a good example in the direction of temperance. I have had some years' experience in the Defence Forces, and from the peculiar position that I have occupied as a medical officer, I have had exceptional opportunities to judge of the results of the canteen system. I am very glad to say that notwithstanding the existence of the canteen in camps, the cases of drunkenness have now been reduced almost to a minimum. These results have been brought about I must in spite of the canteens, and not because of them. In my opinion, the position of the men at Queenscliff and Victoria Barracks in Svdney has become one of danger, owing to the canteen being constantly at their elbow, and I think that it is one of. the first duties of this Parliament to take measures to remove an undoubted temptation. The honourable and learned member for Corio suggested an amendment, but I trust that he will not press it, because his wishes can be carried out by means of regulations. After all, the matter to which he referred is one of discipline, and I am: sure that those who are responsible for the conduct of our camps will, in the event of the Bill being passed, recognise that they must altogether prohibit the introduction of liquor. I have very much pleasure in supporting the B ill . MrM c WILLIAMS (Franklin) [3.59] I have much pleasure in supporting the B ill . I have been in camp on several occasions, and, although I must admit that the sowith canteens is taken out of briety of the men generally has been parAt the last encampment ticularly noticeable, I cannot ignore the fact that the only trouble that I have ever known to occur has arisen through the men having a canteen at which they could obtain liquor. The canteen is a source of danger, not so much to men of mature years as to young fellows who are not in the habit of taking After much, liquor. Perhaps, in order to appear a little bit soldierly, or through, a sadly mistaken idea of friendship they are induced to drink a glass or two of liquor, ancl, being unaccustomed to it, they get into a condition into which they would not fall if the canteen did not exist. Buti f we decide to abolish the canteen we must be careful that a stringent regulation is framed to prevent the admission into camp of large quantities of liquor for consumption at the officers' and non-commissioned officers' mess. The abolition of the canteen system will fai l to a very considerable extent if we permit the free introduction of liquor into camp for the purpose to which I have referred. Before concluding, I cannot avoid recalling a statement which was made to me not very long ago by a military officer. He said, ' You members of Parliament have a pretty good cheek to talk about abolishing the canteen in camp, seeing that you have a canteen of your own.""

When it was first mooted, however, I clearly saw that, in the event of effect being given to it, a great deal of our commerce, which now flows through the Mediterranean Sea, the Suez Canal, and the Red Sea would be diverted into an entirely new channel. I saw that a very large portion of it would be diverted into the Atlantic Ocean, and that, passing through the Panama Canal, it would cross the Pacific to the shores of Australia. I realize, as every thinking man must do, that the completion, of ' t h is canal must bring about a great transformation so far as both the North and the South Pacific Oceans are concerned. From comparatively quiet, unfrequented waters, they will be transformed into, perhaps, the busiest ocean highways of the world, along which the great bulk of the commerce, not only of Great Britain, but of Continental countries and the east coast of America, will flow to Australia, as well as to ports on the west coast of North and South America. The Pacific Ocean, comparatively unfrequented as it is, will a few"" years hence become alive with the commerce of the civilized nations of the earth, and it is most important that Australia should consider what will be the effect of that transformation upon her ow.ni commerce, and her trade with other nations, which flows across these seas. One of fhe first things to be guarded against is the occupation by foreign Powers of the most important group of islands lying close to what will be the main route of traffic between Panama and Australia.

I must certainly ditions obtaining in the islands, and to give credit to the Prime Minister for the do the work of pioneering there. But when, Mr Johnson. It is unservices can avail them nothing so long In consequence of our action a As the disputes in regard assist them, not by monetary grants, but after encouraging our people to settle in the group, we deliberately set up' obstacles in the way of their progress, and close the only profitable, market open to them, we are tt guilty of something worse than folly. The effect of this action on our part is likely to be very serious. We may not feel it immediately, but there is not the slightest doubt that, unless we take steps to remedy the evil we have created by our failure to afford reasonable encouragement to these settlers, we shall realize later on, in a very unpleasant way, perhaps, the blunder we have committed. I am glad to say that in nearly all the principal newspapers of this and other State capitals articles have opinions which coincide with my own I am glad that a most instructive article of this character has appeared in the Age newspaper, because it is not often that I can speak in terms of commendation of the matter appearing irj that journaJ. As the writer puts the case for the settlers in the New Hebrides very concisely, I may 'be pardoned for quoting what he says. The article appeared as a leader in the Age of the 25th June last, and is as follows:About the, time the Commonwealth was created there was so great a danger of the New Hebrides passing completely under the domination of the French that the Government was obliged to take practical steps to avert an issue so menacing to Australian national interests. Strong representations were made to the Imperial authorities, and soon afterwards an agreement was entered into between the Commonwealth Government and Messrs. Burns, Philp, and Co., whereby the lands belonging to that company in the group were thrown open for British settlement. In consequence about sixty Australians were induced to settle in the islands and undertake the cultivation of cocoanut. The situation was thereby temporarily saved, for the influx of the new colonists turned the tide in favour of British supremacy. about the task of establishing themselves in the most sanguine spirit, and a bright future apparently lay before them. The idea was that they should derive their main income from copra -the product of the cocoanut-bu t as the cocoanut palm does not come into bearing for about seven to ten years after being' planted, they expected to make their living in the meanwhile by growing maize and coffee for the Australian market. It was that prospect which persuaded them to leave .their homes on the mainland and embark their capital and enterprise in the work of asserting and maintaining Australian interests in those lonely Pacific islands. The Commonwealth Parliament at once proceeded to reward them for their patriotism by breaking all its implied promises and treating them as outcast aliens. It passed a Tariff which very properly put a high duty on foreign grown maize and coffee, but as it neglected to provide any rebate [54]2 on British grown produce entering Australia from die New Hebrides, it showed in the most practical fashion that it regarded the British settlers it had enticed there as no better than foreigners and enemies. That Tariff still stands unaltered. The fact has already produced results injurious to the Commonwealth. Twothirds of the Australian colonists have exhausted their capital and have been compelled to abandon their embryo plantations and quit the islands for want of a market in which to dispose of the products of their toil. Australian selfishness has ruined them, and those who still survive are being brought nearer to the same ruin, by the same cause, day by day. The French settlers, on the other hand, are flourishing. They are subsidized by the French Government to the extent of ^34,000 per annum; their produce is allowed to enter Noumea practically duty free, and they enjoy the f u l l rights recently appeared expressing of French citizenship. France realizes the enormous strategical importance of the islands, and is willing to make any reasonable sacrifice to secure them. She has lately offered British settlers the same rights and privileges as their French rivals now enjoy if they will become naturalized as French subjects. N ot only are the French settlers in the New Hebrides subsidized by ""the French Government, and by a company operating from France, but their produce is admitted into French ports practically duty free, because, while in the first instance duty is charged upon it, a very large rebate is allowed, and the balance collected is returned to the French authorities in the islands, to be expended in improvements, such as the making of roads, and the providing of wharfage accommodation, and other facilities for the transport of commodities to market. The British settlers, on the other hand, are heavily handicapped, because they cannot send their produce to French ports without paying heavy duties, and Australia, instead of giving them treatment similar to that given to the French settlers by France, has raised against them a Tariff wall, They* 'set which keeps out their products, and these are then thrown back on their hands, often to rot, because in that climate maize cannot be kept very longwithout being spoiled. Therefore, not only are great inducements held out to the British settlers to forget that they are Britishers, and to remember that they are being treated by Australia as aliens and outcasts; but the people are being tempted by the fear of starvation and destitution to avail themselves of the undoubted advantages which would follow French naturalization. The article continuesSo far this offer has been refused, but there is good reason to fear that it may some time be accepted. The British settlers are growing tired of being penalized and mined for their patriotism. For five years we have been denying them the means of livelihood, although they exiled themselves to serve us. VVe shall have our own negligence and niggardliness alone to blame if they turn round and assist the French to obtain sole control of the group. It is said that such a proposal has been made, and' that there is grave danger of the matter being seriously taken up. We are loth to believe that anything could induce a body of British subjects to renounce their nationality; but there can be no doubt that the British settlers in the New Hebrides are very sore at the unjust treatment which the Commonwealth has meted out to them. At the present time a petition is in course of signature in the islands which is intended to be forwarded to Mr Deakin, asking for preferential tariff treatment of British grown produce. We are, however, very well aware of the duty we owe to thc petitioners, and it will be a lasting memorial lo our discredit if we wait for the arrival exercised a more or less careless protecof the petition to transact it. Coming from an organ like the Age, which cannot be charged with leanings towards free trade, these are very strong sentiments, and show the unwisdom of looking at the question from a fiscal stand-point. We should approach it with the desire to do what is best in the interests of the Empire, of Australia, and of the settlers themselves, ancl regard it as altogether outside fiscal considerations. The article concludesThe Federal Government should immediately introduce a short Bill granting a substantial rebate of the Tariff on all British grown produce entering Australia from the New Hebrides. It could be passed in a single' sitting, for we doubt if one member could be found to vote against it. This is a matter that concerns our national honour, which we pledged to the settlers whom we persuaded to go to the islands, but which we have yet failed to redeem. For other reasons we cannot too soon put this matter to rights. Interests which go to the very root of our future national welfare demand that British occupation of the New Hebrides should be paramount and permanent. This can only be effected by opening our markets to the British settlers. In no other way can British development of the islands be .promoted. The men who are fighting our batlle for us there ask nothing but the rights of Australian citizens, nnd many of them are Australians. They must live while they are struggling for a foothold. Hitherto we have watched their efforts without liftin g a hand to help; indeed, we have done what we could to foil and hinder them ancl bring them to starvation. <In a word, we have been playing blindly into the hands of France. It is not yet too late, perhaps, to remedy our folly, but we cannot afford to waste a single day in setting about it. I thoroughly endorse what I have read. The dangers pointed out are by no means imaginary; they are only too real. In that opinion, I am supported by the statements contained in letters sent Mr Johnson. by British residents in the New Hebrides to friend's in Australia, and, in particular, by a letter which I have received from the brother of a settler, who has been kind enough to give me a good deal of information about the conditions of settlement in the New Hebrides. The amount expended by France in the development of these islands is wholly out of proportion to the return which she gets from the French settlement there. But the European nations now realize that the Pacific may be the scene of the'naval conflicts of the future, and therefore recognise the importance of guarding their interests by securing territory there. A generation ago, most of the Pacific islands, with the exception of those over which Great Britain torate, were in the undisturbed possession of the aboriginal inhabitants, but to-day, owing to the want of foresight and activity on the part of the Downing-street authorities, foreign nations have established possessions in many places within a few days.' journey of Australia, and at a convenient striking distance, should unfriendly relations between them and Great Britain arise. We cannot blame these nations for taking advantage of the situation, but we should reproach ourselves for not having been sufficiently alive to the value of the islands from a strategical, as well as a commercial, stand-point. At that time no national complications could have arisen from the hoisting of the British flag upon islands which are now in the possession of foreign Powers. In many cases where the British flag was hoisted, the British authorities did not appreciate the hold that they had upon the islands, and' some were afterwards practically filched from them. I need only refer to Tahiti, Hawaii, Samoa, New Caledonia, and German New Guinea, over all of which the Union Jack once floated. don for the statement that the New Hebrides were included in the original charter to New Zealand. And it is indisputable that they were largely discovered, surveyed, charted, and missionised by British effort, and at British cost. Gradually the islands to which I have referred have passed away from the British sway, and have been brought under foreign control. At present there is no chance of the New Hebrides being taken under the sole protection of Great Britain unless at the cost of some great sacrifice, either",27,Rebate Of Duties New Hebrides

And on the question of prompt action or otherwise by the Commonwealth Government the fate of the group on the score of national control now virtually' hangs. The French Government see what an 'immense advantage they have, in the fact that Australian settlers here are treated by the Australian Government as aliens and foreigners, and their products shut out of their only market by prohibitive tariffs. This has already practically ruined many settlers, who, after exhausting their small capital, have had to abandon their plantations. Small wonder that these ruined men are bitter in soul, and in the struggle between patriotism and destitution, are strongly tempted to yield to French inducements to change their allegiance from the British to the French flag. Surely the small amount of produce that the Australian settlers send into the Australian market cannot seriously be regarded as competition that can hurt Australians, who are their brothers. And look at the issues at stake from the nation's stand-point. The Australian settlers cannot hold out much longer against the templing bait of the better trading opportunities offered them by the French authorities, and once they yield, the case for French control, on the ground of effective occupation and French trading interests being paramount, will be unassailable. So for God's sake do try to get the Australian Parliament to realize what apathy or neglect must mean. The control of these islands by a foreign Government means practically that the Gibraltar of the Pacific is, through sheer folly, stupidity, and apathy, lost to our nation, for whatever nation holds the New Hebrides holds the key to the whole of the Southern Pacific trade routes once the Panama Canal is an accomplished fact. But this you know as well as I do, because you have often proclaimed the same fact. The writer is in a very unfortunate position. He sold out his property in Australia, and invested all his money in the New Hebrides. He assures me that he has practically lost everything, but he is still endeavouring to prevent others from falling into the snares set by the French settlers in the direction of inducing them to accept French naturalization. Another letter has been addressed to Senator Smith by a New Hebrides settler, who, in reference to the petition sent to the Prime Minister, saysThe main point dealt with is the unsatisfactory condition of British development here, owing to the abandonment of. plantations in embryo by such as maize, millet, &c. Another control of the group. Such a proposal has actually been made, and I have reason To renounce one's nationality is a grave step to take, but under the peculiar circumstances it is an Act that would find condonation even among the most patriotic. One's sentiment of patriotism is apt to become deadened when one's own country refuses to regard one as anything but a foreigner. This is a particularly sore point with Australians here, especially as we claim to be trying to colonize in the interests of Australia. . . . . There can be no successful efforts at development until the one obstacle, the tariff, is wholly or for the main part removed; and our petition embodies a request for a rebate' of at least three-fourths of the amount of tariff on all British-grown produce from the New Hebrides. The amount of produce imported into Australia from the New Hebrides is very small, and, even from the point of view of a pronounced protectionist, could' not be regarded as likely to exercise any appreciable influence upon our markets. I gather from an official return laid upon, the table, on ioth August, 1904, that the quantity of maize sent to Australia was 18,266 centals. cover ?

The return which I have mentioned shows the produce which has been carried from the New* Hebrides to Australia in vessels owned by Burns, Philp, and Company during the year ended 30th June, 1904.

96,Mr Webster (Gwydir) [5.5],"Iinterests of the Department, but in the interests of the public. Throughout the large cities of Australia the Government have been subjected to very strenuous criticism because they propose to introduce the toll telephone system. City residents strongly object to any change from the flat system -the system under which a yearly rental is paid for the use of the telephone irrespective of the number of calls made by, or the services rendered to, the subscriber. Abundant evidence can be found in almost every civilized country in favour of the adoption of the toll system. 1 The other the Postmaster-General whether it was the intention of the Government to make that system compulsory, I was sorry to receive the reply that it was not proposed to make it compulsory in the case of the present subscribers. subscribers evidence which I have obtained points to the fact that it is not only reasonable to apply the toll system to new subscribers, but that it is absolutely essential-if we are to secure the full use of the telephone service-that it should be made general throughout the Commonwealth. I have taken the trouble to consult authorities upon this matter, whose word cannot be questioned, and they all emphasize the economy attending the adoption of the measurement system as compared with the flat system. In this connection, I wish to refer to the utterances of Lord Stanley when Postmaster-General of Great Britain. In a letter to The Times, describing the utility of the measurement system, he saysThere are two systems of charge in Londonthe unlimited service system and the message but it is detrimental to the efficiency of the rate system. The unlimited service system . in Lord Stanley's opinion, is unsuitable for a modern telephone exchange service, and owes pared with the measurement system. He its continuance to the force of custom and the declares that under the flat system certain demands of a limited number of large users. subscribers will use their instruments to The London exchange system is conthe fullest possible extent. It is that fact stantly increasing both in the number of subwhich accounts for many persons being so scribers and the number of exchanges. In again referring to the matter a little to communicate with a certain sublater, he saysI t is clear, therefore, that no fixed rate for Important evidence bearing on this quesunlimited use can adequately correspond with such conditions. If fixed with regard to the tion was also given by Mr W. E. L . cost of the service for a large exchange system, Gaine, general manager of the National it must necessarily be prohibitive for small users, Telephone Company. These authoritiesand if fixed on the basis of the cost of a small all men of vast experience-spea k in no unexchange system, it must soon become unremunerative. In Lord Stanley's view the proper certain voice as to what would be the effect method of charge is that which was recomof the proposed change. mended by the Select Committee ""of 1898, under which the payments of the subscribers are fixed in proportion to their use. The measured rate system offered by the Post Office fulfils this requirement, and its advantages have been proved by its acceptance by more than 90 per cent, of the subscribers to the London Post Office system. The toll system has been in use in the United Kingdom for some time, with the result that it is applied to 90 per cent, of the telephone subscribers there. In corroboration of Lord Stanley's remarks, I desire to quote -from a Teport by Mjr. John Gavey, Engineer-in-Chief of the day, when I asked British Post Office, who makes these very pertinent remarksI think that the true solution of the question of tariffs is the introduction of the measured service-that is, a moderate subscription to cover the line and the-telephone, with a moderate fee per transaction. That system, if generally introduced, would bring about a great measure of economy, not only amongst the users of the telephones, but in the administration of the service. Under the ordinary method of flatrate charging, the large users get the advantage ---the smaller users are penalized. Again, the large users fill up their lines to the very utmost possible degree; in other words, they will not rent a second line until they are absolutely compelled to, with the result that subscribers who call them up are, in 50 per cent, of the cases, told the line is engaged. The answering of the call and the testing of the line occupies as much of the operator's time as the putting through; the result is that the cost of working on the flat-rate system is much increased, and the smaller user is penalized, and, I think, whatever measure of economy in rates may be anticipated by the Committee or the country at large will depend rather on the general introduction of the measured service of charges than the perpetuation of the flat-rate system. These statements emphasize a very important point in connection with the reform which I am now urging. According to Mr Gavey, the flat system is not only unjust, service, besides being expensive as comfrequently told when they wish scriber that the line is engaged. In referring",32,Rebate Of Duties New Hebrides

98,Mr Webster,"Exactly. All theto a meeting at Sheffield, at which he urged advisers of their Departments, realize the the adoption of the measured as against the true trouble at the root of the telephone flat system, Mr Gaine saidI endeavoured to show wilh what amount of plausibility I was capable of that this was the most righteous system that could be, that you paid according to use; but, in the very strongest language, the meeting did not care for that; they would not have it at any price, and one man coming down the stairs when I was enlarging upon the beauties of the system, said he did not care, & c , it would cost him £g$ a year instead of the £& or ^10 which he was then paying, and he was not going to have it. That practically is the objection raised by those who use their telephones to the fullest extent under our system. They complain that if they were called upon to pay according to the use they make of the service they would be charged far more than they are under the flat system. Naturally they are opposed even to the partial change contemplated by the Government. for their money some one else must be getting too little. justice is, so to speak, a double-edged one. The man who obtains more than that for which he pays is doing an injustice to the State, and is receiving something to which he is not entitled, whilst the person who only occasionally uses the telephone is penalized. He has to pay practically the same as the man who avails himself of the system to the fullest extent. Mr Gaine, in answer to the question, ""And it cuts against popularizing the service,"" saidI think it does. The"" to l l "" system I would These eminent men agree that our present take with both hands to-morrow, a small charge and i d . a message, and I think you will do a great deal to popularize the service. I have also a report of the evidence given have further evidence by equally competent by Mr John Gavey before the Select Comauthorities. I have here the testimony of mittee of the House of Commons, in which the American Telegraph and Telephone he emphasizes the opinions expressed by Company, to whose allied systems no less other witnesses to whom I have referred. than 2,500,000 telephones were connected He saidEvidently the fear of being charged with the controlling so vast a system, and having tolls for the excess conversations immediately such a wide experience, should be able to eliminated all frivolous and unnecessary talks. speak with authority on this subject. In That is another aspect of the question. The introduction of the measured system confers a great benefit on subscribers genersaid in former reports with reference to the ally by eliminating the unnecessary and effect of the operation of the so-called indefrivolous talking which goes on, to the dependent triment of those having, legitimate business petition, particularly in view of the rates at to transact over the wires. I am satisfied which they undertook to supply service, and that these gentlemen, who are responsible which they themselves, to a large extent, now system. Mr Gavey went on to sayDifferential toll might be imposed somewhat of this character :-Suppos e the first 1,500 messages were charged at a penny and the next 1,500 at a halfpenny, and then all beyond that at a farthing. That proposal was practically, made to override the objection of those who use the telephone to its fullest extent. I believe that it is under the consideration of the Government, and that they will have some suggestion to make to the House with reference to the scale of charges and the limited number of calls to be allowed under the new regulations. Evidence was also given before the Committee by Sir William Preece, one of the greatest authorities on telephony in the British Empire. He saidIn America (in Buffalo) they started a system of charging only for the work done-the y call it "" a toll. "" It is a bad term, but it has got introduced, and we cannot help using it. It means this : That in Buffalo they commenced (in 1S80, about) to charge their renters only for the service rendered, at so much per talk. In Switzerland, and partially in Stockholm, and partially in certain parts of France, they have adopted this toll system. Now, sir, my view is this : That this toll system, in itself, is an extremely fair mode of charging, because you really extract from the user of the telephone something, f r o ratd, for the service you render him. When you ask, say, two men to pay £20 each in London, the one may send twenty messages in a day, and the other man not twenty messages a month, so that the incidence of the charge is unfair. system is not only ineffective and unjust, but also pernicious, from the stand-point of the administration of the service.

100,Mr Webster,"Exactly. The inpublicly acknowledge to have been entirely inadequate, has undoubtedly operated as an embarrassment to the logical progress of the business. Mr J. J. Carty, then chief engineer of the New York Telephone Company, made these observationsUnder the flat-rate method of charging in large cities the more times the customer uses his telephone during the day the greater is the expense to the telephone company. This is due, not only to the increased number of operators required, but also to the increased switch-board sections needed for them, and to the increased trunk line plant. By the method of flat-rate charging there is no motive for the telephone company to encourage an increase in the number of calls. For this reason, a flat-rate plan would have to be so engineered, and the rates would have to be so established, that extension stations, desk stands, and other auxiliaries tending to make the use of the telephone easy, and therefore more frequent, must be discouraged. The existence of the flat rate in such cases would not only be attended by all of these consequences, but many others, one of which in particular is of great importance. I refer to the excessive use of the subscribers' line which such a rate engenders. The consequence of this excessive use is that the busy calls attain such serious proportions that it is difficult, if not absolutely impossible, to give satisfactory service. This trouble from busy calls has at times attained such serious proportions that engineers in varkus places have exerted extraordinary efforts to mitigate the evil, but without , success. This difficulty having been caused by commeric.il methods could not be overcome by the engineer employing physical methods. The solution of this difficulty lay with the business management, and consisted in the adoption of a proper system of message rates. Once such a method was put into force, all of these difficulties which I have enumerated as pertaining to the flat rate, and many others which I have not taken the time to explain, disappeared. He then went on to refer to the effect of times a day. the flat rate system, and the wisdom of its exceeds fourteen calls is getting, a service adoption, sayingAs soon as the message-rate system was remunerated. adopted all of these difficulties disappeared, phone forty times a day, if he were aland many positive advantages, not even suslowed the maximum number of 600 calls pected as residing in the message-rate plan, deper annum, and charged i d . for each addiveloped. Under the flat-rate system there was tional call, would be asked to pay £ 2 7 every temptation for the subscriber to send as many calls as possible over one line. This, ios. per annum for his telephone service, as I have already stated, resulted in overcrowdand, although that is much more than any ing the line, and was attended by bad resubscriber pays now, the service would be actions of every kind. Those having but small a very cheap one at the price. use for a telephone could not afford to pay the high flat rate which that method of working made it necessary for the telephone company to charge. The consequence of this was lhat the Government loses as much as £ 2 0 per only those having a large number of calls inyear on some telephones. stalled a telephone, nnd those having small use of the telephone made it a practice to use the telephones of their neighbours, or did not emare cases in which the Government loses ploy the telephone at all. This practice on the considerably more than that amount. Nof part of the small user was a natural one, in only does the Department lose revenue, but view of the fact that under the flat rate the telephone subscriber considered that it cost him nothing to allow his neighbour to-use his telephone. All of this resulted in a system largely composed of overloaded lines. Under the condition obtaining in our large cities, the relief of an overloaded line can be obtained only at the expense of a second line, which, in most cases, meant doubling the cost of the telephone service. For this, and many other reasons, the desired relief could not be obtained under the flat-rate system. I think I have read sufEcient to show that the leading authorities throughout the world agree that the system in force in Australia to-day is insufficient to meet the demands of the public. They agree practically that it interferes with the economy and efficiency of the service. They all emphasize the point that the person who uses the telephone to its full extent obtains more than that for which he pays. It must be recognised that the greater the number of calls the greater the cost of administration. It has been calculated that fourteen calls a day practically cost as much as the subscription paid by the subscriber, having regard to the necessary addition to working expenses of the amount required for a sinking fund, and to cover interest. That is to say that, when an operator has answered fourteen calls, the subscriber making them has obtained full value for his money. Every subscriber who uses a telephone more than fourteen times a day gets a service for which he does not pay. About1 per cent, of the subscribers in Australia use their 'telephones over 100 times a day, and 10 per cent, fifty times a day, while a very large number use them more than fourteen:, but less than fifty But every subscriber who for which the Department is not adequately A person using the tele-",34,Rebate Of Duties New Hebrides
101,Mr Ewing,Unde r the present system,35,Rebate Of Duties New Hebrides
102,Mr Webster,"I believe, that therethe service is rendered ineffective, and thus great annoyance is caused. When a line is used to its fullest extent, the effectivephone service to the disadvantage of small ness of the service is necessarily interfered with, many subscribers being prevented from getting the numbers for which they ask, and having to make five or six calls before they can secure connexions. This is very disturbing to their tempers, and results in nervous injury to the operators of the switch-boards. Subscribers, not knowing why they cannot be connected, often assume that the operators are not paying proper attention to their work, and the language used on these occasions is often such as ordinary men would not care to listen to, while sensitive girls have been while the hotel proprietors, as most of them seen by the superintendent to burst into tears as the result of the insults offered to them, would be put to less expense fo; them. No man would like his daughter to be placed in a position where she might be treated in this way. I hope that the Government will not hesitate to make the proposed change. They sliould not pander to those who have been protesting so largely of late against any increase in the rate. I believe that if the change were set about at once, the new system could be in thorough' operation before the end of 1909. When it is brought about, subscribers will be charged for the service actually rendered to them, and no one will have to pay for a service he does not get. Some persons grumble because it is proposed to charge Jd. a call for every call exceeding a certain maximum; but that is an absurdly cheap rate at which to send a message over a distance of, perhaps, five or ten miles, a reply being obtainable for which no charge is made. Before the invention of tlie telephone, urgent messages had to be despatched either by telegram or by special messengers, a system always much less satisfactory than the telephone, and much more costly. brevity, telegrams were frequently misread, and no answer could be obtained to them without extra payment, while the up-keep of messenger staffs was in many cases very large, and in neither instance could communication be entered upon in anything like the time that is taken when the telephone is used. But. while metropolitan subscribers are grumbling at this small charge, if tlie people in the country ask for a telephone exchange their request is not even considered until proper guarantees are signed to cover possible deficiencies in revenue during a number of years' work. Mr Webster. The people in the large centres of population have hitherto obtained a cheap telesubscribers, and of those in country districts. Of course, many whose telephones now are used very frequently would be glad of the adoption of the toll system. Hotel telephones, for instance, are used at all hours of the day and night for the purpose of frivolous inquiries, and often attendants iare constantly kept busy answering the calls of persons who wish to know if certain visitors are staying there. If one halfpenny had to be paid for each call, calls would be less frequent, but the departmental revenue would be increased, recognise when the position is explained to attendance. Some of the business men who at present pay only £ 9 a year, for their telephones1 per cent, of them-ge t a service worth £100 a year, and would have to pay that sum to the Department if they were charged Jd. each for all their calls Over a certain maximum. On the other hand, there are many small business places where the calls are not more than four or five, or even two a day, and at present they have to pay as much as those who use their telephones continually. That in itself indicates the need for a change-no t a half-and-half change, but one which will give the community the full benefit derivable from the toll system. The Government have indicated that they are disinclined to apply the toll system ,to the subscribers who are at present paying the flat rate. If they do not, it will be years before the benefits of the change are fully felt. In America the toll system wasadopted many years ago, and owing to the small annual charge made under that system, the subscribers under the flat-rate Owing to their system have not increased, but, on the contrary, have gradually diminished, until they cow number only 1 per cent. The extension of telephones under the measured system has been very great in other parts of the world. In America there was an increase of as many as 500,000 subscribersin one year, and in Germany the annual calls increased from 20,000,000 to 100,000,000 a year, while during the last four years, there has been a further increase of 40,000,000 calls. In New York in 1893 there were 10,000 instruments in use, and, in 1904, 140,000, only 1 per cent, of which are at present under the flat-rate system.

It has been proposed that we should allow two persons to use the same line at a charge °f £ 3 5 pe* annum each, as compared s with £ 5 , and it may be possible to permit a larger number of subscribers to share in the use of a line at a still further reduced fee. I have every hope that electricians will soon be able to overcome the difficulties which now arise owing to the possibility of persons connected with the same line being able to overhear conversations to which they are not supposed to listen. Under a system that is now being tested, I believe that it will be possible for twenty subscribers to use the one line without interfering with each other. If present expectations in this regard are realized, it will be impossible to fix any limit to the development of the systemi The Government have in Mr Hesketh, an officer whose heart is in his work, and who understands the whole of the mechanical, electrical, 'and commercial aspects of the service. He has been to America and' has gained a great deal of valuable information. I should like to quote a few of his remarks with regard to the extension of the telephone service. He saysTo briefly condense the conclusion, it is impossible to avoid after a close study of American conditions, I believe ihat to establish any telephone system upon secure lines-line s which will induce the greatest number of people to partake in its privileges, is not to leave the outside districts until the large centres are fully provided for, but lo build from the outside districts in towards the large centres, or, at the very least, to give to the outside districts an equal share of attention. It were better to leave the cities to press their requirements, and to go out offering the advantages to the country districts, than to do the reverse. The business men in cities know the use and convenience of a good telephone system; the farmer may not. should be taken that the advantages are pointed out to him, and that he is given every facility for sjiaring tliem. Mr Hesketh's statements clearly indicate that up to the present time the telephone system has not been used to advance the welfare of the persons who are developing this country. He argues that the system should be developed in the country districts and worked in towards the centres of population. I want the Minister representing the Postmaster-General to recognise that that is a cardinal feature in Mr Hesketh's report. The Vice-President of the Executive Council represents a country constituMr Webster. ency just as I do, and he must realize the advantages which telephonic communication would confer upon rural residents. to country life. one of the factors which tend to make endurable the lot of persons settled upon the land. I have no desire to delay the House by quoting from the whole of the material in my possession, because I have already, sufficiently shown that the adoption of the toll system is urgently required in the interests of the telephone service itself. If we send officers to other countries to ascertain what is being done there in the way of providing telephonic facilities, we must be prepared to pay some regard to their reports, and we must face the problems presented to us-no t in a halfhearted manner, fearing the opposition "" of a few city merchants, but in an absolutely fearless and just way. Let us so regulate our telephonic charges that each subscriber shall pay for the service which he receives. That is the basis upon which the Department should be administered. There is no excuse whatever for the Government hesitating to substitute the toll for the flat system at the earliest possible date. member favour the scale of charges which was framed by the Government, and which was afterwards withdrawn ? about that.

What is the present tariff? £17 for an unlimited service; but I may remind the honourable member that under the message rate you can get a telephone for £ 6 ios., and I may perhaps add, that of the Post Office subscribers 90 per cent, take the message rale, and not the unlimited service rate; that is to say, £ 6 ios. covering 360 calls. ber was speaking of Switzerland. taken. that the Department charges a nominal fee and Jd. per call from the jump.

United Kingdom 360 calls constitute a maximum, and thereafter a charge of id. per call is levied. I hold in my hand the figures relating to the charges imposed in Switzerland, Germany, and other countries, but there is no need for me to quote them, because I shall have another opportunity of doing so before the session closes. am extremely sorry that fhe Government have yielded to the clamour of the large telephone users in the cities of Australia. It seems to me that the metropolitan press control the Government of the Commonwealth. The newspapers of the different capitals teemed with correspondence upon the Government proposal to introduce the toll system, and the Government, listening to the appeals of interested parties, immediatelv withdrew their scheme, which consequently did not come into force upon ""ist Julv, as was originally intended. It may be their intention to fix 750 calls as the maximum allowed for a fixed annual fee, and they may intend to charge Jd. per call for the' first couple of thousand calls in excess of the maximum. If any such proposal is brought forward I shall oppose it. It would be unfair to impose differential rates in regard to the telephone service. I ' understand that Mr Hesketh has supplied to the Postmaster-General a later-anc l a very lengthy and able report-upo n this matter. I believe that that report has been before the various officers in the different States, and that it is ready for submission to this House. I s'hould like to have seen it before proceeding with this motion. If the Government do not agree to substitute the toll for the flat system within a period of three and a half years, the reform of which they speak will be a mere make believea reform which is unworthy of them and of the gentleman who is controlling the administration of the Postal Department. Upon behalf of the farmers and settlers in the country-of those who do not enjoy telephonic facilities 10-day, Gut who live practically isolated from their fellowsI appeal to the Ministry for consideration. While meting out justice to city subscribers we can at the same time act fairly to residents in the country. There is no justification for the Government resisting my appeal, whilst greasing the fatted sow. City merchants raise their voice against the granting of any concessions to the farmers, and yet, in connection with the working of a socialistic institution like the Post Oflice Further, in the they are prepared to accept five times the amount of service to which they are legitimately entitled. It is they who are getting the benefit of the socialistic machine. They do not object to that, but they are the first to protest against the application of the same system to people who are far more deserving of consideration at the hands of I the Government. By placing the telephone charges upon an equitable basis, we shall clearly show that we have the interests of the people at heart, we shall increase the number of subscribers one hundred-fold, we shall give relief to those who cannot afford to pay the present rates, and we shall provide a more effective service. Our telephone system is absolutely out of date. In Svdney the metallic system is not yet in vogue, although it is in operation in Brisbane.

By adopting the toll system we shall at once secure the means to enable the metallic circuit to be introduced throughout the length and breadth of Australia, and we shall then be able to connect our telephone wires with numbers of subscribers who cannot be connected under the single-line system. The system calls for reform in regard to its mechanical, administrative, and financial aspects, and I trust that the Government will see that that reform is carried out so that the people may derive to the full tlie benefit of this great modern convenience. I can support to a large extent much that the honourable member for Gwydir has said. phone system is of immense importance to the commercial community, and that it is also a great convenience to those living in the rural districts to which it has been extended. As to the method of payment, the call or toll system requires that payment shall be made for the services rendered. cannot be applied to all branches of the Post and Telegraph Department. were applied, for instance, to the mail services, those living in the interior would have to pay very heavily indeed for the delivery of their mails as compared with what would be the cost to those living in the cities. into this matter thoroughly and should commence with the preparation of a proper 'business balance-sheet, showing the capital expenditure and the cost of maintaining the service. One reason why many country districts are unable to secure extenthemselves would have to pay for it. I sions of the telephone system is that a very high charge is made for erecting the lines. Some weeks ago I referred to this phase of the question, and I desire to again bring it under the attention of the Minister. Before determining upon the rates to be levied, the Postmaster-General should have a business-like balance-sheet prepared, and ascertain what the service is costing. ing the whole system was made available only about a month ago. idle to talk about conducting this system on business lines unless our words are followed by deeds. One great obstacle in the wav of the extension of the system to country districts is that the persons to be served are required to pay not only for. the erection of the lines, but for their maintenance, a fee of 25s. per annum being levied for the latter purpose. The honourable member for Gwydir said that under the present system a merchant could obtain for £ 9 a vear a service that would cost him £100 per annum under a toll system of Jd. per call. I would point out, however, that that wouldi mean 50,000 calis per annum, or in other words, 1,000 a week, 150 a day, 19 per hour, or 1 in every three minutes. I scarcely conceive it possible that any merchant makes such a demand on the service. It is idle for us to base our arguments in favour of the extension of the system to the country disThere is no doubt that the teletricts upon such statements. As a matter of fact, some business establishments have not one but several telephones in use; and, whilst we seek to do the right thing by the rural districts, we must recognise that in all matters of business we ought to be just and reasonable. The position of these merchants should be considered. The call system is, in my opinion, the best that could be adopted, since under it every manhas to pay in some degree for the services rendered him. It also prevents frivolous If it conversations over the lines. Another point is that if payment had to be made for each call those having telephones in their private houses would not allow their neighbours to use them as so many of them do at present. Such a practice is The Department should go forbidden by the Department, but human nature is such that every one seems to delight in obtaining something at the expense of the Government. This use of the telephone service by non-subscribers would not occur if it meant that the subscribers cannot express an opinion as to the number of calls that should be allowed at a fixed rate, but the proposal that the charge should be reduced as the number increases is a wise one. toll principle is admitted the question as to the number of calls to be allowed is simply a matter of detail for consideration. I first read the correspondence in the press It is in reference to this subject, I thought that the initial charge proposed to be made by the Government was too high.

146,Mr Carpenter,"I amnot dealingService. I consider that the appointment of certain officers to look through the Departments under the charge of other officials, and prepare reports which inferential ly condemn the administration, without regard to the difficulties under which the work may have been conducted for some years past, is calculated to create suspicion in the minds of some of our best officers, and convey the impression that they are not being fairly treated. I am not here to urge any excuse on behalf of the officers in Western Australia; but I would point out that for the past fifteen years events have marched so rapidly that a great strain has been imposed upon the resources of the Department. Towns have sprung up in a few days, and an immediate demand has arisen for postal, telegraphic, and telephonic facilities. It has therefore been almost impossible to meet the demands in the same satisfactory way that would have been practicable in other States, where the development has been more slow. It is an easy matter where the growth is normal to prepare to meet demands as they arise; but when a new gold-field' is discovered, and men rush by hundreds and thousands into a locality hitherto uninhabited, it is useless for the heads of the Department to protest that they cannot grant postal and telegraph facilities because they have not the necessary appliances. They are called upon to do the best they can. and it may be that in many cases the responsible officer has not been to blame because he has not provided' facilities in keeping with the requirements of the case. That is one possible explanation of the complaints that have been made, and have led to the charges against the officers to whom I have referred. However that may be, the one point to which I wish to direct the attention of the Minister, and which relates to the whole service, is whether some better means could not be devised of raising the standard of efficiency, and of pointing out defects and suggesting improvements in the service. During the last dav or two a paragraph has appeared ini the newspapers to the effect that the secretary to the Post and Telegraph ' Department. Mr Scott, will nossiblv be appointed as genera] inspector of the Department. proposal is an excellent one. The practice of appointing inspectors is adopted by our large banking institutions, and, to some extent, in other Departments of the Public Service. No officer, in public or private service, is perfect and there are few, , if any, who would not welcome suggestions with a view to effecting improvements in their methods. It would be a good thing if we could appoint an expert in each division to occasionally visit the various States and look round, not as a spy, or as an enemy to the officers in charge, but as a friend, and suggest any improvements that he may consider desirable. It would be preferable to do this rather than to send officers out to do the work in such a way that those in charge, instead of being helped towards the adoption of a better system, are at once singled out for punishment or removal from office. Speaking from my own experience in the industrv which I have followed all my life, I contend that there is not a man in any workshop in the world who would not walk about and find fault with the methods adopted by his fellow workmen, and perhaps suggest improvements. The looker on sees more than the player or worker. A man who for many years has been doing a certain thing; in a certain way frequently omits to notice where improvements could be effected, whereas valuable suggestions could readily .be made by persons looking on from the outside. If a method such as I have suggested were adopted, it would conduce to greater confidence in our public service, and a better feeling among the officers. I have mentioned this matter again, because I think that the Minister has hardly appreciated the importance of the subject, or the effect it may have upon every branch of our service, if it becomes known that there is ..a possibility of a junior officer being brought along to inquire into the work of a superior, and, perhaps, to condemn him, with a knowledge that he will be able to profit by such condemnation. That is the crux of the whole matter. I believe that the Public Service Commissioner would himself admit that a grave danger attaches to such methods of inspection, and I hope that we shall receive from him at least some assurance that it will not be continued. wish to bring under the notice of the Minister representing; the Minister of Defence, He is a good man, too. a matter which, while, it in no wav affects I think that the him personally, is one that I think may eventually exercise a very serious effect upon the discipline of the great Department over which he presides.",42,Medals Naval Brigade Alleged Combine In Oatmeal Warrnambool Battery Lift In Sydney Post

149,Mr Kelly (Wentworth) [7.49],"I554 The Minister knows that the one essential in his Department is discipline, and the only way in which it can be obtained is by an absolutely loyal adherence to the spirit ancl' letter of the regulations governfriends, which may subsequently be published in ing the Department. If a subordinate officer or man in the Defence Forces transgresses the regulations he is invariably .given a very short shrift. Very properly the heads of Departments are firm upholders of the regulations; but if it is necessary for the heads of Departments to insist upon their subordinates upholding those regulations it is all the more essential member know that he did it without that they themselves should equally honour them. The matter which I am about to bring under the notice of the Minister is not, in itself, one of a very vital nature, except that it does evidence a disregard for the regulations which no high officer of the Defence Department should exhibit. Today, with, a view to imposing some check upon breaches of the regulations, I asked a number of questions in this House. I asked the Minister representing the Minister of Defence whether there were any regulations dealing with the relations which officers may have with the press, and. if so, whether he would lay a copy of them upon the table of the House. The Minister replied that there were such regulations, and he did lay a copy of them upon the table. I then inquired whether officers were free to grant interviews to the press if they so desired, to which the Minister replied that they were not. I further asked if a certain officer had been granted permission to give information relating to his recent mission to England to a certain newspaper. The Minister replied that he had not been granted such permission. Finally, I asked whether the Minister would take steps to see that there was no recurrence of the episode. forms the subject-matter of my present complaint. He stated that he was not aware that the officer in question had infringed the regulations. infringement in any case. tions governing the Naval Forces of the Commonwealth, and allow the Minister himself to be the judge of that.

Here was an officer of high standing in the Naval Forces of the Commonwealth actually granting an interview to a representative of the Age newspaper without special authority-a n interview which extended over three-quarters of a column. authority ? so. The next regulation bearing upon this matter readsThey are not to attempt to prejudge questions under investigation by the publication, anonymously or otherwise, of their opinions. I have been compelled to bring this matter forward because of the Minister's statement that he is not aware that there has been any transgression of the regulations. Surely he must recognise that it is absolutely essential that ail officers of the Defence Department should know that it is not their duty to have any dealings whatever with the press. ber allow them to hold private conversations which might find their way into the press ? the regulations at the present moment.

160,Mr Kelly,"I do not think that is so,every officer and private to decide the matter for himself? Obviously, such a regulation would be impossible in its working, because under it every man would be the judge of what information if was proper for him to give to the press, and the result would be that in a very short time every secret in the possession of the Defence Department would be at the disposal of every one outside. The next point which I desire to discuss is one in regard to which the Government are distinctly blamable. It is a matter upon which we may justifiably ask for some explanation. As honourable members are aware, during the recess the Government took it upon themselves to send the Naval Director to England for the purpose of gaining certain information. Whilst he was in the mother country it was obviously tb the benefit of the Commonwealth that he should gain as much information as possible. My quarrel with the Government is that they recalled the officer in question without affording him an opportunity of attending the Imperial Naval manoeuvres, which were held this year. That is a point on which I wish the Minister to give a full explanation. The honourable gentleman must recognise that the experience which our Naval Director would .have gained by attending the Imperial manoeuvres would have ibeen invaluable to the Commonwealth. able? does not seem to think that there is any value in naval manoeuvres. members that attendance at naval manoeuvres is a privilege anxiously sought by sailors in every part of the world. the Commonwealth gain ? have a Naval Director who has not for very many years been at sea. He is a very valuable officer, but his value would be enhanced by sea experience. good manv of our officers are always "" at sea "" ! member for Wentworth means experience at sea with the Commonwealth fleet-the Protector, for instance. for Laanecoorie does not seem to realize that the Naval Director is proposing a scheme of torpedo flotillas for the Commonwealth, and that the combined movement of torpedo craft and large ships of war is one of the most delicate operations in naval manoeuvring. I have been told by naval officers in the Imperial service that they would infinitely rather not have torpedo boats on their side when manoeuvring than have to operate with torpedo boats in the handling of which they had not entire confidence. That, I think, answers the honourable member's interjection. It is essential, if we are to have torpedo flotillas-and I am opposed to them-that the commander should at least have had some recent knowledge of naval manoeuvres. The Naval Director had an opportunity while in. England to attend the Imperial manoeuvres, and I think the Government did not act wisely in recalling Captain Creswell so soon. The Minister knows that Captain Creswell was invited, and actually accepted the invitation; and yet we find him hastily recalled, and missing an invaluable opportunity to fit himself for his high office. To turn to another subject, will the Government take into their serious consideration the advisability of instituting in Australia some examination similar, or corresponding, to the English examination for "" tactical fitness to command "" ? It is now the avowed intention of the Government-and I have no quarrel whatever with that avowed policy as expressed-to give "" preference "" to Australians in all' appointments in the Australian service. I say, advisedly, "" preference to Australians,"" not the employment of Australians exclusively. provided they are fit. The only way in which we can make our officers fit to hold the high positions to which they aspire is to call upon them to pass the highest and stiffest examination extant. Some of our appointments are extremely important. Take, for instance, the high office of Inspector-General. It has been lately urged in the press that the Judging by reports, a appointment is not an Executive appointment in the technical sense, but an appointment more of a> staff nature than anything el so. But I refer honourable members to the explanation of the late Minister of Defence, on the 2nd November, 1904, in this House, as to one of the probable duties of the Inspector-General.

171,Mr Kelly,"Provided they are fit.the Forces in time of war, and the reply wasIn time of war the man who should be placed in command of our Forces is the man who knows, so to speak, the individual capacity of the members of the Defence Forces. The man who knows what the omcers can do, and what the men can do, is the man who should command, because he knows to what extent he can try them. The man who best knows that is the Inspector-General. Therefore, he would be Commander-in-Chief in time of war. The then Minister of Defence meant to qualify, and, I think, afterwards did qualify, that statement by saying that the Inspector-General would probably be Commander-in-Chief. There, we see, an enormous responsibility which may devolve on the Inspector-General in time of need. Knowing that he will have to incur, in all probability, that enormous responsibility, it is not too much to ask the Government to be extremely careful to see that Australian officers have an opportunity to pass such an examination as will fit them to undertake it. General for Australia has passed much more severe examination's than has the English officer in a similar position. with persons or personalities; this is entirely a question of general policy. I think the best method and honourable members will see the force of what I say -woul d be for the Ministry to consider the matter in their corporate capacity. It is not the fault of Australian officers that they have not passed such examinations, and they may take it as some bar in the way of their progress that there are examinations of the kind in other parts of the world. ures are those who have passed the examinations. fools are those who have not passed them. The remark of the honourable member for Laanecoorie is one made in regard to all professional examinations-that examinations are a test not of ability, but of knowledge. the examinations-that is, people who are clever only at examinations-but , on the other hand, the men who cannot pass them have not the knowledge requisite for high office. If an officer has not the knowledge on paper he will not have it on the field. The examination for practical fitness to command! is an examination of more than a man's mental fitness and understanding. I know I am speaking vaguely; and I only wish I had the papers before me. At any rate, all officers of the Imperial service, who aspire to positions of any importance, are asked to pass that examination. tralia. not examined in "" tactical fitness to command."" major have to pass the examination. lieutenant-colonel. fitness to command. particular examination ? mination than that for lieutenant-colonel. It deals not only with the manoeuvring of large bodies of men, but with questions of supply and so forth; it is really an important examination which fits a, man to hold an independent command. with the manoeuvring of a regiment, whereas the Australian examination deals with the manoeuvring of a brigade, which is higher still. The examination, in England is, I understand, to test a man's fitness to exercise an independent command. An officer in command of a brigade may very easily be a subordinate officer; indeed!, in most cases I think he is. manding a division or whatever the force is. Australia. is surely rather exaggerating the unimportance of the Australian forces, if he means that a brigade is the full strength that will be ever placed in the field. We may find fools passing time, drilled as divisions in Australia. way get rid of the fact that if ever our forces are to go into the field, and to be of anv use, it must be in greater strength than one brigade.

I rise now lo refer to a grievance which is almost five years old. It relates to the case of a lady who claims to be the designer of the Australian flag. It appears that at the exhibition organized by the Barton Gobest design for an Australian flag was awarded, the exhibit of this lady, owing to some oversight, did not secure the recognition to which it was entitled. The name of the lady in question is Mrs. Rose Shankland Knight, wife of Mr Andrew T. Knight, State-school teacher. Prior to the Government exhibition a competition was promoted by the Herald, and Mrs. Knight sent in the design of a flag which was identical in, all respects with that subsequently adopted by the Commonwealth, on the advice of experts, as the national emblem. This design was shown by Mrs. Knight to Colonel Williams, editor of the Ballarat Courier, who commissioned his chief reporter, Mr Cotton, to interview her, and subsequently, after the Australian flag had been selected by the Barton Government, sent to compliment her. Mrs. Knight has written several letters asking that her claim, not for the money prize, but for the honour of being the designer of the Australian flag, should be recognised, but has received' no acknowledgment. She is able to produce, if desired by the Government-and I presume that they would like to ascertain who was really the designer of our national emblem a .copy of the interview between herself and the reporter from the Ballarat Courier, as well as the notes made by Mr Cotton, and a communication from Colonel Williams, and also the evidence of people who know she sent in her design to the Herald competition.

205,Mr Ewing,"Very well, I shall havewhich I desire to refer relates to the Department of Trade and Customs. In consequence of the number of hides and sheep skins now exported from the CommonI wealth, many fellmongers here experienced great difficulty in finding employment at their trade. These exports have affected the thority on this questionfellmongery trade to such an extent that a lot of fellmongery yards and sheep skins basil factories have been closed. do not know whether a remedy is to be found in the Anti-Trust which has left our hands, or whether it is provided by a section of the Customs Act, which prohibits certain exports. I have no desire to interfere with our export trade, but in a matter of this kind we must have regard for the greatest good to the greatest number. When I find that the export of hides is assuming such large dimensions owing to the labour available for their treatment in foreign countries, being 50 per cent, cheaper than that obtainable here, I cannot help thinking that the matter is one of which the Department should take some notice. It appears that the hides exported from the Commonwealth in 1905 were of the value of £3,879,398, the exports from Victoria alone being of the value of £1,152,583. In 1901 the hands employed in the fellmongery trade totalled 1,831; in 1903 they had fallen away to 1,640, and in 1905 there were only 1,000 so employed. These figures show a decrease of 831 hands in less than five years. Let me give a few figures relating to the Geelong factories. It is from information supplied by the local men that I am able to present these statistics to the House. There were 745 men employed in the Geelong tanneries in 1899-1900, and now there are only 78. In Connor's tannery there used to be 30 hands; there are now only three; in Mun-. dav's tannery there were 65 hands employed, there are now only 15; in the Australasian Leather Trades Review. He tralian Tannery Company's yards tjiere were 60 men employed, there are now only 25; in Gardiner's tannery there were 30 hands employed, but there are now only 15; whilst Douglas and Company had fellmongery yards employing 60 men, but are now employing none in that branch of labour. The value of the leather manufactured in Victoria between 1899 and 1903 fell off to the extent of £77,512. A return furnished by. the Department shows that in the year's 1901-2-3, the Commonwealth exported 20,300,000 sheep skins, valued at £3,091,811, and 894,393 hides, valued at £787,587. In 1904, 4,338,962 sheep skins and hides, to the value of £100,610, were exported; whilst in 9°5> 7<5 >ooo sheep skins and 21 171,173 hides were shipped. To quote a writer, Mr E... Plumridge, a great auThese sheep skins ancl hides are exported to foreign countries, such as France, Germany, I and Belgium. The wages paid in those countries averaging fully 50 per cent, less than in Australia, and the hours worked being very much Bill longer. It appears that the wages paid in Belgium average from 2s. 6d. to 3s. 2d. per day of ten hours, whilst the wages paid in Australia would be 6s. per day. In addition to these difficulties, the industry has to compete against the fact that these hides are taken as ballast in ships which are subsidized by foreign Governments. A bonus is also paid by these Governments to vessels conveying the largest number in a given time. I am told that some of these facts have been brought before the Tariff Commission. the matter. a possibility of obtaining a report from the Commission which will give some satisfaction to the industrv. Something needs to be done when out of twenty yards which were being used some years ago only six are now engaged in the industry. I find that other countries have met this difficulty. I myself wrote in reference to the subject, at the request of some of my constituents, to the Consul-General for the Argentine Republic in Sydney. I have not received a reply from him, but I have here a letter which .gives an account of an interview with the Consul for the Argentine in reference to the subject. The letter is from the manager of the AussaysDear Sir,-In accordance with your request, I interviewed the Consul for the Argentine Republic, and although he is not in a position to f u l ly answer the questions contained in your letter, the following information relative to the export duty on hides, skins, and wool, and the average prices realized for those articles, should be of interest. By the Tariff regulations of the Argentine Republic, the price for adjusting duties on cow hides is fixed at 6£d. per lb., and the export tax is i d . per lb. On salted hides the duty is £d. per lb. Sheep skins (lambs, dirty and washed, in whatever condition, quality, or price), are valued for the Tariff purposes at 4|d. per lb., and the duty is",47,Medals Naval Brigade Alleged Combine In Oatmeal Warrnambool Battery Lift In Sydney Post

208,Mr Crouch,"I hope that there is3 of a farthing, the same figures being applicable to salted sheep skins. Wool is valued at 4^d, per lb., and tht duty levied is the same as on sheep skins. The average prices realized at the end of 1905 for sheep skins and salted hides were as follows :-Sheep skins,' f u l l wooled, first quality, g£d. per l b . ; second quality, gd. per l b . ; inferior, Sd. per lb. Cross breds-firs t quality, iod. per l b . ; medium, 9^1. per l b . ; irregular, 9d. per lb. Hides (salted), 4|d. to 5^d. per lb. The Consul for the Argentine cannot state when these export duties were introduced, consequently we were unable to institute a comparison between the prices ruling prior to the duties being imposed, und those in force at present. In our next issue we are publishing a f u l l report of the proceedings before the Tariff Commission, when evidence was tendered by Mr James Munday, Mr Palmer, and yourself. I am told that the imposition of these export duties has not had the effect of decreasing the price of skins at the place of shipment. The duty has been paid by the exporter. that our fellmongers have lost their employment, and that the tanners have suffered so largely, I think that the Government might give favorable consideration to the proposal to impose an export duty. That could be done, in my belief, without injury or loss of price to those who export skins, whilst it would give employment to a large body of men who otherwise would materially suffer. It is a great national question to which at a later time. I hope the House will give full and just consideration. I desire to make a few remarks with 1 respect to the removal of postmasters. Two or three cases have come under my notice which indicate a want of care and judgment. Mr _EWING -The honourable member knows that the matter is under the control of the Public Service Commissioner. cisms may be conveyed to him. where a postmaster has been removed because his salary was higher than that which is considered to be appropriate to the office which he occupied. Buti f that oflice were re-graded to-day, it would be found that the business has so much increased that the Department would be justified in retaining the postmaster. He does not wish to be removed, the people in the nerghbourhoo3 do not wish him to go, he satisfies the Department, and the only reason given for his removal is that the Public Service Commissioner considers that his salary is too high for the office, stating that he can only re-grade offices every five years. It appears to me to be absurd to remove a man from an office ih the position I have indicated, because it is a rule of the Department to re-grade offices only every five years. I know of another case of an opposite character. A post-office is situated in a growing district, ancl the business has advanced so greatly, the office has become so important, that the grade of the present postmaster is too low for it. He was placed in that office for reasons of health. The health of his family has improved, and he is satisfied to remain where he is, but the Department insists on his being removed, because the office has advanced beyond his grade. However, he is being removed to another progressive district, where, again, the office may grow beyond his grade. If an officer is If that be so, seeing not likely to improve in his grade, the Department should not remove him to another advancing district, but to one of a more stationary character. But to remove an officer to a progressive district, where the grade of the office is likely to go up, and then to remove him somewhere else, is not in the best interests of the Commonwealth. It involves an expenditure of public money which ought not to take place. This proceeding should be inquired into. No doubt it has not been brought under the notice of the Commissioner. knows that every officer has the right of appeal, and that until the appeal is decided he will not be removed. quite apart from the officer himself, these removals should be made on some system. In the end, of course, officers must go whither they are told. The common-sense method I have indicated should be adopted. In many of these cases promotion is dependent upon the report of a superior officer. I admit at once that it is a very difficult position to deal with : but cases have come under my notice where there can be no doubt that the reports of superior officers standing in the way of promotion have not been fair. I have no doubt that these reports are prejudiced. The Commissioner should look into the system, and devise a means of checking the reports of superior omcers. I recognise that it is very difficult to .get a perfect system. Until we get some",48,Medals Naval Brigade Alleged Combine In Oatmeal Warrnambool Battery Lift In Sydney Post

214,Mr Lonsdale,"I suggest that,officers of unusually perfect human nature we are not likely to attain perfection in these matters. A number of cases have come under my notice which I am not at liberty to mention. If I were to mention the facts they would support my representation, but I should be giving away the case of the officers concerned. I am speaking with a full knowledge of all the facts, and 1 have no doubt that it is prejudice on the part of superior officers which stands in the way of certain officers getting to a higher grade. . I am not one who would seek to use influence or. behalf of an officer, because I hold that the less we inmember of the Naval Brigade had gone terfere in these matters the better; but where I believe that a wrong is being done, I am prepared to stand by an officer with all the strength I possess. That is the attitude which I have always taken up. I do not believe in helping menwho cannot adivance on tfjeir own merits, andi want a lot of assistance. It is a mistake and a wrong to interfere on behalf of such men. But where officers aire being injured, through -no fault of their own, where they are being prevented from getting promotion by the prejudice of a superior officer, they are entitled to assistance. the reports of superior officers should be discovered. It must be clear to every one that military and naval officers should be compelled to obey the regulations in just the same way as are privates. Where a deliberate breach of the regulations is brought before the Minister he should deal with the officer, or, at any rate, he should officer-that is, the Minister. get the case dealt with by the proper Board. offence. but strange to say it is not considered that there are many degrees of offence when a private is the offender. As a rule, he is dropped upon pretty heavily. It appears that degrees of offence are considered only in the case of higher officers. C£LS6 should insist upon fair treatment being meted out to officers and privates alike. Do so, surely our officers should go to not punish an officer in a certain way because he is an officer, or a private in a certain way because he is a private, but mete out equal treatment to all ranks. now? Evidently, there is one officer who has committed a breach of the regulations; but, so far as I know, he has not been called to book. He may be a very valuable officer, but, nevertheless, he ought to be dealt with. I think that he should have a chance of defending himself. If he can prove that he has not broken the regulations, that is another matter.. offence j but the less talking there is the better. to the press and revealed some information, what would have been done with him? Would the offence have been regarded as trifling when committed by a private as it apparently is when committedl by an officer? The offence is really greater when it is committed by an officer. What is the use of the Minister suggesting that, in this instance, there was a trifling offence? Either it was an offence, or it was not. The punishment should be greater for the officer than the private, but, strange to say, it is always the opposite. I understand from the press Some system of checking that the Naval Director did not remain to attend the naval manoeuvres. the will of the Ministry, surely ! the press that the Naval Director came back without being recalled by his superior ber mean to say that this officer forewent the privilege of attending the naval manoeuvres ? What reason can there be for his returning? cannot peer into the mind of the -officer, but I understand that he did not attend the naval manoeuvres. The Minister can say whether the officer was asked to come back. If he was not recalled, why_ did he return'? I understood that the Minister intended him to go to the manoeuvres. A great deal has been said about the necessity for our having Australian officers. If that be those expositions, which are calculated to give them the best information and training.

243,Mr Lonsdale,"No . WhatI wishshould be neither an advantage nor a disadvantage to a candidate to be an Australian. Qualifications alone should be considered. In my opinion, it would have been a good thing if Captain Creswell had been able to attend the manoeuvres. I understood the honourable member for Laanecoorie to say that his attendance would not have done much good, and to interject that some of the biggest failures in the British Army had done well at examinations. tain Creswell's attendance at the manoeuvres would not have done him good. that ability to pass an examination is 'not necessarily a proof of fitness for a position. It mav only show the possession of a good memorv. There are doctors who, having brilliantly passed examinations, are not successful in the treatment of patients, while other medical men who have not done well at examinations have been very successful in their practice. But those facts would not justify us im abolishing medical examinations, or in declaring that those who have not passed examinations are better than those who have done so. Examinations are a test of knowledge, and should^ as far as possible, be practical. officers can take part in naval or military manoeuvres, they thereby gain a training which they would otherwise be without, and I think that if Captain Creswell could have remained for the English manoeuvres he should not have been recalled, or, if he was not recalled, he had no right to return. I do not wish to discuss the Tariff, but I feel bound to express my disgust at what has been said regarding the fellmongers' grievance. In Victoria, whenever there are two or three men who are not doing well, some Member of Parliament comes forward to champion, their cause, and an attempt is made to lay the great primary industries of the Commonwealth under tribute to give them assistance. That is the result of the' political training of the people of this State. Fast legislation has taken all the grit out of them, so that they now wish to be shielded from every wind that blows, and to be protected from competition of everv kind. The other day there was a great howl in the Victorian newspapers because of the action of the Geelong Harbor Trust in buying some barges in Tasmania. I cannot imagine anything more contemptible tlian that. Let us develop a stronger and nobler spirit, and divest ourselves of that intense selfishness which would sacrifice the interests of the community at large for the sake of affording a few days' employment to a certain section of workmen. Why should one of our primary industries be sacrificed for the sake of a few fellmongers? The people who buy our wool wish to treat it in their own way, and they should be at perfect liberty to do so. Why should we reduce the price of one of our staple products by retaining it here? I I did not say that Caphope that the Minister will take a note of my remarks with regard to the postmaster to whose case I referred, and that he will make inquiries into the matter. am very Ioth to say anything, upon an occasion of this kind, but I feel that the extraordinary remarks of the honourable member for New England regarding the party to which I belong call for some protest. One is often staggered to learn from the newspapers that the most remarkable ideas are held concerning the views expressed by honourable members of this House, but I think that such speeches as that to which we have just listened are primarily responsible for any misapprehension that may exist. The honourable memI f our ber has stated that the members of a certain party in this Parliament were so utterly selfish, so completely blind to the benefits that have been showered upon us by the motherland', and altogether so unjust and unfair, that they were prepared to disregard ability and merit and to give preference to an applicant for any position, merely because he happened to be an Australian.

Many of those who utter the cry "" Australia for the Australians "" should reflect that if there were anything in it they would have no right to be here, because Australia should have been lef t to the aboriginals. If their fathers and mothers had not come from the motherland, they would not have had the privilege of calling themselves Australians. if it had not been for the enterprise, courage, and colonizing capabilities of those who preceded us in Australia, many of those amongst us would not have been here. I am not speakin"" for myself, because my parents did not come to Australia. The cry of "" Australia for the Australians "" is uttered by many persons who would exclude from participation in the benefits we enjoy those of our own kith and kin who We live in other parts of the Empire. I have no sympathy with that kind of spirit. If we should preserve Australia for the Australians, to be logical we ought to we to judge argue that this country should never have been taken from its original inhabitants. Consequently, we should regard ourselves as intruders and interlopers. The mere But accident of birth-place ought not to impel us to prevent persons coming here from the mother country to assist us in building up a great nation. Personally, I welcome, every member of our own race who will come to Australia, and help us to establish a new Britain in the southern seas. I infinitely prefer the crv of ""Australia for It seems to me that some the Empire"" to that of ""Australia for the Australians."" It is a very much grander and nobler cry. I have no desire to dwell upon this subject, but, as the question has been raised, it is just as well that there should be np misapprehension regarding the attitude of honourable members upon this side of the House, who have adversely criticised this absurdly narrow and selfish sentiment.

259,Mr Johnson,"Loyalty to the Emof paramount importance that we should secure the best possible men for positions of responsibility in our Defence Forces. Reference has been made by the honourable member for Wentworth to the return of Captain Creswell from England at this particular juncture. Probably the Minister representing the Minister of Defence is in a position to tell the House the reasons for that officer's sudden return. Was he recalled by the Government, or did he come back of his own volition? It seems most peculiar that, after having received and accepted an invitation to attend the British naval manoeuvres, in June last-where he might have gained knowledge of the utmost value-he should suddenly have decided to hasten back to Australia. The invitation which was extended to him should haye been regarded as a very great compliment to Australia, and it seems to me that in neglecting to avail himself of it, a slight, almost amounting to an insult, was offered to the British authorities. If he returned to the Commonwealth of his own volition, I think that the House is entitled to be furnished with the reasons for his action. If , on the constanding the representations which have trary, he was recalled at the instance of the Government, we are equally entitled to know the motive which actuated them. I am not aware of anything of an urgent character to account for his sudden return. Perhaps the Minister can offer some satisfactory explanation of this peculiar circumstance. He may also be aware that in military and naval circles there are rumours current that there were reasons for Captain Creswell's sudden return, which, so far, have been kept in the back-ground. I am in possession of some private information upon the subject-information which I am not at libertv to disclose here. I do hope that the Minister will see his way clear to give the House some explanation of this matter. Captain Creswell is an absolute stranger to me, and, consequently, I am not making these observations from mptives of a personal character, but merely from a desire to gain reliable information. Another matter to which I wish to direct attention has reference to the regrading of some of the post-offices' in New South Wales. how the scheme which is being carried out affects Victoria and the other States, but I do know that in some parts of New South Wales this regrading-involving as it does the transfer of postmasters from one district to another-may seriously disMr Johnson. organize the work connected', with the forthcoming elections. In some cases these postmasters are returning officers and eelctoral registrars. The trouble is that new men taking up their duties-althoug h they may be familiar with the routine work in other districts-ar e unacquainted with the officers with whom they will have to deal in the conduct of the elections. I refer to such officers as poll clerks. This is a very important matter. of. gested to the Postmaster-General that it might be advisable-wher e these postmasters are performing electoral duties-to delay their transfer till after the' general election: of the difficulty. not be a solution of the difficulty in all cases. It would, however, certainly do away with the risk of seriously disorganizing the work of the elections. Notwithbeen made, I am aware that in one or two cases men occupying these positions have received notice of their appointment to other offices. protest the consideration of the appeals will occupy some time. of the appeals will extend over the interval betweeni this and the close of the elections, such a delay would, of course, make all ihe difference, so far as the ivork of the forthcoming ; elections is concerned. I have a matter connected with promotions to refer to. I have no desire to mention names, as I do not care to treat these cases as personal matters, but a special case has been brought under my notice-that of a man who has a very delicate wife, and a couple of children who are attending superior schools. One of the children, I understand, is going up for a somewhat stiff examination. This man is being removed to a country office I do not know manv miles inland, and in a climate which is admittedly unhealthy. The man's wife is so delicate that she requires to consult her medical adviser more or less frequently, and he has certified that the climate will be absolutely dangerous to her health if she is removed to this place.

There is no superior school in the district to which the man could send his children, and, having spent a good sum of money on their education, with a view that one of them should take certain honours, it is hard that the father should be compelled to remove to this bush place, where it will be impossible for his children to pursue their studies as they are able to do at present. The salary attached to the office is insufficient to enable the officer to permit his wife and children to remain in Sydney, or to send his children to a boarding-school. It seems to me that it should be possible to arrange transfers which would not entail inconveniences such as these. It might be possible to find amongst unmarried men of robust constitution persons who would be eligible for these isolated posts, and to whom public schools' and doctors are not matters of any great importance. with delicate wives in worse positions in the country who for years have been anxiously awaiting removal. no desire to interfere with the early removal of such officers ito more suitable places. I merely suggest that in making these exchanges, if possible, a selection should be made from single men of robust constitution to fill such places as the officer master-General a question on the subject, in question is to be removed to. The suggestion, is one which I think may well be brought .under the notice of the Minister, that it may be submitted to the Commissioner for adoption, if possible. There are one or two matters to which I should like fo refer before the debate closes. Statements of a very serious character have been made in connection with the recent visit to England of Captain Creswell. It has been asserted by several honourable members that this officer deliberately left England without taking advantage of an excellent opportunity afforded him to witness the naval manoeuvres about' to take place there, and that he came back to Australia without being recalled by his Minister. In the circumstances it appears to me that the matter is one of so serious a character that, if the Minister does not give a satisfactory answer to the statements made, the adjournment of the House should be moved in order to deal ' 5°5 with it. I trust that the Minister will be able to give a satisfactoryanswer to the statements which have been made by honourable members, and to statements to the same effect which have appeared in the press of the Commonwealth. About a fortnight ago I directed the attention of the Postmaster-General to a condition of affairs in the Sydney Post Office, which for a long time past has been causing inconvenience to thousands of people in that city. I refer to the state of the principal lift in the office. It is over five months since that lift got out of order, and,, although I drew attention to the matter a fortnight ago, when I had occasion, the day before yesterdav. to go to the post-office in connection with the business of my constituency, I still found the notice, "" Lift not working."" From inquiries I made it would appear that from 100 to 150 perisons use that lift daily when it is in working order. Thousands of persons must therefore have 'been inconvenienced' during the time it has not been working. The fact that the principal lift in the Sydney Post Office, where so much business is transacted, should be allowed to remain out of order for over five months, is certainly a disgrace to the Department. concerning the matter a week or two ago? and the honourable gentleman said that he would make inquiries. When I visited the Sydney Post Office the day before yesterday, I found that nothing had ibeen done, and the lift was still closed. The Vice President of the Executive Council was in charge of the Post Office Department for some time during the last four or five , months, and I think the honourable gentleman ought to discover who is to blame in connection with this matter. the subject to-morrow. * which I should like to direct attention was the subject of a question yesterday by the honourable and learned member for Parkes. I refer to the removal of telegraphic instruments from the Royal Exchange, Sydney. The Vice-President of the Executive Council is aware that the Royal Exchange is situated in one of the most important business centres of Sydney.

The feeling which I have indicated is a growing one; and Ministers ought to do all in their power to see that it is removed, because it only tends to produce irritation and ill-feeling between the people of New South Wales and the people of other parts of the Commonwealth. I should like to refer to another matter connected with my own constituency. During the absence of the Postmaster-Generali n Europe, I drew the attention of the Minister administering the Department to the lack of telephone facilities in the important centre of Bulli. Postmaster-General is a native of the district, and knows it to be one of the most important coal-mining centres in Australia. Some considerable time ago the Postmaster General agreed that a telephone exchange should be established there, and I may mention that it was to be established on the toll system. Mr Nelson, the Chief Electrician of the Department in Sydney, visited Bulli and met the residents; when Sup-ply (Formal). [REPRESENTATIVES.] Supply (Formal). the difference between the two systems had The telegraphic instruments been explained, it was unanimously agreed to adopt the toll system. I have not been able to ascertain all the facts, but, for some reason or other, although this meeting took place long ibefore the Postmaster-General went to Europe, the telephone exchange is not yet in working order. A very large T l i e instruments have amount of business is done at Bulli, and the Minister knows the necessity there is for quick communication with Sydney and other parts of New South Wales.

I have received a complaint in this connection from the local Progress Association, and I take this opportunity to bring the matter under the notice of the Afinister, feeling sure that he will have inquiries made.,. sire to bring under the notice of the Minister who administers the Patents Act a case which well illustrates the difficulties arising from the fact that there is only one Patents Office. A certain resident of Sydney applied for a patent, and the time for his making the deposit of £ 5 expired The people have on a certain Saturday. On the previous Friday the applicant went to the General Post Office and obtained a post-office order for the amount, which he posted in time to reach Melbourne on the following day, in the . ordinary course. _ The Patents Office, however, closes at 12 o'clock on Saturday, and, as the letter did not arrive before that hour, it was held that the time for lodging the deposit had expired. The consequence is that this man has lost his patent.

In any case, the money is supplied by exactly the same set of citizens, and, as I say, any change must involve extra expense. vides that there must be a Federal Capital, and it is only right and proper that the -Constitution should be put into operation. Every honourable member will agree that it would have been infinitely better had there been inserted in the Constitution a provision that, if the site were not selected within three or four years after the establishment of Federation, the Parliament -should meet in Sydney. H a d that been done, we should probably have heard nothing of the bush capital for many years. New South Wales. sentatives of the other States. In order to keep honourable members in touch with thought in the great centres of civilization throughout Australia, and to prevent delay in fhe delivery of the numerous letters that I think such cases must be addressed to them, the site of the Capital should be near, if not on, the main line between Melbourne and Sydney. The Federal Capital must be easy of access. When we reach it we shall probably have from 100 to 150 officials stationed there, and it is not fair that we should take them away from all the benefits of civilization. Honourable members would not care to reside with their families in some out-of-the-way place where they could not obtain the facilities for educating their children that offer elsewhere, and we should recollect that the offiLYNE -If the honourable cers of our staffs will be equally desirous of having some adequate opportunity for the education of their children. When we arrive at a truer sense of what our legislative functions are we shall not have long sessions, and if the Capital be established away from the main lines of communication, we may have practically a deserted village during eight or ten months of the year. A hardship would thus be imposed, not on honourable members, but on the officers and others who must necessarily take up their residence in the Capital. I should be delighted to see the Ministry make an effort to determine this question. We have in this case an illustration of the fallacy of neglecting to make a big question a party matter. Honourable members are free At present we to vote for this site or that, without regard to what will be the effect of their selection, and the position in regard to this question is an indication of what would happen in the absence of party government.

309,Mr Watkins (Newcastle) [9.41],"ment. I refer to the necessity for providing long-service medals for the members of the Naval Brigade, such as are provided for the members of our land Forces. I have never received a satisfactory answer from the Department in respect to this matter. If there is any one Department under the Commonwealth which more than another is particularly skilful in evading an awkward question, and in giving no satisfactory reason why a request should be entertained, commend me to the Defence Department. naval authorities in England did not grant long-service medals? made that long-service medals were not granted to members of the Naval Brigade, because they were not given to the Navy in England. But I always considered that that reply was unsatisfactory, because in Australia the Naval Brigade is practically a part of our land defence Forces. There is no reason whatever why the members of it should be differently treated. Even as regards England, it appears to.me to be ridiculous that a long-service and good-conduct medal should be given to one branch of the Defence Forces, and withheld from the ether. The last time' I brought up this matter, I was informed that it had been referred to the Attorney-General for his opinion as to whether we could institute an Australian long-service medal. Nearly twelve months have since elapsed, and while I admit that the Attorney-General presides over an important and busy Department, still, a year is a reasonable time to allow for an answer to be given to a question of that description. ral now informs us that the question has never been referred to him. he gets it. credence to replies given by Ministers if that is the position ? been referred to some officer of the Department, but it did not come before me personally. that the question was to be referred to the Attorney-General's Department, and I hope that a reply will be given by the honourable [55] and learned gentleman himself. At any rate we ought to know whether the members of the Naval Brigade are to receive what is undoubtedlv fair treatment. The honourable member for Werriwa has referred to this Parliament as moribund. Judging from the action which the Opposition sometimes takes when it is operating in full force, I must say that it appears to me to be a very lively corpse. I dissent from the honourable member's remarks with regard to fhe Federal Capital Site, and as to the visit which it is proposed to make to newly-suggested sites. members of the Opposition were a unanimous party. ally. Ours is by no means a caucus party. We are quite free to express our own opinions.

Mv principal object in rising, however, was to direct the attention of the Minister representing the Defence Department to the case of the men dismissed from the Warrnambool battery. _ No information has as yet been given with respect to that matter.

It takes 56 'bushels of oats, weighing 40 lbs. to the bushel, to make a ton of 2,240 lbs., which brings up the price of oats to -£l 14s. a torn Wheat, which is sold at 60 lbs. to the bushel, is purchasable in the market at 3s. 4jd-. per bushel, and it takes 38 bushels to make a ton of 2,240 lbs. is reckoned at 2,000 lbs.; but in order to make the comparison complete I have brought the ton to 2,240 lbs. in each case. At 3s. 4^d. per bushel, a ton of wheat comes out at £ 6 8s. parcels is quoted in the market at £ 7 ios. a ton. Allowing for what the millers get in the way of offal, such as bran, it leaves a difference of £ 1 zs. for the cost of milling and distributing. On the other hand, I find that oats which cost £ 7 14s. are being distributed wholesale as oatmeal at about £ 1 8 a ton. Allowing£ 1 16s. a ton for the cost of milling and distribution, because the offals are not so valuable as in the case of wheat, and also allowing for distributers' profit, and everything else, it brings the total cost of oatmeal U P t 0 £ 9 ios. a ton. But instead of being distributed at anything like that sum, I believe that the wholesale price is close upon -08, if not actually £ 1 8 . ber considered the relative values of tlie waste of the two products? lowance for the difference in the price of oafs and flour, and also the difference in 1 the value of the offal. I know as well as the honourable member that the value of wheat offal is much greater than that of oat offal. If we make a comparison between this market and the English market, we find that, as a general rule, oats are more expensive in England than in Australia. Oatmeal is being distributed in Glasgow at £ 1 3 , and in Melbourne at about £ 1 8 a ton. tage of the duty of £ 9 6s. 8d. a ton. exists a combine, but it looks to me very much like as if , amongst the millers and workers in this commodity in the different ports, there has been some arrangement entered into whereby the cost of oatmeal to the people is made excessive. ers. hear the honourable member for Moirai f he can throw any light upon the subject. If there is no combine in existence, there is an end to the matter, but if there is a combine in existence it is the duty of honourable members and those connected Of course, a tor. of flour with the Department to see if something cannot be done to set the matter right. Seeing that we have set our faces against the existence of trusts and combines, which are acting to the detriment of the public, Flour in small we should be' very careful to see, first of all, that poor people, who are dependent to a very great extent upon flour and oatmeal for their sustenance, do not suffer.

332,Mr Wilson,"1 . shall be very glad toDebate resumed from 18th July (vide That the Bill be now read a second time. tain lv feel very considerable difficulty in dealing with this measure, because, in the first place, I am very anxious to avoid unnecessary expense. I am one of those who are aware that there is no expenditure which serves a better cause than does the provision of additional Justices when they are really required. If there are not sufficient Justices to carry on the work of a Court, then, no matter what our objection on the score of expenditure may be, additional Justices should certainly be appointed. If that is not done the delays of the law, always in themselves vexatious enough, and also the costs of any cause are largely increased. When litigants are delayed it means that enormous expense is involved, because of the number of witnesses who have to be kept waiting until the cause is tried. ' For instance, in Sydney last month the Justice appointed a day upon which to determine a country cause. Forty-two witnesses had started to come down to the Court, when they were informed that, owing to the pressure of business, His Honour would be unable to attend, and the cause had to be delaved for a week longer. As a consequence, the expense of forty-two witnesses was entailed for ojne week| longer ithan otherwise would have 'been the case. I can also cite a case with which I had some connection a few years ago. Owing to the Equity Judge being unable, to hear and determine the cause on the day appointed, because of the pressure of other causes upon him, the expenses were increased by the sum of no less than £ 1 , 2 0 0 . management. that expenditure was incurred for witnesses' expenses' alone. One or two witnesses had to be brought from New Zealand, and a very heavy expenditure was involved in keeping them in New South Wales. If we take it upon ourselves to refuse to appoint more Judges, when a case seems to have been made out for an addition to the Bench, we must act under a f u l l sense of the heavy responsibility thrust upon us, because, whatever regard we may have for economy in administration, it behoves us to see that there are not too few Justices BILL. for the hearing of appeals. Consequently, when the proposal to add to the High Court Bencli was first mooted, I felt that I should have great difficulty in dealing with it . ' In my opinion, it would be preferable that Justices should want cases than that suitors should want justice, and,rather than bring about the denial of that justice which it should be our primary aim to secure, we should provide more than enough Justices. But, after carefully considering the whole matter, I feel unable to agree to the appointment of more Justices. and learned member agree to any fresh appointments ? time. No doubt, under the Judiciary Act as it stands, the Justices have too much to do, and, if the Act is not amended in certain particulars, it will be necessary to increase the Bench, not by two only, but by at least four. The honourable and learned member' for Indi will agree with me that the appointment of two more Justices will not provide for the constitution of another Full Court, and that the appointment of at least three would be necessary for that purpose. In addition, there is the work of the Arbitration Court, so that four., and not two, new appointment's will be needed if the Act is not amended. What is necessary is to reduce the number of appeals. We should not permit appeals to the H i gh Court from a single Judge. Of course, two Justices could constitute an Appeal Court; but it would create great dissatisfaction in. the mind of a litigant if a decision were given against him because the senior Justice happened to hold one opinion and the junior Justice another. Therefore, it will be unwise to have an Appeal Court of less than three Justices, and it is not proposed to constitute a second Appeal Court. But the facts put before us show that, if the Judiciary Act remains unamended, there will be work, not for two only, but for four more Justices, while an amendment of the Act will make anv new appointment unnecessary, unless, of course, it is thought wise to have an Appeal Court of five instead of three. When the first Judiciary Bill was before us, some four years ago, I , with the honourable and learned member for Angas, pointed out that, if the original jurisdiction provided for were given to the High Court, and appeals were allowed from a single Judge, we should, within two or three years,",60,Medals Naval Brigade Alleged Combine In Oatmeal Warrnambool Battery Lift In Sydney Post

""learned member desire that all litigants shall have to go through the F u l l Courts of the States to get to the High Court? appeal to the High Court should go through the Supreme Courts, and, unless the matter was very important, an appeal should not be allowed from the Supreme Courts. The High Court should sit only as an Appellate Court. multiplied too much, it increases, instead of diminishes, law expenses. the establishment of the High Court, the appeals from Australia to the Privy Council did not average more than twelve a year, and there is not much difference be-tween the expense of an appeal to the Privy Council and the expense of an appeal to the High Court. of the 223 appeals to the Privy Council has been £ 2 1 0 each, and I know of appeals to the High Court which have cost over £ 1 . 0 0 0 each. cost £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 each if the appeal had been to the Privy Council. honourable and learned member refer? to the Attorney-General in private. When' half-a-dozen parties are represented by counsel, expenses soon mount up. I know of a case in which the brief .of the learned counsel was marked with a fee exceeding one hundred guineas, to which, of course, had to be added refreshers. fore the High Court are always represented by counsel, but, in scores of cases, poor litigants need not be'represented by counsel before the Privy Council, and have to incur no further expense than that of printing documents, such, as have to be printed for an appeal to the High Court. deavouring to cheapen law, we have enormously increased its expense to many litigants. Court in Melbourne, there were twelve appeals to ' it ; but if the Judiciary Act had been properly framed, nine of those appeals would not have been heard. What we should do is to amend the Judiciary Act so as to bring the work of the Court within reasonable limits. I admit that there is something to be said for strengthening the Bench so as to have an Appeal Court of five instead of three. To honourable members who take that view I have nothing further to urge. But that is not the ground on which we are asked to consent to the appointment of two extra Justices. If it had been contended that at the time that we passed the original Act excitement ran high, and that there was a grave doubt as to the work the Court would be called upon to do, or as to the appeals which would be made, we might have been asked to reconsider the position, and to inI f appeals are crease the number of Justices. With those who take the view that five Judges-on the Prior to Bench would probably add to the weight of the Court my objection will go for nothing, but 1 wish to particularly point out our failure to recognise the fact that our own legislation has enormously increased the number of cases that have come before the High Court. I do not altogether like to say, "" I told you so,"" but upon looking up the debates I find that I was one of those who pointed out what would result from the passing of the Act in its present form. 1 pointed out that if we gave to the Courtthe original jurisdiction contemplated-ther e was no necessity for it, because we had all the necessary machinery in f u l l operation-w e should enormously increase the work of the Justices. I urged that instead of having one Full Court, we should, within two or three years, require at least two Courts, and that, if cases vvere to be speedily disposed of, we should within ten years be called upon to appoint 17 or 18 Judges. So far my prediction has been fulfilled. I need only refer to the speech of the Attorney-Genera! for proof of this. He referred to the Parties bework that had been done by the Justices, and showed that my forecast was a perfectly correct one. The honourable and learned member for Angas also delivereda very able speech upon the same point. Any one reading that speech to-day cannot fail to be struck by the foresight displayed By enby the honourable and! learned member, and we must be thankful that we have amongst us some men who would grace any debating A t the last sitting of the High assembly in the world.

345,Mr Conroy,"I can give the namesbecause he was one of those who pointed cut that we were exceeding our powers in taking away the right of appeal from the Supreme Courts of the States to the Privy Council, and that we were wrong in deciding that the High Court alone should hear such appeals. The judgment which has since been given by the Privy Councili n ' the Outtrim case fully bears out what was said on that occasion. We took i l ' upon ourselves to give extended powers to the High Court, and I venture to say that within the next two or three years we shall find it necessary to appoint another five Justices in addition to those whose elevation to the Bench is now contemplated. Our Judiciary Acts invests the Justices with so much power that it is only because they have refused to exercise their original jurisdiction, that they have been able to cope with the work. By making litigants go to the High Court straight away we do not diminish the expense to them, but rather increase it. The Justices of the High Court occupy an almost unique positionI am employing the exact words of the Attorney-Generaland we ought not to add to their number, if we can avoid it, especially in a moribund Parliaiment. If , by making the Court, as was first intended, a strictly ap pellate tribunal, we can get along with the. present number of Judges, we ought to do so. we ought to limit the powers of th-b Court, because I foresaw thaF before long we should be called upon to strengthen the Bench. If we allow the Act to stand as at present, we shall only play with the question by appointing two extra Justices. If the report presented by their Honours goes for anything, we should appoint at least four more Justices. Already there are some remanets in at least two of the States, and, therefore, some litigants will be prevented from obtaining an early decision of their causes, and will be involved in extra expense. We should constitute two Full Courts, so that sittings might be held simultaneously in different States for the hearing of appeals. The alternative is to amend the Judiciary Act in the direction of taking away some of the rights of appeal that are now given. If we had made such an amendment before this, nine of the twelve cases which were recently dealt with in Victoria would have absolutely disappeared. cision of a single Judge. the decision of a single State Judge were done away with, litigants would have to pass through two Courts instead of one, in order to reach the final appellate tribunal. knows very well that that is not correct. Does he think that litigants ought to have the right to appeal from Court after Court? He knows very well that in fhe great majority of cases litigants are satisfied with the first decisions that are given. Before the High Court was established, the decisions of the States Supreme Courts-irrespective of whether they were right or wrong,stood. There was a certain amount of finality about them. according to the judgments given by the High Court upon appeal, they were absolutely wrong. have constituted the High Court does not of itself argue that the Justices composing it are endowed with such an infinitely better knowledge of jurisprudence that we are entitled to say their decisions are always right, and those of the Supreme Court Judges are always wrong. infallible, but I would much prefer to acI was one of those who stated that cept the decisions of the High Court than those of any Full Court of a State. the High Court who for a time filled the position of acting Judges in New South Wales, were regarded during their tenure of office as very sound and sensible men, but no greater weight was attached to their judgments than was attached to those of their brother Judges, whose opinions they are now so easily able to supersede. thing to me is the marvellous way in which our High Court Justices always agree. in the Chief Justice of the High Court, the Commonwealth possesses a jurist of very high powers indeed which the Commonwealth has reason to be proud. is one to which nobody in Australia need be ashamed to point, because it possesses men of very great abilities indeed.

Court at Home upsets about 50 per cent, of the decisions of the Divisional Courts. bers appear to think-and the Attorney General encourages the belief that by affording litigants an opportunity to appeal direct to the High Court, we enable them to effect a saving. To the majority, I venture to say that that process involves an additional expenditure. the honourable and Learned member. In addition. I think that he ought to consider whether we have the power under the Constitution to do what he sugge. frame our laws that the number of appeals to the High Court will be .limited in the same way as are the appeals to the Privy Council. We cannot constitute two Courts of Appeal, and if the records to which reference has been made show anything, it is that at least two Courts of Appeal are wanted. I say that two Courts of Appeal are not necessary. How can we constitute two Courts? Every one of the cases which have been quoted would require to have been heard by three Justices. Either we are going too far, or we are not going far enough. The appeals which are now , being made to the High Court are so numerous that the position is becoming a very serious one. Before that tribunal began to upset the decisions of the States Supreme Courts, litigants were satisfied, That is not the case to-day. .1 will guarantee that tbe expense incurred in appealing to the High Court has considerably increased the cost of litigation. ment of that tribunal, there were about twelve appeals annually from the decisions of the States Supreme Courts. These appeals cost, upon an average, about £210, °* £ > 5 ° ° a year. I will undertake to say 2 that no party can appear before the High Court without incurring an expenditure of from /""30 to £ 4 0 on either side. If we assess a great many of the smaller appeals at from £ 8 0 to £100, what a large sum they represent. In view of the multiplicity of these cases, I hold that we are considerably increasing the cost of litigation. Honourable members themselves are conscious of that. What did the Attorney-General do when the Australian Industries Preservation Bill was under consideration the other day ? He limited the power of appeal from the decision of a single Judge. In fact, he provided that there should be no appeal from his decision. In scores of instances that is what obtains to-day. In this connection I particularly refer to the various Courts of Petty Sessions throughout the States. In numbers of cases their decision is practically final. It surely will not be said that we are diminishing the cost of 'law when we now find that in all these cases an appeal would lie to the High Court. As I say, we have enormously increased the amount of litigation which can !be proceeded with, and that is not to the. benefit of the people of Australia. litigants have an option, and can go either to the High Court, or to the Full Court of the Supreme Court of a State. is a congestion of original business that should not lead to a denial of justice, since litigants have that option. a denial of justice where they have that option, nor would there be a denial of justice, even if we did not appoint fresh Justices of the High Court. But the High Court should so frame its rules and regulations as not to allow appeals to be made direct to it. not* do any such thing. our Judiciary Act, and permit appeals only under certain conditions, it could. At the present time a lot of this work is forced upon the High Court as the result Before the establishof our legislation. This was clearly foreseen when we were passing that legislation, and at the time. I pointed out what the result would be. I said that in two years' time the appointment of additional Justices of the High Court would be asked for, and it is manifest, if the figures which have been quoted are correct, that two Courts should have been asked for before, if some power such as I suggest is not to lie exercised. learned member force litigants to go to the State Full Court before they can gei"" to the High Court? would not allow an appeal to the High",63,Judiciary Second Reading

Such a matter should be allowed to go to the High Court. I thought that when we were establishing this Appellate Court we proposed to do so practically in lieu of the Privy Council, and that consequently there would be no more appeals to the High Court than there had been to the Privy Council; nor would there have been if we had framed our legislation properly. I pointed out at the time that if we framed our law as proposed, the number of our appeals would be enormously increased. I have been justified by the event.

So far from diminishing the expenses of appeals, it is proposed to increase them to an enormous extent. would double the expense. is quite wrong. If the power given to appeal to the High Court were only that given in the case of the Privy Council, we should not get'very manv mor« cases than are taken ib the latter tribunal.

My point is that unless we amend the Judiciary Act we shall Justices-that is, we shall have to do so unless the High Court is made an appellate Court pure and simple.

404,Mr Conroy,"But as soon as peopleproposed Judges for that Court, and the necessity for it would be obviated if the High Court were made what it was originally intended to be. I do not say that a Court of five Judges is' not better than a Court of three Judges, but it is as well to look the matter straight in the face, and recognise the fact that, unless we amend the Judiciary Act, two Judges will not be nearly enough, but that, on the contrary, we shall have to appoint at least three more, and possibly a fourth. 'At all events, if appeals continue to increase in the same proportion, or in anything like the same proportion as in the past, we shall have to provide next year for at least two more Judges; and while we are at work we might as well consider whether it would not be well, by an amendment of the Judiciary Act, to render such appointments unnecessary. The one argument that could then be brought forward in favour of extra Judges would be that their appointment would strengthen the Court and give greater weight to its decisions. Sometimes appeals are heard in the Supreme Courts of the States by five or six Judges, and I remember two occasions on which a Full Court of seven Judges sat to determine very important points of law. It would be very unsatisfactory if a decision by seven Judges of a Supreme Court should be upset by an appeal Court consisting of only three Judges. The Attorney-General has never appealed to us on these grounds, but savs that tbe Court is to deal with extraneous niatters entirely; so that the one strong ground I thought he had in defence of the Bill, he has thrown away. Under the circumstances I am unable to give that support to the second reading of the Bill that I might otherwise have been glad to extend. adjourned.
