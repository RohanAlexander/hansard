42,Sir John Forrest (Swan,"Ministe rsuch. The Defence department of Australia, if one can judge from what one hears, is not a very popular one, and I have regretted a good many times that it should have fallen to my lot to be associated with it ; for it the officers appointed by the General, with is more pleasant to be identified with what is regarded in the public mind as a popular institution. The Defence-department is not a revenue producer, and is, to tliat extent, unpopular. A great deal of money is spent in connection with it for what appears to some as very little return in times of peace, so far as the national exchequer is concerned. In time of war we might get a good haul now and again, but in time of peace this is purely a spending department, and I do not wonder, therefore, that those who are sent here specially to protect the taxpayers view any abnormal growth with some alarm. These Estimates have run the gauntlet of the Treasurer's and of my own scrutiny, but I do not claim to be altogether responsible for them. They are not our Estimates, but those of the States, which we found in existence when we took over the departments on the 1st March, 1901. Of course, it may be said that we should have reorganized the department and reconstructed the Estimates upon a basis that we might call our own, quite independently of the Estimates which had previously existed ; but those who speak in this way are not practical men, because it would have been absolutely impossible to do anything of the kind, as I think I shall show in a few moments. ment delay the transfer of the department until they were ready to take up the work of reorganization ? would not have been improved if we had delayed the transfer. Supposing that the Commonwealth had not taken over the Defence department, the States would probably have incurred the same amount of expenditure as before. Does the honourable and learned member suppose that they would have reorganized their departments and cut down their expenses to any large extent ? cases. have reduced the expenditure in South Australia by £5,000 or so, but that would not have materially helped the Commonwealth. All we have done in the way of organization has been to appoint a General Officer, who has been here now a few months, and to also provide him with a staff. I may say, in passing, that the exception of one clerk or secretary, were in the service of the States at the time they were selected. they were qualified. any question has been raised as to thenqualifications. I do not suppose that the General Officer would have selected as members of his staff, upon whom he would have to depend for the management of the defences, men who are not thoroughly qualified. ' If he has done so, he is not the man I take him to be. It would be a very suicidal policy on his part to appoint.incompetent oflicers, because he could not expect to get good work out of them. We took the Defence department over on the 1st March, and everything was then new to me. I was not familiar with the Defence departments of Australia, although I had managed the small Defence department of Western Australia. Then we had the elections immediately afterwards, and following upon those the meeting of Parliament, the Royal visit, and, since that date, Parliament in f u l l session. Before we even had time to look round after the Royal visit, the Treasurer demanded, at the point of the bayonet, that the Estimates should be submitted to him. All we could do was to gather the material for these Estimates from the six corners of Australia, and we instructed the officers in the various States to send in their Estimates. The Estimates furnished by them were not those which honourable members now have before them. W it h the kind assistance of the Treasurer, who is always an excellent friend where any cutting down is necessary, we brought these Estimates into the shapeif I except one or two items, which I shall explain-in which they were passed by the States last year. Since then we have had additional Estimates placed on the table, and all the votes have been lumped together in the Certainly, in some shape in which they now appear. It must be remembered, too, that we have been tied down a good deal by our parliamentary duties, and that we have had no General Officer on whom we were depending for the re-organization of the department. It would have been impossible for me to re-organize",17,Department Of Defence

The first few months were devoted to collecting information, so that we could base our Estimates on the state of affairs existing at the time that we took the departmen to ver. To do more than that for the year ending 30th June next never entered my mind. Without a General OfficerI knew that it was impracticable for me to re-organise the department ; and I never thought of attempting it.

There will be a saving effected of something like £100,000 on these Estimates. Minister not cut down these Estimates by that amount ? honourable member has been Treasurer of Tasmania, and he must know that that £100,000 is distributed over the whole of these Estimates. Therefore, it would be impossible to cut bhem down by bhat amount wibhoub recasting the whole. Isi t not sufficient when I bell honourable members bhab I believe there will be a saving of £100,000? We must also remember that these Estimates include £25,000 for the purchase of new riflesa very small sum indeed when one reflects that £100,000 ought to be devoted to that purpose. I do not know where the additional money which is required is to come No man from-whethe r out of revenue or loanbub ib is absolubely certain bhab we require more rifles. not come out of loan. the honourable and learned member that a Throughout these Estimates there greater country than Australia pays for rifles out of loan money when it is necessary to do so. Then, a sum of £40,000 is provided in excess of the amount which was spent last year for the purchase of ammunition. We propose to set apart £110,000 for this purpose, although last year only £70,000 was spent in this connection. Of course, it is not intended to use the whole of this ammunition during the current year, but we are endeavouring to make up our reserves, which are very much depleted. Even the expenditure of this money will not suffice to accumulate the reserve which, ib is generally admibted, is necessary. When we consider bhab £25,000 is to be spent upon rifles, £40,000 exbra upon ammunition £106,000 for navnl defence, and that nearly £100,000 will be saved throughout the whole of the Estimabes, it will be seen how it comes about that these Estimates are apparently Furthermore, I am so large.

It may not be generally known, but I liave been economically disposed all my life. I do not mean to say that I am niggardly, but it has ever been my aim to see that public money is expended wisely and economically. able gentleman feels it necessary to inform the committee of the fact. life were better known to the honourable member it would prove what I say. Where one is unknown it is necessary to say things which would not be necessary where one is known. Further, we must re-arrange our naval expenditure. Upon our permanent naval force I find that we spend over £70,000 annually. I do not think that that money is expended in a way which is most likely to render that force efficient in time of need. I have not the slightest doubt that we shall have to re-organize our local naval defences. They cost too much, having regard to their efficiency in time of war. That is the general opinion of those with an intimate knowledge of this question. But even in regard to that expenditure, I have made up my mind that considerable reductions must take place. The permanent men can be largely reduced, and consequently the expenditure can be decreased. However, I have not felt justified in dealing with this matter precipitately. We must move slowly and with deliberation, and then we shall be able to act wisely and justly. A t the present time we pay £106,000 to the Imperial Navy, towards which New Zealand also contributes £20,000, and our Australian navy in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, and South Australia costs from £70,000 to £75,000 annually. Therefore we are already paying £181,000 for naval defence. spend more than that in the future, but at the same time. I believe we can secure a far better service for the expenditu re. What we want is a service that will be effective in time of war, not one that is merely effective for harbour defence or in smooth waters. We require a naval defence that will protect our trade and commerce, and consisting of ships which will be able to proceed to sea. No doubt that matter will receive the consideration of the Prime Minister when he is in England, and probably upon his return 31 N he will have something to submit to Parliament regarding the means by which our trade and commerce can be best protected with the least possible expenditure. I agree with those who think that the expenditure upon our military and naval forces requires the closest vigilance and scrutiny. AVe must have an effective service upon economic principles. able gentleman move the first reduction ? quire to make any reduction. Instead of doing that I advise honorablememhers to pass these Estimates as they stand, and to regard them as representing the transferred expenditure of the various States upon military and naval defence. Honourable members should recollect that we have a very big continent to defend, and that we haveonly just entered into federation. Theseare the first Estimates of the Defence department. Hitherto there have been six. States with their different military and naval systems. state of affairs prevail to-day ? hitherto the States have had their own military and naval commandants independently of each other. Now, however, we are bringing all these different systems under one head, and it is only reasonable to believe that more efficiency and economy are possible in the management of one large machine than in the management of six separate machines. My object in rising was to explain to honourable members the true position in regard to these Estimates. During their passage I shall be only toa . glad to give honourable members the fullest information in my possession in regard to*, any particular item. -Nobody will deny for a moment that theNo doubt we shall have to obligation rests upon us to see that the Commonwealth is effectively defended by its. own people. To tlie extent that that is necessary by means of a citizen force, all should be pleased to pass any Estimates that may be required.

One of those points is that we report of the Major-General commanding have not taken sufficiently into account the of all consideration in regard to possible valuable extent to which the defence of this reserves. We need not have a force of so Commonwealth can be assured by purely many thousand men all actually in service at voluntary means.

We may all reasonably expect that our defence force will not be called on again to serve anywhere outside the Commonwealth. contingency which I prefer to believe is exceedingly remote. The chance of our I propose troops being called upon to serve in any foreign country or anywhere outside our own shores is a very remote one. There was to my mind ample justification for sending our men to South Africa, because Australia is as largely concerned in the preservation and protection of British power in South Africa as is any portion of the Empire. South Africa constitutes for us the one safe trade route available in time of war when the Suez Canal might be closed against all the belligerent vessels. That war has given us evidence field such as that-and the field in Australia would be very much tlie same-of mounted I wish to men not drilled into mere machines, but left largely to their own initiative, men with some capacity in the way of riding, which every Australian soldier probably will possess, and with the ability to shoot I will straight.

80,Sir Edward Braddon,"A t anyfor which provision is made in these Estimates. There can be no question whatever that in some of the States the defence force is very much in excess of the 'requirements. One great sinner in this respect is'Tasmania. In the return which accompanies the report of the Major-General commanding, I find that Tasmania has >a total of 3,016 men in the defence foree. That is to say, Tasmania, with a population of 180,000, has a third of the number of troops possessed-by New South Wales with her population of 1,200,000, and half the number of Victoria with her population of 1,100,000. men serving than South Australia, which has double her population, and half as niany men as Western Australia, which has a population slightly greater than that of Tasmania. It was all very well when these different States 'were independent each of the other, thab-each should have a force sufficient for its own particular requirements. But the occasion for that bas entirely changed. We are federated, and the defence force of Australia will operate from one end of the continenb bo bhe other, including also the island of Tasmania. The force is under one control and one commanding head, and will be available equally for the defence of any portion of the territory that may be subjected to attack. Therefore, our federation would be barren of its f r u it in one of the principal directions if we did not economize 'in regard to the number of men in the defence force, so as tcreduce bhab number, nob Sbabe by State, but for the whole Commonwealth,' to the actual minimum required for our defence. decide that minimum ? the minimum amount bo be spent able member speaks of the'minimum force. ment will assisb -Ministers in regard to the -with me in this respectI think that as it minimum amount to he spent in a very is the duty of every able-bodied man to deshort time; but the responsibility surely fend the hearths and homes of his country, rests with those who are governing, and so every.able-bodied man should be liable 1 wibh those upon whom rests, for the time -for service if called upon.

I purposed moving a similar amendment, and, strange to say, there is agreement also, without consultation, in the matter of the amount. There is greater necessity to offer some opinion in regard to the expenditure on defence than might otherwise be the case, in view of the fact that for at least six months after this financial year has closed the finances will, inall probability, £500,000, leaving out of account the conbe carried on by Supply Bills without the passage of Estimates for next year.

There was, however, an amount asked for by the department in expectation on the part of a very considerable proportion, if not the majority, of the people of Australia, that one result of federation would be to secure, not only greater efficiency in the defence force, but a saving in the expenditure. The question, of defence, amongst a comparatively few functions of importance, offers greater opportunity for honourable members to devote their attention to it than was the case in the various States, where it was only a comparatively small function amongst very many others.

97,Mr Watson,"It is strange that the States is, on the whole, larger than ever it was before. For the magnificent army which, according to Major-General Hutton's return, consists roughly of 30,000 men, putting aside rifle clubs, the cost is £ 2 10s. per head for the staffs. This is irrespective of the regimental staffs, and takes into account only the central staffs in the various States, aud the headquarters staff in connection with the Commonwealth. That is an absolutely outrageous expenditure. For every man, whether he be a volunteer, partially-paid man, or permanent man, there is an expenditure of £ 2 10s. on management, leaving out, as I say, the various regimental staffs, which, so far us I know, are absolutely necessary. The actual sum spent in the various States is £56,000 odd, which, with the addition of £16,000 odd for the head-quarters staff, brings the amount to £72,720, or roughly £ 2 10s. per head. Taking allowances, contingencies, and so on, so far as they do not apply to individual oflicers, the amount spent in New South Wales is £ 1 5 , 1 2 4; in Victoria, £10,230 odd; in Queensland, £17,147 ; in South Australia, £6,346 odd; in Western Australia, £5,000 odd ; and. in Tasmania, £2,548. The amount put down for the head-quarters staff is £13,000 odd, but that is the amount for only a part of the year, and is not a proper guide as to the yearly expenditure, which is £16,325. It goes without saying that the various State staffs should be either totally abolished, or very materially reduced as a consequence of the establishment of the central administration. duced. given us no indication of what saving he give reasonable compensation than to conanticipates making in this direction even tinue them in employment for whioh there for next year. been quite worked out yet, but I can give some information. with which StateI am most familiar, a general officer commanding is provided at £1,000 a year, a salary which seems to me to be higher than is necessary for what is a subordinate post pure and simple.

A saving of £16,000 out of £56,000 will still leave £40,000 to be spent on six separate staffs throughout the Commonwealth, an expenditure which I cannot conceive to be' necessary, in view of the small number who have to be drilled and the nature of the accounts which have to be kept. a large number of the oflicers referred to have permanent positions, and we cannot get pensation or pensions. is no necessity. that view. cheapest in matters of this sort.

Of course, I recognise that it is a. difficult thing for a layman to pronounce upon military matters an opinion to which, any attention will be given ; but it seems to methat Parliament has a right to lay* down thebroad principlesand policy of our defenceforces. The expert knowledge of the general in command should be utilized only in making the best of what expenditure thinks is justified-. A certain sum ofmoney has to be spent. for defence, purposes ; and we say, further, that out of that sum we are going-. to encourage rifle shooting; by means of the formation of rifle clubs to whatever is considered 'requisite; but it is only inside well-defined lines that the expert ledge of the general in command should come into play. I think that the General has underrated the importance which ought to be attached to the establishment of rifle clubs. I am sorry to say that in New South Wales wehavenot had so many men enrolled as members of rifle clubs as there have been in Victoria, nor nearly as many as we should have had if' proper encouragement General Hutton seems to me to be'imbued with that notion which apparently nearly all men who have passed their lives in the military service, that without pipeclay and drill a man <:annot bea soldier that without the close disciplinethat years in a trained force gives, there is no possibility of obtaining an efficient service in war time. agree with me, in view of recent developments, that if men are well armed and mounted and know how to use the rifle properly, a force very superior in numbers is necessary in order toeffect any very great result in opposing them. proved by the Boer war, and the probability is that if we have a large body of expert rifle shots in Australia, we shall be able to do with a much smaller number of well-disciplined and trained military men than would be necessary ,under circumstances. large proportion of whatever sum we vote for military purposes should be devoted to the encouragement of rifle shooting. not mean to say that we should devote the money especially to rifle association matches, for in that way I think a great deal is wasted to-day, even in New South Mr Walton. spentinthe Wales.

It is not fair to say that he thinks that he has done all he can do. method upon which the vote is to be spent, but as to the total sum to be expended. The Minister's speech gave me the impression that he had no idea of doing the work for less than the amount at which it stood when the Commonwealth took over the forces. only. Minister to mean for the future. In the appendix, to the report of Major-General Hutton, it is shown that whereas the expenditure of the Commonwealth amounts to 4s. 6d. per head per annum, the expenditure in Canada, which is in a much worse position than is Australia, because she has a possible enemyI hope the time will never come when the United States will be the enemy of England and Canada-o n her frontier for a distance of 3,000 miles, the expenditure is only Is. 6d. per head per annum. Notwithstanding that Canada has a population of a third more than has Australia, her expenditure is under £600,000, while ours for this year approaches' very nearly to £1,000,000. These figures show that it is possible to have an efficient defence without the large expenditure which is most unwarrantably sought to be placed on the people of the Commonwealth in continuation of the wasteful policy in which some of the States have eugaged. I do not know how honourable members feel, but before the debate on this item is closed, I think it would be well if we had some indication from the Prime Minister as to his views in respect of the Empire defence scheme that was put forward a little while ago in England, and cabled out here, I believe, as one of the subjects likely to come up before the conference of Premiers in England. I do not know how far it is likely to be considered by the Premiers, but there have been wild sugjrestions made that Australia should hold on all occasions a reserve force, practically at the command of the Empire, for outside defence. I. think that the total force suggested for Australia is about 50,000 men. out? I do not remember it . Does the well within our reach, but our sea honourable member refer to a telegram in the defence is absolutely beyond our reach, and newspapers ? notice of that. In the first place, I do not think it was genuine. the correspondents of the newspapers are moving in the matter, because our friend Mr Seddon is going to bring up the question of Empire defence according to his own statement, and in various other ways it is being pushed on. In the Army and Navy Gazette, from which a quotation is made in the Argus of to-day, a suggestion is put forward that it would be a proper thing for Australia to contribute to the defence of the Empire in the same ratio to its revenue that Great Britain does. that for many years. for it for many years without result. a man like Mr Seddon may become. and Navy Gazette omitted to draw attention to the fact that a large proportion of the revenue of each State in Australia is made up of the return from the railways, the post offices, water and sewerage boards, water conservation, and a hundred and one items which have nothing to do with the ordinary functions of a central Government, such as England has, and which should not enter into the question of revenue or taxation. Therefore, any comparison of that sort is wide of the mark. We ought to have from the Prime Minister some indication of the line of conduct that he is going to follow in respect to these grave matters concerning defence which are likely to arise at the Conference. I feel sure that there is no desire on the part of the people of Australia to launch into any wild scheme, or even any scheme of large expenditure, so far as the Empire Defence League is concerned. I think I can fairly reiterate what I have said before here-that our share of the defence of the Empire will have been fairly, honestly, and fully carried out if we safeguard this portion of it from attack, and be)'ond that I am not prepared to go. that would cost? no possible method has yet been suggested",27,George Turner Th E Right Honor Of Something Further That is O F Thevalueina

But we ought not to be expected toenter on any largescheme that will cripple a countiy such as this, which, after all, is not so rich, as some persons try to make out, and which involves a. vast expenditure disproportionate to the population in the ordinary services ofGovernment.

I am convinced that for even £500,000 it is possible to have a force on proper lines sufficient for the defence of Australia, sufficient against all possibilities of invasion-which , in the report laid before Parliament, Major-General Hutton very rightly discounts. He implies that the chances of invasion are comparatively small, and, while I agree with him that so far as possible the men we haveshould be trained, that it is necessaiy to have a proper proportion of highly-trained men as artillery and engineers to look after the technical work of defence, I hold that the rest of our defence can be achieved without any great expenditure, and that we are not justified in spending the amount which the Ministry have asked us to vote on these Estimates. not prepared to enter into a discussion of the Estimates to-night, as I feel indisposed.

This is the work which we want the General in command to do-to organize theforces of this country on some principle. So far as I am able to sees tlie report sent in by General Hutton contains no reference to the organization of the defence forces, or to the matters to which I have drawn the Minister's attention. The General goes out of his way to speak of defending. Australia, not from the inside, but from the outside. More than one-paragraph indicates that in his opinion we should defend ourselves best by fighting for Australian interests outside' our own borders. If any attempt is made to introduce that principle when the DefenceB ill comes before-us, it-will have-my most uncompromising opposition.

178,George Turner,"That is indepenMr SAWERS I am quite willing to make a. handsome and worthy contribution towards the maintenance of the Imperial navy, which is the best defencewe can have. As I have said before; I am absolutely opposed to the establishment of an Australian navy, for whicli this country will not-be financially prepared"" for another two or three generations. liaments under the British Constitution have very carefully safeguarded their lights in connection with the military Estimates. liament has so jealously conserved' its powers in this regard that the Estimates have provided for yearly payments only, and I think that the care exercised by the Imperial legislature affords us an example which we should do extremely well to follbw. It is perfectly true, as the Minister for .Defence has said, that the inlanguage, with regard to other nations, crease in the Estimates is not so very great in comparison with the amounts voted for 1 the year prior to the taking over of the' department. It must be remembered, however, that in the year 1900 a great deal of entirely exceptional expenditure was incurred'. The war in South' Africa was proceeding, and the various States were being rushed into a very heavy outlay. connection with the various contingents were not included. away the contingents themselves was not included, but a great deal of money was expended upon administrative work conrnected with thepreparation of the contingents for despatch to South Africa. This expense should have ceased longago, because lately the whole of the cost in connection with thedespatch ofmen to South Africa has been borne hy theI m perial authorities. The total sum now asked for is £937,000. We may fairly deduct from that the £10,000 spent in connection with the Royal reception, because that is an item which will not probably recur for many years. Wemay also deduct the amount of £25,000 set down for rifles. That expenditure will not be necessary every j'ear, and it might very well be extended over two or three years. Roughly, therefore, the Estimates amount to£900,000. In 1897 the total amount contributed for defence purposes by all the States was £520,000. Sir JOH N FORREST -Does that include the. contribution, towards the Australian auxiliary squadron. Sir. JOH N FORREST I do not think so. following year the expenditure upon defence by the States was £598,000. So that during the last six years the expenditure upon defence has been increased to. the extent of £400,000 per annum. Still, I do Since 1688 the British Parnot think it will be argued that we are now in a. very much more efficient state of defence than we weresix years ago. I desire to see the Commonwealth defences organized upon the principle of defence and not upon that of aggression. If we are to join in every war and quarrel of the mother country, or, to indulge in such as has been sometimes used in this Chamber, I admit that three or four times the amount now asked for would not be too much. Our intention, however, is to act upon peaceful lines, holding ourselves in readiness for defence when we are attacked, and not before. A cry has been raised in favour of our taking a sharei n the naval expenditure of the Empire. The sum we now contribute is not a large one, but it must be remembered that we have no voice in the affairs of the nation, or in the making. of peace or war. There should certainly be no tax imposed on the people for the purposes of general naval defence until we have some representation in the councils of the Empire. Theni t will be time enough foi; us to considerwhatourincreased contribution shall be. A t present, we have to deal with matters as they are, and, in view of all other circumstances, our contribution, although not large, cannot reasonably be cavilled at. I decline to look forward into the future and say what it. may bring forth in this respect; but, for the present, I refer honourable members to that sound constitutional and economic authority, John Stuart Mill, who pointed out that as we had no voice in the making of either peace or war, no contribution should be asked from us toward the maintenance of the Imperial navy. If we asked England to join in a war with us we should place ourselves in a very different position.

I did not appoint him. lieve by .the Minister for Defence that the scale of military expenditure now is the same as it ' was ' when defence affairs were taken over from the States. But I want to draw attention to a very extraordinary increase as compared with 'the South Australian Estimates. In the yearending 30th June, 1900, the total expenditure on military affairs in that State was £22,392. In the year ending 30th June, 1901-that is the last available Estimates-the amount put down was £38,629. Sir the naval Estimates 1 the Commonwealth Government the amount set down in the military Estimates for South expenditure on the auxiliary -squadron and for King George's Soundi n the one which does not appear in the other. the auxiliary squadron is £10,000. I am going to mention ho w the difference is made up. The-amount actually intended to be spent by South Australia in the year 1900-1 was £38,629. But the ""approximate annual expenditure as at date of transfer "" was £50,243. Then the Government sa.y I do not say they that they are going to spend this year .£47,596, and they claim that there is a ture of nearly £3,000. But, as a matter of fact, there is nothing of the kind. TheI do not say that expenditure on military affairs that would have heen carried out in South Australia, had the Federal Government not taken over defence, was equal to £38,629. able member say that the Government would not have provided an additional sum on The artillery staff the supplementary Estimates for expenditure over that amount ? £38,629. tlie expenditure ? thing of thekind. member makes it appear that we have increased the expenditure, and t h a t is not correct. how the military officers who control this expenditure have rushed the amount up beyond what was""intended by the State Legislature and the' State Government. The fact of the matter is this-It was decided by the State Government to cut down the military vote to the lowest possible figure at which we thought we could get through. For that purpose, though the amount of £50,000 or £60,000 was asked for by the military authorities, the Cabinet cut it down to JOHN FORREST -Does that include £38,000, and the Estimates were put through in that form.

244,Mr Batchelor,"It is my desire tomonths the expenditure was increased beyond the intentions of the South Australian legislature. have checked the increase in the South Australian Parliament. Mr .BATCHELOR I take my share of the responsibility as a member of that Parliament. Up to the time the department was taken over by the Commonwealth the South Australian Government were being pressed by honourable members, by the public, and by the newspapers, to spend a lot of money on military expansion. The votes were, however, cut clown to the lowest reasonable figure. Australian Government increase their forces before the department was transferred to the Commonwealth, and not provide equipment for them? Government have had to provide equipment for increased forces. that was a fact. Sir for was £11,000, and I reduced it to £3,000. this expenditure reduced to the figure which is that at one time tlie pendulum of expenwas considered reasonable before the sudden diture swung to one extreme, and that after agitation for military expansion. In 1899, tlie South African war started it swung to the pay of the whole South Australian the other. forces, active and reserve, apart from the permanent men, amounted to £5,550. In the following year the amount had increased pendulum, which before the war swung to £9,000, and this year it is £12,000. probably too far back, is now at the other The vote for clothing and equipment has extreme, and this is not the time to reincreased from £1,400 in 1S99 to £8,S00 organize our forces and fix up our military tins year. £5,800. in the Estimates there is a further £3,000 Australian naval and military forces, includfor equipment. for the equipment of the men for whom the taking the expenditure at £22,392 in 1900, South Australian Government did not the swing of the pendulum is now in the provide. on railway transport increased from £750. so far as South Australia is concerned, and in 1899 to £1,500 in 1900, and to multiply that amount by 10, because the £2,500 this year. for by the fact that there was no encampment in the first year mentioned, and, therefore, there were no railway travelling expenses. 34 o the reason. Horse allowance for mounted men cost £70 0 in 1S99, while £1,000 was provided in 1900, and a similar amount is proposed this year. Any increase has not been in connection with the mounted men, and I am rather surprised that that should be so. Where the increase has really occurred it is difficult to say. The expenditure on the naval force in South Australia has increased in three years from £6,532 to £9,710, in addition to £10,000 which South Australia has now to contribute to the auxiliary squadron as one of the obligations under federation. In South Australia the military vote increased from £22,392 in 1899 to £38,629 in 1900, while the estimated expenditure this year is £5S,264. I do not intend to allot the blame for this tremendous increase. It is hardly fair to The Commonwealth calculate the contribution of £10,000 to the auxiliary squadron; but, even with that amount deducted, the military expenditure of South Australia stands at £48,264. In view of the way in which this expenditure G noRGE TURNER -The vote asked, has increased, is it not natural that people should be led to the conclusion that there is a real clanger of militarism in Australia ? I desire to have SirG EORGE TURNER -The great trouble Estimates unless we do so very carefully. The expenditure of £22,392 at the end of 1900 was not the minimum by any means, ing a battle-ship, for some £16,000 per annum. That really was the minimum, but other direction.

264,Mr Mccay (Corinella),"I do nobthose are the radical changes-ha s shown the necessity for greater discipline and training than was ever necessary before in any army. The Boer troops themselves, who are continually being held up to us as examples of what untrained troops can do, were themselves as highly trained for the particular class of work they had to do as are any troops in the world. Many years have elapsed since British troops have had to face troops so highly trained to fight under the particular circumstances which confront them in action there. the stiffness of tlie barracks. MrM c CAY that I did not refer to the braining in the stiffness of the barrack-yard, or to the beautiful whiteness of pipe clay, which by the-way, many troops, in addition to those in Soubh Africa, use. Nor did I refer to the precision shown by 1,000 men in presenting arms at the one moment. I do not think that those things are of bhe leasb use in war ab the presenb time. The greab fault in bhe models we have followed in Australia is thab far boo much abbention has been besbowed upon work of that kind in comparison with training in field work. has not been the fault of the regimental officers. The legimental commander knows thab when the staff-officer comes to inspect his troops he will expect to see them presenb arms, draw back bhe head, and turn eyes to .the right wibh precision, and so forth, and that the state of efficiency of the troops will be judged in that way ; and he knows that he mnsb abbend to it . cipline. of that kind tend necessarily, not to a higher state of discipline, but to a higher state of mechanical accuracy, which is a very different thing. If our troops were permanent troops, devoting the whole of their attention to milibary braining, there would be time to train them in pretty parade-ground movements, as well as in obher work; but with the limited time at their disposal, I have always bhoughb-eve n as a junior officer, whenmodoubt I had no right to have any thoughts on tbe 'subject-that far too much time was wasted on that class of work. I am glad to say, however, that from what little we have seen since the arrival of the new commandant, he too 34 o z recognises that parade-ground movements, although very nice in their way, are not as important as is the wider discipline of fieldtraining. Discipline and ti-aining are not only not less essential, but more essential bhan they used to be, simply because men have to he left more to'their own initiative and independent action in the field bhan ever bhey were before. The instincts and habibs which discipline and braining induce in bhern, and bhe practices which bheir braining teaches them thab bhey are to follow when bheir own initiative is to be acted upon, are essentials. I say without hesitation that it is purely farcical to say"" Teach the men to shoot, and nature will do I was just going to say the rest in regard to their training as effective field forces."" nearly all the men who went bo the Soubh African war from South Ausbralia were brained in about six weeks' time ? honourable member will promise me that before the Australian forces have bo bake bhe field in earnest the enemy will leave them six weeks in which to be brained, I shall not ask for another day's drill for bhem, because in bhose six weeks That they would get more training than any citizen soldiers in Australia can geb in six years. Ib seems bo me bhab, whabever the committee differs -on, it is practically agreedbhat there should be some land forces in Australia, and that such forces should be fit to take the field if the occasion should arise, it is a radical and fatal error to suppose that we can do without proper discipline and proper training for our men. That proper discipline and proper training consist. in giving the men a reasonable opportunity of learning the principles to guide them in bhe -field in the presence of an enemy. If we could insure even a month's training for our men before they went into the field' we 8 should have no necessity to train them in the interval, but we must be ready ab any moment The average experience bhab a man gfebs with the forces in Ausbralia is aboub equal to sixteen days' training -in a year.

Sixteen days' training is not a bit too much to allow to train a man, and then to enable him to keep up to that state of efficiency which he must continue to possess, if the preliminary training is to be oE any use. That is the reason why we must have something more than rifle shooting, important as it is. I admit that nothing is of any service unless we get a man able to shoot after his discipline and training have enabled him to get into a position in which he can use his rifle. I must protest most emphatically against what appears to me to be an entire misconception in thinking that the Boer war has shown that troops can go into the field without any training, or that troops without training can hold their own against troops which have been trained. against superior numbers. MrM c CAY able member did not hear what I said at the beginning of my remarks. I said that in my opinion the Boers were highly trained soldiers for the service they had to perform. Surely the honourable member knows that there was a system of compulsory service in the two Republics under commandoes. honourable and learned member understands it. does not know what I understand by discipline, because he has not heard all that I said on the subject. learned member's speech on the Defence Bill. not discuss the question of what discipline consisted of. I did not mention what it consisted of except to say, as I said this afternoon, that there has always been in Australia far too much parade ground work. The discipline and training, which will take time,°are more essential now than ever they were; not barrack-room work, not pipeclay work, not the precision of 1,000 men training in moving over ground of all kinds, iii all the formations necessary for work in the field. During the last year or two we have recognised that fact, and have altered our work as far as possible in those directions. But that the men should be trained is absolutely essential. more expensive ? of what kind of work they should do, of pointing out what work is necessary to enable them to be effective soldiers. I wish to say a word or two about a suggestion which I think an honourable member made as to the excess of officers in the Commonwealth forces. The more officers we have in proportion to our forces the better, provided that they are properly trained, because an officer cannot be trained to do properly the work of an officer in the time in which a man can be' trained to do properly the work of a private, or even of a non-commissioned officer. The essential idea of any scheme of peace establishment which allows for a sudden expansion of its numbers in war time must be a complement of officers, and also sufficient non-commissioned officers, proportioned to the total strength of the forces in war time, and v I regret that the honornot to their strength in peace time. Consequently, when it is said"" Here is a captain commanding 50 or 100 men, whereas in war time he might be commanding 250 men ""-probabl y he would not be commanding so many-it must be remembered that when we increase the strength of our rank and file in war time we shall not increase the the number of the officers. We cannot train officers, if they are to be properly trained and know their work, with the same rapidity that we can train private soldiers. It is essential that our peace establishment should be over officered in order that our war establishment, if it should ever be required, should be sufficiently officered. The question which the committee has to face, in regard to large economies, is whether the troops are to be partially paid or volunteers. I have taken a deep interest in this question for a great many years, and my judgment is that, admitting all the good qualities of volunteer troops, all the experience and skill they may acquire, all the perfection of training or discipline to which they, may attain, nevertheless in the long run the partially-paid forces do presenting. arms as one man, but better work and produce better results. I have watched partially-paid troops and volunteer troops, and speaking with more or less knowledge, I believe that partially1 paid troops have produced better results on the whole than have volunteers. proved.

If we desire a man to be trained, and to be immediately capable of serving his country in the first line of defence, if it should be called for, he is just as much entitled to be paid for his training as to be paid for his services. We might as well ask men to serve their country without pay, and trust to their patriotism to do it. I have no doubt that we could get men to do it I refer the honourable member for Bland to his own words the other day, when he applauded the idea that all the members of the Coronation contingent should be paid for their work. A man who is trained for -service in the field is just as much entitled to be paid for his work two cases, because in one case we send men away from their homes for months, and their families have to be provided for. MrM c CAY principle between men getting paid for going away from their homes for a half day and men getting paid for going away from their homes for half a year. I am not reflecting in any way on the individuals who compose tlie volunteer forces. It is the difference in circumstances which produces the difference in results. In ray opinion, the partially paid forces produce better results, and it i.s meanness on the part of any community to trade on the patriotism of any of its citizens and ask them to do work for nothing-becaus e it is not play. The idea must be grasped that all this is serious work, and not merely a pastime or an occupation, whether it be drilling or rifle shooting, and we have no right to ask the men to work for nothing. I shall take a case which I know : Out of a corps of 300 men there are not one hundred who live within two miles of the drill ground. Some of them live 20 and 25 miles away, and the others at varying distances within that limit. Very often these men have to walk for miles to the parade, and walk back for miles, because in the country there are not trams and trains all over the place as there are in the suburbs and the city. These men give up practically a large portion of their time. On many occasions they have to leave their work to attend to their drills. On many'occasions the}' give up their half-holiday to drill, which is not a holiday occupation. If they gave up their holidays to any other avocation, some honourable members on the other side would be the first to cry out and ask for payment, not only for the time occupied, but for time and a quarter, or time and a half, or double time. If men work on holidays at training themselves to serve their country, surely they are as much entitled to be paid as are men who work at any other trade on holidays to serve their country 1 ISo one who advocates the cause of labour is entitled to support the principle of getting cheap service out of the enthusiasm of others. It is all very well, perhaps, for a man to allow his own enthusiasm to carry him so far, but to trade on the enthusiasm of other men seems to me a contravention of any right principle. I believe in voluntary service to the extent of giving a man the choice whether he will serve or not. I do not believe in conscription or in universal service. AVhen a man does choose to serve, however, and it is found that he is physically fit for the work, and I see no difference in he is trained and is told that he must bold himself prepared to fight, we are bound to pay him for the time spent by him in training, just as much as if he did any other kind of work. AlthoughI may be regarded as an enthusiast on this subject, and as therefore somewhat inclined to excessive expenditure, I think that substantial savings can be effected in these Estimates. A t the same time, the suggestion that the Government should be asked to pledge themselves to submit £200,000 less in their next Estimates is an unfair one. they can save £100,000. MrM c CAY I know that. I have gone through the Estimates, and I believe that £120,000 could be saved without affecting the efficiency of the forces, or to any material extent the number required under the Commandant's scheme. the amount provided for in the Estimates. MrM c CAY If that were done we might as well do without defence forces. Canada 1",39,George Turner Were Not The For Forts Was £250 And In 1900 And The

290,Mr Mecay,"That may be; bub i tto equip the members of our defence force with good modern rifles-. Whether we have a purely volunteer or a partially-paid force that will be anything like suflicient in numbers for the work of defence, it is of no use to think of properly equpping them with money appropriated from revenue unless we are prepared to wait for some years. Our forces have been allowed to d r if t into such a state of inefficiency, so far as outfit is concerned, that it is impossible to put them right with any money that will be available from the revenue. They will have to be equipped with a new rifle. The present small bares, good as they are, and representing as theydo a vast improvement upon the oldMartini-Henri, are not equal to the magazine rifles in many respects, quite apart from the want of the magazine. I am perfectly certain that in the course of two or three years we shall have to fit out the whole of the forces of Australia with the best possible rifle. Under present conditions we have not a proper field equipment for our troops in Victoria. We have not any field guns fit to take out on a Sunday afternoon,' to say nothing of going into action. ing money upon men who are not properly equipped? shall never be able to equip our forces efficiently from revenue, and consequently we shall have to spend loan money for the purpose. that £500,000 will be sufficient, and we shall have that much surplus revenue this year. says is that £500,000 will meet' immediate requirements. I have ventured to make an estimate in connection with this matter, and I conclude that we should require £1,000,000, which I am prepared to borrow or the purpose of equipping our troops. MrM o CAY spare such a large amount of money from our revenue; I do not wish to be extravagant. every page, of these Estimates, but I do not wish money to be saved at the cost of the efficiency of the troops or at the expense of the men themselves. know of some of the items upon which the honourable and learned member could effect a saving.. there is not a staff within the Commonwealth that is not too big. W it h regard to the staff of the General Officer Commanding, we must do what he wants. He has certain work to do, and he requires certain instruments to enable him to perform it ; but if I had been the general officer commanding I think I could have done with a staff half the size of the present one, and many general officers could also have done so. The difficulty is, however, that all these officers have gone into the State services in good faith to spend their lives there ; we can, however, avoid making fresh appointments in the years tc come. There is not a State staff that is not twice as large as it ought to be. In A ictoria, in 1884-5-6, r when the militia, movement was inaugurated, the forces were then nearly as strong numerically as now, and yet the staff was not half its present size. The staffs have grown from time to time until they are much larger than they need be. To my mind the State staffs, at any rate, should contain just as much of the citizen as of tlie permanently-paid element. It must not be forgotten that in the last resort we have to rely upon the citizen soldiery, and the citizen officer, whether he be well or ill trained, is the man upon whom we have to fall back in actual, time of emergency. make a big saving upon these items except by dismissals. ence to the question of naval defence. It is idle to think that we can establish anything like an adequate Australian navy. Whatever we pay to the Imperial Government as our contribution towards naval expenditure will be ten times better expended than if it were spent in Australia. We do not wish to occupy a similar position to that of some I am.not. of the South, American republics, or even of It is impossible for us to some of the Australian States prior to the accomplishment of federation. We have no desire to o.wn a fleet consisting of one obsolete I think, there is waste shown in vessel, the destruction of which would be synonymous with the ruination of tlie fleet. Eveni f we expended money in the purchase of war-ships, extending over long periods, we should acquire only vessels which would soon become obsolete, and which at their best would not be as efficient as they ought",41,Edward Braddon Is The Cost Of Able Genbleman Worked On Injury To The

299,Mr Mccay,"On e word more in referto be. If the Government proposed to build one first-doss battle-ship, what would this House say ? The expenditure that would be involved in such an undertaking would pay for Imperial protection for many years, and secure it in a much more efficient and complete form. Moreover, it would require a big fleet to protect the Australian coast. The amount which we are now paying to the Imperial authorities represents all that we can afford, and all that the Home Government expect us to contribute. The latter know that, as far as our means will allow us, we are perfectly willing to assist them in every possible way. I wish to say one word in regard to the paragraph in the Commandant's report which states that the second essential for the defence of Australian interests, wherever they may be threatened, isThe possession of a field force capable of undervery small one. taking 'military operations in whatever part of the world it may be desired by Australia to employ them. The field force above indicated in [a) could, if necessity arose, be made available for this purpose. If that view be adopted, I say that the Minister controlling the. Defence department, instead of being called the Minister for Defence, should be designated the Minister for War. The great merit connected with the despatch of Australian troops to South Africa lies in the fact that every one of them went of his own accord. I do not think that men in Australia should be sworn for service in any other part of the world. Otherwise, they would constitute an Australian army, as distinct from an Australian defence force. Every man who wears the King's uniform will be willing to offer his services elsewhere should occasion require, but we ought to allow him to be a free agent in regard to this matter. Essentially Australia is forming a defence force, and not an army. If an army is required for work abroad, Australians will be perfectly ready to offer their services. But, whilst we have a Minister for Defence and a Defence Act, let us state definitely that the service for which the men are enrolled is that of Australian defence. not detain the committee very long, because, unlike the honourable and learned member for Corinella, I am not a military expert. He is a colonel, and I am simply a humble man of peace and law. I have always found, as a lawyer, that it is just as well to doubt what one hears from experts. Nearly every expert is likely to be in the wrong. When the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Batchelor, was speaking, the honourable and learned member for Corinella interjected something to the effect that the contribution of South Australia was not proportionate to its population. quoted by the honourable member for South Australia, Mr Batchelor, seemed to show that South Australia maintained its military force at less expense than did any of the other States, and that if such were the case it was not fair for him to take the position in that State as the basis of. his calculation. learned member said something to the effect that the South Australian proportion was a the sort. I made a comparison between the cost of the South Australian force and that of the other forces. able and learned member did make some qualification. He is so precise that I have almost to become apologetic when I make any reference to him. I find from the report of Major-General Hutton that South Australia has a total of 3,000-odd troops as against Victoria's 6,452. Therefore, if one considers the relative population, South Australia's contribution does not compare unfavorably with that of Victoria. cost. learned member seems to have "" cost"" upon the brain., He does not like volunteers, but prefers the partially-paid troops. Now we all admit that the Boers have made a pretty good stand against perhaps the best army in the world. We also acknowledge that the American troops of 1774 weie "" raw levies,"" who for several years were unpaid a "" ragged lot,"" -as they were called in the days of Washington. The American troops of 1861 were also "" raw levies."" The cheer of the honourable member for Tasmania, Mr O'Malley, brings to my mind an essay, which I am sure, from his utterances, he must have studied a tribute by that rhapsodical writer, Walt Whitman. In one of his Leaves of Grass, he refers to the fact that one of the finest stands in history was made by the ""raw levies"" in America.",42,Edward Braddon Is The Cost Of Able Genbleman Worked On Injury To The

306,Mr Glynn,"The honourable and I f we trace the history of Switzerland from the beginning of its federal union to the present time, -we shall find that it has more or less depended, not upon skilled troops, but upon volunteers. As regards Canada, to which the honourable and learned member has referred, it is certainly something in favour of economy that that country, with a contribution of 1G shilling per head of its population, has an army -which actually numbers little less than does the Australian, althou'gh our contribution is 3-6 shillings per head, or more than twice as much, according to the figures -of 1899. These are broad facts which a nonexpert cannot possibly explain, but at all events they tell in favour of the possibility of effecting very large economies, because Canada, with a population of over 5,000,000, is in a better position to indulge in extravagance than is Australia. Yet we have the fact before us that its contribution to defence represents a considerably smaller outlay foralessnumberof soldiers than is involved in the case in Australia. Upon the whole I cannot compliment the Government upon their so-called defence policy. They really have no such policy, because at the beginning of the session, nearly twelve months ago, they appointed a committee of experts, in the persons of the commandants of the various States, to recommend some scheme upon which they might base a Defence Bill. A scheme was recommended, and the Government submitted a Bill, which the commandants, at a second conference, repudiated. imported a commandant at a pretty stiff salary, and one which is largely in excess of that paid to the occupant of a similar post in Canada. This officer, Major-General Hutton, has submitted a report which seems to differ from the recommendations which the State commandants made last year upon some matters which were considered by them to be vital. For instance, they discountenanced the affiliation of rifle clubs with the regular soldiery, whilst Major-General Hutton, in his report, thinks that their affiliation is essential, and adds that where ever the system has existed it has proved a marked success. It is somewhat significant to find that the report of Major General Hutton shows, in one respect, at any rate, a repudiation of the recommendations made by our military experts nine months ago. This fact should impress upon us the necessity of caution in military matters. been referred to. That gentleman, who was a military expert, lectured in June, 1901, before the Royal United Service Institute, upon the lessons learned from the Transvaal war in regard to military tactics and army organizations. Taking a quotation from the Times, here is what that great authority saidThe Transvaal war proved that military science as practised to-day was absurd, and that the sacrifices made upon the Continent to support conscription, and into which it was pror.iosed to drag England, were unnecessary. To some extent the system of conscription was embodied in the defence proposals of the Government, but evidently they became so ashamed of the Bill, which was repudiated by the State commandants, that they withdrew it, probably for ever, from legislative light. In one of their reports the State commandants declared that they took no responsibility for that Bill in the form in which ib was submitted by the Ministry. The honourable and learned member must not misrepresent facts. I say that the commandants were absolutely in accord with the Government upon that point, and that the principle of conscription was not provided for in the Bill. State commandants differed from the Go' vernment upon the point. I was merely pointing out the necessity which exists for Tlie Government have now the exercise of caution. I refer to the question of conscription merely to show that the principle has been repudiated by no less an authority than M . de Bloch. He addsGorgeous uniforms, with showy lace, were maintained, and at maineuvres one was stupefied by the prodigies aud aberrations performed by the military tailor with cloth, leather, and steel. His reference there was principally to Germany, upon which so many experts rely for information in regard to military matters. According to the recommendations of General Hutton, I find that we must at once increase the military force from 29,000-odd to 44,000-odd. In schedule 3 on page 4 of his report, Major-General Hutton recommends an increase to 44,218 men, which show's .an increase of about 14,000 in the field force. That is an increase of 50 per cent.; and it certainly does indicate the necessity of this committee, being anxious about the military expenditure, and giving a general direction to the GoThe name of M . de Bloch has vernment by striking about £200,000 off",43,Edward Braddon Is The Cost Of Able Genbleman Worked On Injury To The

308,Mr Glynn,"I did not say that thethe total vote. The Major-General himself in his report points out that we really have, through our geographical position, almost an immunity from attack in Australia. He states thatOversea aggression can only be attempted (1) by a raid of two or more crusiers with a small striking force for the purpose of landing; (2) by have very large Imperial notions. Mr a large and well-equipped force conveyed in numerous transports and escorted by an enemy's fleet. He then passes on to point out thatTbe latter attempt may, under. existing conditions, be considered cufficult in tbe extreme, more especially in view of the military' spirit whicli animates the inhabitants of Australia. I do not want to pursue the quotation, but he amplifies that point afterwards, and says in the conclusion of the paragraph thatThe small landing force available even from a strong fleet of cruisers would find such a task partment. impossi ble. In other words, Major-General Hutton himself points out that we have practically nothing to fear from an invading force. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -Wher e is any other enemy to come from ? a raid by two or more cruisers. But Major' General Hutton goes on to point out why should be strengthened. points out our immunity from attack and thinks that our security is sufficiently great already, he thinks we should give to the world a greater proof of that immunity. If honourable members read down page 2 of his report they will find that he mentions thatComplete security for life and capital must therefore be insured not only for the population existing, in Australia against foreign aggression and domestic violence, But that security must be further assured in the eyes of the commereial world beyond its shores. He says that we have nothing to fear locally, but that really what he wants is that we shall create such a capacity for resisting aggression that though we ace not threatened, or likely to be threatened, the commercial world outside ourselves may be given overt proof and ostensible evidence of our security. Surely we are not going, on considerations of this, sort, to add to our military expenditure, and keep it up at a rate which amounts practically to £1,000,000 a year? I do not want to go minutely intothe Major-General's report, but I do say that his own words plead strongly in favour of economy. Reference has been made to the question of naval defence, and I find that Major-General Hutton's report also deals with the fact that the immunity of our commerce from attack depends upon the strength of the Imperial navy. We have a delegation going to England very shortly. Some of the delegates Seddon, the Premier of New Zealand, who was once an out and out democrat, may be supposed by reason of that fact to have had a bias towards peace and against excessive Imperialism. But he has now gone home as the chiefI do not like to use the term jingo, but I will say the' chief supporter of extravagance in connection with the Imperialistic idea. travagant Minister for the most greedy dealways excepted from a comparison.. When we come to analyse the character of the men who are going home there seems to me to be good reason, for reading them a little lesson, in order that the Prime Minister may not bind Australia-h e cannot bind us legally, but he might bind us morally-as regards military and naval expenditure. What is it is that the defence force the position in reference to our naval Although he defence? Many times the suggestion has been made in the House of Commons, in Canada, and. by lecturers who have come out here, that Australia should contribute more largely towards the cost of the Imperial navy. I remember that Mr Parkin when he was lecturing in this country, urged, that we should largely'increase our contribution to the navy. In 1891, when the Canadian lecturer arrived on our shores he stirred up an agitationin favour of Imperial federation and its concomitant of joining inlmperial defence. A t that time the naval expenditure of England was £14,000,000. General Hutton bases his statements in regard to the comparative amount paid by the colonies and various dependencies of Great Britain towards the army and navy upon the naval statistics of,. I think, 1898. He gives the amount at £26,594,500. As a matter of fact, in 1900, the naval estimates of Great Britain were £29,000,000, and last year they reached the total of £32,000,000] and we find statisticians like Sir Robert Giffin stating that the completeseeurity that has been demanded by tlie Times-and I am quoting from a leading article in the Timesis not possible without an annual outlay of",44,Edward Braddon Is The Cost Of Able Genbleman Worked On Injury To The

311,Mr Glynn,"Present company is£40,000,000 upon the navy. Let honourable members look at our position, supposing we ,were asked to make an equitable contribution towards naval defence. hot saying that the demand is not equitable from an English point of view -that we should be asked to increase our proportion of payment towards the cost of the ' navy. I know that the Imperial Government can make out a strong case for a greater levy, not only upon the Australian Commonwealth, but also upon Canada and India; because a few years ago the amount paid by Australia, Canoda,.and India towards the Imperial navy was less than £600,000 a year, or one-sixtieth of the then total naval Estimates. But I say that we cannot afford largely to increase our contribution. AVe pay now, taking the estimates submitted to us, in contributions towards the auxiliary squadron, and towards the local defence a total of about £178,06-5 a year. If our contribution were based upon wealth and population combined -whic h would be a. very fair way of estimating the proportionate amount that ought to be paid-instea d of our paying £178,000 a year our contribution would have to be about £3,000,000 a year.. That is, England has a case to ask us to consent to an equitable apportionment of an annual expenditure which would land Australia in a contribution of over £3,000,000 a year. of that. Those who go to England at this juncture should be particularly caref u l when we are asked',, as members of the Imperial Parliament are asking us, and as the Times on more than one occasion in the last twelve months has asked us to do, to make a more equitable contribution towards the cost of the Navy.. I am. not speaking against the morality of the Imperial position, but I am. impressing upon, honourable members the reality of the Australian position; and we ought: to give a. caution to some of thebellicose gentlemen who are going home to be careful that no arrangement is entered into which will' bind the Commonwealth. has undertaken not to. bind the. Commonwealth. Mr GiLYNN.,-"" I am. not suggesting that anything, will be done which w ill bind the Commonwealth legally,, but very often things are done which cast a moral obligation upon the country. In-the case of the Immigration Restriction A ct something of the kind was done. The principle laid down at the London conference in regard to that matter was put I am before us as a binding obligation-binding , * at any rate* upon our consciences. I particularly rose with the object of pointing out the necessity of caution as regards military and naval expenditure, which has already run up to close upon £1,000,000 per annum. We cannot give the Government the details of a retrenchment scheme, but. we can do what has been done in South Australia. There, when a Ministry refused to moke retrenchments and asked for details, the matter was taken in hand by three members of the House, and. they cut down the Estimates by about £130,000, and the Ministry had to fall into, line with what was recommended. I say that if this committee strikes off a total of £200,000 from the military Estimates,, the Government will be able to find a way out of the difficulty that will bring about a reasonable economy in our military expenditure. It behoves us in this Federal Parliament to moke some strong plea for economy in this direction. I have no doubt that the views of honourable members who have spoken, are quite in accord with my own, in. that they desire this great spending department of the'Government to be carried on as economically as possible. Honourable members recognize We cannot stand even a fourth that these Estimates are merely the Estimates of the various States at the time of transfer, so far as the establishments are concerned. Some items are,, of course, far in excess of the Estimates of the States, but speaking generally, the proposed votes are those which were in existence on the 1st March,. 1901, when the Commonwealth took over the Defence department. I hope I made-it clear that these Estimates are no criterion of what, may be done in the way of organization and economy. I am f u l l of expectation that next year we shall be able to ^>ut theforces of the Commonwealth on a better and more efficient footing, at a reduced cost. The Estimates amount to £9.37,000, but of that amount, £106,000; is scarcely chargeable-to ordinary expenditure. It represents the statutory contribution of all the States to the auxiliary squadron.

We may take it, therefore, that the Estimates for the Defence department amount to £831,000. Mr G. B. EDWARDS --But the expenditure on naval defence was always included in the States' Estimates. beenincluded in the Estimates of New .South Wales, but I know that the States' contributions to the auxiliary squadron were under special appropriations. Wales. the contributions were under an agreement fortified by statute, and, therefore, the expenditure was one which each Government had to meet, and which each State Parliament had no power to refuse. Having made that deduction, I am prepared, on behalf of the Government, to undertake that the next Defence Estimates introduced in this House shall not exceed £700,000, or £131,000 less than the proposed votes now before us. That undertaking will, I trust, be regarded as reasonable. £131,000 is not enough. follow, of course, that that is the limit to bu} ammunition locally than to import it . which the Government may go in reducing the expenditure, because we shall do our factory. best to be even more economical.

So far as I can see, this outlay will go on increasing year by year, because, instead of having, as now, about 30,000 members of rifle clubs in the Commonwealth, we may have as many in New South Wales as there are in Victoria. £32,000 is spent for rifle club ammunition in Victoria alone, so that a new engine of expenditure has been created in connection with defence. wealth ammunition factory at an early date. would not be supplied more cheaply by a Commonwealth factory.

Then the Government propose to buy 5,000 rifles, which will cost £25,000. A t the present time we want 20,000 rifles, but we shall have to go slowly and obtain them in small quantities year by year.' I mention these facts because when I undertake that the Estimates next year shall be less than the present Estimates by £131,000, I do not wish to promise more than I may be able to perform. No doubt we shall not spend so much this year as we should had the Estimates been brought in earlier. There are votes for works which have not been carried out, because the Government had no authority from the House, and the Treasurer would not advance the necessary money. We are now at the end of the tenth month of the year, and honourable members will see that these votes lapse, because we should not be able to get the works completed by the 30th June. fence not a large amount under the Estimates of the Minister for Home Affairs? department has no control over that expenditure. The Minister for Home Affairs is pretty much in the same position as myself, inasmuch as included in his Estimates are works which, owing to want of time, he will not be able to carry out, except in cases of great urgency, when the Treasurer may authorize the necessary expenditure. It always happens, if the Estimates are delayed, that a great many votes must lapse. This, however, will not prevent the works being carried out in another year. I do not think I need say more except to repeat the undertaking I have already given as to the reduction of the Estimates next year. If the Government find they can make even further reductions in the expen-, diture in the direction desired by honourable members they will be very glad to do so. We may not be able to do better than we promise, bub we shall make the attempt. I should like to .say, before I resume my seat, that although I rose with trepidation to make my statements in regard to these Estimates, I have none now, and I desire to thank honourable members for the way in which they have dealt with the matter. I do not suppose that I shall speak again on the subject, and I should like to say that honourable members appear to have recognised the difficulties under which we labour. Mr G. B. EDWARDS (South Sydney). -Afte r hearing the speech just delivered by the Minister for Defence, I cannot help thinking that this will be far and away the best day's work which the Parliament has ever done. If we succeed in obtaining whab the right honourable gentleman now in point of fact concedes, we shall have done good work for the Commonwealth. Indeed, I go further than that, and say that I fail to see why we should not carry out the intention expressed by the acting leader of the Opposition and make a reduction to the full extent of £200,000. matters too far until we see how we get on* Mr G. B. EDWARDS -Quite so. Conciliation and compromise are the very soul of politics, and as the right honourable gentleman has promised a certain reduction, and promised further that if possible a still greater reduction will be made, I . think the committee may very well be content. I intended to address myself rather fully to this question, but in view of these facbs, I feel bhat I ought to confine myself to the making of as few remarks as are necessary to enable me to express the belief that we are justified in what we are doing, and that nothing less than what is now proposed to be done would have satisfied the people of the Commonwealth. more off next vear.

In the speech made by the Treasurer, when submitting the Estimates of Expenditure to us last October, there is passage after passage which goes to prove that he himself believes that these defence items should be very vigorously cut down. honourable gentleman is probably the most popular Minister in the Commonwealth, because he has a great deal of the good-wili of this side of the House, as well as that of Government supporters, and I do not think tliat anything he has clone or said in this Parliament has met with so much approval and public good-will as did his expression of opinion last October, that the defence expenitems it amounts to £26,000 in excess of diture had grown abnormally, and was far higher than the Commonwealth could afford. I have marked several passages in the right honourable gentleman's speech, but as I wish to curtail my remarks as much as. possible, I shall confine myself to the statement that in four or five of these passages the right honourable gentleman endorsed the view's of the most rigid economist in the House in regard to the possibility, nay tlie necessity, defence purposes. of cutting down the defence vote. We are not justified in taking up the stand which some supporters of the Ministerial proposals have taken up, that we should be content to keep this expenditure within the limits of what it was when the Commonwealth took over tlie duty of defending the States, because during the last few years prior to tlie creation of the Commonwealth, the defence estimates of the various State Governments were unusually swollen. We have no right to think of keeping up the expenditure in the same ratio, still less to think of increasing it, as we should, if we followed tlie proposals tabled 'by the Miniswibh the question of whether we can'afford ib. ter. on defence in the States was £522,448; in 1901, it was £811,000 ; at the date of the transfer to the Commonwealth it had grown to £861,000, and, subsequently, the Government proposed practically to make it £869,000. £850,000, but that amount refers, only to ordinary expenditure, and does 'not take into account what is called "" other"" or Mr G. B. Edwards. new expenditure incurred by the Commonwealth. That proposal would have been bad enough, in view of the Treasurer's own statement that the items were far too great, and that, in one case, he was I am positively afraid to count up the total in reference to the transferred forces, because it would be so great that it would give him a further shock. But the new estimates, as now submitted, are still further increased. What the Government have done further in the matter of defence expenditure is somewhat hidden, owing to the way 'in which The right the votes have been presented to us. items are made up of the cost of rifles and ammunition, and of the amount we have to pay New South Wales, which really should have been paid out of loan funds. Mr G. B . EDWARDS -Still, we have to deal with the total expenditure of tlie Commonwealth, and while on the ordinary the normal expenditure at the highest point reached in Australia, we have to add nearly £50,000 for new expenditure on bhe part of the Commonwealth. Further, we have to add to the tobal a series of items amounting, I think, to £25/000, which have been placed in the Estimates for the Ministerf o r Home Affairs, and which relate to buildings and other works for left out of blie comparison with last year's expenditure, and we have bo pub them on both sides if we take them into consideration now.

363,Sir Edward Braddon,"That ismember knows what Government promises are. Sir terest to reduce the Estimates as much as we possibly can. we shall have the power to make still further reductions upon the next Estimates if we think it desirable to do so. Therefore, as the mover of the amendment, which was intended to indicate to the Ministry that they should effect a reduction of at least £200,000, I am ready to accept the promise of the Minister. We have gained so much right honourable gentleman sticks to his guns. at any rate gained so much, and I think that the country will approve of what we have done, and that in the confirmation of the attitude we have taken up public opinion will bring to bear upon Ministers a force which will compel them to make still further reductions. MrA . M c LEAN (Gippsland) -It was my intention to support the amendment of the right honourable member for Tasmania, Sir Edward Braddon; but, in view of the promise made by the Minister for Defence, I think the right honourable member has acted rightly in withdrawing it . drawn it. He may wish to withdraw it, but we object. MrA . M c LEAN Government have gone so far that the amendment may very well be withdrawn. They have named £131,000 as the minimum only, and have promised to go as much further as they possibly can. remember that after all we cannot drop from an inflated scale of expenditure down to the level desired by some honourable members in the one year. MrA . M c LEAN It could only be done by adopting very drastic measures. In the Defence department, perhaps to a greater degree than in other branches of the public service, we need' to continually watch the expenditure; otherwise it will increase until it becomes an intolerable burden on tlie taxpayers. den now. The right honourable MrA . M c LEAN No doubt it is, because the amount to be voted on these Estimates is equivalent to within a shade of 5s. wealth. I understand, however, that the Government hope to effect a saving of £100,000 even for tlie present year. The Estimates for the last two or three years have been increased by leaps and bounds. We know that the war fever was rife throughout the Commonwealth for a considerable time, and as the military authorities no doubt took advantage of this, and found Ministers a little more pliable than usual, the expenses were unduly inflated. It will be the duty of this Parliament to see -We shall gain more if the that the expenditure is kept within proper limits in the future. I do not expect to see the whole of the retrenchment possible effected in one year, but I hope that the Government will be able to reduce the expenditure to an even greater extent than they have indicated. AVe should not seek to bind them by a vote, as that would be ungracious and ungenerous in the face of their offer. 1 hope that any economies that may be effected will not be made in such a way as to reduce the facilities ! for imparting to our citizens the knowledge necessary to qualify them to take pait in the defence of the country. The rifle clubs represent the cheapest branch of our defence forces, because the total expenditure incurred, including the cost involved in the supply of has not withammunition at reduced prices, does not exceed £ 1 15s. per rifleman. A great many of the younger members of these clubs have I think that the been cadets in the public schools, and have received an excellent training that will cling to them throughout their lives. They are nearly all excellent horsemen,because in the country districts every young fellow learns to ride. We must AVith such men available it will cost very little to give them theadditional training and discipline necessary to make them first-class soldiers. The Boers when they entered upon tbe present war were simply good horsemen, and bushmen, and fair rifle shots, and I believe that we can achieve the best results by encouraging rifle clubs in every possible way, and by offering every reasonable facility to men to qualify themselves as good marksmen. We shall obtain better value for the same money in that direction than in any other.

I do not wish, however, to discuss the general question of defence, because that can be done with greater advantage when the Defence Bill is before us next session. I hope the Ministry will reduce staffs which need not be kept up to their former strength, now that a central control is provided for. A great saving can be effected in that direction. honourable friend knows the difficulty of getting rid of the men who are there. MrA . McLEAN -Yes; and I know, further, that the right honourable gentleman is the man to meet that difficulty. He can put his foot clown as well as any one. If he does that, and the Minister for Defence has no money, he cannot spend it . I was very glad indeed to pbserve the cordial manner in which the Minister for Defence met the views of the committee, and I think honourable members should meet him in an equally frank and candid manner, and accept his promise. Our principal line of defence must necessarily be on the water. Inhabiting as we do an island continent, our first object should be to keep the enemy from landing on our shores, and that can only be done by strengthening our naval and harbour defences. It'may be said that the enemy would land at some part of our coast remote from settlement, but in such a case our land forces would be able to give a good account of any invaders before they could reach the centres of population. I hope that the Government will pay attention to this aspect of the matter. As far as our permanent forces are concerned, they should represent the merest skeleton of our provision for defence. Of course it will be necessary to keep up skeleton regiments, to be filled up as occasion may require. They can be filled up only by drawing upon the rifle clubs and other branches of our citizen soldiers. the. honourable and learned member for Corinella says we must not do under any circumstances. That is what I did, and he declares that I ruined the service. MrA . M c LEAN that statement. I confidently point to the 34 P z result of the American war. There were no It must be better soldiers in the world than the volunteers who took part in that struggle. They were soldiers of whom any nation might well be proud, and I think that we have just as good material in Australia to-day. South Africa were volunteers. MrA . McLEAN -Yes ; and they gave a very good account of themselves. Indeed the manner in which they acquitted themselves reflects credit upon Australia. I feel perfectly sure that by utilizing the services of the various rifle clubs, we shall obtain the best possible result at the minimum of cost. Before sitting down I merely desire to add that it is the duty of the Government and of Parliament to see that the cost of our defence forces does not exceed the lowest amount that is compatible with efficiency, and I am sure that that efficiency can be obtained at a much less expenditure than os. per head of our total population. MrM c DONA LD (Kennedy) -Honor able members have been told by the Minister for Defence that the Estimates which are now submitted for their consideration, are those which have been taken over from the various States, and that he is in no way responsible for them. But I would point out over twelve months have elapsed since the Defence department was transferred. The Government therefore have had a year in which to ascertain whether these estimates were . inflated. An y one who has watched the growth of military expenditure in the various Australian States during the past few years musb have come to the conclusion that the military authorities exercise an hypnotic power over Ministers. Scarcely a Minister has controlled the defence forces in the various States who has been possessed of sufficient courage to fight this growth of military expenditure. The military gentlemen have merely intimated that they required a certain amount of money, and the various Ministers have replied, "" All right, we will grant it to yon.""

I know of one gentleman who opposed that reform, and who proved to be in receipt of £S00 a year from commissions. In Canada the Government conduct their own arms factory, and manufacture their own ammunition, and the expenditure in connection with these works comes out of less than £500,000 per annum. The Minister for Defence, however, wishes this young nation, whicli is to be built up on incur an ' expenditure of not less than £700,000 for our military requirements. If If they aggregated we include our contribution to the naval squadron the aggregate sum absorbed for defence purposes is approximately £800,000. That amount is out of all proportion to the requirements of the Commonwealth. In the light of these facts, how do the Government justify their oft-repeated desire to economise in order that they may return to the various States all the money which they possibly can? Here is an opportunity for them to save £200,000, and yet they are not prepared to accept it , simply because they fear the frowns of the military people.

Seeing that this year the Ministry have a right to spend nearly £1,000,000 for defence purposes, I say it would be only a fair thing if they promised to instruct the military authorities that not more than £500,000 should, in future, be expended upon our defences. Personally, I intend to vote for the reduction of these estimates by £200,000, and I am sorry that the right honourable member for Tasmania, Sir Edward Braddon, did not move to make a still larger reduction. I shall certainly oppose any attempt to withdraw the amendment. The right honourable gentleman must not try and get out of the difficulty upon this question by merely taking it as an instruction from the committee that, if the amendment is carried, it only means a saving of £131,000 per year. The amendment was originally moved with the view of giving an instruction that the vote was to be reduced by £200,000. If that is not to be the idea, we shall take the course of moving the reduction of the whole item, when the question is before us, by the amount of £200,000. But I regret very much that, in a matter like this,* a large number of honourable members are not prepared to vote as they think they ought to vote. They are prepared to support the Government now, because the Government have come down with a sort of white-wash compromise. That, in my opinion, is certainly not very creditable to a large number of honourable members. I am not sorry that this debate has taken a general turn at this particular stage, because the Minister for Defence is going to England shortly. The debate will be an indication to him as to the general feeling in this Parliament with regard to military expenditure. I am glad that the Minister is going Home. I understood him to say to-night that he rose with much trepidation. I did not know that trepidation was one of the qualities of the right honourable gentleman. I only hope that he will not show trepidation when he is in the Colonial-office, or under the powerful influences which will surround him in London. When the question is put to him, of whether he will help the Home authorities in organizing an Imperial force for the defence of the Empire I feel sure that he will know very well the view of this ' House-that the House, whether rightly or wrongly, is not prepared to go in for any extravagant scheme. More than that, I hope that he will recommend to the consideration of the Colonial authorities the frank and admirable report which has been made by Major-General Hutton. If that report be read-it is not hard to understand, even by a layman like myselfi t is perfectly clear that in the Major General's opinion it is ""difficult in the extreme ""-thos e are his words-to land a large and well-equipped force in Australia at any time. He also thinks that a small force, even for the purpose of making a raid, is out of the question. No one would attempt the task with any feeling of security. But if a big force is impossible, and a little force is out of the question, why are we to have a defence force at a l l ' MrL . E. GROOM -The Major-General says that such an attempt will be unsuccessful if we have our force. General Hutton says that oversea aggression might be attempted either by a raid of two or more cruisers, or by a large and well-equipped force conveyed in numerous transports, and escorted by an enemy's fleet. He says that.The latter attempt may, under existing conditions, be considered difficult in the extreme, more especially in view of the military spirit which animates the inhabitants of Australia. will oppose the invading force. a military spirit, but quite another thingto have a standing army. A t all events,. there is running right through this report a mistake, inasmuch as Major-General Hutton assumes that it is competent for this Commonwealth to organize a force which can beused in other parts of. the Empire. He Sa}'s, after dealing with the impossibility of: an invasion, that there are Two factors that may be considered as governing the future organization aud administration of the military forces of the Commonwealth, namely, (a) the defence of Australian soil.

The only power which we, as a Federal Parliament, have to organize a military force is contained in section 119 of the Constitution. Under that section we can only organize a force "" to protect every State against invasion."" The word ""defence"" is not used, because that word may be twisted so as to have all sorts of wide meanings. You may defend a country by attacking another country. .But this section saysThe Commonwealth shall 'protect every State against invasion, and, on the application of the Executive Government of the State, against domestic violence. If ever there was an occasion in which I have felt rather glad to know that we are encumbered by debt, it is this. I have always, as my honourable friends know, been against State borrowing. But the effect of -our borrowing has been that all our Customs receipts are practically hypothecated to meet the interest upon our big debts. Our taxation is heavy through the Customs, and we cannot afford,' even if we had the will, to enter into any big scheme of Imperial defence-unde r present conditions, at all events.

I never had £500,000 to spend as I liked. that I have an occasion to withdraw a slanderous statement which I made by way of interjection to-night, that this most greedy department of defence is in the hands of a most extravagant Minister. I can recognise from the right honourable gentleman's speech that he is as anxious as any of us to reduce the expenditure. I think he feelsand he is very quick to feel-the tone of the House, and knows that this is about the last House in the world to countenance extravagant military expenditure. It He gives his reasons for is awkward that the Estimates should come on at this stage. I do not blame Ministers. In a transition stage, it is natural that they should bring their Estimates before Parliament as soon as they find time. But a good deal of this discussion might more properly have taken place upon the Defence Bill. I feel that before we are asked to deal with the ordinary Estimates for military and naval expenditure we ought to come to some kind of decision as to what we want. We ought to have some principle which will guide Ministers as to what we wish to get. I recollect that, with a good deal of reason, it was urged in favour of federation that it would reduce the military expenditure, because in place of having a number of staff officers in the different centres, and a great deal of expense connected therewith, we should secure by centralization a greatly reduced expenditure. ment used was more on the ground of efficiency. was also the idea. It is natural to expect that where businesses are amalgamated, economy should result. Similarly where colonies or States have amalgamated for certain purposes, I do not see why we should not look for economies. There is no department that is less productive and so extravagant-it is like the horse leech-as the Defence department. If I had my way I should prefer to see the means for defence made a matter to be attended to by the Education department. Every youngster should be taught how to use his rifle, how to ride, and how to use his eyes and fingers. point. I have as many Imperial which has been adopted in Victoria, where our cadet force has not cost very much. There has been some splendid work done in I am exceedingly glad connection with that force, and I think honourable members who witnessed the march past, when the Prince of Wales was here, will recognise that the cadet force of this State has shown results which are fully commensurate with the expenditure upon it . W it h regard to what has been said as to what we want, I think there is a great tendency for us to lean upon British officers, who come here with all their British traditions and British ideas as to defence and drill.

I realize from the report of that highly competent officer, Major-General Hutton, fortified by the military experts in this Chamber, that after half a century of self-government in Australia, and after setting up six different sets of military authorities, we -are now not at all ready to meet an invasion. Our equipment is altogether a failure; we have no modern rifles and no cartridges, and we are told tliat our heavy guns are obsolete and not good enough even for a Sunday parade. How many millions have been spent in obtaining this measure of failure I do not know ; but it occurs to me that the time has come when we ought additional to consider whether it is worthwhile spending this nioney. A t any rate we have brought home to us the fact that the work I am glad to underwe have to do is one of complete reorganization-of managing the defences of the country on a system of efficiency, combined with economy. I am glad that at the head of this department we have a gentleman who, in his opening remarks, told us that the department required watching with all the vigilance possible, and that one branch already costs too much. Honourable members cannot but feel satisfied with the Minister's frankness and his If a man has been realization of the fact that there must be economy, and some efficiency in return for the money expended. About militarism there is a great deal too much pomp and show which is not at all suited to this age or to the Australian people. Magnificent uniforms may be necessaiy in If we some of the older countries in order to attract young men to the army, but they are not needed in a democratic country like Australia, where the people, if there was not a uniformed soldier here, would not allow an invader to gain our shores. There has always been too much "" glory "" and "" heroism "" associated with the soldier's calling. As a matter of fact, the soldier's occupation is about the safest that a man could follow. Amongst sailors and miners there are more killed and wounded than amongstsoldiers. In the whole history of Australia our soldiers have taken no risks, and no one can say that at present there is any prospect of an invasion of this countiy. Much greater risks are run in an industrial life than in a military life. The American railways k ill 300 persons per annum, and wound over 23,000, which is as big a record as could be found on any battlefield in twelve months. People talk about soldiers being very brave, but I have seen greater bravery displayed by a miner who, with known and imminent danger staring him in the face, has risked his life to recover the dead body of his fellow man. That is greater heroism than is displayed by a soldier who attempts to rescue a comrade on the battlefield, though for the latter",58,Georgh Turner The Estimates The Peaceful Industries Of The Country To

418,Mr Spence (Darling),"I have listenedservice a Victoria Cross is granted. There is no Victoria Cross for industrial heroes; for them there is no £ 1 a day, with living allowances, and no grand uniforms to display at society balls. If it is considered necessaiy to have men figuring in uniforms at society gatherings, the Defence department might, in each of the capitals, have an establishment where uniforms could be hired out. the practical work of soldiery, and there is no necessity why the countiy should supply them, or compel officers to spend £ 7 0 , or other big sums, on ornamental parade clothes to display at fashionable functions. We know, of course, that^ the object of these expensive uniforms is to restrict officers' positions to the wealthier classes; but it is time that, in this connection, Parliament used a little common sense. I do not contend that we have attained the age of civilization yet, although we consider that we are somewhat civilized. The nations of the earth cannot be regarded as civilized when they have failed to establish an}' other method of settling international disputes except that of shooting oneanother's subjects. But on the island continent of Australia, which is far away from the turmoil of Europe, we ought to mind our own business, and build up a countiy worth fighting fora countiy which will belong to the people, and not to British or foreign money-lenders. If we-do that, we need not have the pomp and show of militarism ; we can have training and discipline, and, above all, we can spend our defence vote of very nearly a million in providing a good equipment, and finding the men afterwards. I am not complaining of the remarks of the Minister for Defence, because I am pleased with the tone adopted by the right honourable gentleman. We may differ as to the amount to be expended, which in my opinion is too high, but I have regard to the spirit which the Minister displayed in laying before us the intentions of the Government. It does not seem to me that those who have spoken during this debate have paid consideration to the fact that a report has been presented to the Government, with whicli I presume they have not yet dealt, proposing the re-organization o£ the whole military system. In that report Major-General Hutton suggests that several departments will have to be set up. I believe that it is the business of the Government to own its own factories for the production of all that is required in connection with defence, and tliat it will be cheaper and more effective to do so than to bolster up private contractors, who may or may not give us an honest return for our money. These private enterprises have never done so in the old country. I am not prepared to trust the military requirements of Australia to these men after the experiences of the old Gold-lace uniforms are not used in land, which has done as much good fighting as has any countiy in the world, but whose soldiers have been supplied by contractors with swords that have doubled up and cut off the swordsman's head instead of that of the other fellow, as well as with revolvers that would not go off. in the matter of swords. effectiveness. I want to emphasize the view that before anything is done in this matter the Government should take the House into their confidence, and that we should have another chance, which, I understand, the Minister has premised, to discuss the proposals made by the Major-General. AVe should certainly have our own small arms and ammunition factories, and, i u fact, make all the material to be used by our troops in fighting. I do not anticipate that we shall ever have any fighting to do in order to hold Australia. Surely we have enough faith in the development of mankind to believe that the risk of war will be lessened year by year. That very fact in itself is a strong reason why we should not spend a great deal of time and energy and money in building up a huge department which may never be 'wanted, or in purchasing things which may become obsolete a year or two later. Of course rifles and ammunition are absolutely essential, and we shall never be safe until we have our own sources of supply. Then if the route between Australia and the old countiy were blocked by a foe, as it would be if Great Britain were at war, we should not have, to depend on her to line it with ironclads in order to clear the way and enable ammunition to be sent out to us. I hope that the Government will support the recommendation of the MajorGenerali n regard to setting up all these factories as soon as possible. One of the wisest and best means of securing that end would be to cut down expenditure. There are various ways in which it can be done.

The mone)' might be diverted with better effect into channels which are necessary for the development of rifle clubs. Victoria made a good move in enrolling 20,000 riflemen shortly before the creation of the Commonwealth. I forgive the people of Victoria for that, for it was a rather sensible step to take. New South Wales, however, took care to starve the rifle clubs. It was impossible to get any money for a target or anything else for them. But did hot the authorities pile on the allowances and the cost of heads of departments? And did they not squeeze a semi-volunteer regiment into a partially-paid one, and give some of the men permanent appointments, and do other things of that kind ? I was one of the members of the State Legislature who made some protest against the practice at the time, and I am glad to be able to follow up my protest here. Such methods of administration will not be tolerated by the Commonwealth Parliament. We desire value for our money, by giving the people a chance to be prepared to take a hand in the defence of the country if they are ever called upon to do so. If they are, they will do so readily and efficiently enough, without the military system which is sought to be foisted upon us by men trained in the old country, where militarism has been rampant. that the debate has now taken a turn that will be acceptable to those who will be responsible for the future expenditure in connection with this department. I regret that the time at our disposal has not been long enough to enable us to become better acquainted with the admirable report which has been presented to the Government by Major-General Hutton. my copy this morning, and have not had an opportunity of thoroughly reading it ; but from what I have seen in it,< I feel there is evidence of careful thought and of an earnest desire to do the best for Australia in every line of the report. There is, in my opinion, evidence that the Major-General-who , we must admit, will in the future be responsible for the cost of the Defence department-ha s formed the opinion, as has been pointed out by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, that it will be neces sary for us to organize forces not only for the defence of the soil of Australia, but for the defence of the interests of Australia wherever those interests may be-affected. I agree also with the honourable and learned member that we should not consider the latter proposal. I am concerned only with the defence of the soil of Australia, and I believe with tlie honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne that the section of the Constitution which he quoted absolutely prohibits this Parliament from taking any steps in the direction which the Major-General desires us to go. In these circumstances I consider that it will be of value to Major-General Hutton to know what is the feeling of the committee in regard to that question, because upon it will depend the re-organization, of our forces. A force for the protection of Australia would not be anything like that which would be required if we were to lay ourselves out for the defence of Australian interests, if we were to have what is known as a field force of sufficient strength to be transported to an} part of the globe where it might be r needed, in order that our commerce or our interests might be defended. I shall oppose by every means in my power the establishment of such a force as that. What we require is a force which will adequately protect our soil and prevent an invader from getting a footing thereon. The general officer commanding also alludes to the necessity of discipline for foreign service. That is true, but only true to a limited extent as regards Australia. All the military experts who have turned their attention to this question have made one initial blunder. They have omitted one factor, I believe the prime factor in the sum when coming to their conclusions. They have taken for granted that the Australian is of the same nature and of the same capacity as I only ' received the man who stands in the rank and file of the British army. We who, I am thankful to say, have a system of education second to none in an}' part of the world, stand in a very different position. I believe that his education places the Australian in a different category and on a totally different footing from the inhabitant of the United Kingdomi n this regard. The success of the Australian in South Africa was not due to drill or to previous military experience.",60,Georgh Turner The Estimates The Peaceful Industries Of The Country To
421,Mr Salmo N (Laanecoorie),"I thinkHonorable members would be astounded if they were aware of the slight knowledge, and in some cases almost absolute want of knowledge held not only by the men, but by the officers who went with some of the contingents. only a month or two in a volunteer regiment as, an officer, and men who had never served as a private, and in one case, to my certain knowledge, a man who had never worn a uniform, were selected as officers to go to South Africa, learnt a certain amount on the voyage, found themselves in somewhat similar surroundings to those which they had in Australia, and by the exercise of their mental faculties, and by taking every advantage of their previous training, not as soldiers, but as inhabitants of a country similar in conformation, and inhabited by people of similar pursuits, were able to make themselves, not only efficient soldiers, but the objects of admiraor from the southern parts of England tion and of favorable report. my opinion, has been the real reason of the success of our men there, and the great mistake which is made by military experts who all hail from the other side of the globe is that they do not recognise these differences in the rank and file of our Australian volunteer and partially-paid regiments, and the rank and file of the British army. It is undoubted that the power of initiative shown by the Australian is unknown amongst the highly trained machine-like soldier of the British army. I am not saying a word against Tommy Atkins; I have the greatest admiration for him, and I believe that when the history of that war comes to be written, the highest and most deserved tributes of praise will be showered upon him. He has shown powers of endurance, and powers of submission to discipline which arc in the highest degree to be desired and praised, but he has not had the opportunity to show.the same power of initiative as has been shown by our Australian soldiers, and if the opportunity had arisen he would not have been able to use it, because unfortunately he lacks education and previous experience. educated as the average man in Australia. There is free education in Great Britain as well as here. learned member is ""blowing"" too loudly for Australia. Mr Salmon. marks have been taken in the wrong spirit by honourable members who hail from the other side of the globe. Men who had been comparison to make. decry the mental capacity of the rank and file of the British array, but I feel I am on perfectly safe ground when I say that comparing them with the Australians who went to South Africa, they are not in the same street as regards education. I defy the honourable members who have interrupted me to prove the contrary. I had a good deal to do with the men who went from Victoria, and when I tell honourable members that those men were not agricultural labourers, did not occupy the same position, or had not the same education, as the men who went from Yorkshire member think that his remarks have any bearing on the military Estimates 1 the whole question of defence, and I am endeavouring to show where, in my opinion, an initial fault lies in the report which has .been referred to over and over again during the debate-that the difference in education is not recognised by experts who write such reports; but perhaps this is hardly the time to pursue that line of argument. I believe that the system to be adopted here is tocommence at the beginning with a further development and perfection of our cadet system, where men need not.be taken from their work, where the industrial life of the community need not be interfered with. The teaching of drill sufficient for all future purposes, with slight modifications perhaps as developments may occur, can be made part of the ordinary school curriculum. The lads are very much benefited by this drill, physically and mentally. They learn discipline ; they learn to respect those who are placed in authority over them, and the effect on their bodies is no less marked. The rifle clubs should receive every assistance. I am proud indeed to have been a member of the Victorian Legislature which did so much to foster the rifle club movement. It was done at great expense. The inflation of the defence Estimates for Victoria the year before last was almost entirely due to the votes for fostering that movement.",62,Georgh Turner The Estimates The Peaceful Industries Of The Country To

If we were going in for foreign aggression, then we should have an a*rmy of mercenaries. AVe should not expect men to go beyond the confines of their own country in order to fight battles without being paid. The defence of the country is part of the citizen's duty. I would prefer to see a citizen soldiery here, and to train our cadets and foster the rifle clubs in a proper and sensible fashion, not by coercing them to fire at fixed targets, but by giving them opportunities not only to have such practice as would be useful for them in the field, but also to come together during the year in order that they might get ah experience of camp life, and thus f it themselves for any call which might be made upon them in that direction. I agree that there must be a permanent force, but it should be limited to a small head-quarters staff, with an efficient body of instructors, and a, skeleton force for our forts. The forts can be sufficiently manned by a small number of men in times of peace. Mr L. E. GROOM -The forts on Thursday Island1 liar with our own forts-w e have a splendid system of fortifications at Queenscliff. I have seen them manned by a skeleton force, and also by a ful l force drawn from the reserves. All the forts are kept in a perfect state of repair, and also of preparedness, and the reserves who from time to time have been called in for the purpose of exercise and practice have shown themselves capable of fitting in readily to ' the work which is required of them, and proving themselves equal to any emergency which might reasonably be expected to arise. In the report of the General Officer commanding there is one suggestion which might be referred to, and that is with respect to the manufacturing departments. The necessity for an ammunition factory in Australia, under Government control, cannot, I think, be over-estimated. It is an urgent necessity. It should precede almost any other work in this direction. A small arms factory and a gun foundry could come later on ; but the manufacture of ammunition is an urgent necessity. Our riflemen, and those whoareengagedin preparingthemselves for the defence of the country, should be able always to get an adequate supply at a reasonable cost, and the factory should be under Government control, because commercial reasons might interfere to a considerable extent with the value of the explosives. Only this morning we had a very terrible indication of what might happen on a larger scale if sufficient control and supervision were not exercised. A blank cartridge was found to contain a piece of iron in the shape of a nail. Goodness only knows where that cartridge might have been aimed, if used by one of the troops, and perhaps a life might have been sacrificed. It is quite possible that from want of proper supervision, from want of Government control,we might have an explosion of very much greater proportions occurring, and for that reason very largely I am in favour of the factory, when it is erected, being placed absolutely under the Government. I am sorry to see, however, that the general officer has committed himself to one part of the Commonwealth. He names Sydney as being a suitable place for the establishment of such a factory, and the principle reason he gives, is that it is nearest to the naval base of Australia. MrL . E. GROOM --And because of the supply of coal and iron. strongly, no doubt, to the establishment of a gun foundry, and even to the establishment of a small arms factory ; but it does not apply with anything like the same strength to the establishment of an ammunition factory. I went into this question with an officer of tlie A ictorian department, who 7 is, I suppose the greatest expert in the southern hemisphere, Mr Napier Hake, who was brought out from England some years ago by the Victorian Government, and who is now I believe an officer of the Commonwealth. It was shown that for a very small sum, comparatively, a factory which exists in A^ictoria could be fitted up for the manufacture of cordite and other high explosives, and that we should then be independent of outside supplies. It was also shown that there is one great reason why it should be established in the southern State. I need not point out to honourable members that the question of temperature comes in when dealing with these high explosives. It has not been considered advisable, at any rate by the I m perial authorities, to use India up to the present time, although very urgent representations Live been made from time to",63,Chelor Does The Honourable And Learned

430,Mr Salmon,"That would apply verytime with regard to its being used, in order that it might be self contained and self-supplied in that respect. additional reason was that India might draw her supplies from us, and thus enable us to recoup ourselves for the outlay, which would be something under £100,000. I had intended to direct attention to the increases in the defence Estimates of Victoria, but time will not permit of more than a passing reference to them. There was an increase in the year before last of £26,000, which was mainly owing to the grants to rifle clubs and the purchase of rifles for the cadets. In the following year the expenditure jumped up by £36,000. Last year's Estimates amounted to £232,000, and now we find that the Commonwealth Estimates for Victoria amount to £249,000, or an increase of about £16,000. Sir is to be devoted to the formation of a reserve of ammunition. explains the increase upon last year's Estimates, but it does not affect the increase upon the previous year. The honourable member for Darling referred to the allowances made to military officers, to which I am strongly opposed, mainly because we never know 'how the money is spent, or even that it is spent. An officer may have an allowance for forage for two horses, but, as one honourable member has pointed out, he may use a motor car. The object of providing for forage allowances is to enable officers to keep two horses ready for use at any time, but I am sorry'to say that in nine cases out of ten the money is not expended in tlie wayit should be. Thehorses and forage required for military purposes should be supplied by the Government in the same way as are the police horses, and the officers who use them should be responsible for their safe keeping. The Minister for Defence has promised that a reduction shall be made, but I am not satisfied with that. I should prefer to see the amendment carried in order that reductions may be made to the extent of £200,000. I was one of those honourable members who went about the country telling the people of the enormous savings that would be effected under federation. Amongst other things I said that instead of our having six military commandants we should have only one. I find, however, that we now have seven instead of six, and I should not be keeping faith with the electors if I countenanced the continuance An of such a state of affairs. I have always kept ray election pledges, and I am not going to break faith with the people now. I shall endeavour to carry out the promise I made, that economy should be exercised in carrying on the Federal Government, and I intend to vote for the amendment if it is pressed to a division. cipal functions of Parliament, perhaps more important even than that of passing legislation, is to exercise control over the public expenditure, and if we are to perform our duty in this respect, it will be necessary for us to considerthe. Estimates before we reach the eleventh month of the year to which they relate. We are now discussing the question of reducing expenditure B j ' passing a series of Supply Bills we have absolutely voted this money away. I am pleased to say, however, tliat for some reason or other the Defence department has unexpended balances amountingto£130,000 which the Minister for Defence Says will be saved. It is apparently through no fault of the military authorities that this amount stands to their credit. put in Supply. the expenditure in these Estimates. I am pleased that the Commonwealth Parliament have on two occasions within the last week given undoubted proof of their democratic and liberal tendencies. This is unquestionably the most democratic, advanced, and liberal deliberative assembly in Australia. Last week the members of the committee were worshipping at the shrine of Venus. We then liberated the women folk of the continent, and armed them with the franchise. Now we are before the altar of Mars, but we are not prepared to immolate ourselves upon it . We are crying loudly for the retrenchment of tlie military expenditure, and are raising our voice in favour of a gradual and continuous reduction, with greater effect than any of the State Parliaments have done. I am pleased that the Minister for Defence has expressed his willingness to prune his Estimates to the extent of £130,000, and to make further retrenchments in the near future.'

434,Mr Wilks,"Provision is made forgratified to read this announcement, and will n consequence look with greater favour upon Parliament than heretofore. I find that the total vote proposed for the Department of Defence is £937,000, against an approximate expenditure at the date of transfer of £S61,000. As the honourable member for Laanecoorie said, the people were told that drastic retrenchment would be effected in the Defence department, and yet we find a large increase. I trust that the means by which the savings indicated by the Minister for Defence are to be effected will not be left to the discretion of the officer commanding the Commonwealth forces. If so, the partially-paid and volunteer forces, and the rank and file of the defence forces generally will suffer. The high salaries paid to officers-highe r than are given in any other portion of"" the British Empire-and the allowances now made, will not be continued. This is not a matter of speculation, but has been the experience of nearly all the States. Whenever retrenchment has been decided upon, the military authorities have always avoided the reduction of the salaries paid to the principal officers, and the efficiency of the service has Suffered in consequence. In New South Wales, for instance, the Easter encampment was abandoned on one occasion in order that economy might be served. Some valuable information has been afforded by honourable members who have spoken during this debate. It has been shown that Canada, with a larger population, with a greater frontier than our own, and with a foreign Power on her borders, spends less upon her defence forces by £300,000 per annum than the amount provided for in these Estimates. I notice that the expenditure upon the New South Wales Defence forces has been increased by £6,000, and upon those of Victoria by £16,000. rifle clubs. so, and I hope that the policy of the Minister for Defence will be to encourage the establishment and maintenance of those clubs throughout the Commonwealth. In this connection I may instance some of the disabilities under whichour various volunteer forces labour at the present time. In New South Wales a corps has recently been established which is mainly composed of civil servants, who, from the nature of their occupation, make admirable volunteers, inasmuch as they are skilled mechanics, who work at such establishments as the Government dock upon Cockatoo Island, &c. Despite the fact that these men give their services voluntarily, they cannot secure from the Government up-to-date rifles. The}' do not possess even one Lee-Metford or Lee-Enfield rifle. The only reply which they have received to their application to be supplied with modern weapons is that the Government have not Lee-Enfield rifles in stock. This fact evidences the inadequacy of the arms department of the Commonwealth. I hope that the Minister for Defence, whilst allowing the Military Commandant untrammelled sway in all matters connected with the internal management of the forces, will keep a watchful eye upon the expenditure. Although Australia has repeatedly exhibited her loyalty to the Empire during the progress of the South African campaign, I am satisfied that the public will not countenance the squandering of large sums of money upon the Defence department. AVhen the honourable member for Laanecoorie was speakinghe instituted a comparison between the Australian troops who have been fighting in South Africa and those from the United Kingdom. He declared that' the former were better educated than the latter. I do not think that he intended to convey exactly that impression, because the success of our Australiantroops has been due to the exercise of intelligence, and not the result of school instruction. They happened to be more adapted to the Boer methods of warfare than were the Imperial soldiers. The Australian contingents were chiefly composed of men * drawn from provincial districts, who had had experience of country similar to that inhabited by the Boers. I respectfully submit that the South African Gampaign has proved that there is no necessity for the Australia to maintain a large standing army. The long and formidable stand I understand that that is which tbe Boers have made against the greatest power in the world has conclusively demonstrated that. Seeing that the Boers have held their country under such conditions, I say that it is impossible, not only for any one power, but for several powers combined, to conquer Australia, especially when one comes to consider its geographical position and the enormous difficulties of transport which an invading force would have to encounter. In this connection, Major-General Hutton has admitted what has been transparent to most",65,George Turner £12 00 0 Of That Which Has Really Passed Beyond Our Control
435,Sir John Forrest,That is due to,66,George Turner £12 00 0 Of That Which Has Really Passed Beyond Our Control
436,Mr Wilks,"people for a very long period. Consequent^, there is no need for any lavish expenditure, either in regard to the maintenance of a permanent force or of a staff. I do hope that the Minister will not allow any reduction, to be made at the expense of the various regiments of the Commonwealth. Any saving which is made should be effected by attacking the high and inordinate salaries paid to members of the staffs. There is no necessity whatever to maintain the staffs which existed prior to federation. Instead of encouraging any further expenditure upon a land force, I should like to see more attention paid to the building up of a naval reserve. There are hundreds and thousands of men in Australia who would serve more zealously in a naval reserve than they would in any land force. These men should be trained, so that they may be of use to the Commonwealth, and of service to the Empire should occasion require it . I hope that in future sessions the consideration of the Estimates w i ll form one of the first items of our parliamentary business. believe the Ministry have saved time by their promise, and that the general discussion which has taken place will have its effect. All we can do is to indicate the direction in which reform should take place, and I trust that we shall find that the military authorities will carry out the intention and direction of the committee. travelled over a great deal of ground, and much has been said which in my opinion would have been more appropriate in a de' bate upon the Defence Bill, which we have not had time to consider fully. I am one of those who believe that the Minister for Defence has dealt fairly and frankly with the committee. He has realized what the feeling is, and has at once come down with proposals for a considerable reduction of his Estimates. It must be recognised that the Minister and the Government generally are heirs to the inflated expenditure of the various States before federation was accomplished. This applies to all the departments, but more particularly to the Defence department. The Minister has agreed, however, to make a reduction of £131,000. My primary object in rising is to express the hope that such reductions as he will have to make will not diminish the allowances which are at present given to the rifle clubs. I believe that if the sense of the committee were taken, the | Minister would ascertain that the encourage, ment of rifle clubs throughout the Commonwealth is in the direction of the policy whicli should be pursued in regard to the defence of Australia. Therefore I would ask the right honourable gentleman to consider, when he is making the necessary reductions, the value of the rifle clubs, and not allow them to suffer. On the contrary, I trust that he will render assistance to them and encourage them. While I am on my feet I may say that I believe that the cadets are the foundation of the whole of our citizen soldiery. I further believe that every man who has the rights of citizenship should maintain those rights by being in the position to show that he is able to use his riHe for the defence of his country should the need arise. As one of the representatives of the people, I recognise that many of the'statements made ave true, that there are no departments of the Commonwealth in which there has possibly been greater extravagance in expenditure than in connection with our I military departments. It will be necessaiy to watch the expenditure closely, and I trust that the Minister, before we are again asked to consider the Estimates, will give us an opportunity of considering the whole policy of defence in the form of a Bill. Before sitting down, I again express the hope that that useful line of reserve which we have in the rifleclubs, and which is the basis of our soldieiy, will be encouraged and not injured by the economies that have to be effected. with the affairs of his department, the Minister for Defence has shown himself amenable to the influences of the majority of the members of this committee in a degree that would excite considerable surprise in tlie minds of his old friends in the State of Western Australia. Any of those friends of his who might have come into this chamber and heard the right honourable gentleman make his last speech, would have been at a loss indeed to identify our Minister for Defence with the gentleman who for so many years presided in such an autocratic fashion over the destinies of Western Australia. But I am very glad indeed to take this opportunity of complimenting the right honourable gentleman on his adaptability to altered circumstances : and I only hope that that adaptability has not gone so far as to allow the officers of his department to influence him to a degree that",66,George Turner £12 00 0 Of That Which Has Really Passed Beyond Our Control

438,Mr Eowle R (Perth),"In connexionpossibly his better judgment might otherwise repudiate, in relation to these Estimates. I do not wish to indulge in any captious criticism on the right honourable gentleman or his department. I recognise that he has made an honest attempt to meet the wishes of the committee in coming down to the degree that he has done. But I object in general to the proposals of the officers of the Defence department because the Minister for Defence has repudiated the principal amount of responsibility-in connection with these Estimates. So far, then, as the action of the oflicers of the department is concerned, I consider that they have failed almost entirely to apprehend what has been required of them .by this Parliament as evidenced in the debates on defence matters which have taken place in this Chamber and elsewhere. bureaucratic government in connection with this particular department-to o much f r i ll and frippery, and too much inefficiency of the most palpable kind. I do not want to object for one moment to necessary expenditure. I fully realize that perhaps a considerable amount of expenditure is required by the Commonwealth Defence department to begin with. But I regret that I cannot see that the additional expenditure is going to be incurred in the direction that the majority of honourable members have indicated. The efficiency of the defence force is a matter we must be prepared to vote for. wonderful ideas which have been floating in the minds of some Australians with regard to the efficiency and invulnerability of the Australian soldier is apt to lead some of us somewhat astray. The honourable member for Laanecoorie has given us a remarkable illustration of a complaint that a popular illustrated periodical sometimes charges against young Australians-that of swelled head. He instituted a comparison between the Australian soldier and the British soldier, not only as regards fighting qualities, but also as regards ordinary intelligence. I was very sorry, indeed, to hear such a comparison attempted. I feel sure that there is not a single Australian soldier who has fought side by side with the British troops in South Africa but would laugh at such a comparison as the honourable member attempted. There is no doubt that the Australian soldier has fought well, and has earned and deserved the encomiums which 34 Q . have been bestowed upon him in no stinted manner by Imperial soldiers. well. never be disappointed in him, I feel sure. Buti t must be remembered that the conditions of warfare in South Africa were particularly those in which the Australian soldier was likely to be most effective, and they were at the same time likely to act against the experience of the British soldier. On the other hand, if the Australian soldier had to fight amongst the hedge-rows and lanes of England, I feel sure that he would be almost as much at a loss there as theaverage English soldier was in South Africa.. So that these attempted comparisons areentirely beside the question we have to deal We have still too much of with. So far as efficiency is concerned, I am, not one of those who believe that merely bymaking a man proficient in the use of the rifle we make an effective soldier of him... Something more than that is required.. W it h all the power which the rifle gives in the hands of a man able to use it, we must stilt give due consideration to matters of strategy and tactics in modern warfare j and I am afraid that the South African war is responsible, to a considerable extent, for some ideas that are very prevalent in Australia, and that are likely to act injuriously upon our defence forces if they are not corrected. We have been told to-night that we I , for one, fully realize that the have an excellent illustration in the case of the Boers, of men who have received! no training in warfare beyond being able to ride a horse and handle a rifle... Eminent European soldiers who have been, associated with the Boers have placed on record their opinion that the latter failed precisely in the degree in which they wereunable to act unitedly and follow ordinary strategy and tactics. Colonel Villebois deMareuil, a French officer, who was with theBoers until he was killed in one of thefights, points out in the book which he wrote that the Boers largely owed theirnon-success to the fact that they were entirely deficient in that training and discipline which is necessaiy even in the case of the best rifle shots in the world. That officer tells us that at times the Boer leaders had to sjambok their men in order to compel them to obey orders. With such an example before us, it would be criminal for this Government or the mili. tary authorities to neglect the training of",67,George Turner £12 00 0 Of That Which Has Really Passed Beyond Our Control

He deals with a permanent force, rifle clubs, the cadets, and with a field force, composed entirely of paid or partially-paid men, but there is not a single reference to volunteers. I listened with a good deal of interest to the excellent address of the honourable and learned member for Corinella, but I was unable to follow him, in so far as he deprecated the formation or continuance of volunteer regiments. But there are various volunteer regiments in the Commonwealth which, in my opinion, are as likely to be effective on the field of battle or in mimic warfare as a good many of the mili tia regiments. the partially-paid men did better work than the volunteers. may be so, but I see no reason why some encouragement should not be given to tlie volunteer regiments throughout the Commonwealth, because I believe that in this direction we can augment the defence forces very considerably. I recognise the right of men to be paid for services rendered in connection with the defence of the Commonwealth ; but where we have men willing, .anxious, and proud to give their services free, I do not see why those services should be refused, either on the ground that men are entitled to payment, or that volunteers are not likely to be as effective as partially paid men. So long as we impose certain -conditions, which are inseparable from military training, there is no reason to apprehend that a volunteer regiment will not prove as valuable as the average militia regiment. In Western Australia, material for an excellent volunteer regiment has been waiting for over two years, and so far as the Estimates give any indication, that materia] is likely to wait much longer for enrolment. In that State the proportion of members of the defence force to the rest of the community is possibly equal to that of the other States, but Western Australia is at present entirely detached, and on that ground some latitude might be allowed, and the force made somewhat stronger'. Major-General Hutton in his report says, taken to protect each State against invasion. But what would the Commonwealth be in a position to do if Western Australia should be invaded ? I hope that at the earliest possible opportunity this Parliament will take into consideration the absolute necessity of constructing the transcontinental railway. The representatives of Western Australia do not wish to force this question on Parliament, because they feel sure that as soon as the financial way is clear this honourable obligation will be undertaken by the Commonwealth. Western Australia is earnestly, looking for this railway, which, I hope, will in the very early future be part of the national defences. I complained that in some respects there was a good deal of very apparent inefficiency which the Government did not intend to remedy, and it was the artillery which I was particularly indicating. It I said that, on the whole, would be interesting to know how many obsolete muzzle-loading guns are still in commission throughout the Commonwealth; In many cases that how much expenditure is incurred owing to the presence of these guns in our defence equipment. They all ought to be on tlie scrap heap, and I am sorry that no indication is given on behalf of the department of an intention to send them to their proper place at the earliest possible moment. The supphy of effective, weapons for our artillerymen is an absolute necessity. To send men into the field with the present guns could only have the effect of certain Chinese weapons, which, by their noise, frighten the more timorous of the enemy. HadI seen any desire or intention on the part of the Government to substitute modern up-todate weapons, I should have been prepared to stretch a point and give them more money than might be justified under ordinary circumstances. But we are proceeding on the old lines without a single serious attempt to make the equipment thoroughly effective, or to do away with all the unnecessary frippery which has been referred to several times. For these reasons I feel it my duty to insist upon the utmost possible reduction in the expenditure, as a protest against a system which is by no means representative of the desires of the people of tbe Commonwealth, and which cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, be described as effective defence.

442,Mr Fowler,"the committee have given sufficient indication of a desire for a thorough re-organization of the defence forces at the .earliest possible moment. In view of the fact that the Ministers have pledged themselves to next year make a reduction of at least £131,000 on the present Defence Estimates, or even a greater reduction if it can be effected, I do not desire to press my amendment. The promise that Ministers have given has secured that which I desired to gain by carrying the amendment and forcing on the Government the opinion of the committee as a guide in the matter. The Government have agreed to so much in a fair spirit of compromise, and I accept their undertaking, and desire to withdraw my amendment. Mr' POYNTON (South Australia) When I was before the electors, some twelve months ago, this was a very live question. There was scarcely a candidate who did not include in his platform the keeping down of military expenditure, and as I came in personal contact with many of the electors I found that it was a burning question/with them. If we look into the figures and the abnormal growth which has taken place in the military expenditure of Australia during the last few years, we shall not be surprised at the fear which has been expressed by the electors that this huge engine of expenditure is becoming quite an octopus. Even a t the present stage it is so far-reaching in its demands upon the Treasury that it is absorbing practically one-ninth of the total Customs revenue. When we compare this expenditure with that which is taking place in other countries, which are not so favourably situated as is Australia, we find that the figures are still more striking. Canada, with a population of 5,500,000 MrO ' MALLEY mandant has based bis figures on a popumatter of time when these boys, having lation of five and a half millions, and in been taught how to use the rifle, will be round numbers Canada's military expendiquite competent to defend our shores ture totals only £433,000.

W it h these facts before us I feel that even the reduced proposal 34 Q z for an expenditure of £700,000 is a most extravagant one. Why is it necessary for Australia to build up a huge military system such as is proposed ? W h y should we cultivate this military spirit ? As far as I can see there is no necessity to do so; there is no real danger. been doing it for years post 1 guided by the States. Already they are complaining.
