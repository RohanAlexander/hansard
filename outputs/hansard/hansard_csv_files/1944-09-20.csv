I have received from the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) an intimation that he desires to move the adjournment of the House for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, "" The circumstances attending the negotiations for the sale or transfer of broadcasting stations 5KA Adelaide and 2HD Newcastle, or shareholders' interests therein"". the Opposition) [10.57] 1 move That the House do now adjourn. ported ? Five honourable members having risen in support of the motion, in order to 'bring to the notice of the House two transactions-o r rather one transaction and a proposed transaction -in relation to two broadcasting stations, each being of such an extraordinary kind as to demand the fullest inquiry. These cases concern stations 5KA Adelaide, which has a subsidiary at Port Augusta, and 2HD Newcastle. Both stations had been owned by Jehovah's Witnesses. In each case, the negotiations for the sale of such assets as remained after the cancellation of the licence were in the hands behalf""? of MrH . G. Alderman, of Adelaide. The facts in relation to the two cases are ment says so. remarkably similar, and I can summarize them quite shortly. I shall take first the sale of 5KA and 5AU in February 1943. The vendors were Sport Radio Broadcasting Company Limited and the Port Augusta Broadcasting Company Limited. By an agreement made On the 5th February, 1943, the shares, with the exception of one with which I need not concern myself, were sold to the Adelaide Central Methodist Mission and the Workers' Weekly Herald, which is, 1 understand, the official organ of the South Australian branch of the Australian Labour party. Now, it is an interesting fact that the purchasers are referred to as the Adelaide Central Methodist Mission and the Workers' Weekly Herald, but the purchase money, £8,500, was provided entirely by the Adelaide Central Methodist Mission. In other words, although there were two buyers, only one produced money. ber will discover as I proceed that the affiliation is even finer than he appreciates. The shares that were bought for the £8,500 provided by the Adelaide Central Methodist Mission were divided into fifths; four-tfifths went to the Central Methodist Mission and one-fifth went to the Workers' Weekly Herald, which had not subscribed one penny of the purchase money. In other words, a gift was made hy the Adelaide Central Mission of one-fifth of the interest in these wireless stations to the Workers' Weekly Herald. On top of that, it was provided that the Central Methodist Mission should provide up to £3,500 as further funds to enable the comipanies to carry on, in other words, as working capital. So the amount to be provided by the Central Methodist Mission was £12,000. The Workers' Weekly Herald provided nothing, but, as a part of this deal, it secured a one-fifth interest in the property that was changing hands. In addition, it was provided in tlie agreement that the Workers' Weekly Herald. on behalf of the Australian Labour party",15,Greenslopes Militar Y Hospital

(2) That we should also give the Labour party in this district the right to broadcast .propaganda for one hour in each ordinary week and for one hour each day between the date of the issuing of writs for a general election, and the holding of such election,, no payment to be made by the Labour paTtyi n respect ol either of these concessions. granting of time for broadcasting was to be subject to some.agreed stipulation as to some portion of it being in the evening hours most suitable for broadcasting.

J. can think of three possible interwas he able to say to the Adelaide Cenpretations, and I shall mention them. Honourable members may be able to think of others. The first possible interpretation, one that leaps to the mind, in this case-and it is no use shutting our eyes to it-is that Mr Alderman was authorized by the Government, the Postmaster-General, or some other person in authority, to extract a contribution in money's worth to the Australian Labour party as a condition of the transfer or issue of a license to a body of pergetting this licence will depend upon your sons in Adelaide, representing the Methodist Church, and, as proposed in Newcastle, the Church of England. That interpretation, of course, would involve the most flagrant corruption, and there is no occasion for me to make any further comment upon it. The second interpretation is that Mr believe that this was a happy meeting of Alfliennan, moved by a pure spirit of enthusiasm for the Labour party, went on a frolic of his own and 'found, in Adelaide, n buyer who shared his affection for the Labour party-all the purest possible spirit-and equally willing to benefit the Labour party without hope or expectation of return. The whole transaction was a perfect piece of altruism! In this view, of course, Mr Alderman would not be able to make any promise as to whether the insertion of the benefit to the Labour party would help, because the assumption is that the Government and the authorities would know nothing about it. It was a pure piece of christian generosity as between Mr Alderman and the Ade1 laide Central Methodist Mission. To accept that interpretation, one would need to have far greater simplicity of mind than either Mr Alderinan or honourable members of this House. After all, it cannot be suggested that the donation by the Methodist Mission was a voluntary one, and that the Methodists themselves just thought of it. It is perfectly plain that the suggestion did not emanate from them, because we find that in the Newcastle case, the suggestion came from Mr Alderman and, therefore, it is very reasonable to assume that in the Adelaide case also the suggestion came from Mr Alderman.

That interpretation might not be quite so innocent as my second one, and not quite so brutal as my first one, but it is still an interpretation that is utterly inconsistent with the honest administration of this country. Those facts, which in themselves, are most eloquent, and which give rise to the most insistent inquisitiveness of mind as to what are the other facts that lie behind them, make it quite clear that these transactions must be investigated.

If this remarkable state of affairs in which, with the Labour party in office, a person has a better chance of getting a broadcasting licence if he pays money or moneysworth to the Labour party, represents the honourable member's standard of honest administration, well and good. I am happy to say that it does not represent mine. I declare physical assets represented in the two unhesitatingly to the House that the case for an independent searching examination by a royal commission is unanswerable. for Information) [11.12] -The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) has indulged in flights of fancy. He told us of various possible interpretations that might be placed upon what was at all times a business deal between people who had the assets in a broadcasting station to sell and other people who were anxious to buy them. Let me relate the history of those licences. On the 17th January, 1941, Jehovah's Witnesses and its associated bodies-the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, the Adelaide Company of Jehovah's Witnesses, the International Bible Students' Association, and the Consolidated Publishing Company-were declared, under the National Security (Subversive Associations) Regulations to be unlawful bodies. The broadcasting licences that were held by Jehovah's Witnesses under various titles such as Air Sales Broadcasting Company Proprietary, owning Station 2HD Newcastle, the Sport-Radio Broadcasting Company Limited, owning station SKA Adelaide, and the Port Augusta Broadcasting Company Limited, owning station 5AU, Port Augusta, were suspended some time before the organization was declared an unlawful association. This declaration purported to put those bodies legally out of existence, and Commonwealth Peace Officers took possession of their premises. The Adelaide Company of Jehovah's Witnesses briefed Mr in 1942-43, he could have saved the House Alderman; K . C , to challenge in the High Court the validity of the regulations. I interpolate that the regulations were framed by the Menzies Government and were not the only regulations that have been declared invalid by the High Court. On the 14th June, 1943, the High Court declared that the regulations were invalid. The result of that decision was that the bodies which had been illegally put out of existence had a perfect right to the repossession of their properties, including their Central House in Strathfield, New South Wales, printing presses in various parts of the country, and the broadcasting stations. Under the decision of the High Court the Commonwealth Government was required to restore this property to the organization. No specific amount of compensation was claimed by the organization in respect of the action taken, and the matter has been the subject of negotiations with the Commonwealth for some time. The broadcasting licences were suspended, not under national security regulations, but by virtue"" of the authority possessed by the Postmaster General under another statute. That was never challenged in the High Court. But once the High Court had decided that the organization known as Jehovah's Witnesses had a legal right to the repossession of their property, the Government had a moral obligation to recognize their right to the ownership of the licences in the broadcasting stations. At the same time the Government had the right to declare whether it would renew the licences owned by Jehovah's Witnesses. It also had a perfect right to permit the sale of the licences held by that body to any other body or bodies that might negotiate with Jehovah's Witnesses. Mr Alderman has acted as the legal representative of this sect for a number of years. He did not come into the picture simply to sell the licences for the broadcasting stations. Although he is not a member of the religious organization, he seems to have an extraordinary power with the members of it. His position has never been hidden. If the Leader of the Opposition had taken the trouble to read the evidence that Mr Alderman and other witnesses gave before the Broadcasting Committee and himself a lot of time in the recital of his possible explanations for Mr Alderman's actions.",19,Formal Motion Tor Adjournment

No criticism was offered between March, 1943, when Mr Alderman related the circumstances in which the Adelaide. Central Methodist Mission came to be interested in the sale of this licence, and the 20th September, 1944. The fact is that the sale was negotiated in South Australia between Jehovah's Witnesses and the Adelaide Central Methodist Mission. The terms, which the Leader of the Opposition read, are correct, but from the time of the sale of the licence until to-day no one in South Australia has offered the slightest criticism of the transaction. knew about it. about it. No church leader in South Australia has objected to the transaction. The Leader of the Opposition did not read other clauses in the terms of sale. the terms of sale on the table of the House? slightest objection to doing so. Under the terms of the agreement, the Church of England and the Catholic Church in Adelaide are each granted one hour's free broadcasting time every Sunday.

He has acted for Jehovah's Witnesses on many occasions. He has acted also for trade unions, as the Leader of the Opposition has also done. That does not make either him or the Leader of the Opposition a defender of trade unions or a friend of the Labour party. Mr Alderman has also appeared for Sir Keith Murdoch and is a close personal friend of that gentleman. Probably he is a little closer to him now than is the Leader of the Opposition. He has not been associated in any way with the Labour party, and is not in a position to commit the Labour party in any . way in these or other business transactions. The sale of station 5KA was a business transaction. The people who owned the assets had the right to lay down the conditions of sale, and the people who were negotiating to buy them had the right to say whether they would accept the conditions.

71,Mr Calwell,"Mr Alderman has the Labour party. One hundred commercial licences are operating in Australia on the medium wave-band and, of them, 44 are owned or controlled directly or indirectly by newspaper interests. The Labour party has three stations throughout the Commonwealth-2K Y in Sydney, 3KZ in Melbourne, and 6KY in Perth. The Leader of the Opposition has suggested that the transactions to which he has referred were so extraordinary as to require investigation by a royal commission. The Broadcasting Committee, on which the Opposition has been represented for a number of years, was aware of these transactions and if the members of it considered it necessary, they could have brought the matters to the attention of their parties. not do so. ' Opposition has what Carlyle might have called "" a preternaturally suspicious mind"". originally acquired these licences by purchase. They were not free grants, but were bought on the open market. Consequently, the purchasers had the right to sell them as ibest they could, and to lay down the conditions of sale. If the conditions were not accepthas been given to the granting of a broadcastable to prospective purchasers, the owners had the right to offer the assets elsewhere. The position was entirely different when broadcasting licences were being issued in 1934. At that time Sir Archdale Parkhill was Postmaster General in the Lyons Government. A channel was available in Melbourne for another commercial station. The Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Victoria, had reason to believe that it would be granted the next licence to be issued. deal with the issues that have been raised ? an issue which honourable gentlemen opposite wish to avoid.

According to information available to me on the departmental files, the Lyons Government decided, in August, 1934, that a new licence was to be issued in Victoria.

Bishop of Newcastle, Dr. Batty, was not very keen on the issue of a licence to the is better served in light broadcast entertainChurch of England. He gave evidence before the Broadcasting Committee, in Newcastle, in November, 1942, when I was it3 chairman. I remember the circumstances very well. The Bishop said he was not intensely interested in denominational stations. He addedI do not speak officially for the diocese at the moment, but personally I am not keen on the idea of our operating a station. T am not so keen as some other members of tlie church. Subsequently the Bishop intimated that the diocesan advisers wished to be associated with the issue of a broadcasting licences were given away. The licence for Victorian out payment. Originally, of course, these licences were given away. The licence for station 2CH Sydney, which is owned by the New South Wales Council of Churches, and also the licence for station 2SM Sydney, which is owned by the Roman Catholic Church, were given to them. At that time the Church of England authorities in Sydney were not interested in the ownership of a licence. time the Anglican Church was associated with the Council of Churches. sequently it withdrew from the Council and it then expressed a desire for a licence of its own. [Extension of lime granted.] In relation to this subject, I direct attention to the following paragraph which appeared in the first report of the Broadcasting Committee:In regard to the choice of applicants for the use of such chaimeU ad may become available, we invite reference to paragraphs 385 and 414 of the Gibson report, in which it was recommended that in the granting of new licences or the re-allotment of former licences, preference should be given to religious and educational interests.

In appropriate eases the churches might'beasked to consider combining their interests in some way for the purpose of sharing the use of the station.

Bishop Hilliard, Co-adjutor Bishop of the Archdiocese of Sydmey, disputed the claims of Newcastle to have the station. Evidence on these matters appears iu reports of the Broadcasting Committee, which the Leader of the Opposition could have read had he desired to do so. Bishop Hilliard said that a broadcasting licence for the' Anglican Church should be issued for Sydney, and not Newcastle. Ultimately, of course, such a licence will be issued, when frequency modulation is adopted in this country in the post-war period, and more channels become available. Bishop Batty has written a letter suggesting corruption where there is no corruption The files show clearly that allegations of corruption have been made for some time.

The transactions were in accordance with the business principles usually observed in the sale of broadcasting stations and other assets. I point out to honourable gentlemen opposite that the present Government has not had an opportunity to issue or re-allot licences, because the two licences mentioned in the motion were never surrendered but were merely suspended. The honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron), on one occasion when he was Postmaster-General, suspended the licence of 2KY, but that station did not lose its right to have a licence, and ultimately it resumed transmission. The Government might have percnitted Jehovah's Witnesses to resume transmission, but the holders of the licence considered that it would be better to sell their assets. The majority of those gentlemen who were Ministers in previous governments are still members of this House. Those governments had the issue of eighteen licences in country towns in New South Wales since the issue of the licence to 3AW Melbourne. They did not give preference to religious bodies or returned soldier organizations, but always to the Graziers Association, newspaper interests or other commercial organizations. They want us to believe that there was nothing corrupt in what they did, and that they did not receive thousands of pounds worth of free advertising at election times, as well as support between elections, from those who were the beneficiaries of their largesse. Four licences were similarly issued in country towns in Victoria hy United Australia party-United Country party governments. Those might very properly have gone to some of the organizations that have acquired licences or want to acquire licences at the present time. mission? for a royal commission. In this matter, the hands of the Government are perfectly clean. All the relevant facts are in parliamentary papers, including the reports and the minutes of evidence of the Broadcasting Committee. The fifth report of that committee was presented yesterday by the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Guy). Honourable members opposite have only suspicion upon which to base their charges. They believe that this Government is as bad as they were when handing out licences to their friends. The prices mentioned in this transaction were for the physical assets only, and did not include such an intangible thing as goodwill. Mr Alderman said in evidence before the Broadcasting Committee that he could have obtained much more than £S,500 for the Adelaide station which he sold to the Methodist Mission. He was asked by commercial and newspaper interests to sell to them, and could have obtained £15,000 or £16,000. But he adopts a certain attitude towards life, and considers that the Labour party is entitled to a share of the air in the capital cities of Australia. In transactions on behalf of his. clients, he has always insisted, with their consent, that a monopoly of the air shall not continue to be held by anti-Labour interests. Honourable members, opposite are afraid. They do not believe that there has been any corruption, but they hate the idea that the Labour .party may have one medium of expression by means of which it can place its case before the Australian people. They believe that, if we were pushed from the air as we have been pushed from the newspaper field in Australia, a miracle might enable them to obtain control of the treasury bench once again. There is not any likelihood of any such misfortune for a very long time. They will have to get a much better case than they have put to-day if they wish to persuade the people that the Adelaide sale was other than a fair and reasonable transaction, and that the licence subsequently issued by the Postmaster-General was issued other than in accordance with the various recommendations of the Broadcasting 'Committee set up by this Parliament.

Flushed with his success in Adelaide, he approached the Diocesan Council of Newcastle, and left i't in no doubt of the terma and conditions upon which a licence would be made available. The council must give the Labour party a one-fifth share in the station, with the right to appoint one director, and the Labour party must be given free broadcasting time. council would agree to those terms its chances of getting the licence would be particularly good. However, the Diocesan Council would not be a party to this corrupt proposal. It has been stated that Bishop Batty made no reflection upon the Minister, but the fact remains that he did not withdraw the original suggestion of corruption. ber has exhausted his time. for the Navy and Minister for Munitions) [12.5] I am astounded at the extravagance of the unwarranted allegations made this morning by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies). The right honourable gentleman has made certain charges which implicate the Adelaide Central Methodist Mission, and although names have not been mentioned specifically, his statements inevitably iavolve particularly the Reverend Samuel Forsyth and the Reverend George White, who were associated with the arrangements. He also made allegations damaging to the reputation of other persons, including the Honourable R. S. Richards, who was connected with this matter. In the strongest terms I am capable of expressing, I repudiate these sinister and highly improper suggestions. I have no doubt that these gentlemen will reply in strong terms to the charges made against them. I can assure the House that there are no more honourable men to be found in the community than those who were associated with this transaction, and it comes as a shock to me that a public man should rise in his place in this House and endeavour to 'besmirch their characters by questioning the terms and methods of this transaction. The extravagant charges of honourable members opposite that there has been corruption, and bribery, and trafficking in licences, only proves that they will say anything when they see an opportunity to make political capital and attack the Government. If they are able to attach some sinister meaning to an innocent and straightforward transaction, they will not hesitate to do so. Everything that was done in connection with the sale of 5KA was perfectly honourable, and will bear the most If the searching examination"". Those concerned in the matter will have no difficulty in proving that their probity is superior to that of any honourable member of the Opposition.

Absolutely the same conditions as were contained in the agreement in respect of the sale of the Adelaide station! (2) That we should also give the Labour party in this district the right to broadcast propaganda for one hour in each ordinary week and for one hour each day between the date of the issuing of writs for a general election and the holding of such election, no payment to be made by the Labour party in respect of either of these concessions.

The unsavoury details of this scandal should be thoroughly investigated by a royal commission. I say that with considerable personal feeling, because it will be recollected that I was humiliated by a royal commission into the expenditure by the Government of which I was Treasurer of the paltry amount of £300 on fighting communism. If that royal commission was justified, the facts which have been adduced to-day make a royal commission into this matter imperative. Leader of the Opposition ( Sir. Menzies), in moving the adjournment of the House in order to draw attention to the issue of certain broadcasting licences, went to conman made that statement to the Bishop siderable lengths to impute improper motives to the Adelaide Central Methodist Mission in connection with the purchase of station 5KA, and said that the circumstances of that sale and the proposed sale of station 2ED in Newcastle to the Church of England should 'be investigated by a royal commission. If we are to have a royal commission, its terms of reference should be far wider than the matter of those two transactions, because statements made by the Minister for Information ( Mr Calwell) and documents on the files of the Postmaster-General (Senator Ashley) disclose the existence of a most unsatisfactory state of affairs in broadcasting when the right honourable gentleman was Prime Minister. But I do not propose to support the proposal that a royal commission should be appointed, because the charges made by the right honourable gentleman have been effectively answered by the Minister for Information. The completeness of the reply was disclosed by the right honourable gentleman's attempt, by constant interjections, to spoil the Minister's speech. He had frequently to be called to order by the Speaker. That, was a most effective answer to the charges made by the Leader of the Opposition. That right honourable gentleman also was to serve the Christian community. declared that in 1942 the Broadcasting The Church of England and the Roman Committee was dominated by members of Catholic Church in Adelaide are each the Labour party.

Hayes and Dr. Grenfell Price represented the United Australia party, and Senator Cooper represented the Australian Country party. Thus, the Labour representatives exceeded by only one the representatives of the other two political parties. An examination of the recommendations of the committee will reveal that in the majority of cases the decisions were unanimous. Therefore, the statement that the Broadcasting Committee was dominated by the Labour party is incorrect, and I have pleasure in placing the facts on record. of Newcastle. Mr Alderman said ! I am dealing with the statement of the Leader of the Opposition that the Broadcasting Committee was dominated by. the Labour party, and that its decisions were coloured by the views of the Labour party. Nothing could be further from the truth. I became a member of the. Broadcasting Committee after the preliminary stages of the agreement had. been completed, but I know that the sale of the assets of station 5KA was amicably arranged and that corruption was never alleged. The transaction was negotiated in the first place by Mr Richards, whose honour is above suspicion. To imply, as did the Leader of the Opposition, that this transaction was corrupt, is to impute that the Methodist Church lent itself to corruption. That is unworthy of him. Those tactics are resorted to by a barrister when he is presenting a very weak case. The right honourable gentleman's association with religious bodies has been sufficient for him to know that although they may be criticized by some sections of the community, at least their actions and motives are not corrupt.

151,Mr Barnard,"Neve r mind whatsuggestion of the Leader of the Opposition that improper practices were employed in negotiating the agreement, is not worthy of him. I heard Bishop Batty give evidence to the Broadcasting Committee at Newcastle. As the Minister for Information stated, the Bishop was most indefinite. First he asked for the licence, then he did not want it. Later, he desired to hold the licence for a time, or to have it transferred to Sydney. In this matter, the Church of England did not conduct negotiations very satisfactorily. The arrangement for the control of the assets of station 5KA Adelaide was negotiated by Mr Alderman, as solicitor, and the whole transaction was most amicable. As the Minister for the Navy( Mr the right honourable gentleman appeared Makin) showed, the agreement had been in operation for twelve months, and not a word of criticism has been directed against it. Minister did not know about it last week. member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) is seeking to draw a red herring across the trail. Everybody accepted the agreement, and all parties were satisfied with it. The arrangement is serving the churches very well in South Australia. [Extension of time granted.] I direct attention to the fact that in Newruption and improper practices. castle, where the community is predominantly Labour, the Church of England has not been able to make a similar arrangement. In Adelaide, where the community was not predominantly Labour, at least when the agreement was made, the arrangement worked satisfactorily. As the Minister for Information indicated, the obstacle to the sale of 2HD at home during his absence. I remember Newcastle to the Church of England was not so much the licence as the price to be paid for the assets of the station. The Leader of the Opposition failed to make out a sound case for the appointment of a royal commission to investigate his charges, and the Leader Fadden) could not support his charges of corruption. What does the agreement, which the Leader of the Opposition read to the House, contain? Probably the right honourable gentleman himself has written letters in similar terms on behalf of clients. honourable member, I have never written a letter on behalf of a client. But I have appeared for people like the honourable gentleman.

But they did have a defence. in open court. He was not making an attack under parliamentary privilege.'

During my term I have listened to members of the "" fighting Opposition ""-thei r own expression-delive r attack after attack on the Government, with the object of discrediting it in the eyes of the people, and on every occasion I have seen them driven deeper into their dugout. I believe that the people will never again entrust their destinies to them. In presenting the budget last week, the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) told the Parliament that during last year the total mobilization of bur man-power had reached peak level, and that it would be a mistake to imagine that the war strain had decreased or that either the direct war effort or the control of private expenditure could be relaxed. Notwithstanding these warnings, and the assertion that no state of mind would be more fatal to the stability of our economy than one which assumed that, with the increasingly favorable turn of war events, prices control' and rationing could be relaxed, the story that he related of the nnancial stability of the nation was by no means a sad one, having regard to the enormous burden which has to be shouldered. The honourable gentleman said that the present tax levels, are so high that (further contributions from that source would be impracticable. He was able to inform the country that the estimated expenditure was not so great as it was last year, and that the war expenditure alone would Brennan, F -show a reduction of £39,000,000. A Johnson, H. V. gratifying feature of the war expendiSheehy, T. N. ture, estimated at £505,000,000 compared Fraser, A. D. with £543,000,000 last year; is that no Coles, A. W. less than £452,000,000 is to be expended in Australia, and only £52,000,000 overseas. Gratifying also is the intimation that, in connection with civil expenditure, the provision for social services will show an increase of £37,700,000 compared with that for 1940-41. These services will include the pharmaceutical, unemployment effective in January, and a hospital benefits scheme agreed to at the Premiers Conference, legislation for which is to be introduced. The decision of the Go-Twelv e vernment to budget for a reduced war expenditure was made only after a full review of Australia's war effort, and does not imply any diminution, but merely a reorientation of that effort; The increased demands of the American forces and of the United Kingdom necessitate the diversion of man-power from the armed forces and munitions production to the production of food and other essentials. Releases from the fighting services and munitions establishments have been arranged for this purpose. The Treasurer also said that the releases from the armed forces had exceeded enlistments by 25,000, and that approximately 18,000 persons had been or would be released from government munitions factories. Considering the war restrictions, our export and import figures are quite favorable. It is interesting to note that it was possible during the year to repay a temporary loan of £12,000,000, raised in London in 1940-41, after meeting an overseas war expenditure of £56,000,000, despite the adverse exchange, which must always puzzle and annoy Australians. Our external financial position showed a substantial improvement during the period under review. It is also pleasing to note that, although it has not been possible to estimate accurately the demands that will be made by rapidly changing and important operations in the current financial year, approximately 20 per cent, of our war' expenditure, totalling £110,000,000, is being provided this year in connection with reciprocal aid to American forces in this country",33,Formal Motion Tor Adjournment

The Treasurer has not been able to offer tax relief, or encouragement to those who anticipated the relaxation of rationing and prices control. I emphasize that rationing applies to goods which are in short supply. However, certain concessions are embodied in the income tax assessment bill that has been introduced, and these will prove a veritable godsend to many wage-earners who have domestic and other responsibilities. of the present limit of £50 for each taxpayer upon which a rebate is allowed for medical expenses, the Treasurer proposes a rebate upon £50 for each member of a taxpayer's family, and a further concession is that medical expenses may include dental fees up to £10 in each case. The rebate of tax in respect of dependent children is to be extended to cover children between the ages of sixteen and. eighteen years, who are receiving full time flducation. There are also provisions which relate to accumulations of repairs and maintenance of property and plant, and the abolition of the sales tax on building materials for the assistance of home-builders. All of these demonstrate that the Government is anxious to give relief wherever possible to those who are hard pressed or in need. We are determined to maintain those humanitarian principles upon which the Labour movement is based, and for the preservation of which the war is being fought. all realize that tremendous difficulties will be encountered during the period of transition from war to peace. Whatever criticism may be directed against the Government regarding its performance of a thankless job, no one can find fault with its intentions as expressed in the present budget. However, I hope that soon the war will be over, and that this is our last war-time budget. I look forward to the time when the Government will be able to afford the poorer sections of the community relief froan the burdens of war-time taxation which they have so willingly shouldered during the period of the war. Those in the lower income groups must be the first to be given relief, especially men with family responsibilities. Basic wage Mr Fuller. earners should be free of all forms of direct taxation. A review should be made at the earliest possible moment of invalid and old-age pensions with a view to granting substantial increases. It is to the credit of this Government that, notwithstanding the demands made by the war, invalid and old-age pensions are to-day higher than ever before. Nevertheless, I believe that they are not yet high enough to enable pensioners to live in reasonable comfort. I suggest to the Instead Treasurer that, when post-war plans are under discussion, consideration should be given to the proposal te establish in every important town in Australia a government-controlled home for old people. We have all seen old people, who have done their part in the pioneering of Australia, bundled away to a home in the city, there to spend the last days of their lives among strangers. Many of the sons of these pioneers shed their blood in the last war, and some are again serving in the present war in defence of our freedom. Therefore, I urge the Government to give serious consideration to my suggestion. I believe that the war will not last much longer, and that we should begin now to plan for the future. When the war ends, we shall be confronted with gigantic problems which will differ materially from those that had to be solved after the last war. To-day, for We instance, we have about 1,5.00,000 people' engaged in war activities of one kind or another. The demobilization of so vast a number will have to be undertaken with great care and judgment if we are to avoid economic confusion, and prevent hundreds of thousands of people from being thrown on to the labour market. An obligation rests upon the Government to ensure that poverty and unemployment shall be abolished after the war. We are fighting for something vastly better than what existed before the war. We should never forget, that, during the depression, 30 per cent, of the working population of Australia was unemployed, and that 700,000 men, women and children were living on the dole. In those dark and desperate days I saw men and women lined up at police stations throughout the country asking for relief, while moths and silverfish were eating the clothing in shops and warehouses, and mice were destroying stacks of wheat at railway sidings-and all this because, as we were told, there was no money. As soon as the war started, however, there was plenty of money. Millions of pounds ' was produced overnight. I do not say that we should not have spent money on the war. Victory is cheap at any price, but let it never be said again that there is no money with which to feed and clothe the people. Human life transcends every other consideration. We must set up an orderly economic system in place of the chaotic conditions which brought misery and ruin in their train. The Government is determined that, after the war, men and women shall be free in the true sense of the word, and to that end they must be given the f u l l measure of economic security which is their birth-right. In order to ensure this, it w ill be necessary to inaugurate a vast programme of reproductive public works such as housing, the construction of new roads and railways, hydro-electric schemes and soldier settlement. The need for new homes, to the number of many thousands, was never greater. embark upon a vigorous policy of homebuilding which will provide the nation with a roost valuable asset. Every one agrees that a great deal w ill have to be done after the war to restore our roads to the condition in which they ought to be. A great many shire councils not only lost their employees, but also their equipment, which was taken over for war purposes. There is also an urgent need for new roads, including one fro m Tumut to Canberra. This undertaking should be included in the post-war reconstruction plans, and the work should be done by the Department of the In terior in co-operation with the State authorities. The road would open up some of the richest farming country in New South Wales, and make available, for exploitation, great areas of timber. It would also enable supplies of f r u it and vegetables from surrounding areas to be brought to the market inCanberra. A further advantage would be that the distance from Canberra to Melbourne would be shortened by many miles. In fact, this should be regarded as a strategic road which would have a high defence value, and the undertaking should be given a high priority. I also appeal to the Government to co-operate with the New South Wales authorities in the construction of the Yass-Canberra railway. A sum of money should be placed on the Estimates for this work, and construction should begin immediately the war ends. Electricity is an amenity which every Australian citizen is. entitled to enjoy. Water and electric services should be made available, not only to residents of country towns, but also, where practicable, to every farm-house. Let us make it possible for every country dweller to have an electric stove, a refrigerator, a bath-heater and a radio. The provision of these amenities w ill do much to promote a better understanding between residents of the country and the cities, and w ill tend to bring about a better distribution of population, something which is urgently required. Water and electric power are of such importance that, wherever possible, the rivers of the country should be harnessed in the service of the people. The Government must Much preliminary work has already been done by the State in connection with proposals for the harnessing of the Tumut. River. During the last three years, borings have been made for foundations for a dam. This work, if completed, would supplement the B u r r in j u c k irrigation and hydro-electric scheme, and would be of great value to the whole of the Riverina by providing cheap power for country industries. The Snowy River ought to be harnessed as a part of a hydro-electric scheme for the generation, of power, not only to serve south-eastern New South Wales and north-eastern Victoria, but also to augment through the grid system the electricity supplies of all eastern Australia, particularly Sydney and Melbourne, as f a r north as southern Queensland. The burning question of land settlement should be immediately gone into in co-operation with the State governments, in which the control of lands is vested. The time is overripe for the problem of land-locked country towns to be grappled with. One of the tragedic consequences of the defeat of the recent referendum is .that' the Commonwealth is limited in such matters as the breaking up of vast estates to'the influence it may exert through the Loan Council. In the Hume electorate, one of the safest primary producing areas of Australia, the towns are land-locked to an alarming degree. They are surrounded by holdings of up to 40,000 acres. Such a state of affairs must not be allowed to continue. With the prosecution of a vigorous policy of subdivision, thousands of ex-servicemen could be placed on the land with advantage not only to themselves, but also to the nation in the development which would follow. We should, therefore, co-operate to the very limit with the States in order to smash the land monopolists who have land-locked our country towns into stagnation. I was "" beaten to the post"" in the debate last week on the adjournment motion by the Deputy Leader of the Country party, the honourable member for prices. Otherwise, I should have spoken then. It was amusing to hear Opposition members tell how their hearts bleed for the primary producers of this country. They must think the primary producers have short memories and have forgotten that the honourable member and his colleagues in the years in which they occupied the treasury bench failed dismally even to attempt to ease the farmers' burdens. The most effective answer to the hifalutin "" political propaganda of the honourable member is a leading article in the Sydney Morning Herald of last SaturdayI f , however, the scheme be judged from the standpoint of public policy, it must be conceded that it has made a substantial contribution to national welfare. In many ways it has been the simplest and most effecinadequate, with the result that, tive of the various attempts made in recent years to help the grower, and to small producers it has been especially valuable. Though they may not have reaped large profits, they have enjoyed a payable price and a stability hitherto unknown in the industry, under a scheme which was brought in when a surplus of 150,000.000 bushels was overshadowing a collapsing market. Just over ten years ago the world was in the throes of a financial depression; millions walked the streets of the world's greatest and wealthiest cities in a Mr Fuller. hopeless search for work, and in millions of homes"" dreadful hunger drove the spirit of resistance from men-, women and children. Battalions of undernourished children became the unfit men and women who in. the last five years have failed to meet the medical and' physical requirements of the services. In every great wheat-field of the world lay the mightiest surplus of wheat-the world has ever seen, and, while men' arid women struggled for a few pence with which to buy bread', millions of bushels of unharvested' wheat rotted. In America, millions of bushels was burnedand millions of acres of wheatland went out of production because there was no prospect of payable prices. To' the wheat-growers of Australia, the nnancial loss of' the depression years was the grimmest burden which they have ever had to bear. Many, deeply committed to banks and other financial institutions, were forced to abandon their properties, bankrupt and broken, and swell the hordes of unemployed in the towns and cities. The years that followed the depression were almost as bad. Wheat prices on the world markets recovered for a while, only to slump again, and, for years, fluctuating prices menaced the. farmers' security. To-day, however, that is merely a bad memory. Time has blurred the stark picture of ruin. Since the. outbreak of war, the wheat marketing system has undergone several changes, and it is now the soundest ever known by the industry. Earlyi n the war, the. Commonwealth Governinent established a wheat stabilization scheme under which all wheat was pooled under the control of the Australian Wheat Board. But the Menzies-Eadden Government failed to recognize that the prices ruling just before the war were ruinouslyfrom the early pools, farmers frequently did not receive even 3s. a bushel, and had to wait for months for payment. To the farmers' protests, the Government's reply was: "" You are lucky to get 2s. 6d. a bushel."" The Leader of the Australian Country party had failed the farmers again by backing the right honourable member for ""Kooyong( Mr Menzies) and ""big business"" against the fanners. He let the small",34,Chifley
174,Indi ( Mr Mcewen) On Stable Wheat,"fanners go to the wall. The wheat growers who could afford to wait were given the chance to squeeze smaller competitors out of production. When the Labour party took office, plans were immediately made to stabilize wheat at a payable price through the "" Scully plan"". Originally, this plan provided for the payment of 4s. a bushel at growers' sidings for the first 3,000 bushels, and a first advance of 2s. a bushel presentation of a budget tell a complete on the balance up to 1,000 bags. Immediate payment is made on the first 1,000 bags, which is known as ""quota wheat"". .Payment is made at the siding and the Government meets freight, handling and storage charges. The industry benefited by £4,000,000. In 1943, the first advance on "" non-quota "" wheat was raised to 3s. a bushel, and, to meet the cost of the award for workers in the industry, the first payment on "" quota"" wheat was raised to 4s. l^d. a bushel. Growers receive further advances from time to time on "" non quota "" wheat from each pool as it is sold. In addition, the Government has subsidized cheap wheat for feed by £780,000 a year. ,So, without cost to the grower, wheat can be given an additional outlet by being sold to stock-feeders at 3s. 6|d. at buyer's siding. The Government also decided to give producers control of their own industry, and members of ti e Australian Wheat Board are now elected by the farmers themselves. The practical experience that the farmers have brought to the Australian Wheat Board has been extraordinarily helpful to this great national industry, which is in. a far sounder position than ever before. I feel certain, therefore, that the high--powered political propaganda used by tie honourable member for Indi and his colleagues will have no appeal to any section of primary producers, and that the farmers will be true to the Labour party, which has saved them from bankruptcy. matta) [3.14] -In an age which is characterized by rapid changes in the affairs of men, it is perhaps not surprisHe did not explain another significance ing to find this trend manifested in the presentation of the federal budget. Until recent times, no Treasurer would consider that he had done his duty properly and no parliament would consider he had done so, if he had not presented a balanced statement clearly outlining the sources from which he contemplated collecting his revenue and equally clearly indicating the directions in which the money was to be expended. The final item of a budget, whether Commonwealth or State, was invariably an indication of a surplus or a deficit in the public accounts. But no longer does the financial story. Bather has the document become an economic thesis; it is none the worse for that, perhaps, but it illustrates the change to which I referred. The Treasurer told the House that the expenditure for the financial year would be £653,000,000, and that revenue from all sources would be £325,000,000. He added that the gap to be bridged was £328,000,000, and that large sums would be required from the public by way of loans. He did not even tell us this year, although it had been his practice in previous years to do so, how much loan money will be raised on the ordinary market hy voluntary subscriptions, and how much will be bank credit. In presenting this statement, the Treasurer also revealed, quite apart from the heavy expenditure for war purposes, that non-war expenditure will be not less than £147,800,000. If it were not for the psychology which has adapted.us to think complacently in terms of millions, greater notice would have been taken of this substantial increase of non-war expenditure. Only a few years ago, the then Treasurer, Mr Spender, directed attention to the fact that for the first time in our history the budgetary proposals contemplated an expenditure exceeding £100,000,000. In the present budget, nonwar expenditure is estimated at £148,000,000. Strangely enough, the Treasurer told us that we must not take his budget figures too seriously. I quote from his printed speechThe budget war expenditure does not exactly measure the amount of Australian resources used for war purposes. of the statement. It is true that when standing alone the figures do not reveal clearly and unequivocally the war expenditure, and the same may be said, although the Treasurer",37,Chifley
175,Sir Frederick Stewart (Parra,"did not say so, of the figures for nonwar expenditure. For example, in the total of £148,000,000, the sum of £30,000,000 is being appropriated for the National ""Welfare Fund. That is in accordance with the law. But £30,000,000 is not being expended for the purposes to which the fund should be applied. Indeed, the Treasurer told us that this year only £12,000,000 of the £30,000,000 will be expended on social services appropriate to the trust, and that £18,000,000 will be invested in short-term treasury-bills and these will be utilized for war purposes. One might well ask. why did the Treasurer thus juggle the figures by increasing nonwas prevented from entering the field of war expenditure by £18,000,000, and decreasing war expenditure by a similar amount? have had some years of parliamentary experience, the explanation is very simple. ""We know that when the Treasurer introduced his new taxation proposals two years ago, and brought into the dragnet of the Commissioner of Taxation persons in the lower income groups, he was careful to assure them that the money was designed not -for the prosecution of the war, but to provide social security for them. £30,000,000 has been placed in the schedules as non-war expenditure, when a more correct division would be £12,000,000 for non-war expenditure and £18,000,000 for war purposes. Last year the situation was even more aggravated than it is this year. Although the Treasurer hypothecated £27,000,000 for the National ""Welfare Fund, only £2,250,000 of that amount was expended on the appropriate social services, and the balance of £25,000,000 was invested in treasury-bills. Thus it became a part of war expenditure, instead of non-war expenditure as the Treasurer claimed. The honourable member for Hume( Mr these various social benefits.

That does not the people cast an affirmative vote on the accord with the story that we hear from Sir Frederick Stewart. 19th August. Yet, two and a half pages of the Treasurer's budget statement are devoted to a description of contemplated expenditure on social services. One paragraph is very significant;The Government is pressing forward towards its goal, which is to ensure that aU essential health and medical services will be available without charge to all persons needing them. I can here record two further steps forward. The Treasurer then proceeded to inform honourable members about free hospital accommodation and treatment of sufferers from tuberculosis. Are our memories failing us ? Were we not told a few weeks ago that the Commonwealth Government public health, even in co-operation with the States, and that only an affirmative To honourable members who vote at the referendum could remedy the position ? remember that. not think that my recollection is wrong when I say that an affirmative vote was not recorded at the referendum. Yet the result had no effect upon the Treasurer's programme for social services. HonorThat is why the sum of able members have heard a good deal about the National Welfare Fund, which, in my opinion, is more a pretence than a reality. Last year, only £2,250,000 was expended from the fund for social services, and this year only £12,000,000 is ear-marked for the same purpose. The balance of £43,000,000 will be used, as it was always intended to be used, for war purposes. The Treasurer has provided money for maternity allowances, funeral benefits, and unemployment and sickness benefits, in spite of the fact that the people were told that unless they gave to the Parliament of the Commonwealth authority to deal with industrial matters, it would be impossible to provide for them that all Commonwealth is predicting 2 per cent, of unemploy-",38,Chifley

During this debate several honourable members have directed attention to evidence of wastefulness in the management of war activities. ground again, but I invite the attention of the Minister for Aircraft Production (Senator Cameron) to a report that a gross waste of man-power is occurring at the aircraft factory in Parramatta-road, Lidcombe. I also direct the attention of the appropriate Minister to the reports of the waste of man-power and money by the Allied Works Council in the interior of Australia. I understand that the War Expenditure Committee has submitted a report on this subject to the Government. placed in the hands of honourable members without delay and certainly before the -conclusion of the discussion of the Estimates. the face of the evidence it must give evidence of waste in many directions. Probably the document will not be released until .the Estimates have been passed.

I am glad to turn again to a provision of the budget which I can commend. The Government contemplates increasing the appropriation for the purpose of providing Australian representation at the International Labour conferences. The honourable member for Bass( Mr Barnard) has recently enjoyed the privilege, which I enjoyed some years ago, of representing Australia at one of these conferences. I am sure that he will be a better man for the experience. I am I -shall not traverse that glad to know that Australian representation is likely to be arranged on a more equitable basis in the future than has been the case in the past. Hitherto, the policy of the Government has been to mvite the trade unions to select their representatives, and the Government has paid all travelling expenses both ways and made reimbursements for lost wages and out-of-pocket expenses. The method of securing representation of the employers was not so satisfactory. Usually inquiries are instituted to ascertain whether any That report should be qualified employer is likely to be rambling in Europe or America at the time of the conference, and, if so, to appoint him to represent the employers. I hope that Unless the report flies in the larger appropriation of public funds for the purpose of providing representation at these conferences may be taken as an indication that the Government intends that, in the future, the representation of employers and employees will be on the same finanafter cial basis. It is desirable also that the numerical strength of our delegation should be increased. At the meetings I attended at Geneva in 1935, Japan had sixteen representatives and Great Britain 37. I have great confidence in the peacepreserving possibilities of such international gatherings. in the rehabilitation of I cannot commend the Government so enthusiastically in respect of some other matters. In fact, I strongly condemn it for its expenditure on the recent Constitution alteration referendum. The last general elections cost the nation £108,000, but the recent referendum, in which it may be said that there were only two candidates compared with the multiplicity of candidates in the general elections, involved the country in a cost of £125,000. The explanation, of course, is that whereas at general elections the various political parties provide the money for their propaganda, in the recent campaign the money for the "" Yes"" propaganda by the Labour party was provided from Treasury funds. I am surprised that the people of Australia have been so complacent about this. Possibly they have become so accustomed to scandals of the kind exposed this morning in connection with radio stations that a government expenditure of a trifle of £60,000 on party propaganda does not irritate them. Turning now to the Government's taxation proposals, I regret that the Treasurer' could not see his way clear to ameliorate the conditions of the taxpayers to a greater degree than he has done. The proposed concessions, though welcome, are almost negligible. The lifting of sales tax from building materials is a welcome gesture. I dislike that word, but if is the only one that will receive superannuation. We do not like fit the case, for, in view of the fact that restrictions on building are to continue, the removal of the tax is little more than a gesture. I refer now to a matter of great financial significance which is not specifically referred to in. the budget, and which, so far, has not been mentioned by any participant in this debate. I refer to the Prime Minister's promise to the coalminers that, under certain readily realizable conditions, he will institute a federal scheme of pensions for coal-miners. No one can suggest that I am opposed to a policy of security for the workers against the vicissitudes of old age, accident, illness or infirmity. Quite modestly, I can. claim that few citizens have done more than I to create a public conscience on this subject. But I am opposed to the selective treatment of a section of the people. All citizens should enjoy the same security under identical conditions. I am totally opposed to the holding out of a financial inducement to one section of the community to perform its simple national duty. Parliament is entitled to know what is in the Prime Minister's mind on this subject. The right honourable gentleman has publicly stated that because a certain rate of coal production was not maintained during a specified period, his promise was withdrawn; but another promise was made that if the desired conditions are achieved the promise may be restored. The taxpayers, and, in fact, the whole community, should be told by the Prime Minister what he contemplates doing. Has he in mind a non-contributory scheme, for that is the declared policy of the Government in regard to pensions and other social security provisions ? The coal-miners have stood up to their obligations for ten or eleven days. If they stand up to them for another similar period, does the Prime Minister intend to introduce a non-contributory pension scheme? If he is prepared to apply this principle to a scheme for 17,000 coalminers, does he intend to convert the Commonwealth Public Service superannuation fund to a non-contributory basis ? Is he prepared to say to the railway workers and school-teachers: "" You have been making contributions in order to that; it is a capitalistic system. We shall introduce a complete scheme of noncontributory superannuation. We have had to do it for the miners, and we do not see why we should not do it for you also""? I cannot imagine that occurring. But, if the Prime Minister is prepared to give to the miners an elaborate pensions scheme without obliging them to contribute to it, he will destroy the very basis of our social security. What are the beneficiaries of this promised pensions fund to receive? In the absence of any advice from the Prime Minister, we should be safe in assuming that, as a minimum, it will be on the same generous scale as the present miners' pension scheme in New South Wales. Either the Prime Minister or the miners would have to change in order seriously to contemplate any scheme that would be less generous. The present scheme, which is not likely to operate much longer, unless the Prime Minister or somebody else comes to its rescue, was introduced in July, 1942. It contemplated a pension at the retiring age of 60 years, or earlier in the event of incapacitation, of £2 a week for the miner, with an additional £1 a week if he had a wife, and 8s. 6d. a week for each child under the age of sixteen years. The scheme operated on that basis for twelve months. The contributions were by the miner 2s. 6d. a week when he was working and nothing when he was not working, and 5d. a ton on all coal mined in New South Wales. These two contributions were supplemented by a Treasury contribution of £80,000. Claims did not become effective for some weeks. As a matter of fact, the submission of them was slow in the first year, with the result that the fund showed a surplus at the end of the year. Then the orgy commenced. Under pressure, the New South Wales Labour Government seriously amended the scheme. One amendment husband of a woman who was eligible for an old-age pension should receive an increase of 5s. a week. Peculiarly enough, the pension went not to the wife, but to the husband, and that has caused very great concern to the womenfolk on the coal-fields. This increase of 5s. a week followed the lead given by the federal legislature when it increased . the old-age pension by a corresponding amount. I was amazed when I read in the report of the qualified accountant who investigated the funda gentleman who was a member of the royal commission which had first reported on it-that whilst the legislation restricted the increase to the husbands of women who were entitled to the old-age pension, in fact it has been paid in all cases, in the belief that the Government, of New South Wales will ultimately validate the payment. Because of further liberalization in the form of retrospectivity, the fund is well nigh bankrupt, and iu a few years the contributions will be, not 5d., but 10d., a ton, and not 2s. 6d., but 10s., a week by the miner. Let me show what I meant when I said that the retrospeotivity concessions have seriously affected the solvency of the fund. It is well that we should consider these, because no scheme of pensions promised by the Prime Minister would b'e acceptable which did not give to them at least what they are now receiving. One of the amendments after the fund had been operating for twelve months is to be found in section 10, sub-section In. It Sir Frederick Stexoart. has caused the march of the fund to bankruptcy, and providesThe tribunal may award a pension to tlie widow of any person who was, at any time after the first day of January, one thousand nine hundred and twenty, engaged in the coal or oil shale mining industries of New South Wales, and who died before the commencement of this Act, where the tribunal is satisfied that the granting of such a pension would not be inconsistent with the general scope and purpose of this Part and that, having regard to all the circumstances of the particular ease, it is just and equitable to award a pension to such widow. In other words, if a man employed in this industry died 23 years ago, his widow can now claim a pension. provided that the treatment. have no objection to compassionate treatment ; hut it cannot safely be given under a scheme of this kind. If that is the sort of thing which the Prime Minister has promised to the miners, this Parliament has the right to know exactly what he has in mind. But it is not the only element of retrospectivity in these amendments. Section7 provides that a miner injured since 1930, and even one injured since 1920, shall be able to claim a pension from the fund, provided he had worked in or about a mine for twenty years. Some honourable members have been rather diffident about accepting my analysis of the position. Perhaps they will not be so eager to refute the quotation which I shall now make from Common Cause of the 16th September, 1944-a n authoritative and up-to-theminute source. This is the relevant paragraph from a statement by Mr J. Jack, who is no less a person than the State president of the Retired Mine Workers Association, and, as such, is very greatly concerned about the solvency of this pensions schemeI f the scheme had been carried out ns was first intended, that is, that the men employed in the industry being compulsorily retired at CO years of age to make way for youth, and not going back to 1928 to bring in men who voluntarily retired twelve years previously, and if we did not have the spectacle of the Federal Government cancelling invalid and old-age pensions (which necessitated them being placed wholly on our pension f u n d ) , the miners' fund would have been solvent to-day and there would he no need to raise the workers' contributions.",40,Frederick Stewart Men Were Being Dismissed From A Muni

182,Sir Frederick Stewart,"II f my friends opposite are not prepared to accept ray version, they may accept the implication in that statement that the fund Ls no longer solvent and that the insolvency has been caused hy retrospective liberalization. I have mentioned this, not because I want to ""throw cold water "" on the New South Wales miners pension scheme, but because I want the country and this Parliament to know what is implied in the promise of the Prime Minister. If I have misstated the proposal, and the right honourable gentleman has in view some other scheme, we shall be glad to hear of it. If we are not given any information, we can only take the present scheme as a basis; and I repeat that no scheme so unsoundly based as is the New South Wales miners pension scheme could be acceptable to the people of Australia. I join in tbe hope expressed by the previous speaker and others, that before this Parliament is called upon to consider another budget the present conflict will have been brought to a satisfactory issue and that the Treasurer's demands upon the community next year will be of more normal proportions. congratulate the Government on the budget. Although Opposition members have had very little criticism to offer concerning it, I have noticed a tendency on their part to advocate a reversion to the old financial order of things. Two years ago, when we were in a very dangerous position, we heard expressions of approval of a new order, and I am somewhat disturbed when I now hear the question: "" Where is the money to come from ? "" It would appear that they are beginning to receive orders from those whom they represent. The matter of finance will be most important in the future, and we must not revert to the old order. The direction' of it must not again be entrusted to large vested interests. The honourable member for Hume( Mr Fuller) spoke of misery that had been inflicted .unnecessarily on the people. That was due to a system under which finance was controlled by private enterprise. The Government must bring down at an early date legislation which will restore to its former status the Commonwealth Bank. That institution was established by a Labour government, but [38] its usefulness was destroyed by the parties now in opposition. The major factor was the Australian Country party, which even to the present day poses as the representative of the primary producers, yet lines up'with ""big business"" whenever (he pressure is applied, in order to prevent what would, confer a benefit on not only the primary producer, but also all other sections of the people. I hope that the Government will legislate to prevent future interference with the Commonwealth Bank should the parties opposite again, unfortunately for the country, be returned to the treasury bench, and thus ensure control of finance by ihe people through their parliamentary institutions. Last night, the honourable member for of soldier settlement, and shed crocodile tears over the suffering of soldiers who had been placed on the land with insufficient money to purchase stock, erect homes, and effect improvements. I agree that the returned soldiers were badly treated, and I thought that there was no possibility of the same sort of treatment being meted out to them again. I have always advocated that the Commonwealth Parliament should have ful l power to legislate in respect of matters associated with repatriation, including soldier land settlement. Recently, I heard the honourable member for Indi deliver an address over tbe air in which, as usual, he lined up with "" big business "" in opposing the grant to the Commonwealth of those powers which would have enabled it to help the returned soldiers. I am. glad that the soldiers themselves voted for the referendum proposals, but the honourable member and his party let the soldiers down, as they have done before. He knows that the Commonwealth has no power under the Constitution to acquire land for soldier settlement, or to control settlement schemes. Nevertheless, the honourable member, in one of his usual misleading and untruthful statements, posed as a champion of returned soldiers. I am one of those who suffered under the previous soldier settlement scheme, and I do not want a repetition of it. Probably members of the United Australia party are more honest in this regard than are members of the Australian Country",43,Frederick Stewart Men Were Being Dismissed From A Muni

The price of corrugated iron after the last war was £50 a ton, yet I was charged £410 for a three-roomed, unpainted house buil t with timber sawn out of the red gum that grew on the place. One of the greatest handicaps with which .returned soldiers had to contend after the last war was inflation of land values, but there is no hope that the State governments will do anything to control land values. The State governments are under the domination of, the Upper Houses of the State Parliaments, and the Upper Houses are the mouthpieces of vested interests. Nevertheless, the honourable member for In d i opposed the granting to the Commonwealth of powers which would enable it to control land values. The honourable member for In d i , with his usual carelessness of the the discussion on evidence it was pointed out. truth, even posed as a returned soldier settler. He is not a returned soldier, although I read in a newspaper the ofher day that he was one. What reliance can we place on the word of a man who makes statements like that? He was trying to gain kudos for himself, and there are probably thousands of people in Victoria now who believe that he is a returned soldier. I understand that he was in camp for a week or two before the armistice; yet I heard h i m say in a broadcast that he was a returned soldier. Mv. MOEWEN personal explanation. I made no such statement. I have listened in silence so far to the honourable member, but I am not prepared to be misrepresented. The honourable member has said that I am untruthful. That is objectionable to me, and I ask that the statement be withdrawn. He has also said that, he heard me say that I was a returned soldier. I said no such thing. The honourable member is not permitted to interrupt the speech of another honourable member in order to make a personal explanation. But as the honourable memexpression which was objectionable to the honourable member for In d i , I ask him to withdraw it . personal explanation MrM c LEOD O u t of deference to you, Mr Chairman, I withdraw the statement of which the honourable member complained. The honourable member for In d i sets himself up as a champion of the returned soldiers, but he is not, as a matter of fact, the champion of the soldiers or of any other section of the p r imary producers. In order to show what the returned soldiers really desire in the way of land settlement, I quote the following extract from the report of the Rural Reconstruction Commission:So-far as a'dministration is concerned, the intentions of the league were clear to the commission, i.e., that they desire complete Commonwealth control of returned soldier settlement. It is significant that similar representations were mode by the league in 1918 when discussions were taking place between the Commonwealth and States with regard to. soldier settlement after the 1914-18 war. In. to and admitted by the president of the league that the administrative design of the bill could not be implemented without constitutional amendment* under which the Commonwealth secured, for purposes of soldier settlement,., sufficient of the existing exclusive powers of the States in the control of land and land settlement. One of the vital provisions of the draft bill prepared by the Returned Sailors,. Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia was.Land settlement for returned soldiers is to. be entirely under the control of the Commonwealth, and tlie administration is to be vested in n Commonwealth Land Settlement CommisI desire to make a sion, subject to the control of a Commonwealth Minister.

That should not be allowed to happen again, but I havelittle hope that a similar situation can be avoided while soldier settlement remains under the control of. six State Parliaments. In particular, I fear that we shall once more have the experience of inflated land values, leading to overcapitalization and a heavy interestburden. I did my best to ensure that the Commonwealth would be granted power to take over soldier settlement.

188,Mr Mcleod.,"honourable member for Indi who opposed the referendum proposals. We all are looking forward, now to an early termination of hostilities in the European theatre of war, and we hope that peace in Europe will be followed shortly by peace in the Pacific. Therefore, we should now be making our preparations for the time when peace comes, and particularly making plans to provide employment for ex-servicemen. Other nations are preparing for an expansion of industry after the war in order to provide employment. We in Australia have been engaged largely upon primary production. We have produced at low cost commodities for export to other parts of the world, but I believe that a great deal of extra employment' could be provided in Australia by the proper development of, the wool industry. Hitherto, the wool has been shorn and baled with all its natural grease, and with burr, seed and other foreign matter adhering to it. Honourable members may be surprised to know that with every 1,000,000 lb. of wool which we export we send also 500,000 lb. of waste matter, most of it just dirt. That is a most uneconomical proceeding. I suggest that there should be a great postwar extension of our textile industry in Australia. It may be argued that we have not the experienced men for such a development, but neither did we have experienced men at the outbreak of war for the making of munitions and the building of aeroplanes. We trained the men we needed for those undertakings, and we can do the same in the textile industry. All wool should be at least scoured before export. I suggest that it should also be carbonized and spun into yarn. That would provide an enormous amount of employment. We should manufacture in Australia all the cloth we need for our own requirements. There is no reason why that could not be done because I have seen samples of Australian-made cloth that would sell in any part of the world against any competition. However, I do not suggest that we should weave all our wool into material. We know that Great Britain, which has been a large buyer of our wool in the past, will want to rehabilitate its textile industries after the war, and we can sell to Great Britain our wool made up into yarn or tops. Great Britain could buy from us yarn instead of greasy wool, thereby saving shipping space and freight with economic benefit to every one concerned, including the growers. A thorough investigation should be made of the great disparity between the price at which woollen cloth is sold by the manufacturer to the wholesalers and the price at which it is retailed to the public. A man engaged in the textile industry told me after the last war that a mill in which he worked sold cloth to warehouses in Flinders-lane at 4s. a yard and that, after having passed through the warehouses to the retail houses, the price of the cloth to the public was marked at 10s. a yard. In my opinion, there is no justification for that, because service commensurate with the increase could not possibly be given. It is necessary that the cost of woollen articles should be kept down to a level at which wool will be assured of being able to compete with synthetic fibre. T am not, however, afraid of that competition. I think that the possibilities of synthetic fibre being a serious rival with wool have been exaggerated as a part of a campaign to keep the price of wool very low. The manufacturers of synthetic fibre also have to contend with costs of production. The disparity between the two selling prices is one reason why I should like to see prices control continued for years after the war ends. A greater danger to the woollen industry than synthetic fibre is the development in this country of the manufacture of shoddy, in reference to which I shall read the following extract from the Weekly Times of the 10th May, 1944 :Explaining that shoddy was practically unknown in this country until aliens established mills about ten years ago, and made shoddy cloth to compete with the virgin wool production of older mills, Mr Comper declared that it was deluding the public and penalizing honest manufacturers. Describing shoddy as "" a menace to the health of the wearers"", Mr Comper said before the war his firm had tried out consignments of alleged woollen coatings manufactured by the type of mill indicated. They were made from reconditioned wool, polluted with extraneous matter of questionable character, and silk waste. In some pieces of material particles of elastic, obviously formerly portions of women's garments, had been found. This material smelt objectionably. When small cuttings were placed in water, a thick scum came to the surface and the dye came ->ut. After one or two such experiences they Iccided to cease to trade with these mills. Mr Comper then showed the Board a sample of what he called typical shoddy. This, he said, was being used in large quantities and was made in a mill in a Melbourne suburb by aliens. Coats manufactured from this shoddy were shabbly after two months' wear. "" Cani t be wondered if the public clamors for masquerade as typical Australian woollen?"" he said. "" What beats me is that Australian mills of integrity seem to have been flooded with government contracts, while these mills of alien ownership seem to have a free run."" Before the war investigations were made into the origin of this shoddy. It was found that waste merchants, calling themselves flock merchants, paid up to £12 a week for the privilege of sweeping the floors of clothing und such factories. They not only gathered up waste scraps of material, but also scraps of food, sawdust and d i rt of every description. four years are, I should say, yearning for All this stuff was carted to the flock merchant's warehouse and sorted in a casual way. Rats were everywhere and a foul smell pervaded the place. He had been informed that in one week 28 tons of this waste matter was supplied to one mill making shoddy, which was eventually foisted on to the public as the bona fide allwool product of Australian mills. It was obvious that the labelling of woollen goods was long overdue. If a trader sold margarine for butter he could be prosecuted for fraud, but if a trader sold something for virgin wool which was not virgin wool the public had no redress. I point out to members of the Australian Country party, especially the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott), that the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully) has asked the various State Governments to introduce legislation providing for the compulsory labelling of shoddy. But that will not prevent its manufacture and sale to the public in the guise of pure wool, because Victorian manufacturers will sell in New South Wales, and vice versa. Mr soldier. Comper laid the blame for the manufacture of shoddy on aliens, but I am not so sure that he is right, for shoddy has been made in Australia for a long time. The extent of its manufacture should be inquired into. companies which the Opposition represents. member for New England has never protested about it, notwithstanding that it is a greater menace to the prosperity of the woollen industry than is artificial fibre, because pure wool can compete against the artificial product which, in my opinion, is more a substitute for cotton than for wool. The Government should make every effort to obtain a continuance of the wool imported cloth when such cloths agreement for at least five years after the war ends. That would ensure against wool prices being depressed through the sudden release of stocks of wool held in Great Britain and America. Releases should be made progressively to meet demands. I anticipate a renewed demand for wool from the great woollen mills of ""France. I do not believe that they have been destroyed. The people of the cold European countries, after having had to wear ersatz clothing for about woollens. Those countries have always bought Australian wool. Expansion of the woollen industry and the textile industry is vital if we are to overcome the problem of how to employ our people after the war. The treatment of the wool from its virgin state through all stages must be undertaken in order that we may be able to export the finished product instead: of selling it in its raw state to Great Britain and our other customers. Thereby we shall be able to provide an enormous amount of employment. We have the asset, and it is our duty to use it. personal explanation.

T 1. congratulate Fadden) that he gave to his examination of the Government's financial proposals. His analysis of the budget was one of the clearest and best that I have ever heard in this chamber. One honourable member described' the budget as dull and unimaginative, yet this is the very time when those words should not be applicable to a statement of the Government's financial policy, though they are, I regret to say. After a seemingly endless night, men's eyes are now turned to tlie dawn that heralds an era of peace. We must endeavour to anticipate the problems of peace, which will be so quickly and intimately brought before the Parliaments of the world for debate and decision. To many people, this war has seemed endless. As the Nazi, terror spread, the lights of Europe went out one by one. Civilians, have been tortured by the Gestapo in. concentration camps, or were subjected to the horrors of the corpse factories, like the terrible depot at Lublin, in Poland. For five terrible [39] years, the Jewish race, which has suffered much throughout history, has endured untold horrors at the hands of the Nazis. Now, one by oue, the lights of Europe are being rekindled. Bulgaria, Bumania, and Finland, three of the Axis satellites, have left the Axis. The reason why liberty ami freedom, are being restored again in Europe is that the United Nations have had. supreme leadership from the men who have guided the destinies of the four principal powers in waging the battle for freedom. As a private member, I may hold n comparatively unimportant position in this House, but I believe that, we shouldi pay tribute to the two great bodies that have been most responsible for our successes in this war, namely, the leaders of the United Nations, and the infantrymen of those nations. The"" foot-sloggers"" are the unheralded heroes who have fought the good fight in this war. Their deeds have not been extolled in the press. The searchlight of publicity has not I hope that my fallen upon them. But they have won. the battles that have made possible the defeat of the Nazis. The success of. the United Nations would never have been possible if the "" foot-slogging "" infantry my leader ( Mr had not performed so nobly as they have upon. the deep thought done. The infantry at Blenheim, Raniillies, and Malpiaquet, made the reputation of the great Duke of Marlborough, and the fighting infantry of the United Nations, in the ice-bound wastes of Russia, in the heat of the desert of North Africa, an'd in the feverinfested jungles of New Guinea, have made secure in history the fame of Marlborough's great descendant. Winston Churchill. The first of the leaders of the United Nations to whom I pay tribute is the Prime Minister of Great Britain, Mr Churchill. He is the very embodiment of courage, unconquerable in defeat and supreme in victory. The President of the United States of America, Mr Franklin D. Roosevelt, is the leader of an ally which, was not a belligerent in 1939. Not until the Japanese attacked the American fleet at Pearl Harbour did the United States of America become involved. But long before Pearl Harbour the leadership of Mr Roosevelt made rhe Americans realize that their entry",47,Frederick Stewart Men Were Being Dismissed From A Muni

198,Mr Abbott (]S Ew England) [4.32].,"velt's policy enabled us to carry on the struggle as effectively as we did during those terrible months when the British Empire stood alone in the world against the onslaught of the Axis. By supplying the British Empire with arms and munitions, Mr Roosevelt gave us invaluable assistance in the struggle. He realized that if Germany conquered, freedom would perish. -Stalin, the leader of Soviet Russia, is a man of steel, as his name implies. Of indomitable spirit, he inspired his people to stop what many people believed to be an irresistible force, when the Nazi hordes were racing across the plains of the Ukraine. Then he smashed the forces of Germany on the spearhead of Stalingrad. That was the turning point in this war. After that. German defeat, the crescendo of music in the world's orchestra rose to the present pitch, and the first notes of Germany's funeral march are now being played by the Allied Annies in Western Europe and by the Russians in Poland. General Chiang Kai-shek has kept the spirit of resistance burning in his tortured country since 1937. For years his armies have been ill-equipped to stem the powerf ul, well-armed aggressor. The Japanese have committed against the Chinese dreadful atrocities, but Chiang Kai-shek with supreme courage, has carried on the battle. member pay a tribute to our own Prime Minister? has not become a (battlefield, and our cities have not been subjected to country missed the fate of Europe by the narrowest margin. I recollect one afternoon in this House in 1942 when the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) announced that the battle of the Coral Sea was in progress. When the history of this war is written, that engagement will probably be described as one of the decisive battles of the Pacific. It decided the fate of Australia. Between this country and the most savage and barbaric enemy that any nation has ever fought there were only the thin plates of the warships in the Coral Sea and what Tennyson described as "" the nation's airy navies grappling in the central blue"". On sea and air power was the resistance of Australia, -based. When I was referring to the great leaders of the United Nations the honourable member for Reid asked me what I had to say about the Prime Minister of Australia. Honourable members know that the Prime Minister and I do not agree on many subjects, and I am not afraid to speak my mind to him, and he is not afraid to speak his mind to me. But I would say that the verdict of, history will be that the Prime Minister in those dark days and hours did not fail his country. The budget lacks realism, and does not plan that, edifice which must be built for the destinies of Australia, and also of the world, insofar as we may be able to assist. Recently a conference was held at Dumbarton Oaks in the United States of America to consider proposals for setting up an organization to ensure the future preservation of peace iu the worldI know that the Commonwealth Government has done everything in its power to implement the Atlantic Charter and the Mutual Aid agreement, and that it was represented at this conference. One part of the Prime Minister's speech which impressed me was his emphasis that the destiny of Australia lay within the ambit, of the British Empire. We realize the impracticability of any other thesis. We do not believe that 7,000,000 people would have any voice in the world's affairs, or would be able to do anything towards shaping those affairs. As a unit of the British Empire, Australia can have a big say in the formulation of Empire policy. I believe that this country must abandon all isolationist, tendencies and terrible bombing attacks, this seek its development within the framework of the British Empire. Our leaders should do what, they can to influence Empire policy in directions that will benefit the Commonwealth. I desire to read to the House extracts from what, is probably one of the most prophetic poems ever written, Tennyson's ],ochsley Hall, which was penned in 1842, more than 100 years ago.

But if all the sneerers and jeerers throughout, the world, continue to see only the dirty little spot of light that is thrown on the floor and can never look to the stars, our future will be poor indeed. Of course I am an optimist. I believe in humanity. The reports, that have come front the Dumbarton Oaks conference give us some hope that, we may look for the establishment of a world organization that will give us prospects of security beyond any liver promised by the League of Nations. The conference has recommended to the governments of the three powers represented that a council shall lie formed of four permanent members representing Great Britain, America, Bussia and China, and representatives of six or seven other powers to be elected periodically, and ihnt (here shall also be an assembly consisting of representatives of the Allied Nations. Almost immediately the conference met. a di vision of opinion became apparent concerning sanctions and the military forces necessary for their enforcement. The question was whether this ''Parliament of man"" should be responsible and maintenance of an international police force or whether each constituent member should maintain its own navy, army and air force. It is to the credit of the Soviet Ihat its representatives strongly -advocated tbe formation of an international air force. I do not believe that there will be any security for mankind unless an international navy, army and air force can be established. Eor want of a better name i would describe that organization as an international police force. So long as the different nations compete among themselves in the development of armaments, what has been called "" the bloody traffic in arms"" will continue as it existed for many years prior to the outbreak of this war. The Commonwealth Government should do everything possible, through whatever channels it can express its views, to stress in these international organizations the importance of establishing an international police force. is going "" red "". colour I go so long as I can do something to prevent tie red blood of the people from being shed on the battlefields of the world every 25 years or so. It may be expressing only a pious hope to say that I look forward to the day, whether it be near or distant, when an international police force will operate to preserve the peace of the world. In the meantime, there is an urgent necessity that steps be taken to standardize armaments. One of the great curses that we had to contend with at the beginning of this war was the variation in the calibre of weapons for sea, land or air fighting in the different countries. Prance had adopted standards different from those of either America or Great Britain, and, of course, the calibres of British and American weapons also varied. Steps should be taken to ensure as high a degree of uniformity as possible in connection with any munitions programme that may be developed by the United Nations. A grave defect of the budget speech was the omission of any reference to the future for the organizing of Australia's export industries.

205,Mr Abbott,"I do not mind whatimmediately the war ends. Recently, Dr. J. P. Belshaw, lecturer in economics and history at the New England University College, Armidale, published a. small book entitled The Future of the AustraUan Fix-port Industries, a study of which I recommend to every honourable member, and, in 'fact, to the whole community. Tlie writer states that the outlook for our export industries is not happy, and that we cannot, assume that, conditions in the future will be similar to those, which existed before the war. In the early part of his book he states that the export industries of this country have always had an enormous influence upon its prosperity. I do not think that that statement will be assailed. Any person who followed the course of events in Australia during the depression will agree that a healthy export trade is essential to our prosperity. The first people in this country who felt the heavy impact of the depression of a little more than a decade ago, were the primary producers, for. almost within a calendar year, the overseas prices of their products fell by 50 per cent. Consequently there was a serious contraction of. the buying of secondary products by people engaged in primary industries. The result was reflected at once throughout the whole economy of the nation. The writer then went on. to stress the dependence of our export industries on purchases from Great Britain. In this connection he referred to three factors of outstanding importance which made the British market one capable of such large imports. was population. tlie population of England and ""Wales had increased from 8,900,000 in 1801 to nearly 41,000,000 in 1931. During that period the teachings of the Manchester school influenced liberalism in British polities to a remarkable degree and led to the adoption of the British policy of cheap food. This brought about increased importation of cheap foodstuffs snd the consequent establishment of overseas markets for British manufactured goods. The writer also pointed out that British imports were valued annually at between £300,000,000 and £400,000,000 more than British exports. This amount, has been called ""the invisible imports of Mr Abbott. Britain"" and is made up as follows:Returns from shipping of foreign goods, about £300,000,000; insurance, £80,000,000; and overseas investments, £4,000,000,000, resulting in an increase to Britain of £200,000,000 per annum. British markets, he pointed out, played a predominant part in the trade of Australia. To-day, the population of Great Britain is not increasing; it is actually falling. It is estimated that by 1995, about half, a century hence, the population will have declined by 11,000,000 people. The second point made by Dr. Belshaw has relation to British agricultural policy. There is little doubt that a strong endeavour will be made in the future to maintain rural production in Great Britain at a high figure, which is at, present, two-thirds of the nation's requirements compared with one-third before the war. I recommend any honourable member who is interested in this subject to read also the report on agriculture issued by a committee of the House of Lords, which included the Labour Peers, as well as Conservatives and Liberals. A study of that document will indicate very clearly to honourable members that the dawn of the coming day so far as Australian export industries are concerned, will not be exactly without, clouds. The third point made by Dr. Belshaw is that after the war it will be found that the British overseas investment income will have dropped from £200,000,000 to £100,000,000 because Great Britain had The first sacrificed its overseas investments in He pointed out, that order to buy munitions of war with which to destroy the Nazi tyranny. Another point to which we should give consideration is the food position that is likely to exist in European countries after the war. ""We have been led to expect that very large quantities of Australian foodstuffs and raw materials will be required in Europe after the war. the Australian end ? presently. I believe that it will be found that, the position in Europe will be very different from what we were led, only a few months ago, to expect. Reports have come to hand lately which indicate clearly that the food shortages",50,Frederick Stewart Men Were Being Dismissed From A Muni
206,Dr. Gaha,"""What is the position at",51,Frederick Stewart Men Were Being Dismissed From A Muni
207,Mr Abbott,"I shall come to that in Europe are not so serious as they were thought to be. In faot, in some parts there seems to be little shortage. The two countries which are in a bad state are Poland and Greece. The position in .Normandy at the time of the Allied landings was not bad, and we have been informed that if there is any shortage of foodstuffs in Paris it is due to maldistribution. The live-stock position is also worthy of our close attention. Mr Youdale, London manager of the overseas farmers' co-operative organization, who was in Australia, recently, told us that there would be considerable shortages, but later information has indicated that the shortages will not be so serious as was at first anticipated. Figures published in tlie Swiss Neue Zurich Zeitnng, in May, 1944, concerning the sheep population of Europe, stated flint although Hitler had planned for the sheep population in German-controlled countries and neutral countries in Europe to be increased to 130,000,000 head, the figure that had been achieved was ""100,000,000. When one considers that the sheep population, of 100,000,000 in Europe, plus those in Great Britain, exceeds that of Australia, producers in this country must feel disturbed. Then there are the live-stock numbers in the dairying countries. It is believed that the pig population of Denmark is now greater than when the Germans entered that country; and probably the dairy herds have not declined to anything like the degree that was expected. Let us look at the wheat position. The number -of tractors in Great Britain has increased from 40,000 before the war to approximately 150,000; and that greatest of all granaries, the Ukraine, has been mechanized to a remarkable degree. But there is no occasion to despair or to consider that the position will be irretrievable if a wise and strong government be ready to .take the initiative, and act quickly. Obviously, we have to change from old to new markets. The greatest market in any country is the home market. I shall, therefore, have much pleasure in supporting any move by the Government, or from elsewhere, which will bring migrants to this country who will help to develop it and increase the consumption locally of the products that we grow. Many Australian minds are disturbed by the uncertainty whether or not there is a genuine desire on the part, of -<iine persons to maintain what I regard as the foundation on which the security, strength, and development of Australia must be established. I refer to the White Australia policy. The history of nations throughout the world proves that the mingling of the bloods of people of different colours is not conducive to happiness or development. When the Portuguese first went to the East Indies, they mixed freely with tlie natives, with whom they intermarried and interbred. This was the beginning of the disintegration of the Portuguese as a nation. In ancient dimes. Borne was sapped and finally defeated because of tlie intrusion of black people from Africa. The same result followed the invasion of Spain by the Moors. The intrusions that have been made by coloured races in the Mediterranean area have resulted in a lowering of the standards of the people in that basin. Therefore, there should be an unequivocal statement not only from every member opposite, but also from the Government itself, of their and its intention to stand firmly and strongly for the maintenance of the White Australia policy. But there have been signs of weakening and the abandonment of that policy is implied not only in the views that have been expressed by the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James), in this House, but also in. statements made in other responsible quarters of the Labour movement. It. was very disturbing to read that, the leader of the Labour party in South Australia, Mr Richards, had made this statement on the 5 th January, 1944In his opinion, he said, Britain could not send migrants. The war had drawn off the flower of the manhood of most nations, hut particularly of Britain. If Britain were to retain a place and prestige which would justify her being a force in European and international affairs generally, she would have to build up a solid defence involving the maintenance of a vigorous, useful population. Vital statistics showed that Britain, if she had not already done so. was fast becoming a nation of'aged people. -Australia had to decide first whether migrants were to come from within the British Empire, and, if so, from which dominion or colony. Surely, said Mr Richards, there was oue definite pointer. If people were to address be able to control my remarks in order to save the question to the newly-appointed Governor of Bengal, Mr Casey, he would probably inform them of the probabilities associated with the problem. Mr Richards emphasized that he was not propounding Labour policy, but directing attention to a problem that the Australian people and government would have to face. He is not entitled to speak with one voice as a private citizen and with another voice as the leader of the Labqur party and, at the time, a prospective Premier, of South Australia. He continuedThe problem raised the question: Would the British Commonwealth agree that any dominion should rest content with a standard of living and mi adequate defence system while other dominions had teeming millions of starving citizens who were ready and eager to populate and defend it? He there stated concisely the position in relation to the migration to this country of citizens of India. I do not believe that the people of Australia consider that coloured people are their inferiors: our sole desire is to keep this nation white and to preserve the internal economic conditions of tlie Commonwealth. Australia would be swamped by a coloured stream if migrants were allowed to come here from any portion of the globe, and we should have a more acute racial problem than has been caused iu similar circumstances in any other country. My next quotation is from a speech which the honourable member for Hunter made in this House last July. In January, 1944, Mr Richards, the leader of the Labour party in South Australia, merely suggested that the members of one coloured race, namely the brown people of India, should come to this country. On the 19th July, 1944. .however, the honourable member for Hunter went a long way farther than that, for he suggested that all the colours of the racial spectrum .should be brought to t.hi3 country. (-orrcct. ber is reported to have said this1 am forced now, however, to make some vi'innrksi which may be severely criticized because of their possible effect upon the White Australia policy which I always advocated. I. fear that I shall never make a shrewd and cunning politician, who can say what he does not think. I say what I think, although some people have told me that I do not often think. I am quite sure that I shall never myself from unpleasant political repercussions. I have always said what I think, and I shall continue to do so. I believe that when I owe n debt X ought to pay it. When people do me a good turn I consider that I ought to do them a service in return. In connection with the problem that is in my mind now it may be said, "" You accepted black, brown, yellow, and brindle races into Australia when it was necessary to defend this country, yet you say now that because of the White Australia policy such people cannot remain here and live with you. They may shed their blood for you, but they may not live with you"". I. feel rather inclined to reject the idea of any people of a different colour coming to defend me, unless I am prepared to say afterwards. -' Welcome, brothers "". We have to ask ourselves some questions about our White Australia policy. The expression of such sentiments is very disturbing indeed. The opinions that are held by the honourable member carry great wejight in the councils of the Government. He is liaison officer between it and the coal-miners, and his voice has often been heard loudly and long in political debates. The time is ripe for the Government to define its attitude towards the ""White Australia policy. It is all very well to say that we should allow any one to enter this country-brown , black, brindle, yellow, piebald, skewbald, half caste, quadroon, or octoroon. That is not the question. Such people came to our aid, just as white people went to the aid of the people of Java. The question is a national and an economic one, namely, whether Australia is to he preserved to the white race or is to be converted ""into a coloured continent. We have to be sure that the Government will protect the l rights of the Australian people, and will not depart one iota fro m the White .Australia policy. It may have pressure put upon it ; it must resist that pressure for the White Australia principle is the rock on which the nation .stands or falls. In TheM y t h of the Open Spaces, W. D . Forsyth has made an extremely able study of the trends of world population and migration. His work contains some very interesting information .as to the trends of population shifts today, compared w i th those of a few years ago. He has shown how the sources of migration from the old world have dried up during the last 100 years, and how new sources have been tapped. He",51,Frederick Stewart Men Were Being Dismissed From A Muni

209,Mr Abbott,"The honourable memhas pointed out that whereas during last century migrants came to new areas in the main from northern and western Europe and the British Isles, to-day the countries in which, migrants would have to he sought arc, principally, the Netherlands, Eire, Italy, Poland, Greece, Spain, Portugal, Bulgaria and the Ukraine. These, according to him, are the countries in which the net reproductive rate stood above unity. In the other countries, it stood either at or below unity, which means that the population is rapidly passing into the older age groups, whilst the young, fertile groups are not being produced in. the necessary ratio to maintain an adequate population. Although Forsyth, would, not entirely rule out the possibility of obtaining migrants from the countries of north and north-west Europe, in his opinion it is most improbable that many of them would be attracted. One other kind of migrant has been the United States and other countries. mentioned in this chamber, namely, the In particular, we should endeavour orphans and waifsof Europe and the to develop markets in the East.

Neither must we order to create a. market for its kerodo as Mr P. J. Clarey, of the Aussene. tralasian Council of .Trade Unions did, when lie was in the United States recently. He declared that Australia could support a. population of 130,000,000 people, a statement which is palpably absurd. When people occupying representative positions in Australia visit overseas countries, they should weight carefully their utterances. The Government should set up an authority to study migration. It should arrange to bring here European migrants free of charge, and should see that they get jobs. It should also ensure, of course, that outown people are in f u l l employment. That, is already the policy of the Government, as it is of the Opposition parties. Only by increasing the population can we enlarge our home market. We must also extend our existing overseas markets, and establish new ones. This requires planning, and effective overseas publicity of the kind employed by Before the Prime The Irade statistics of India make sorry Although the The Government could appropriation for the Department of We have a good been invented, and kerosene was a large outlet for petroleum. The Standard Oil Company flooded China, with hundreds of thousands of small lamps I suggest that we in Australia should consider manufacturing spinning machines and looms for the people of China so that they might manufacture cloth from good Australian wool at a reasonable price. I was surprised to hear tlie honourable member for Wannon( Mr is reduced it will cause chaos in our McLeod) say that he was not afraid of the competition of the staple fibre and rayon industries. If the honourable member were to look up the figures he would see that tbe pre-war cost of staple fibre was lOd. per lb., which corresponds to a price of 3d. per lb. for greasy wool. If he believes that Australian wool growers can carry on at that price he is a super-optimist. The journal of the Australian Institute of Agricultural Services for June, 1944, quotes from the evidence given before the Rural Industries Committee to show the cost of wool during various stages of manufacture. It gives the price of scoured wool at 2s. 6d. per lb., other prices being, tops 2s. l i d . , yarn 5s., and cloth Ss. 4d. Then there is a jump from 8s. 4d. to 21s. 4d. for the wholesale price, whilst the retail price is 30s. I suggest that the Government's economic adviser to the Prime Minister, and author of the Premiers plan, Professor 'Copland, ought to use some of his spare time, which he now devotes to investigating the price of furniture for dolls' houses, to finding out why there is a difference of 250 per cent, between the cost of manufacturing cloth and the price charged to wholesalers. When we know that such enormous combines as Courtaulds Limited and Dupont Nemours Limited are about to commence operations in Australia, the public will realize that we need only the I.G. Farbenindustrie of Germany in order to have established here the whole international cartel of staple fibre and artificial cloth manufacturers, one of the greatest combines in the world. Recently, a monetary and financial conference was held at Bretton Woods in the United States of America which discussed, among other things, the international rate of exchange between various countries, including Australia, Great Britain and the United States of America. Under the terms of the agreement, the voting power lies with the United States of America, Great Britain and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Those countries can fix any rate Mr Abbott. of exchange and bring about a revaluation of world currency. I point out that if the exchange rate between the Australian pound and the pound sterling primary industries, and will seriously affect our secondary and tertiary industries as well. I realize that Australia cannot remain in a state of economic quarantine, or it would have to resort to a system of barter for its overseas trade, but I draw the attention of the Treasurer to some points of the agreement which are of particular importance to primary producers. To illustrate my argument, I point out the enormous price fluctuations that have taken place over the years in the price of wool tops. For sixty-fours, prices have been as follows:I'rici; in V,..,,. nenc.! per Hi. of tops. 1 lis! I 54 1922 64. 1024 .. 81. I »2(i 51 1 !)2!l .. .. 4.7 103.1 .. 24 As the Treasurer knows, when prices drop so much as has sometimes happened in the past, we are faced with ithe depletion of our London funds and the impossibility of paying for our imports. According to the report prepared by Professor Melville, the monetary conference reached the following agreement, regarding exchange:A member imiy buy foreign currencies from tlie fund until the fund's holding of its currency equals twice its quota, subject to the limitation that the member may not use more than 25 per cent, of its quota in any one year. Australia's quota is £63,000,000, with a right to draw £A15,600,000 each year. If we are not to be allowed to bolster up our London funds by more than £A15,600,000 in any one year, and the exchange rate may not be varied, by more than 10 per cent., we may find ourselves in such a position that we shall have to get out of the agreement and resort to a system of barter, or have prices and wages within Australia determined by an external body. be built up by other means. mary products slump on the world",53,Frederick Stewart Men Were Being Dismissed From A Muni

211,Mr Abbott,"If the prices of primarkets, tbe capacity does not exist to build up external funds except by external loans, and, in the event of a slump, the money market would be tied up. [Further extension of time granted.] In paragraph 19 of his report, Professor Melville saysWe could vary our exchange rate, without the approval of the fund, provided that the 'change, together with all previous changes, whether increases or decreases, did not exceed 10 per cent, of the initial par value. That is another rigid restriction. Then in paragraph 21, he statesI t is true that, if the fund considered that the change in our exchange rate was not justified, it would, after the expiration of a reasonable period, have power to expel us from the fund. That is a most drastic provision. In paragraph 25 he statesNevertheless, for this reason, the purposes of the fund to which we must conform in order to safeguard our right to make full use of our quota are not altogether satisfactory. I impress upon the Government that its own representative considers that the purposes of the fund are not satisfactory. In paragraph 44 he statesThe degree of flexibility proposed for exchange rates is as favorable as could reasonably be expected. The Treasurer and I , who shared the honour of being members of the Royal Commission on the Monetary and Banking Systems, found that when it was attempted to p in the Australian exchange rate to gold, the exchange rate on the black market was 133 per cent. The whole Australian economy in 1929 revolved around the price of 15-Jd. per lb. for wool. Later, when we felt the f u l l impact of tbe depression, on the basis of 15£d., the exchange rate should have been 130 per cent. given to that commission at that time, the black market rate was 133 per cent. SoI believe that every possible effort should be made by the Government to ensure that more flexibility than is envisaged shall be given to Australia and other great primary-producing countries. nope that later the Treasurer w ill bring down a more colourful supplementary budget in which he w ill set out the Government's intentions in respect of our exporting industries, immigration, and the preservation of a ""White Australia. [401 I congratulate the Leader of. the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) on his having had the grace to pay a generous tribute to the Prime Minister( MrC u r t in ) . Now that the referendum is over we are hearing some truths from the Opposition. The right honourable gentleman also complimented the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) upon the budget. I think he said that he had almost felt impelled to kiss the Treasurer for bringing down such a nice budget. That makes me suspect that the budget may not be popular with some members of the rank and file of the Labour party outside this chamber. I congratulate the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott) on the common sense he displayed in his speech, because he spoke on a number of matters on which I had resolved to speak. I agree with h i m that there is no room for isolationism in Australia's policy. Isolation is dead as f a r as Australia is concerned. It is a long time since I have heard such conciliatory speeches as have marked this debate. That may lead some people to conclude that we are inclined to move to the right and the Opposition to the left. It is remarkable that the honourable member for New England saw fit to lecture Government supporters on the White Australia policy, because, but for the efforts of the Labour party over the years, I very much doubt whether we should have had a White Australia to-day. Reverting to the t r i butes paid to the Prime Minister, I think that this is as good an occasion as any to declare that Australia was fortunate in finding a man of the quality and qualifications of the Right Honourable John Curtin to lead the Commonwealth According to evidence through this war. The worse thing that honourable gentlemen opposite could say about the budget speech was that it lacked imagination. No doubt it did. Men seem to lose their imaginative powers when elevated to the treasurership. But the budget provides I us with the opportunity to talk about everything under the sun and ample scope to exercise our own imaginations. I should serve no good purpose by reiterating arguments that have been repeated over and over again in this debate. This Government has done such a great job",55,Frederick Stewart Men Were Being Dismissed From A Muni
212,Mr Williams (Robertson) [5.34],"in this war that eulogies from me would be superfluous. We haveheard in this debate from economists, sound and unsound, about the need to sustain prices and to find markets for our primary products. Much of what has been said is speculation Whether we like it or not, a great many matters affecting this country will be determined for us by the people of other countries. It is good to let the public know that we are cognizant of our disadvantages as well as advantages. I cannot see how we can do very much at all unless we can increase our population by at least another 3,000,000 or 4,000,000. We have not enough people to develop this country properly. I have always been puzzled that so often so much poverty should exist in the midst of so much wealth, developed and undeveloped. When we have brought this war to a triumphant be important that we should induce to. come to Australia thousands of migrants. We shall have to expend a great deal of money on doing so, but I can think of no better way of expending public money than on the development of an immigration policy. Our policy in that respect should be overhauled. I favour the appointment of a director of immigration at a salary of not less than £5,000 a year. We all agree that this country must be kept white. We should, therefore, make every newcomer so welcome that he will remain here instead of returning to his homeland after two or three months of discontent. Hitherto we have approached the matter of immigration wrongly. The trade unions, unfortunately, took the stand that bringing people into this country would cause unemployment and reduce wages. Although that view was wrong, the unions had good reason to hold it, because when immigrants were coming here in large numbers many Australians were unemployed, and sons of farmers were not able to obtain farms for themselves. Immigrants took the jobs and farmlands that were the just due of the Australian-born. Ill feeling and discontent were bred and the whole scheme of immigration failed. The trade unions would now admit that they were short sighted, because the more people we have in the country the greater will be the development, with more jobs and in^ Mr Williams. creased consumption of all kinds of goods. We must make this country attractive to migrants. Once we start asoundly organized system of ..immigration the stream will develop into a flood if we treat the immigrants well, as they ought and wishful thinking. to be treated. Australia is the greatest undeveloped country in the world, and other parts of the world will no doubt closely watch its future growth. Of course, it is relatively easj to bring migrants here; the greater difficulty is in providing jobs for them or getting them properly settled. I am very happy that during this war we have made such close and friendly contacts with .our eousins across the Pacific, the men and women of the United States of America. I look forward to the settlement in Australia of many Americans.' A close it will great bond of friendship has been forged between the two nations. Many of the Americans here now will, no doubt, return to Australia after they have been demobilized. We have been well advertised during this war, and I think that we have learned a great deai from our visitors. I hope that' we shall not forget the lessons that we have learned in observing the Americans' direct ways of getting things done. Undoubtedly, migration, in the past was badly handled. In 1933, the Development and Migration Commission was in existence, and the Parliament of the Commonwealth passed legislation to compensate migrants who had been brought to Australia under false pretences. Honourable members find difficulty now in imagining that a Commonwealth Government actually resorted to such measures in order to induce people from Great Britain to come -here. The unfortunate migrants were told that if they came to Australia they could make a living from areas costing no more than £1,000 to £1,500. This unfortunate legion found in, Australia nothing but disillusionment and despair. That dreadful condition of affairs should not be permitted to Occur again. Australia received from the episode such a bad advertisement that the expenditure of £1,000,000 now to boost the attractions of this country would be hardly sufficient to repair the damage. People in Great Britain still remember the incident, and ""will not readily forget a week experiences dire poverty. The it. Any immigration policy must be based on good faith by the Government towards the immigrant. A vigorous and generous policy of land settlement is more urgent to-day than ever before. Bringing migrants to Australia is useless unless we are able to settle them on the land or find them suitable jobs. There; is no use bringing new people to Australia if they are going to enter into competition with Australians for jobs and farms. Therefore, Australia must be developed concurrently with the introsocial benefit schemes until it makes a duction of migrants. Many persons left employment and good homes in England; for the purpose of settling on the land in Australia, and they were bitterly disreceive at least £2 a week. If the Comillusioned. In future we must advertise Australia faithfully, and produce ""the goods Water conservation goes hand in hand with land settlement. Great projects such as the Hunter water conservation and irrigation scheme should be commenced as soon as possible. In the bulldozer Australia has found, a new friend. If the machinery used by the Allied Works Council is applied to the damming of rivers, remarkable achievements will be possible. I understand that the Government of New South Wales has given to the Hunter water conservation scheme a high priority in its programme of post-war works. People should be encouraged to settle on the land> and conditions should be made attractive for them. The best method of making life attractive in the rural areas is to provide water, electric power and light. The future, prosperity of our country depends upon water conservation. We are living in exciting and inspiring times. received a great advertisement from the war, and a bright future lies before us. I take the most optimistic view of it. We have the country and the assets. A vigorous and progressive policy by the Commonwealth Government will bring the world to our door. One omission from the budget has caused me great disappointment. No provision has been made to increase invalid and old-age pensions. This omission is a matter that the Government may find difficulty in explaining. A person who is required to exist on 27s. condition of those old people is something about which we cannot speak with pride. We should lose no time in increasing the pension. There is a lot of money in the country. Enormous sums of money have been raised by taxation, and great fortunes are being made on the black market, but these helpless people have been deserted and forgotten. The invalid and old-age pensioners of Australia have been "" by-passed "". The Government should not proceed further with success of the original scheme, namely, tlie old-age pension. I consider that invalid and old-age pensioners should monwealth Government is unable to finance that increase, the free hospital and medicine scheme should be deferred. It is better to do one thing well than to do half a dozen things indifferently. Old people and invalids should receive sufficient money to enable them to live in dignity and comfort. The purpose of granting a pension is to provide them with a reasonable sum with which to maintain themselves. The war in Europe appears to be moving to a close, and I express the hope that, when Germany capitulates, the Australian people will receive the news with quiet satisfaction and restraint. Some people are preparing to "" paint the town red"" when the news of Germany's surrender is received, but we should remember, and the Government should ask the people to remember, that there will be no holiday for Australian troops. For many of them, the real fighting will be only commencing. Our thoughts should be with our fighting men and their Australia has already relatives, and we should be fired with determination to remove the yellow peril from our front door. Although victory over Germany will give us a great deal of satisfaction, it will not mean the end of the war-time restrictions. If Germany happens to surrender shortly, the Second Victory Loan, which will open on the 26th September next, will no doubt be quickly oversubscribed as a thanksgiving for victory. I congratulate the Government on its intention to grant a gratuity to members of the fighting services. The men who have fought to save this country from the invader should he given every consideration. If it had not been for the valour of our soldiers and our gallant Allies, the Japanese would have taken possession of this country. The Government should do everything in its power for the men who have fought in this war, because nothing w ill be too good for. them. Men who have fought to save this country deserve the best that Australia can give to them. Sitting suspended from 5.54 to 8 p.m. A t the outset of a budget address in time of war, it is fitting that one should express appreciation of the efforts of members of our fighting forces. I do that unhesitatingly, giving f u l l credit to all branches of the services. I add also a word of appreciation .of our primary producers, who have stuck loyally to their task, and, in fact, of all classes of workers who have not failed their country in its time of need. I have in mind particularly, people stationed in the back-blocks of this country, where they cannot enjoy the amenities of life, and are more or less imprisoned by their isolation. have not failed to play their part in support of our fighting forces. I regard the budget not as one that should .be eulogized, but rather as one of sheer necessity, providing for maximum taxation and a f u l l war effort. However, it is unsatisfactory to a degree, because it does not deal adequately with planning for future works, and for the problems of the immediate post-war period. refer specifically to the rehabilitation of our ex-servicemen. One matter to which I shall refer may be regarded as a minor detail, but nevertheless it is an anomaly. I have before me the papers of a case in which an employer included in his tax return the sum of f l a week in respect of each of two employees whom he boarded while they were in his employ. The Commissioner of Taxation, however, allowed only 15s. in respect of each employee. The same two employees, in their taxation returns, stated the value of their board as £1 a week, but the Commissioner of Taxation altered these figures to 25s. Apparently the Commissioner wants to have it both ways, and I submit that he cannot do so. If in the case of the employees board is regarded as being worth 25s., it should be given the same value in assessing the employer. That is a glaring anomaly which should be corrected. I am opposed to deferred maintenance payments being allowed as a taxation deduction only if they are deposited with the Treasury. That, in my opinion, is a forced loan without interest, and, in the case of most primary producers, w ill be merely an addition to their bank mortgage upon which they are paying current rates of interest. It is unfair to expect individuals to add to their financial burdens, merely because they claim what is justly due to them in the form of deferred maintenance payments. I remind honourable memlbers that local governing authorities are permitted to set aside reserves at fixed deposit interest rates. Many speakers in this debate have claimed that invalid and old-age pensions are not high enough. If so, we should apply the biblical saying, "" Now is the day of salvation "", and the wrong should These worthy individuals be righted now. Why seek political kudos by expressing sympathy with the pensioners and agreeing that their' payment is insufficient whilst making no effort to rectify the anomaly? If honourable members opposite are sincere in their professed sympathy with the pensioners, I shall support any move that they may make to secure an increased payment. There is one provision relating to I pensions which I contend should be relaxed. I refer to the l i m it placed upon the income which a pensioner may earn without suffering a reduction of his pension. A t present, a pensioner is permitted to earn only £32 10s. a year without having his pension reduced. That is far too little. The hardship is greatest on a bread-winner who is unable to work. Either he and his wife have to live on 27s. a week or his wife must augment that income by working, which she usually does. However, once she has earned £32 10s. in a single year, the pension payable to her husband becomes subject to reduction. That is an unfair provision.",56,Frederick Stewart Men Were Being Dismissed From A Muni
213,Mr Adermann (Maranoa) [8.0],"man is wrong in his facts. is an anomaly in a case at Kingaroy, which has been brought to my notice. I contend that both husband and wife should be allowed to earn £52 a year each, or a total of £104, before the pension becomes subject to reduction. That would enable these unfortunate people to enjoy a reasonable standard of living. It often happens that pensioners suffer illness in the eventide of their life, and, being unable to look after themselves, they are looked after by friends, relatives, or some other Good Samaritans. In many such cases, because the people looking after the pensioners do not seek payment for their hospitality, the pensioners are regarded as being in receipt of an income of £1 a week each, and their pensions are reduced accordingly. These are anomalies which must be remedied if there be any sincerity in the sympathetic professions of honourable members opposite. I come now to the matter of decentralization, and in that regard there is an interesting exhibit in the King's Hall of this building. That. exhibit shows 69 instances of decentralization in Australia. A Queensland newspaper last week reported for having said that Queenslanders were "" moaners "". This time they certainly have something to ""moan"" about, and I am sure that you, Mr Chairman, will agree with me in that regard, because of the 69 instances of decentralization set out in the exhibit to which I have referred, only two are in Queensland. Unfortunately, there is a tendency to establish new undertakings in the more densely populated parts of this continent. I am afraid that the Queensland Government is somewhat negligent in that regard, unless I am assuming unfairly that the policy of that Government was voiced recently by the head of a State department. In August of this year, a conference was held of representatives of local governing authorities in the south-western area of Queensland-a n area about twice as big as Victoria. The local governing bodies paid the expenses of their delegates to the conference, which was held in Brisbane, to discuss water conservation and the building up of secondary industries in that area. They asked the chairman of the Irrigation Commission of Queensland to be present and his reply was, "" No good purpose could be served by my discussing it with you at this stage "". That is an outrageous statement, and I trust that it does not represent the attitude of the Queensland Government. I do not think that that administration would be so neglectful of this all-important subject. However, I cite that case in support of my complaint that the budget does not plan adequately for future industrial development. Water conservation is the basis and the foundation of all industries, and if the fertile areas of Queensland are not to be used for land settlement schemes, I have yet to learn how the Commonwealth proposes to settle thousands and thousands of discharged servicemen on the land after the war. The other States of the Commonwealth, have not the huge areas of fertile land that are to be found in Queensland. I heard one member of the Government suggest that the land around Canberra should be cut up for this purpose, but I emphasize that in Queensland there are many millions of acres of undeveloped, fertile the Minister country. Leases are expiring from time the Army( Mr Eorde) as to time, and it would be an easy matter for the Government of Queensland to retain some of this land for the settlement of ex-servicemen. It is important, however, that provision be made for an adequate living area. Funds must be made available now so that the planning of land settlement schemes may be commenced immediately the war ends. The rural credits department of the Commonwealth Bank has rendered valuable assistance to primary industries, and I see no reason why its scope should not be extended to the provision of funds for the creation and development of secondary industries. I do not think that this could be done under its present charter. I trust that the Government will consider my suggestion seriously. However, I submit that national works such as water conservation schemes are the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government, in conjunction with the State governments, I urge that the",59,Frederick Stewart Men Were Being Dismissed From A Muni
214,Mr Barnard,-The honourable gentle,60,Frederick Stewart Men Were Being Dismissed From A Muni
215,Mr Adermann,"There certainlymost economical method of undertaking these projects is by utilizing the local government authorities. I do not contend that the Allied Works Council could not be used for this purpose, but the personnel of that organization is decreasing rapidly. The cost of national works must be the responsibility, not of the individual taxpayer, but of the Commonwealth The Minister for the Army stated a few days ago that 4,000 men were to be released from the Army for dairying purposes, from operational units if necessary. According to the Sydney press of two days ago, Mr Bellemore had announced that 3,000 of the first 20,000 to be released from the Army and the Air Force were to go to dairymen in New South Wales, and 4,000 were to go to other industries. It looks as though that great capitalistic State has again obtained first preference. It is only the third largest of the dairy-producing States. On the basis of its allocation, Victoria should get 4,500, Queensland 4,000, and the other States 1,200 between them. I do not know how the 20,000 will meet the allocation if Mr Bellemore's plan is to be sustained. concerned Immediately ment I voiced that concern, and. it has not since been allayed. Dairy production declined from 211,000 tons in 1939-40 to 157,000 tons in 1943-44. This has had an effect on exports. The Australian consumption has not declined, except by the civil population, because of the large quantity used by the forces. We have to assign the cause of the decline, and determine how it may be remedied. The Government issued a questionnaire to the managers of butter factories, and 429 replies were received. In 331 instances the reason stated was lack of man-power, in 312 instances it was food shortage, which in reality is lack of man-power, in 101 instances it was lack of equipment, and in 50 instances it was seasonal conditions. During the last two years, 3,508 dairies have passed out of existence, and 2,198 dairymen have stated that they intend to undertake the fattening of beef cattle. I am concerned as to how these people are to be restored to dairying operations. The release of men from the Army in order that farmers may be given Mr Adermann. some assistance, will not alone achieve that purpose. I am afraid that those who have withdrawn from dairy production will remain out for as long as the war lasts. I am not decrying the efforts of the Government to increase the production of butter. I do not know when its policy in regard to the release of man-power was finally and State Governments. defined. I am still receiving the stereotyped reply that a man whose release has been sought is attached to an operational unit, and therefore cannot be discharged. That is the experience of all country members. I do not know where the fault lies for the lack in the number of men discharged. The release of men for the dairying industry in Queensland represents only 33 per cent., compared with 46 per cent, in the lowest of the other States, and rising to 58 per cent Yet Queensland had the highest percentage of rural workers, namely, 32.7 per cent., compared with 19.6 per cent, in New South Wales, and 21.8 per cent, in Victoria. The Labour. Minister for Agriculture in Queensland has voiced this commentIn view of the criticism that has been I am levelled at the Queensland Government over the decline in food production, I consider it about dairy production. my duty to point out that Queensland has been, I entered this Parliaand still is, more seriously handicapped by the (Shortage of rural man-power than any other State, and"" in spite of the highest rural population and the highest percentageof enlistments from the country areas, has had the lowest percentage of releases. That State offers the greatest possibilities for an increase of production. The_ release of a man named Wittkopp was asked for on the 23rd March last, on the ground that he was a key man in the peanut industry. A reply was not received. I approached the Army Department in order to learn what the position was. After a check up with the Minister for the Army, who took the matter to the Commander-in-Chief, the reply reached me that the Man Power authorities in Brisbane had not made any recommendation, and that if they recommended the man's release he would be discharged in the course of two or three days. I wired to Kingaroy, which contacted the Man Power authorities in Brisbane; they in turn stated that a recommendation for his release had been made. Yet yesterday, I received advice that Army had refused, his release. This man had four years'service in the last war, and has had four years' service in this war. He is 48 years of age. Under what part of the Government's policy is he kept in the Army? mainland, or outside Australia? tralia, in a supply column. He has heen on the mainland for nearly ten months. His release was sponsored hy Eood Control ally, to he released? in such terms that he. should be released. I shall inquire as to his case .personally, however, is beside the point. This man if the honourable gentleman will give the particulars to me. The rules relating to releases provide for the release of a man in the circumstances narrated by the honourable gentleman. for his release not lightly, but because he be pleased if the Prime Minister will is' a key man whom we. have always employed in the industry for maintenance purposes. The distribution of the peanut crop is held up. With the assistance of the Government,we have been able to import, from the United States of America a peanut shelling machine. record crop, the distribution cannot be made within twelve months unless we have the machine installed. worker ? worker, because his duties are incidental to the distribution of that crop. The Government assumes control of . the peanut crop, and instructs us as to where it shall be sent for distribution, yet we cannot get the key men who would enable us to make the distribution. release is sought is marked with an asterisk as a key man. Apparently, all the men in the Army are key men in industry. I do not believe it. There is too much of this "" key man"" business. But the case cited-the age and service of the man, and the fact that he is on the mainland-is covered by the direction to grant a release. the release of four men for that industry, and placed them in order of preference. This man was number 1. There is greater difficulty in regard to the release of the other men, for which there may be valid reasons. I have tried to be fair. If the Government will not give to us some labour which will enable us to install the peanut shelling machine, we shall not be able to distribute the crop. When I approached the Food Control Branch concerning blackmarketing in the Northern Territory, and the distribution of this crop, I found evidence that Queensland is regarded as a pampered State which must take what was given to it. If I cared to do so, I could show that Queensland is not pampered. That, has been classed as a key man. An ordinary carpenter is not qualified to do the job. We were prepared to try to have it done by a carpenter, but could not obtain one. In view of the shortage of man-power in Queensland, compared with the position in the other States, I shall investigate the matter. I introduced to the Minister for Trade and Customs (Senator Keane) and the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) a deputation of representatives of Queensland tobaccoWith a growers, who submitted an application for the remission of a percentage of the excise of 10s. 6d. per lb. on Australian leaf. The growers are supposedly receiving an average, approximately, of 2s. 5d. per lb., the price varying according to grade. Any one who visits the tobacco areas will see many growers who are living under starvation conditions. That condition is revealed in the acreage that has been planted in recent years, and the reduction of production. Earlier, the growers had asked for an increase of price, and it was granted to them, but to offset the benefit the tobacco manufacturing interests persuaded the Government to agree to the elimination of four or five of the lower grades. The result of this elimination was that the growers were not one whit better off; the combine had seen to it that they did not derive any benefit from the increased price. The deputation stated that men would not grow tobacco leaf if they did not receive a better price. So, on this occasion,",60,Frederick Stewart Men Were Being Dismissed From A Muni

They suggested that as a way out. I have asked twice for a reply from the Government. obtain any, but I have been told that the growers have been informed that the request has been refused. Bearing in mind the Government's treatment of the tobacco combine within recent months, one wonders whether it is a friend of the monopolists. the combine did not pay dividends. It said that its profits would not allow it to do so. It went to the Government for compensation, and received £750,000, which, in effect, was a gift to enable it to provide dividends which it had refused to pay. The Government can give three-quarters of a million pounds to the tobacco combine, but it has no concessions for the tobacco growers. Is that the proper way to treat primary industries in Australia? reply of the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture to a question in this House yesterday, that the position of the tobacco industry would be inquired into, calls to mind a promise that he made to a deputation in December last that, in the course of a few days, he would declare the Government's policy on the establishment of stock-killing works in the country. Apparently those few days have not yet expired, because the deputation is still waiting for an answer. If there is any delay in finalizing this matter, even for two or three weeks only, the decision will be too late for the planting of the crop. bacco production occurs, it may be taken for granted vernment's action in supporting the combine by making a gift to it of £750,000, and by refusing to give any assistance to growers, has delivered a knock-out blow to an industry which should be fostered. Mr Adermann. I now turn to the vegetable industry. There are eight dehydration plants in Victoria, five in Tasmania, twelve in New South Wales, two in Western Australia and five in South Australia. Queensland, of course, has none. Over a period of nine months, up to the 3l3t December, 1943, the value of dehydrated vegetables produced .throughout the Commonwealth was £3,785,000 and the weight of the produce was 6,500,000 lb. It is estimated that by the end of 1944 the production will amount to 30,000,000 I have been unable to lb. I approached the Director-General of Agriculture, Mr Bulcock, expecting that, 'being a Queenslander, he would consider sympathetically the neglect of that State, but he "" passed the buck"" to the Minister for Agriculture, who seemed to think that the In March last, matter was one for the Commonwealth Government, and so nothing was done. The Minister for the Army has stated that Queensland does not produce a sufficient quantity of vegetables to justify the establishment of a dehydration plant in that State, but let us consider the acreages planted in the various States. In New South Wales, there is 243,000 acres under vegetables; in Victoria, 277,000 acres; and in Queensland 141,000 acres. On that basis, if New The Soiith Wales was entitled to twelve plants, Queensland should have seven. South Australia has 49,000 acres under cultivation for vegetables and Western Australia, 42,000 acres, whilst Tasmania has 234,000 acres. The request from Queensland was that that State should have at least one. dehydration plant. That was not an unreasonable request, because a market for the product would have been available after the war. Evidently Queensland has been neglected. The reason why the people of that State voted "" No "" at the recent referendum is that they objected to a central government exercising control over their affairs If a serious decline of toand depriving them of their rights. Is there any good reason why the Governthat the Goment should not have provided at least one dehydration plant in Queensland, which is the only State where the growers are not able to get contract prices for vegetables? Repeatedly, when a glut of vegetables has occurred there the dumping of the product has been. necessary. show a truly national spirit. If federation is to mean anything at all, Queensland should get a fair deal. Australia will never he able to progress as a nation, just over the border in New South unless Queensland progresses with it, because of the vast area of fertile land in that State. in an extra 500,000 consumers being quartered in Queensland, and that has created a demand for goods over and above the normal market which Queensland enjoyed prior to the war. cussing the question of supplies available to civilians, but I maintain that the Governinent is blameworthy for not having made available the extra quantity of supplies needed to cater for the large number of servicemen in Queensland. evidently believes that the requirements of service personnel should be met by others, and that the people of Queensland should carry on their trade and business in the ordinary way; but that cannot be done. that Queensland has no vegetable dehydration plant, and no vegetable contracts. 'As to man-power, that State has the lowest percentage of releases from the fighting services and the highest perthat the sugar-grower is getting any centage of enlistments in proportion to its population. It has been ignored in the matter of secondary industries. It has an overburdened transport system breaking down with the strain, and the only support given by the Commonwealth Government to enable the State Government to meet the situation was a few Garratt engines which the railway officials could not operate. They sent an inspector to investigate the matter, and he suggested certain improvements, then they sent a second inspector, and he suggested more improvements, but the engines are still unsuitable and cannot give effective help to the overburdened railway system of the State. The price of beef in Queensland is still lower than in the other States. Hides realize approximately 1-Jd. per lb. less than in the southern States. One can take tallow from Queensland to New South Wales and get The Government should £2 a ton more for it than is paid in Queensland. The over-all price of tin is £3 6s. a unit in Queensland, as compared with £3 15s. a unit Wales. As for wheat, growers in Queensland formerly got 4s. 7^d>. on an average over nineteen years under the State Marketing Scheme. Production has declined by one-third. The growers now get less under the Scully scheme than formerly, hence the reduced production. Insufficient provision has been made for ordinary day-to-day supplies, and the people have to accept the position that they cannot get all they require, but Queenslanders have had far less in the way of every-day supplies than have the people of the other States. I did not intend to raise that issue, and will not press it now, because I realize that the position has been brought about by transport difficulties. Excepting that I have emphasized this position time after time, and have pointed out to the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture that, if Queensland did not import about 400 tons of wheat daily, more transport would be available for war and civilian supplies. argument to sugar. benefit now. There has been a decrease of the acreage under production and a consequent detrimental effect on the industry. Some days ago I heard the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Frost) interject about sugar, but I think that those who are getting most benefit out of the sugar position are the capitalist jammakers of Tasmania. Much has been said in this chamber regarding the urgent need for increased housing accommodation for the people, but I have never heard the Government emphasize the necessity for a rural housing scheme to enable people in the country to build their own homes, although they are just as short of houses as are people in the cities. I agree with those supporters of the Government who have advocated the provision of rural amenities, particularly electricity and refrigeration. Another aspect of homebuilding is the difficulty of ex-servicemen,",62,Frederick Stewart Men Were Being Dismissed From A Muni

231,Mr Adermann,"I do not thinkon discharge from the forces, in getting homes buiJt. ""We should see that they are treated liberally, but, when they desire to set up homes for themselves, they have difficulty in obtaining the necessary building material. Carpenters are not available, and even the initial building permit seems impossible to obtain. Preference should be given to ex-servicemen in that regard, and, if they wish to establish their permanent homes they should be permitted to build them. I shall not discuss the rehabilitation of ex-servicemen at this stage, but I desire to give credit to the Government for its promised recognition of the claims of those men when the war is over. I ask the Government to give more sympathetic consideration at present to two classes of ex-servicemen who are not being treated as fairly as they ought to be. [Extension of time granted.] I know of ex-servicemen who suffer from ulcers and neurosis, but they are not receiving any consideration at all. 1 am sure that returned soldiers suffering from a mental complaint will be treated sympathetically, but I suggest that they should not be accommodated in homes adjacent to existing mental institutions. To do so would be to create a wrong psychological condition which would retard their recovery. As for ulcers, medical history may be against me in this, but I know several men who were suffering from ulcers before they were accepted by the Army, and passed as A l . Then, when the hardships of the service caused the ulcers to become active again, they were discharged from the Forces, but in no case have they received any consideration on account of their disability. I maintain that once the Army accepts a man as fit, it should accept, responsibility in regard to his health. no consideration? The onus is on the department to prove that whatever they are suffering from is not due to war service. Previously, the onus was on the soldier. merely says that their disability is not due to war service, and that is all about it. As for the budget generally, its merit is were to accuse a trading firm of extravanot to be judged by the praise or blame which it happensto win. Honourable members should not seek political kudos. The situation with which the country is faced requires us to face realities, and these demand sincere government and the implementing of a policy to meet the needs of the future. There must be an all-out effort by members of Parliament and by the public generally to meet the just claims of ex-servicemen when the war is over. time is past when we were justified in sacrificing economy to the extreme haste required in the creation of a war machine with which to defend ourselves against the attack of the Japanese. The time has now come for more careful finance, and having regard to the character of the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) we might expect this requirement to find expression in the budget. That, in fact, is what has happened. He has given no promise of relief from the crushing burden of .income taxation. As a matter of fact, no such promise, if given, could be honoured, because those who wage war must pay for it. We might cushion the impact of taxation by using our reserves, and by postponing expenditure on maintenance and the provision of capital goods. We might defer the building of. new houses and manage with fewer clothes. We might even require future generations to pay in part for the war, but, in spite of all such devices, the fact remains that the great burden of the war, including the taxation necessitated by the war, must be borne by this generation. Actually, the real cost of a war is in human lives, in human energy, in the sacrifice of hard-won and cherished rights, and in the non-production of capital goods. The most we can do is to ensure that the burden is distributed as widely as possible over the community. That this has been done is borne out by bank returns, and by the records of the sale of war savings certificates. Some people profess to see in the accumulated savings of the people a danger of inflation. Paradoxically enough, they argue that because people have saved money during the war, there is a danger that they will spend it prodigally after the war. It is as if they gant tendencies because its balance-sheets",64,Frederick Stewart Men Were Being Dismissed From A Muni

Ther is no justification for supposing that, because the people have been frugal and have saved their money during the war they will, when the war is over, lose their heads and spend their money recklessly. I assure the Treasurer that he need not fear anything of the kind from the people in rural areas who have been able to accumulate savings. I have heard! the term ""concealed inflation"" used by honourable members when discussing income taxation. There is such a thing as concealed inflation, but it applies rather to indirect taxation, and we should study this form of taxation very carefully in order to note its effects. £338,264,000. By using the same index Probably the Treasurer had in mind some of the evil effects of indirect taxation when he agreed to reduce by 12£ per cent, the sales tax on building materials used for home construction. An authority, writing in the Co-operative Building Society's Gazette, estimated that, on a building costing £800, this concession would be worth £70. The Treasurer has stated that the concession will cost the revenue approximately £500,000. On an estimated building programme costing £6,000,000, the interest bill would amount to £300,000 at 5£ per cent. Interest on the amount of £500,000, which would have been collected in sales tax on building material, would amount to another £25,000. I maintain that additional costs of this kind should not be loaded on to such an enterprise as home building. For the year 1942-43, the revenue derived from excise and customs duties amounted to £65,000,000. This was the extra cost loaded on to the goods concerned, and the interest bill on this amounted to a further £3,000,000. This is a further example of concealed inflation. It must be remembered that costs of this kind do not add anything to the value of the commodities used. It is solely a matter of allowing interest to those who provide the finance to enable these articles to be distributed to the community but who expend no physical effort. They are examples of concealed inflation. I said that the Treasurer need have no fear of inflationary. tendencies because of the amount of cash reserves held by those engaged in rural industries. On page 68 of production bulletin No. 35 of the Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics there is a set of tables giving the index numbers of the prices of the principal primary and secondary commodities.. If we take as a basis the period between 1923-24 and 1927-28 and allot to it the figure 1,000, we find that the figure for 1938-39 for all primary industries is 696. The total value of all primary industries in 1938-39, the year of the outbreak of war, was £236,784,000. ""Working on the basis of the values in the base period and using that index figure, 696, the total value of primary production in that year should have been numbers of quantity production for that year, with 1,000 as a base, we get a result of 1,421, which shows an increase of 42 per cent, in quantity 'production. Notwithstanding that increase the amount of money received was less than the average amount received during the base period. ""We. find that in 1938-39 the primary producers received £111,479,000 less for their products than they would have received had values remained the same as in the base period 1923-24 to 1927-28. As the figures stand, they might mean that the farmers became more efficient, that they used better machinery, or that the seasons were better. But those who travel over the country now can see the reason for the greater production, and also for the amount of money that has been savedestimated by the Treasurer at £12,000,000 a year during the war period. They know that that saving has been made at the expense of the land, the buildings thereon, and the means of production in primary industry. .In country districts to-day, travellers see many broken fences, millions of acres of land being destroyed by erosion, dilapidated buildings, and worn-out machinery. Whatever money may be available to those engaged in primary industries when the war is over -and according to the Commonwealth Statistician the amount will be less than in the base years-wil l be required for the rehabilitation of the land and the means of production. There is no danger of farmers running amok, and bidding against one-another for expensive motor cars or wireless sets, thereby inflation, because every pound of credit that they can get will have to be put back into the land in order that their capital goods may be rehabilitated. other words, their money will have to be devoted to the means of production, means and machines. restored, but the human energy which has had to be expended because of a shortage of man-power cannot be restored. are some of the disabilities under which farmers labour. it applies' to rural finance should be completely reviewed. for the financial advisers of the Government to make a common rule for the whole of Australia. factory to those engaged in secondary industries in metropolitan it does not meet the financial structure of primary arranged by country storekeepers, the overdraft system of the banks, stock and station agents, and wool A system that does not give security to either the lender or the borrower, who is more or less dependent for success on good seasons, cannot be said to be entirely satisfactory. to the difficulties farmer, or a group of farmers private company consisting of farmers working the land as working and to the attitude Treasury relief from taxes.

The .property of the company (land 4.H0O acres, stock, houses, shed, farming plant, motor truck, cars, engines, &c., brokers. &c.) is held in common.

All the shareThis system, and I think that you will agree, is of great assistance for the man on the land. The one big disadvantage is double The purpose, of forming the taxation: taxation on the company, and then might taxation on the individual shareholders. To our mind this double taxation hardly seems mutual fair. The law relating to the assessment of private companies may be summarized as The director of the follows:(1) The company pays a flat tax of fis. in the £1 on the total profits. (2) Further tax at individual progressive rates is payable by have to be paid. He shareholders on profits distributed. (3) The company pays further tax at individual rates (ascertained by making a notional distribution to shareholders on the last day of the accounting period) on the undistributed profits reduced by the sums allowed for taxe3 paid or payable Minister for Lands, Mr Tully, saidby the company. Private farming companies are so different from ordinary private companies that it is wrong to apply to both the same rigid rule. An ordinary private company, unless it experiences bad luck, can almost guarantee that year after year it will earn a fair average income, but a private farming company is dependent on the vagaries of the seasons, and, in one year, may do well, even extremely well, and, in the next year, do so badly as to lose some of its assets. The system of placing the assets of a farming community in a private company is becoming the vogue because of its success. Provided that there is a common tie of kinship, thought, or culture in such a community, its children can be educated more cheaply than can the children of scattered families. The pooling of farm implements also places such a community in a much more favorable position than that of a number of individual farmers. The system has proved successful in keeping people on the land and it should be encouraged, instead, of discouraged by the imposition of a punitive tax. Lately, I applied to the delegate of the Treasurer for con: sideration to be given to the division of an estate among the members of the family. He objected because it might enable the dodging of tax. The federal land tax provides for the exemption of the first £5,000 of unimproved capital value, and imposes on the remainder a graduated tax of so much in the £1 according to the unimproved capital value. It is a punitive tax. Its purpose at the outset was to compel the subdivision of large estates, but now' the primary purpose of the tax is to raise revenue and the splitting up of estates is only of secondary importance in the mind of the Commonwealth Government. In that respect it is at cross purare manufacturedin the big industrial poses with the Government of New South Wales, whose policy is to break up large estates, whereas the Commonwealth policy appears to be to compel them to remain large. In moving the second reading of the Settlement Promotion Tax Management Bill in the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales on the 21st March, 1943, the The Government has in mind in this connection family partnerships, under which lands, though separately owned by different members of the family, are worked as one holding, perhaps from one homestead. In regard to such existing family partnership it is recognized that some concession is justified. It is thought that to treat them as joint owners, with only .the one deduction of £5,000 from the total of the unimproved values of the several parcels of land, would be somewhat severe. To meet these cas^s, a provision is contained in the bill that a deduction shall be allowed in respect of each member of the family from the total unimproved value of all the lands worked in the partnership. The deduction for each member shall be limited to the value of that member's interest, where it is less than £5,000, and to £5,000 where it exceeds that amount. It is to be observed that this provision relates only to members of a family as defined in clause Ml, and only to family arrangements which were in existence a.t the date of introduction of this bill. Such family arrangements were doubtless entered into without cognizance of this legislation. This is a generous concession, and a similar concession has been made to members of a family who, at the introduction of the measure, own land jointly and work it as one property. Honourable members can see that the design of the State Government is to encourage the formation of private farming companies in the hope that rural conditions will be thereby so improved as to encourage the sons and daughters of the farmer members of those companies to remain in primary industry instead of seeking a living in the metropolitan area. But the Commonwealth Government's policy runs counter to that. If we use the land tax only for the purpose of raising revenue and not for the purpose for which it was first intended, we shall soon find ourselves "" on the rocks"". I mention that as an example of the difficulties under which people on the land labour. They also meet with difficulties in trying to get articles in short supply which centres, but which could be manufactured in country towns where, in spite of the overall shortage of labour, there are groups of spare labour who, according to seasons, could be engaged in industry, if such industry existed. A constituent of mine has written to me a letter which shows what benefit would accrue to the man on the land if small factories existed in country towns for the manufacture of his needs. The letter is as follows:I am taking the liberty of attaching hereto striking distance of Australia. Had they a letter received from Messrs. H. V. McKay Massey Harris Pty. Ltd., in reply to a hostile letter I wrote them in connection with two plough shares I have 'been urgently requiring to enable me to put a plough into commission. Kindly read the letter and then tell me how W. J. Smith, who was then in charge of the hell a cocky can help produce foodstuffs if a simple thing like a steel plough share is unprocurable. Cast shares can be obtained but are useless in the volcanic soils of our district. If you can kick the backside of some dumband we still held a great, part of bell iu the Food Control Department wlio screams for potatoes, barley, &c, and can't organize a supply of plough shares I will be very grateful. It is of no use for him to turn the vials of his wrath on some departmental officer when the articles he needs are just not there. They cannot be conjured out of nothing. The reply of H . V . McKay Massey Harris Proprietary Limited was as follows:We thank you for your letter of loth April but, are sorry to say that we still have no steel plough shares of this type available. We quite agree with what you say, and think it would be a very good idea to write to the Food Control. Actually, our inability to manufacture adequate supplies of either farm machinery or duplicate parts is wholly and solely due to the dreadful shortage of man-power which exists in our factory. The trouble is that the workshops are in the big industrial areas where sufficient labour is unprocurable, whereas there are no workshops in the country towns where men are available according to the season. Costs of production would be less and the people would have cheaper food if farming machinery were manufactured in the localities where it is used, because heavy freight charges would be avoided. The danger in which we stood through having our industries concentrated on the vulnerable seaboard became so apparent early in the war that it appeared that steps would be taken to decentralize industry, but we appear to be getting back to the bad old ways. I made a speech in this chamber in February, 1942, in which I mentioned the shortcomings of our electric power Mr Breen. system. By arrangement with the Speaker, much of the information which I gave was kept out of Hansard. I gave figures relating to the electric power generation in various parts of Australia. Honourable members can imagine how useful such information would have been to the Japanese when they were within been given exact information as to the whereabouts of the power generating plants they could have struck a mortal blow at our armaments industry. Mr one phase of munitions production, said that if Sydney were knocked out, it would be the end of our war effort, regardless of whether our armies remained intact the continent, because there would be no production owing to the loss of our electricity-generating plants. Hastily, we proposed to establish generating plants in other parts of the country, despite the fact that three or four years before the outbreak of the war, our technicians advised that it was not good engineering practice to try to harness some heads of water required for irrigation to hydro-electric turbines. Nevertheless, such turbines were hurriedly installed at inland centres. As honourable members know, the enemy actually shelled Sydney and Newcastle, and in the latter city the shells just fell short of the Zarastreet power house. Had that power house been knocked out, our war effort would practically have collapsed and we should probably have been obliged to retreat behind not only ""the Brisbane line "" but also "" the Adelaide line "". Eor the reasons I have given, the Government decided to establish war industries inland, but since the passing of the danger of coastal attack, the capacities of the plants at Newcastle, Sydney and Port Kembla have been doubled. This was done despite the lack of adequate power plants west of the range, and the hugh potential of coal in the Lithgow field for the generation of electricity by steam, and also despite the fact that the water conservation system west of the range would probably be sufficient for the generation of electric power. ""We are still concentrating the production of energy on the coast; and population is drifting from the country to the cities. ""Whilst 40,000 females have entered rural production, male man-power in those industries has decreased by 60,000. [Extension of time granted.] population which has replaced the former rural male population since the inauguration of food production programmes, such as vegetable production, will return to the cities upon the completion of those programmes. At the same time, it is most unlikely that the former male population, which provides the only real basis of development in the country, will return to primary production. ""What would they return for? The big munition -factories established at inland centres, which might have formed the basis of future industrial development cannot functionunder. Government control in peace,.because under the Constitution, the Commonwealth engage in trade. . The alternative to clossources of coal exist in the country areas ing down those factories will be to invite private enterprise to take them over; but let us examine the difficulties which will confront private enterprise in such circumstances. Those factories will have to be run in competition with similar factories situated in the capital cities. They will be at a great disadvantage in such competition because the largest markets are in the cities, and the country manufacturer must bear the additional cost of transport over distances of from 200 to 300 miles to those markets, as well as consequential handling and packing costs. About two years ago the Government of New South ""Wales endeavoured to ease such conditions in the interests of manufacturers in country centres by allowing them concession was applied particularly to the flour, milling industry. Australia at that time was fulfilling an order for 500,000 tons of flour for export, and practically every mill in the country was engaged on a share of that contract. However, it was found that the contract price was at port. Consequently, the country millers had to pay the cost of transporting the flour from their mills to the seaboard, and this placed them at a decided disadvantage in competition with mills situated in coastal cities. The action of .the New South ""Wales Government in giving that freight concession as a bonus to country millers was challenged by big business interests in the capital cities, and the High Court upheld the objection in subsequent litigation. That emphasizes The female one of the main features of industrial development in Australia. It shows that we are drifting back to pre-war conditions when we concentrated industry and population in the five capital cities. How shall we be able to defend this country in the future if that policy be continued? ""We shall not be able to defend this continent by relying merely on five fortresses situated on our coastline. We shall be enabled to do so only by distributing our population and vital industries as widely as possible throughout the country. However, under the Constitution, as I have already said, the Commonwealth does not possess power to give effect to a policy of that kind. Government cannot I have emphasized that sufficient refor the steam generation of electric power. That leads me to ask: what use shall we make of our coal measures? It has been stated on good authority that the existing resources of oil used for fuel in internal combustion engines will peter out within 25 years. For that reason, investigations are now being made in the United States of America of the production of oil from coal. Germany produces three-fifths of its total oil requirements from its coal measures, and Great Britain also produces a substantial proportion of its oil from coal. What is our position in that respect, particularly in New South Wales? The Greta seam is probably the best allpurpose coal in the world, but considerable waste has occurred in extracting that freight concessions. This seam. It has been estimated that in some mines where the seam was 34 feet thick, only three-fifths of the seam was mined. The productive capacity of that seam has been estimated at 242,000,000 tons. When the war is over, and the greatest demand arises for all-purpose coal, because of cheaper production cost and the quality of the coal itself, the Greta seam will be exhausted in about twenty years should our own requirements remain at approximately 12,000,000 tons a year. We have no other seam in this country comparable to the Greta seam for the production of oil. In addition, we must also bear in mind the importance of by-products such as coal tar. This is being used us a base in the production of synthetic rubber, which is not a mushroom development that will vanish after the war, because many kinds of synthetic rubber addition, alcohol manufactured grain is also used in the production of synthetic rubber. The Chemical and Engineering News, an American publication, is my authority for saying that for 1944 the United States of America production target of power alcohol is 640,000,000 gallons, of which 333,000,000 gallons will be used in the' production of 330,000 tons of synthetic rubber. Let us look at our own resource? in this respect. We have a power alcohol plant in New South Wales which uses 1,500,000 bushels of wheat annually to produce about 3,000,000 gallons of power alcohol. This power alcohol is suitable for the production of synthetic rubber. At present the complete output of this factory is earmarked for war purposes, but those needs will disappear upon the conclusion of the war. It would seem that the Commonwealth will have to close down that factory because under the Constitution it cannot engage in trade. . In that case, the country will be deprived of the opportunity to develop fully the power alcohol industry, and with it the manufacture of synthetic rubber. I urge the Government to give careful consideration to this problem because only the Commonwealth is in a position to finance research in .this matter. The States cannot afford to do so. The job, therefore, devolves upon the Commonwealth. I submit that the Treasurer in future budgets should make provision for such research work. It has been said that Australia spends relatively nothing upon research in industry. should amend that situation, and be in the forefront of scientific research workers, because we have the ability, and men from our universities have made their names overseas in all phases of science. The spade work was done in Australia, and the world instead of Australia reaped the benefit of it. We should correct that position as quickly as possible, because we of all people most need the help that scientific development can give us. if we are to compete on tbe distant markets of the world against producers who are close to those markets, and Mr Breen. if we are to produce with white meii's labour commodities which are turned out by cheap-labour in countries close to our shores. There is an abundance of ihat are being produced. In cheap labour, whereas we have to use from dear labour and dear machinery, and we cannot do that with any hope of success unless we develop our scientific potential to its utmost capacity. I wish, in conclusion, to speak of the necessity to increase invalid and old-age pensions. I realize that, in time of war, when the demands on the credit resources of the country for war purposes are so great, it is difficult to allocate more than is being provided at the present time to assist invalid and old-age pensioners, but in the post-war period, if we can make it worthwhile for the older section of the community to withdraw from industry, and for the youthful section of our people at the other extreme to do likewise, and if we can then concentrate our productive effort among those between the ages of 21 and 50 years there will be less danger of unemployment than if we attempt to carry on with our present programme. Unemployment and depressions have followed all wars for the last 200 years, and so closely have depressions followed wars that one could be excused for stating didactically that depression was a consequence of war. I believe that, as war can be avoided, so can depressions. It depends on the individual and national approach to the problem. I hope that our future will be an approach for peace instead of for war. [Quorum formed.] BeforeI begin my speech on the budget, I wish to comment briefly on an event that We has happened to-night. Like, I suppose, thousands of Australians and some other honourable members here, I listened for a brief time to the broadcast of a debate in the Albert Hall, announced as an open forum on the question of the nationalization of the coal industry. It was extraordinary from two aspects. In the first place, the Speaker of the House( Mr Rosevear) occupied the chair. I have no objection to that, and I mention it only because it was unusual. But the debate was novel on another much more important and serious aspect. That was the fact that a Minister of the Crown took",65,Frederick Stewart Men Were Being Dismissed From A Muni
235,Mr Hutchinson (Deakin) [9.50 ],"the platform and, in an address over the air, which went throughout and breadth of the Commonwealth could be picked tip by listeners espoused a policy inconsistent with the policy of the Government regarding the coal industry, and inconsistent with the terms of the Prime Minister's ment on the subject. This means the introduction into Australian politics of a new conception of cabinet responsibility, not of cabinet morality. custom in all British Houses of Parliament for all members of a cabinet to share a common responsibility, when a Minister speaks he does so on the lines of tlie policy determined by Cabinet. That is traditional in Great Britain, and has been the custom in this country ever since the introduction government. Tho fact that the Minister for Transport ( Mr Ward) proposed to speak to-night was brought up in the House yesterday able Archie Cameron), and elicited from the Prime Minister unusual "" Well, the Minister for Transport is a member of the Cabinet, but he is also a private individual, and, therefore, he is quite entitled to take the platform and express his own ideas, apart from any sense of responsibility to the Government to which he belongs "". If that is to be the conception of cabinet responsibility in this country, any member of any cabinet may go anywhere, and voice any policy that he desires to voice, at the same time completely absolving himself from adherence to any policy adopted by the government most unusual form of cabinet If the Prime Minister only person who can voice decisions, or give directions upon government policy, then one man is to all intents and purposes in charge of the country, and people are compelled to look to him only for any indication of the course the Government may take. matter because it is unusual, and worthwhile recording in Hansard. There is a second point of great with great events overseas. Most of us interest in what happened to-night. The to-day are contemplating an early end Ministerf or Transport was asked bow of the war with Germany, followed by he would deal with .the coal mine-owners the massing of the gigantic forces of the if the mines were nationalized, and the. length whether he would compensate them. He and very cleverly sidetracked the question overseas, in the first part of his answer, and then he said that that was determined by the Constitution of the country, but, he added, were it not for that, if he had the power, announcehe would deal w i th them and with this problem in an entirely different way. That comes from a Cabinet Minister if who, if he is not the leader of a section It has been the of the Cabinet, is at least one of a rather large section of Cabinet, and also one of a rather large section of the Labour so that party. Apparently his idea is that, if compensation has to be given, and the Constitution does not interpose any barrier, then any person who owns property in Australia can look for a poor of responsible deal. 1 believe that that is of great interest to every person who owns a home, a farm, a business or a shop. It is vitally important to remember that by the honormember for Barker( Mr our Constitution guarantees that, in the event of the Commonwealth Government ( Mr Curtin) a most, acquiring land or property from a citizen, answer. He said, in effect: the fair, just market price must be paid. The Minister's reply to-night brings very clearly before the minds of the people how wise they were when only a short time ago they blocked an attempt to alter the Constitution which would or could have reached down to the very fundamentals of l if e and property. It shows us how significant was the crushing defeat which the Government suffered' in the returns that came to hand on the night of the 19th August last. The two matters I have mentioned are of major importance. of the day. That is a There was to-night a complete departure unity. from the principle of Cabinet responsiis to be the bility, and an indication from a Minister cabinet for the Crown of how, had he the power, he would deal w it h the rights of property owners. I turn now to the budget. In common with other honourable members, I shall deal w it h certain speciI mention this fic subjects, apart from the main document as it appears from an accounting point of view. I do this because the presentation of the budget synchronizes Allied countries against Japan, and we are hoping that, after those forces have heen concentrated for the attack, not more than twelve months will elapse before Japan in its turn hears the terms of surrender dictated to it. Consequently our thoughts are tending now towards post-war problems, and that is right, because we do not want a sudden cessation of hostilities to catch us withSo far as I know, the Australian Governout ways and means of dealing with the problems of tremendous importance that will then confront us. I wish, therefore, to-night to comment upon three main subjects; first, the future of the Austracomplete or partial absence of competilian wool industry; second, the need for an educational policy in Australia; and third, land settlement. It is needless for will get in this conflict, we must realize me or any other honourable member to dwell at length on the importance of the wool industry' to this country. It is true matter. It was not so much what Japan that, with the building up of secondary industries in Australia, we are achieving a greater degree' of economic stability than we have possessed in the past, but it is equally true that in the years to come the fortune of almost every industry and every individual in the country will rise and fall to a marked degree with the rise and fall of the price of wool. The position to-day, while relatively stable because of the fixed prices given to the woohgrower by Great Britain, will in the future, I believe, present problems of gigantic importance. What matters is that after the war, Great Britain, so far as we know, will continue to buy Australianwool. Last year, wool sales meant to Australia between £60,000,000 and £70,000,000, which paid our commitments overseas, including interest and imports. In the year before, the wool cheque was between £70,000,000 and £80.000,000, and anything that cuts across the orderly marketing of this product at a payable price will therefore have a great effect upon the economic welfare of Australia. At the end of the coming wool season, there will be a wool carrv-over in the world of -more than 10.000,000 bales, of which 6,000,000equal to two wool clips-will be in Australia. At the end of the last war also, a problem was created by a carry-over of wool, but the difficulty then was small compared with what it will he at the end of the present war. When the last conflict ended, Australia's carry-over was Mr Hutchinson, 2,700,000 bales, most of which was sold over a period of years by an organization set up for that purpose and known as Bawra. We have no guarantee that when this war ends our wool will be bought by any country On top of that, as I have pointed out, there will be the problem created by a world-wide wartime accumulation of 10,000,000 bales. ment has not taken any action to deal with this problem. Another important factor which will affect the sale of our wool in the post-war period will be the tion by Japan in the market. WhilstI believe that Japan deserves all that it that the diminution of Japanese buying in the wool market will be a serious bought in pre-war years, as the competition which Japanese .buyers offered, that largely determined, the price which the Australian wool-grower received for his product. This problem is a serious one from the viewpoint of. all the major components of the British Empire. It is of vital importance to Great Britain as a manufacturing country, and to Australia, New Zealand and South Africaas wool producing countries. It is a major Empire problem, and I believe that, at the earliest possible moment, there should .be a consultation between the Governments of the United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand, in an attempt to formulate a policy which would give some degree of stability to this, our most important industry, in the post-war years. If no .great measure of co-operation can be achieved at that conference, it behoves this Government to assist the wool industry in this country during the difficult post-war years, lest the entire economic foundation of Australia be imperilled. Allied to the wool industry is the question of developing the textile industry in this country, and in that regard I shall have a few words to say about what has happened in that industry during the war. Our wool-growers have been able to place upon the world market a product unexcelled in any other country. In fact, it is the one product in respect of which we can look the world in the face. "" This we produce, and no country can produce better."" Therefore, one is entitled to state the corollary, namely, that in the years ahead, with this fine raw material at their disposal, textile manufacturers in Australia should be able to produce goods of unsurpassed quality. It should be possible also to induce British textile manufacturers to set up factories in this country where the raw material is available. Unfortunately, our textile manufacturing has not earned a good reputation during the war. Has this been due to government interference, or to lack of initiative, incentive, or care on the part of the industry itself? Undeniably, the Government is responsible in part; but I do not blame it entirely for what has taken place during the last five years. I believe that textile manufacturers, in common with certain other industrial interests, have seized upon the war as a glorious excuse for inefficiency. There is no doubt that, during the war years, there has been poured on to the counters of Australian shops a large quantity of woollen manufactured goods which can be described only as absolute rubbish. Like most other people, I have had to buy some of this rubbish, and many of my friends have been forced to purchase these inferior goods. The textile industry, by this behaviour, whether or not it has been due in part to government interference, has undermined its reputation to such a degree that one frequently hears the remark: "" When the war is over and I can get British textiles, I shall never again have anything to do with Australian goods."" AlthoughI am in j terested in the building up of industries in the United Kingdom, I am more interested in the development of this country, which I hope will become the major Empire .power in the years to come, and instead of being dependent upon the Union Jack, will be the protector of that flag. The future of our textile industry is a matter of great moment, and something should be done to remedy the present position. Men associated with the textile trade say that advance copies 'of magazines and catalogues coming here from Great Britain indicate that, in the early post-war years, the British textile industry will place upon the Australian market, and, indeed, the markets of the world, cloth unparalleled in the history of that great textilemaking nation. Therefore, there will be a real challenge to our own textile industry. What can we do about it? The industry is one which could expand greatly, and one which has a great future in the export trade. I believe, in fact, that the manufacture of textiles in this country could be expanded to such gigantic proportions that the industry would be able to use much of the raw material produced here for the advancement of this country both internally and externally. This problem is one affecting not only the manufacturing side of the wool industry, but also all branches of that industry. There should be held at an early date a conference of all sections of the wool industry in this country to discuss ways and means of putting not only the raw product, but also finished articles, upon the world's markets at the conclusion of the war. There is a need for a considerable research into the manufacture of textiles, and for a publicity campaign to advertise the virtues and quality of Australian woollen goods. The sum of 6d. is deducted from the price of every bale of wool that is sold, as a contribution by the wool producer. This is paid into a 'fund to provide for research and advertising the different branches of the wool and textile industries. The total sum thus derived is £81,000 per annum, of which possibly £50,000 or a little more, is expended on advertising Australia's main product, worth between £60,000,000 and £80,000,000 a year, and substantially more with the addition of the value of the manufacturing industry. A manufacturer of soap exipends as much as £120,000 or £130,000 a year upon advertising. The manufacturer of a brand of toothpaste thinks nothing of expending £30,000 a year, and large sums are expended by furniture manufacturers and the proprietors of cough mixtures in establishing, through the medium of advertisements over the air and in the .press, the qualities of their products. Yet this most important industry, upon which depends practically the whole of the economic structure of Australia, has expended on it by way of advertisements the monstrously, outrageously low amount of £50,000 or £60,000 a year. I would quadruple the contribution of 6d. a bale which the wool producer now has to provide, and then subsidize the pool by at least £500,000, not humbug with a few thousands, to be used for research and in advertising the qualities of wool. Almost all items of women's woollen underwear, and many of the items of men's woollen underwear, have gone out of fashion. To-day, we practise more or less the American mode of dress by wearing light underclothing against the weather by the use of heavier top-coats. world trend. Is there any reason why woollen manufacturers cannot make a light garment which would be as soft to the skin as is anything made from synthetics ? I see no reason. Such a garment would have hygenic qualities which cannot be given to garments that are manufactured from any substitutes. Our textile industry, in conjunction with our wool industry, can produce goods of these types, to-day he is one of the coming business and recapture many of the markets that have been lost. By means of a vigorous advertising campaign, we could enhance the prospects of the textile industry. I may be asked where I would expend the great bulk of the money that should be devoted to advertising the qualities of woollen goods after they had been produced. Strangely enough, I would not look first to the Netherlands Indies or to Russia, or China, even though the attempt should be made to develop markets in those countries, but would go "" all out"" on a real campaign to put Australian textiles "" on the map"" in the United States of America. Many of the men in the wool and textile industries, as well as advertising men, who have been to the United States of America, would favour this course. That country contains 130,000,000 people with a high purchasing power, who to-day are using less than one-half the quantity of wool per head that is used in Great Britain, and much less than is used in Australia. I found America to be more or less starving for really firstquality woollen goods at a reasonable price. Any big firm in Melbourne, if asked what happened when American boats called at our ports before the war, would say that, in the main, those who Sir. Hutchivxnn. travelled on them purchased Australian woollen goods. go to America? to manufactured articles. United States of America prevents it. there is a high tariff. Nevertheless, there would be a market for our goods, if they and protecting ourselves were manufactured and properly advertised. A few years ago, a person in MelThis is a bourne commenced to manufacture tennis rackets. He was a joiner, and had not sufficient money to travel even round Australia, let alone overseas. He began to compete for the Australian trade, but was not very successful because of the strength of the combine which operated in this line of sporting goods. Therefore, he sent his rackets to Canada and the United States of America, with the result that men of this country, and his principal trade, strangely enough, is with the United States of America. The results that could be obtained from research, ingenuity, enterprise, push, and efficiency, backed up by an advertising campaign, cannot be estimated. The use of wool in that country is only 4.1 lb. a person, whereas in Great Britain it-is between East8 lb. and 9 lb. I do not subscribe to the idea that America is a country which does everything in the best way. It was a great disappointment to me in many ways. But it is a paradise for the advertising agent, and offers a tremendous .market for good woollen garments. Hitherto, education has been regarded as purely a State marter. Events will tend more and more to push it into the foreground of Commonwealth activities. In my view, that is the right course. As a Parliament, we cannot fail to take cognizance of educational policies in this country. It would seem that, in the past, our expenditure has been at the wrong end. The budget proposes an expenditure this year of £22,000,000 on old-age pensions, a proportion of which is paid to men. In other words, we are expending money on a social service at the end of a man's life, when, for some reason,-he has not the wherewithal io maintain himself,",71,Frederick Stewart Men Were Being Dismissed From A Muni

239,Mr Hutchinson,"I agree thatinstead of concentrating expenditure at the beginning of his life, in training him to fit himself for what he has to undergo and to maintain his independence and status in his declining days. 1 would be surprised if more than £16,000,000 is spent each year on education, so that we are spending nearly £7,000,000 a year more on the maintenance of people after they reach the age of 65 than we spend upon fitting them in their youth for their life's work. When I was speaking on the coal-mining industry recently, I said that the people in the coal-mining districts had no idea of how to invest money. That is true of the populations of all industrial centres. There is a complete lack of knowledge of what to do with money. That fact constitutes a challenge which we should meet by improved educational methods. In country districts no facilities for technical education are provided and, as a rule, only the children of well-to-do parents are able to attend a high school, let alone a public school or a university. Something should be done to remedy this, and it is not unreasonable that the move should come fro m this Parliament. I would not wait until the war is over. I would send off a delegation of half-a-dozen leading educationists, including one with a knowledge of technical ediucation, and another with experience trip educational methods because, in all the western countries, much attention is being concentrated on this subject. I would allow them to take their own nr, and to incur what expenses are necessary. One of them should be a linguist who could discuss with educationists in other countries the problems to be solved. T would ask them, when they returned, to formulate an educational policy, after which the matter of cost could be gone into. Their recommendations would be considered by Cabinet, and there should eventually emerge the finest educational policy of any country in the world. Ediucation should not be regarded as a State matter exclusively. It concerns all of us. There is only one set of taxpayers, so what does it matter whether taxes are paid to the State Governments or to the Commonwealth Government, or whether we pool our resources? The -establishment of a system of education such as I have envisaged would constitute a most important social service. Soldier land settlement is a subject which frightens most people who devote any thought to it . The history of soldier land settlement in Australia does not make good reading. According to a report prepared in 1927 the loss incurred on soldier land settlement schemes up to that date amounted to £23,000,000. B y 1943 the loss had increased to £43,000,000, or £1,200 for every man settled on the land. Such a loss in a country w it h a population of little more than 7,000,000 is disastrous. Before embarking on any further land settlement schemes we should try to discover why so much money was lost, and seek to profit from the mistakes of the past. There seems to be a f a i r l y widespread belief that any one can be put on the land and he w ill make good. That is a mistaken belief. The fact is that inexperienced people have more chance of making a success of almost any other occupation than that of farming . A successful farmer must have a highly developed sense of the virtue of t h r if t . No matter how much he may do in the way of conserving fodder for the feeding of animals his returns, in the long run, depend upon natural pastures which, in turn, depend upon rainfall. Therefore, his income w ill necessarily fluctuate from in administration, on a year to year, and in the good years he around the world to study must put aside something to tide him over the bad years. The farmer must, in addition, have a shrewd business sense. He must take a lively interest in technical advancements associated with his industry. He must know his soil, because the nature of the soil, together with the climate, will dictate what he ought to grow or produce. Lastly, he must not be afraid of hard work andi a bit of dirt. We must be careful whom we settle on the land. Wo must recognize that, there will always be losses associated with land settlement, and these losses should be faced at the outset. If we have 75 per cent, of successes we shall be doing very well. Hitherto, our efforts at land settlement have always been sporadic. Usually they have been attempted only after we have indulged in a war, and this has militated against their success. When a great many men are settled on the land at the same time an increased demand is created for live stock and for farming machinery. This tends to force up prices. Thus, we start with a wild burst of enthusiasm, and finish up with a final ""bust."" I shall diagnose the faults that have developed in"" settling people on the land, and place before honourable members ways and means of avoiding them. We should not embark on a sporadic scheme of great magnitude for a few years and then suspend operations. Land settlement should be a continuous process. There will always be a certain drift of population from the country to the cities, and on that account we should always have a land settlement policy in operation, in order to give to city youths, as well as country lads, an opportunity to settle on the land. We should not embark on a scheme of settlement by the use of millions of pounds of loan money, as was done after the last war. We should prefer to set aside a certain sum annually from revenue, using the repayments of those who have been placed on the land in settling others. The last scheme was administered in the main by the State authorities. There was an almost indecent haste in those days to purchase country properties, and many mistakes were made. There was no proper selection of settlers with a result ensure satisfactory working, and a most that many thousands of completely unsuitable persons were doomed to failure from the outset. The repayment of moneys advanced to them was entirely on wrong premises. In the first few years they had no payments at all to make, but the sums which they should have paid in the early stages were merely banking up for future years, and the burden of interest eventually became so heavy that it damped their ardour and destroyed their initiative. I am at a loss of one of the great defects of the last to understand why such a policy was adopted. Under a proper system of land settlement the earlier years would always be the harder, and the burden would gradually become lighter, until finally the cost of the farm would be met. -Under the last scheme, chaff was sellwere entirely unsuitable. Pressure' was ing in Victoria at up to £15 a ton. Prices of stock were high, but under these no contribution to make towards the cost of the scheme, and it is not surprisUnder a new scheme the . repayments Mr Hutchinson. ing that a wrong psychology developed. As prices fell the settlers were left with an ever increasing burden of interest and sinking fund payments. [Extension of time granted.] That caused a loss of interest on the part of the landowner in his property, because he had no real equity in it, having in many cases invested no money of his own in it. In other cases the blocks were too small, and the purchase prices too high. Surelyi t is possible to learn from experience in formulating a new policy. Land settlement in future should be a 'Commonwealth matter, although it should be administered with the assistance of the States. Settlement should take place first in those States where there are vast areas available for settlement, and where land values are not unduly inflated. In the purchase of such land, great reliance should be placed on the valuations of the local governing authorities. It is almost impossible for a land valuer from Melbourne to make a correct valuation of land in, say, the upper Goulburn district of Victoria. If , after valuation by local bodies on a fair market value, it is con1 sidered that the value is above a productive basis, then the difference should be absorbed by the State. The blocks should be large enough to careful selection of the settlers should be made. An educational system should be adopted whereby settlers could obtain training to fit them for work on the land. There should be no wild rush to settle thousands of men in the course of a few years. It will possibly be most difficult to avoid this fault, because, after the war, the urge will be to assist ex-servicemen to get on the land as quickly as possible. That would result in a repetition scheme. I know men in Victoria who were members of selection boards which functioned in connection with the last scheme,' and they told me that they were well aware that many of the men placed on the land would fail, because they brought to bear by the government of the day, which declared that the men wanted conditions the settler had to go on the land, and that no time should be lost in meeting their requirements. should he spread over a period of years, and the hard years for the settler should be the earlier part of the purchase period. The earlier years would be a period when the settler would have a reasonable assurance of satisfactory prices for his main products, because the demand for foodstuffs after the war will be steady and strong. In the earlier years the settler should make contributions by way of interest and sinking fund payments, and, as the years pass by, and prices might be expected to weaken, he would find that the burden had been gradually reduced. As he sees daylight ahead and -the prospect of owning his property, he has an added incentive to produce, andto become more and more efficient. If every settler had a financial financedout of moneys raised by interest in his holding-som e equity in the land which he works-it would be an added reason why he should exert himself to the utmost to make a success of the venture.. I have some knowledge of land settlement and I have shown some of the faults of the previous system. A wise government will'learn from the mistakes of the past, and after this war it should be possible to settle many thousands of men on the land at a cost lower than under the previous system. As I have dealt with three subjects, each of which involves a certain amount of expenditure, I emphasize financing the scheme which I have advocated must be soundly conceived. I do not think that any one who studies the present budget can be other than sceptical as to Australia's ability to deal with vital post-war problems, in view of the system of finance favoured by the present Government. Expenditure for other than war purposes is estimated at £148,000,000 for the year. In other words, expenditure under civil headings has more than doubled in the last ten years, because in 1934 the total amount budgeted for was about £70,000,000. Figures supplied by the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Ryan) .showed that during the last twelve months the administrative costs of some departments had risen by £650,000, and that over a period of two years the amount had increased by about £1,750,000. expected that the expenditure of war-time departments, which were set up in a hurry, would by this time have fallen following an increased measure of efficiency, but costs have risen rather than fallen. To-day, 70 per cent. of. the national income is being expended by Commonwealth and State Governments. The former is going ahead with a policy of social services under which grants are made, first to one section, and then to another section of the people. The bill for social services is already over £50,000,000 a year, and with the addition of repatriation payments and other promised social benefits, it is soon likely to reach £80,000,000 a year-mor e than the total expenditure of the Commonwealth in 1934. Moreover, the social service schemes of the Government are to be the impbsitiou of taxes, and the National Welfare Fund is to be established out of loan moneys. We cannot hope to continue the social' benefits envisaged by' the Government, because unless these schemes be established on a sound actuarial basis, they must crash sooner or later. This form of finance will militate against the success of any scheme of post-war reconstruction. Among other things, it will prevent any substantial assistance to our wool industry, any increase of educational facilities, or the success of any soldier settlement scheme. More conthat the background of sideration must be given to the economic well-being of the country than the budget before us indicates. Indeed, the document displays an almost complete absence of an understanding of this country's economic structure. I go so far as to say that the budget indicates that the Government has no real idea of economic planning, but is merely rushing in wildly to spend money which will buy votes. If that be a correct summary of the situation, the budget must be described as a bad document, because in that event, instead of ushering in an era of prosperity, it will add tremendously to our post-war difficulties, and may even lead to chaos and confusion and eventually threaten the whole basis of democratic government in this country. Australia is confronting many problems, One would have but in that respect this country is not greatly different from the other countries which have engaged in this war. T pay",75,Frederick Stewart Men Were Being Dismissed From A Muni
240,Mr Wilson (Wimmera) [10.49],"a rri.hute to the Government for the wholehearted way in which, in a time of national crisis, it has applied itself to the defence of the country and to the organization of its resources so that the nation might play a worthy part in the struggle for freedom. At the same time, I must express some disappointment with certain aspects of the budget. But I do say that the Government showed great courage by facing its responsibilities in a way which cannot rightly be criticized. It did not hesitate to do many unpopular things. It imposed restrictions here and controls there with the one object of doing everything humanly possible to prevent the invasion of this country and to ensure that we should play our full part in this struggle, I believe-and I speak as one who was abroad not so long ago-that we can hold our heads high for the part which we have played. While I pay tribute to those'who have administered the affairs of the Commonwealth in this time of crisis, I also honour the men of the forces for the valour they have shown and for the uncomplaining way in which they have done their duty and helped to bring us to this day when we at least have victory in sight. I am disappointed with the budget. I am disappointed because, although war expenditure is declining this year by about £40,000,000, there is no evidence of any relief for the taxpayers on low incomes. It does not reflect credit on the Government that persons earning as little as £2 a week should have to pay income tax; that persons on the basic wage should be taxed as heavily as they are, and that persons earning little more, married and family men earning an artisan's wage, should be taxed up to £2 a week. In spite of the difficulties associated with war-time finance and the necessity to maintain the value of our currency, I do not think that there is any -need to continue and I hope that this is the last budget which we shall see without some relief being given to tho3e sections. In speaking of workers on low income and salary earners generally, I also refer to farmers who, in the main, earn small incomes. The majority are really on a par with artisans and working professional men whose income seldom exceeds that earned by those sections. Some relief ought to be given to them also. Ifr. Wilson. I hoped that we would have in thisbudget an instalment of Labour's financial policy now that the Government hasa solid majority in both Houses of this Parliament. ""While I do not agree with everything in the Labour party's platform, I have a great deal of faith in itsfinancial policy. The time is ripe and the people are ready for the reforms proposed. ""We should go straight ahead and deal with the financial position by bringing: in a system of national control of the whole banking system. Nothing short of that will meet the needs of the nation in the years that lie ahead. Unless the Government can control its finances and be sure that it shall be able to carry out the policy it enunciates to the electors, it will continue to take second place to the non-elected group rulers outside. There are other commitments which to a degree will offset the reduction of warexpenditure this year. There is, of course, the international commitment, amounting to £12,000,000, referred to by the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt), in respect of assistance to distressed nations. That is quite justifiable. ""We as a nation are favoured in many ways and must play our part in that respect. Subsidies associated with .the Government's prices pegging policy are a rising commitment, and it is estimated another £12,000,000 will be required this year to provide for that contingency. I quite agree with the policy of subsidizing prices to keep down the cost of living, and to obviate any inflationary trend. There are other commitments referred to in the budget to which I need not refer. There is, of course, the evermounting commitment resulting from the orthodox method of finance that we have followed, namely, the interest bill, which I think I am right in assessing at such heavy imposts, £66,000,000 per annum for the Commonwealth and the States. I should have liked some enunciation from the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) as to how he proposes to meet the position in the post-war years. I should like to know whether the Government has any proposal in mind for the reduction or redemption of some of those loan commitments, both overseas and in Australia. ""We have had to borrow to win the war, but we cannot continue in peacetime merrily on our way, borrowing our way to national disaster. Any government -which thinks it can borrow its way to prosperity will find itself in the long run in the same position as that of the individual who thinks that he can do the same. Let us have an early statement -from the Treasurer as to how the Government proposes to deal with the ever.ac-cumulating national debt. There must a change because we cannot go on for ever in, this way. I hope that the Government has some plan which will -show us the way to national solvency. The Treasurer, in his budget speech, referred to tlie redemption of a loan which was contracted in 1941. I am glad to know that at least one loan has been liquidated. I am a comparative layman in these matters and did not gather clearly the method by which that loan was liquidated. Had we known exactly what was our trade balance and the position of our London funds, we might have been able to clarify the matter for ourselves. The Treasurer indicated that that loan was liquidated by the issue of treasury-bills through the Commonwealth Bank. I had imagined that our London balance would have been sufficient to enable us to liquidate that loan in the normal way. The proposed system of rebates of be educated as to the real facts, the result income tax is probably similar to that would be very different. I mention this provided in last year's budget, whereby matter because our people are looking certain taxpayers became entitled to to the Commonwealth Parliament to do rebates provided that they claimed them. the really big jobs confronting this counThe proposal on this occasion is not so try. For the time being, the States have generous as it might be having regard had a victory, and are sitting back to our present financial position. I urge retaining their sovereign powers; yet the the Treasurer to revert to the system of people do not realize that those powers straight-out deductions in respect of are essential to enable this Parliament family commitments. It is much fairer to handle these problems in the interests than the system of rebates which only of the development and safety of this complicates the working out of tax country. Therefore, I urge the Governliability. Very often, owing to such comment to take up the fight again at the plications, the taxpayer does not claim earliest opportunity. It has right on its even the rebate to which he is actually side, and, despite the forces of Mammon, entitled.

Under the averaging system, a portion of their losses and carry on which is applied generally to farmers, they may have to make some payment despite the fact that they have had no income during the past year. I hope that in such circumstances they will be relieved entirely of tax. I now refer to the Government's referendum proposals which were rejected by the people. I supported those proposals because my experience in this Parliament, although not very extensive, has convinced me of the need of constitutional reform. I still believe that, had tlie people been given a better opportunity to study and understand them, the result of the referendum would have been different. I sincerely hope that the Government will not capitulate at this stage, but will place its proposals in a simpler form before the people at the earliest opportunity. I am certain that once the people of Australia understand the facts, they will agree to constitutional reform. I have more faith in them than I have in honourable members opposite who, a few years ago, were advocating similar reform, but opposed the Government's proposals during the referendum campaign because they did not like the present Government. If the people could which opposed its proposals, it will achieve victory. I have already referred to the drought until more favorable seasons occur. Their in that view.

That is the least the Government can do to honour sack subsidy, which is very helpful. I pay its obligation to them. I now refer to the wheat industry. It something like £500,000 for the benefit would be most unusual for me to speak in of the wheat-growers in the form of the this chamber without referring to that subsidy on cornsacks, whilst another subject.

242,Mr Scuily,The various subsidies,81,Frederick Stewart Men Were Being Dismissed From A Muni
243,Mr Wilson,"I calculated that theThere is no world parity price for wheat to-day. There is only one buyer of wheat, and that is the British Government. Any other buyers are of such small consequence that they may be ruled out. Great Britain is buying all the wheat necessary to feed the people in the countries which have been re-occupied, and in distressed countries where food has to be provided. We have reached a stage in Australia when stocks of wheat are sufficiently low to justify the lifting of the acreage restriction for at least a period of two years. I give that as my considered view. I would not advise the Government to discontinue the system of registering wheat farms. That is to be commended and should be retained, but I do urge that it should l if t the acreage control and allow those who have the plant at their disposal, and are able to put in increased acreages with whatever plant and labour they have, to do so. I urge the Government to give the most serious consideration to that suggestion. The matter is urgent because we shall be able to dispose of all the wheat that we can grow for the next two or three years. Of that I have no doubt whatever. T emphasize the urgent need of providing something in the nature of a provident fund to which wheat-growers, when they encounter a period of drought or other adverse seasonal conditions, can have recourse as a right, not to get loans, but to obtain grants on some equitable basis. I sniggest to the Minister that a small deduction, if only of £d. or Id. a bushel a year, should be made to build it up. In that way in two or three years we should have a fund amounting to two or three million pounds, which would be a great stand-by for the wheat industry. No stabilization for the industry will be fully effective until some provision of that nature be made. WhilstI realize the constitutional limitations that may come into the picture in the years immediately after the war, I still advise the Government to give the creation of such a fund urgent consideration, and-to act on it as quickly as possible, because we shall always have recurring periods of drought and financial stringency in the industry. A fund of this nature would put the growers on an independent basis, relieve the Government of responsibility, and save the appeals which we have to make from time to time on behalf of growers. The honourable member for Deakin( Mr Hutchinson) spoke of education. The Commonwealth must come more and more into the education field The standard of education as conducted by the States is lacking in uniformity, is niggardly as compared with other countries, and is not giving us a race of young people sufficiently educated to compete with the people of other countries. We are lagging far behind, and the whole situation is discouraging. It is hard upon parents to have to supplement the free education provided by the State schools by means of secondary education. That is a burden upon them, and in addition the teachers who are interested in the work are discouraged by the lack of finance for the provision of equipment and facilities, which, as I have been able to see, are very far behind those, of other countries. I wish to refer to repatriation and land settlement for soldiers. We have amended the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act, which is claimed to be very much better than it was, particularly because the onus of proof of disability is now upon the Repatriation Commission. Many other extravagant claims have been made about, that act, but I have been disappointed with the position, which I find is not materially improved. Hundreds of people who have been in the fighting services and should be able to look to the Repatriation Department-and these are to my mind very worthy cases indeed-ar e not able to get what I believe is their due. The Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act cannot be left static. It requires further and repeated overhaul from time to time, and I suggest that the Repatriation Committee which did such fine work a little while ago should be reconstituted and act more or less as a permanent committee, to examine and overhaul the act, so that the men of the fighting services will obtain, what they are entitled to, or at least a greater measure of justice than they have had. The position is bristling' with anomalies in respect of administration. I believe that it is mostly on the administrative side that the difficulties arise, but that does not absolve from obtaining loans. In the wheatthe Government or the commission from responsibility. We have an obligation to these men, and I should like to see it discharged more honorably than was the case after the last war. Preference to returned soldiers, as we have known it in the past, has been a mere empty gesture. If there is to be a scarcity of jobs or' another depression, in the post-war period, preference in employment must be given to those men and women who have done so much for their country, but I should like to see something more positive offered to them. Let us train them for the jobs for which they are best suited. That would be better than a guarantee of preference in employment, which, in effect, is merely a political catch-phrase. I believe in security for all, but,failing that, I shall support the principle of preference in employment for ex-servicemen.

This is a matter in which many people, particularly primary producers, are vitally interested. Much Mortgage Department is still too high. was expected from that new institution, It has not been reduced since the new but I am one of those who are very organization came into existence, and I disappointed at the results. Whilst the trust that there will be a reduction soon. setting up of this organization might The system of valuing properties is also appear to be of real assistance, at least far from satisfactory.

When the Treasurer introduced legislation setting up the Mortgage Department, he said, in effect, that side by side with the new organization, steps would have to be taken for the rehabilitation of the nnancial position of the farming community generally. To-day, the financial position of many wheat-growers is as bad or even worse than it was when a royal commission reported upon this industry some years ago. Even the efficient wheat-farmers are labouring under a heavy burden of debt, or are working on over-capitalized properties, and these disabilities make it impossible for them to obtain, loans from the Mortgage Department. They are able to carry on only because of the reasonable prices that are of over-capitalization and debt will have to be dealt with before our rural comThe interest rate charged by the not competent to make valuations. That is one cause of a great deal of dissatisfacto honour our obligations under the tion, and I suggest that the matter be examined. I branches of the Commonwealth Bank to many more country towns. In Victoria one can travel many hundreds of miles without seeing a branch of the Commonwealth Bank. Usuallyi f a farmer wishes to deal -with that institution, he has to travel many miles, or to. conduct his business by correspondence. I hope that that position will be rectified^ at an early date. I should like also a position created in which any man who has an asset, whether he be a farmer or business man, shall be entitled to obtain from the Commonwealth Bank-the people's banka loan upon that asset. That cannot be done to-day because there are all kinds of difficulties. I should like to refer now to some of the monetary proposals which were under consideration at the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference. I have here a remarkable document which in effect is a conglomeration of complicated phraseology, dealing with the manner in which the proposed monetary fund is to be set up. I have never seen the equal of it. From a preliminary perusal of it, I should say that the scheme is designed to circumscribe the trade of this country, and in my opinion it would have the effect of preventing the development and expansion of our natural industries. On that account, I trust -that this Parliament will have an opportunity to go very carefully into it in a full-dress debate, so that all honourable members will be able to examine its implications. It ought to be rejected. I see nothing wrong with the present means for dealing with the external trade posiition. I have witnessed, during this war, benefits that have been derived under the system that is known as mutual aid or lend-lease, and I should like that principle to be carried forward into the years of peace. ""Whetheri t be called by that name or some other name or whether or not alterations be made'to it, so long as we have that principle it will provide the greatest modus vivendi for the development of world trade and good relations between the nations of the world-, thereby avoiding war. If we are Atlantic Charter, and do something for the distressed peoples of the world, we should like an extension of must produce and allow those countries to have our production on whatever terms may be suitable to them, so long as our producers and manufacturers can be paid. We shall then evolve along the lines that are implicit in the principles of lend-lease, and thus fulfil our obligations under the Atlantic Charter. The present trend among wealthy landowners and speculators is the purchase of land. In recent times, there has been quite a "" gallop "" in the acquisition of land. I believe that the Treasury regulations have had a beneficially retarding effect, and that without them the position would have been very much worse than it is. [Extension of time granted.""] Many properties suitable for soldier settlement are in some of the most favoured areas of the Commonwealth. Because of the large incomes derived by some individuals, a great deal of money is available for investment. Something ought to be done to arrest this trend to a greater degree than has been tbe case. Purchases are continuing, although prices have not been inflated because of the control that has been exercised; but the land will not be available for the settlement of soldiers and others if action be not taken to correct the position. I earnestly urge the Government to deal suitably with the problem. With the defeat of the referendum, the future use to which war-time factories shall be put has been somewhat changed. It has been stated in the press that the Government might enter into partnership with private corporations and other bodies, to operate them on a 50-50 basis. If we are to judge by the successes achieved on behalf of the people by such a system, it cannot be recommended. If constitutional power does not reside in the Commonwealth, the Government might enter into agreements with the States for the best use to be made of factories that are considered suitable for production that would be to the advantage of the country, thus providing employment, especially for members of the services, who will have to be put into jobs which will assure, them of a reasonably good career. I hope that shipbuilding will be conmade. Wherever possible, there should tinued in Australia. I have seen many be a system of pipe lines which would of the vessels that have been built by and make the most economic as well as the on behalf of the Commonwealth since fullest use of the available water, in the war began, and they are fine examples preference to the use of open channels, of workmanship of which Australia which often waste by evaporation up to may be proud.

In addition to vary at State borders and that a bias building cargo-carrying types, we should should be shown in favour of districts build passenger vessels and others near metropolitan areas.
