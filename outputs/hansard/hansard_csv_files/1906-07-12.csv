I shall, however, reserve the right to make, between now and the passing of the measure, some such suggestion as that to which I have referred, because I foresee that, if inquiries are multiplied, we shall inevitably have a kind of legal Court set up, whereas the settlement of business matters requires not only disinterestedness and impartiality, but practical knowledge and despatch, if the trading community is not to suffer great inconvenience and loss through delav. understand that the difficulty of the Government is to find business men whose integrity will be above suspicion in the minds of the people-disintereste d men of sufficient position to commend their appointment to the community. I do not know where we shall find such a man, unless we appoint a Justice, or create some new permanent office. Public confidence in the tribunal is an absolute essential. Fortur.atelv, we are able to congratulate ourselves upon the high estimation in which the occupants of our Bench are held, and I think that for the present we may very well rely upon enlisting-the services of one of the Justices of the High Court. The matters which the Justice will have to inquire into under this part of the Bill"" will be, not matters of law, or of fact, but largely matters of opinion and of economics. If a Justice be appointed to decide .these questions we shall be exposing a high judicial officer, who ought to be above all partu considerations, to attacks in regard to the decisions he may give. of the Bill, the Justice will be required to do precisely the same work, and. moreover, the American Judges are called upon to exercise similar functions. that such is the case. The Board which [43 ] was originally provided for would not command the confidence of any section of the public, and I regard the substitution of a. Judge as an improvement. At the same time, I cannot approve of the growing disposition to call upon Justices to deal with ciuestions which do not involve matters of law or of fact, but which require that they shall express an economic opinion upon subjects in regard to which men of equal ability may, in perfect good faith, hold diametrically opposite views, I regard the practice as somewhat dangerous. In many parts of Canada and the United States, this practice has resulted in the impairment of the independence of the JBench and the exposure of the Judges to party attacks. However, I cannot suggest an improvement, and, therefore, ' I suppose I must let the matter pass. I had intended to refer to this question when we were dealing with the Arbitration Act, but the time then at our disposal was too short to permit of my doing so. I believe that the appointment of Judges to try cases such as would arise under that Act has not increased public confidence in the Bench, but has tended to shake it and to expose the occupants of the Bench to party attacks. Amendment agreed to. [7.48] I desire to point out that it is proposed under this clause to give immense powers to a public servant. It is actually intended to place upon the shoulders of the Comptroller-General the obligation to express an opinion as to whether an industry is advantageous to the Commonwealth, whether, and to what extent, it ought to be affected by competitive enterprise from other parts of the world, and as to how far it ought to be subject to that constant interplay of scientific forces which is silently and gradually revolutionizing our industrial methods. When we were discussing the Tariff, a long discussion took place with regard to tanners' machines. It was proposed by the then Minister of Trade and Customs to subject them to a duty of 20 per cent, but I proposed that they should be placed on the free-list. After we had discussed the matter at some length, the Minister promised to obtain a further report on the matter. He sent out an officer-and probably the same man would be called upon to determine questions arising under this clause-to make inquiries, and received a report that whilst our manufacturers were not making the tanners'",13,Australian Industries Preservation Bill

However, I suppose that it is no use saying any more upon this matter. In another part of the Bill, we have already decided that this officer shall undertake these supreme duties. I entertain the greatest fear that the result will prove anything but satisfactory. My only hope is that such other provisions will be inserted in the measure as will lead to the services of this officer being called into requisition as rarely as possible, in connection with a matter of such grave importance to the country. I wish to say, in answer to the remarks of the deputy leader of the Opposition, that I never intended for a moment by my interjection to impute to him disloyalty to Australia. AllI intended to convey was that there area great many people who appear to think that neither Australian machinery nor Australian manufactures of any kind can be as good as are the imported articles. The statement w being continually made. I know fromi experience that there is just as good machinery made in Australia as is made in any other part of the world, and still better machinery would be made if the young life of the country were given anything like a fair chance. -gjven a fair chance. Our own people are continually disparaging our products and making it appear that we are fit for nothing except soldiering. The honourable member for Parramatta spoke of protecting the miners. He knows that we cannot impose a duty upon coal, but if a lot of the articles which are now being imported were made in our factories, a much larger quantitv of coal would be used, and the miners would be infinitely busier than they are at the present time. more independence of spirit instead of 'always leaning upon the Government ber talks about independence of spirit. are sapping by means of this class of legislation. there is as much independence of spirit [43]2 amongst the people of America as there is in my honourable friend, and yet they are pretty well protected. amongst a population of 80,000,000. trade amongst a population of 4,000,000. I trust that the time is not far distant when we shall have ten times that number. I can assure my honourable friend that the reduction of the duty upon strawboard has proved most serious to that industry, and that, notwithstanding the introduction of improved machinery, a much larger number of hands would be employed if an increased duty were imposed. spite of the statement of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports statement. the honourable member was doing whilst he was addressing the Committee? I maintain-despit e his predilection for the State coddling of local industries-that if we had less interference with trade in every way-les s interference with our imports, with commerce, and with industry, there would be more healthy and vigorous conditions existing amongst our manufacturers, their employees, and amongst the community generally, than there is any sign of to-dav.

Thus a total amount of extraneous weighting matter had been added to 1 this sample of sole leather of 16.1 per cent. Another sample was also weighted with both barium and glucose, the total weighting amounting to 11 per cent. The average cost of the weighting material is i d . per lb., and the average price of the leather is iod., a clear profit of od. per lb. A ton of such weighted leather at iod. per lb. would contain 358 lb. of weighting, the purchaser buying this faked stuil in good faith as leather. Therefore he would be deceived by false weighting to the extent of £13 8s. od. on the purchase of one ton. In this instance there is no possible doubt that the weighting of the leather is a designedly fraudulent practice. diminished by weighting, and from this would arise a disinclination on the part of British and foreign buyers to deal in Australian leather. Dr. Norris, president of the Board of Health, says such adulteration would appear to be limited entirely to soleing leather. Without doubt it was a designedly fraudulent practice, one attended by depreciation of quality of the leather subjected to it. Such depreciation may well have been a factor in the conditions which have led to the recent decline in the amount of value of leather exported from Victoria to the United Kingdom, as well as to its exclusion from the British War Office contracts, and there is little reason to dbubt that one of the reasons owing to which Australian leather has become more or less discredited, is that to some extent at least it can be spoken of as poisoned leather. The question of the exact and the direct influence of such adulterated leather on health is a difficult one on which to express a definite opinion. leather more pervious to water, and such a property must reduce the value of leather. From a health stand-point, barium compounds were .1 more important adulterant. Without hesitation he stated that in the form commonly used, viz., chloride of barium, known to the trade as normissa, they are poisonous. They may perhaps cause injury to persons wearing boots made from leather containing them, but such leather is more especially dangerous to those employed in making it up into boots. He suggested that a copy of Mr Wilkinson's report be furnished to the Queensland Government, and that the Federal Government be addressed on the subject, with a view to the framing of legislation, whereby the import, manufacture, sale, and export of leather containing any such weighting should be prohibited, as he was informed was the case in Germany. ber noticed the answer to those statements ? that there has been any complete and convincing answer to them. the honourable member reads the condemnation, but does not read the answer. ments made by responsible Government officials in Victoria at the request of the Premier of the State. In repeating those statements, I cannot be charged with having manufactured anything from my own imagination. can be charged with unfairness unless he reads the answer to them. have not seen any answer to these statements; but I shall be very glad indeed to know if an effective answer to them has been given. If this kind of thing is carried on in Victoria, and any attempt is The quality of the leather is made, in the inferests of one section of the community,to preserve an industry the products of which may foe injurious to the health of the people, serious injury may be done to an immense number of the citizens. If we are to pass legislation to prevent the competition with boots made of this adulterated leather, of sounder boots, made of better leather, and giving better results from a health point of view, we may do very serious injury to the people. I can conceive that under this clause an attempt might be made, by shutting out very muchneeded competition, to preserve an industry productive of immensely injurious results to the general public. It is because the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, the other dav, made such special reference to No doubt that glucose renders the the particular subject of boots that I have thought it wise to bring these statements under tine notice of the Committee.

62,Mr Isaacs,That has been already,18,Australian Industries Preservation Bill
63,Mr Henrywillis,"I am awareis a permanent Board, charged with the duty of considering business matters. The honourable member for Parramatta referred to certain machinery manufactured in Victoria, that was said to be good enough for the purpose. But while that machinery would do its work, it would scarcely be fair to manufacturers, workers, or consumers in Australia that it should be allowed to keep improved machinery out of the market. If , as has been pointed out by the honorabl'; member for Lang, some manufacturers are working barium or glucose into leather, and are thus deteriorating the products of another industry in Australia, should we not have a Board of competent men who would understand the business, and would prevent the continuance of such a practice? I saw no objection to the clause which provided for a permanent Board to control those industries. No Judge of the High Court is competent to decide as to the machinery and methods to be used in manufactures--to decide as to whether an industry shall exist to the exclusion of up-todate machinery. To prohibit such machinery would be against the interest of the manufacturer, of the artisan, and of the consumer. There ought to be a competent Board, in order to secure an industry from prejudicial decisions, which may be the result of ignorance. General of Customs cannot be expected to know the circumstances of every manufacture, and it seems to me that the clause as drafted, or even as proposed to be amended, is not likely to give the greatest satisfaction. My reason for speaking is merelto emphasize what I have before stated. I feel pretty sure that if fhe B ill becomes law, this is one of the provisions which at some future time will have to be reconsidered. should like a definition of "" unfair competition,"" for I must confess that I am unable to understand the Bill in this connection. that point. to give one or two striking illustrations from English history. If these two clauses stand, they may exclude improvements most vital to industrial progress. In 1770 there was introduced Hargraves' spinning jenny, which enabled a workmen to attend to eight spindles in the place of one spindle as formerly. Then came a decided improvement, in the form of Arkwright's water frame, and that was followed toy Samuel Crompton's mule, so-called because it was a combination of the invention of Hargraves and Arkwright. At the present day one workman can, owing to the improvements made, attend to as many as 1.2,000 spindles; and I need not point out the enormous gain that has followed to every worker, not only in Australia, but throughout the civilized world. Until these inventions were applied, only the wealthiest people could afford to change their underwear as frequently as is desirable^ the expense of new clothing being almost prohibitive. Those improvements certainly displaced other forms of work, and then came the power loom for weaving, thanks to Cartwright. The clauses under consideration would deprive us of the benefits of all such inventions; and in passing legislation of such a drastic character, we ought to regard the question from all points of view, and not leave it to the Comptroller-General, at the. suggestion of the Minister, to declare what, in his own opinion, is unfair competition. The decision on this point should rest on reliable evidence,' and not be left to any one person; and especial care ought to be taken not to block the progress of invenThe Comptrollertion. Any hindrance to production must result in the greatest injury to the workers; and for the reasons I ha.ve stated, these clauses shall not have my support. According to the B ill , if a man, in making a garden, chose to use a spade, when he might employ a plough-o r who employed a one-furrow plough, when he might use one with three or four furrows-woul d be able to complain of unfair competition at the hands of those who used the improved machinery. If such legislation as this had been in force when the inventions of which I have spoken were introduced, the effects would have been disastrous. Following on the improved methods of production, there was a great increase of population in England. Prior to 1751, the increase each decade was, roughly, about 3 per cent.; but from that year to 1781 the increase was 6 per cent. I ought to mention that at that time the great Watt had invented the steam engine, which has clone so much to develop manufacture in every direction. This invention has had an enormous effect on coal mining and kindred industries, and enabled manufactures to be carried on",18,Australian Industries Preservation Bill

From 1791 to 1801 the increase of population was 11 per cent.; from 1801 to 1811 the increase was 14 per cent.; and from 18.11 to 1821 the increase was 21 per cent. ened production injuring the workers, as the honourable member for Melbourne poses, it resulted in the enormous increase of population which these figures disclose.' This is a sound reason why all men who can really see what the true interests of labour are, should take care that no hindrance is placed in the way of production. This Bill will put it in the power of a pliable Comptroller-General, under the control of a dull and stupid Minister, to prevent the use of means'of increased production, and by so doing, to block fresh avenues for the employment of labour. Such a danger is not only possible, but so extremely probable, that it behoves us to exercise very great caution in passing such legislation as this. I am so satisfied that great injury will arise to the bulk of the workers of this country, that I intend in every possible way to oppose, not only this clause, but everv succeeding one. quotation which I read to the Committee a little while ago, I find on consulting the files, was a condensation of a report published in the Agea Victorian newspaper. This article contained more comprehensive allegations than those which I read. The only attempt at refutation that I have come across is one furnished by the Victorian Tanners' Association, and the Employers' Federation, which subsequently held a meeting to consider the report. They generally condemned the use of , the materials to which I have referred, but admitted that they were used. ticularly was that the case with glucose. But they thought that one Victorian firm was largely responsible for its use. honourable member condemned the whole of the firms for one. I simply quoted from a report of the Government Analyst, and the Government Medical Officer, which was published in the Age. If there was any accusation, it was made by those officers and not by me. I am not responsible for what they said, or for what was published in the Age. The value of the disclaimer of the Employers' Federation, even qualified as it was by admission that the practice did exist, but not general I v. is discounted by the publication, on the same day in the same column, on 27th March, 1905, of a So far from cheapletter from the secretary of the Tanners' and Leather Dressers' Union. I propose to quote a portion of it, as it confirms the Ports always wrongly supreports of the Government Analyst and the Government Medical Officer. It saysI have from time to time in the past made complaints to various bodies upon the subject of adulteration of leather. Some few years ago, while giving evidence before the Royal Commission, on Technical Education, I made a statement, if my memory serves aright, that one firm at that time was reputed as using two tons of glucose per week in their leather. Later on I forwarded to one of our senators, when the Fraudulent Trades Marks Bill was under consideration, a complaint as to the use of glucose, and also a child's shoe purporting to be leather, the constituents of which were principally cardboard, rag, and bagging. There can be no question that some action is necessary in compelling dishonest manufacturers to so brand their goods that the public may know whether they are getting ""nothing like leather,"" or "" something like leather,"" or "" real leather."" At one time the tanning and leather-dressing trade was looked upon as a fairly healthy occupation, but of late years, owing to the increased use of chemical ingredients and of machinery, it is becoming anything but healthy and safe. Having read this extract, I leave the Committee to judge the matter for themselves. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 141.

I move this amendment with a view to ascertain the sense of the Committee as to whether the whole of paragraph a should not be omitted from the Bill. I also take this opportunity to reply to certain statements made by honourable members last night. I might have made my reply then, except that I wished to give the Government an opportunity to get through clause 12. ment, upon which a division was taken yesterday, was intended to admit British goods into Australia which were competing dishonorably or unfairly with Australian goods, or which were being dumped in order to destroy Australian industry. possibilityI might say the likelihoodof British ,goods being prevented from entering Australia, although their competition be such as in mv opinion is absolutely honest and fair. orable members look at the measure they will 15 proceedings have to be initiated by the Comptroller-General, who has to believe that certain parties are importing goods with the intention that they may be sold or offered for sale, or otherwise disposed of, within the Commonwealth, in unfair competition with Australian goods. How will' he arrive at an opinion as to the intention of an importer? He can have only one way of arriving at an opinion. He must take the fact that in his opinion unfair competition exists to prove that there is an intention to compete unfairly. Then we have to turn to clause 14 to know what is this unfaii compe'tition which is to exclude imports, and upon which the Comptroller General has to take action. Paragraph a .readsCompetition shall be deemed to be unfair if under ordinary circumstances of trade it would probably lead to the Australian goods being nolonger produced, or being withdrawn from the market, or being sold at a loss, unless produced at a lower remuneration for labour. production, together with all tute ""inadequate"" for ""lower."" then readUnless produced at an inadquate remuneration for labour. graph in accord with the decision of last night. I movemay take place without one atom of unfair competition.

AlthoughI do not agree with the statements of the honourable If honand learned member for Corinella in some other respects, still I agree with his argusee that under clause ment that a protectionist Government should deal with the matters that come under paragraph a, not in a Bill of this description, but by means of the Tariff. But what is the plan that is now being adopted? A Tariff has been created; in full consideration of these differences, duties have been placed upon articles; and on top of that Tariff power is being taken to exclude, by prohibition, these goods, not because of unfair competition, not because of dishonest or dishonourable competition, but simply because of ability to compete.

In this Bill they seek to prohibit the importation of goods, or to impose such conditions as may make it difficult or impossible to import them, not because the competition is unfair, but because it is successful, for the things set out in paragraph a are simply the result of successful competition. I shall now allude to two matters, as they will come into the argument in connection with the paragraph. Several honourable members, including the honourable member for Moira, have declared that I made misstatements in a previous speech on the question. In connection with my proposed amendment to a previous clause, I said that if Great Britain were to enact a provision similar to paragraph a, the bulk of our exports would be shut out of the British market. That statement was questioned. The honourable member for Moira saicS that as a matter of fact there was not unfair competition by Australian products in that market. there was. as here described is not unfair, but that if the provisions of this Bill were applied to our exports by Great Britain, then it would shut out a great part of the goods which we 'send to her. it should be evident to any one who reads the clause carefully that when we send to Great Britain meat, fruits-the application to fruits is more limited I admit -and butter, and it leads to similar goods being no longer produced in Great Britain, or to some being withdrawn from the market, and to some not being saleable at a profit unless the wages in"" Great Britain are to go lower than they are-for we find that in some cases the British farmer cannot produce in competition-the n if the British Parliament were to pass a measure with a clause such as I have described, Australian goods, to a large extent, must be excluded . The honourable 1 member for Moira-and I am sorrv he is not here-referre d to the export of meat. Previously I had stated that, of course, no country exported if it could sell in its own market: that, as it must get a better price relatively in most cases in its own market, where it had not to incur heavy freight charges to sell, the only reason for exporting was that it had a surplus which the local market could not absorb, and which, in the interests of the producers, it was better to allow it to go to the other end of the world to realize the best pried which could be obtained there for. The honourable member for Moira said that meat was not sold in England] at less than the price it cost in Australia. Sir WILLIAM LYNE He said that generally it was not. orable member said that it was only in very exceptional circumstances that the meat was sold at less than the cost price here. Probably he was not aware that the Sydney Meat Preserving Works, which sends to Great Britain preserved meat, and also carcass meat to a large extent, has never made a profit, and that it is not intended to make a profit. It is an association of graziers, who are always ready to go into the local market and sustain prices by their purchases. In doing this, they do not consider whether they will get in Great Britain exactly what they pay, and usually realize only cost or something less, the eviI never said that dence being that they have never shown a I hold that the competition profit on their balance-sheets for the year. Last vear the Canterbury Meat Preserving Works lost about ,£36,000 on their London shipments, though I agree that that was exceptional. These facts show I think that our exporters are guilty of what the Minister calls dumping,. They send Australian meat to Great Britain, and sell it there for whatever it will fetch, and even at a loss, and, by so doing, are injuring the graziers of that country. Then, as I have said before, the butter association here fixes the local price of butter, and, so that it may be sustained', ships the surplus production to Great Britain? where, usually, less is obtained for it than is obtained for that sold locally. to bring it back. that that has occurred; but the occurrence is exceptional. years ago. be loaded into ships, and. after being taken abroad, brought back again. happened too.

Yet Ministers would prohibit such action, if it were taken by exporters from Great Britain. I do not object to the practices to which I have referred. Our producers are perfectly right in what they do, because, in order that they may make a prolit on their productions, they must sell locally only so much as the market will consume, sending the surplus to be sold in other markets for whatever it will fetch. It was because the Bill would render perfectly legitimate trading of this kind, if indulged in by exporters from Great Britain, subject to prohibition, and, under the Customs Act, to which the measure makes special reference, forfeiture of the goods sent here, that I moved the amendment exempting British goods which, last night, was negatived on division. The illustrations which I have given show that the honourable member for Moira was wrong in saying that I had misstated the facts connected with the export of our productions. The honourable member for Laanecoorie also questioned my statements, and produced figures to show that they were wrong. My remarks and his interjections are reported in Hansard, at page 1187, in the following words: I have no desire to discourage or interfere witli such exports; but how do they affect the English producer? tralian beef, lambs, and so forth, into England has, bit by bit, taken the trade out of the hands of the English grower. The importation of Australian fruit into England operates in the same way, but not to the same degree, because it arrives there out of the English season, when there is not much Jinglish fruit to offer. sav the same about butter? importation of Australian butter takes the business away from the English producer, but that it takes the business away from them. member can easily satisfy himself on that point. orable member must have found that what he states is not altogether the case. If we have regard to the importation of Danish butter into England before Australian and New Zealand butter went there, the enormous increase from the latter places is not nearly accounted for by anv drop in Danish importations. in the English production? ter interferes with the importation of Danish butter, but it interferes to a greater probably, with the English production, it is sold at a lower price than is the Danish. Mr Dugald Thomson. Australian Industries [REPRESENTATIVES.] Preservation Bill. How can the honourable member ask any Parliament to conceive that the large quantity of butter which Australia and New Zealand exports to England 'does not, in combination with the Danish importations, interfere with production in England. Where was the butter obtained previously, if not from English and Irish producers? of butter increasing every year? the consumption increases with the increase of population. The honourable member for Laanecoorie quoted certain figures from the Board of Trade returns to show that my statements were inaccurate, but I will use those figures to prove that I was well within the mark, when, speaking from memory, I said that I did not think that there was any decrease in the exportation of Danish butter to Great Britain. The figures show that there was an increase. In 1901, the total quantitv of butter imported into Great Britain was 3,702,890 cwts., and, in 1905, 4,147,866 cwts., an increase of 444,976 cwts., or 22,248 tons. Of the quantity imported in 1901, 631.985 cwts. came from British possessions, while, in 1905, 1,054.209 cwts. came from British possessions, an increase of 422,224 cwts., or 2 i , 1:11 tons, which accounts for practically the whole increase in the period to which I am referring. The importations from Australia and New ZeaThe importation of Ausland, in 1:901, were 415,511 cwts., and, in 1905, 759,751 cwts., an increase of 344,240 cwts., or 17,212 tons. Therefore, while the increase in the importations of butter into Great Britain in the four years between 1901 a.r.d 1905 was 22,248 tons, 17,212 tons of that increase were accounted for by the increased importations from Australia, and New Zealand. That is a very fortunate and very happy circumstance, but it does not justify the statement that 'there is no interference on the ' part of Australia and New Zealand with the British producer. It will be seen that whilst our exports to Great Britain during these years increased very considerably, there was also an increase of 1,138 tons in the importations of butter from foreign countries.

I am quite willing, however, to accept his assurance as regards the figures he quoted. I have just shown that the foreign importations with which our butter is supposed to compete increased, during the years mentioned by the honourable member, from 3,070,905 cwts. in 1901, to 3,093,657 cwts. in 1905. an advance of 1,138 tons -unti l the contrary is proved. the interim. may have been a variation from year to year. able member will find that there was a decrease. under Ihe impression that reference to the figures will show that for some of the intervening years the figures were higher still. When I was speaking about Danish butler, the honourable member said-and I am quoting from HansardThe Danes do not say that the importation of Australian butter lakes the business away from the English producer, but that it takes the business away from them. It was then that I said that I thought the returns' would show that that was not the case. I have since ascertained that my impression was correct. In 1901, the imports from Denmark amounted to 1,597,186 cwts., and in 1905 to 1,630,363 cwts., or an increase of 1,658 tons. I think that in one or two years between those mentioned there was a bigger of imports from Denmark, owing to the drought, during which we exported very little butter. In 1891, when we began to export our butter in considerable quantities, the imports of Danish butter into Great Britain amounted to 876,211 cwts., or about one-half the quantity imported in 1905. Therefore, during the period that our exports to Great Britain were increasing, the Danish exportations, instead of falling off, increased very considerably. If we go further back, we find that, in i88r, Denmark sent to Great Britain only 279,625 cwts., or less than half the quantity exported in i8gt. These figures show that the statements I made in reply to the honourable member were well within the mark. It seems to me that paragraph a is entirely unnecessary. wouHd fulfil the intentions of Ministers I was who aim at dealing with unfair competition and that alone. well. Paragraph b entirely meets that case. It is followed by a number of provisions, which set forth what shall be deemed unfair competition. Paragraph b provides that, for the purposes of the Act, competition shall be deemed to be unfair if the means adopted by the person importing or selling the imported goods are, in the opinion of the Comptroller-General or the Board, as the I think, that the honorcase may be, unfair in the circumstances. The Minister must see that, under paragraph a, he could declare to be unfair I am competition that was not unfair. That provision relates not to unfair -competition, but to successful competition, such as we carry on in the British market. If our exports of butter to Great Britain are increased, will they not probably, or, indeed, certainly, lead to a diminution of 'British products to a corresponding extent? member assume that Great Britain can produce enough for her own consumption? It is well known that she cannot. of Great Britain were producing enough butter before the importations increased. It is not as if our produce were displacing foreign butter. As a matter of fact, our butter is to a greater extent every day takincrease ing the place of that which was produced in Great Britain or Ireland. The English and Irish farmers are thus being compelled to either give up the production of butter) to withdraw from the marketwhich means practically the same thingor to sell their goods at a loss, as the result of what may be regarded as fair competition. I do not think the Minister should insist upon the adoption of paragraph a. Has the Minister decided to adhere to paragraph b of the clause? fication that I intend to submit.

Justice will have the power to call in expert evidence in relation to any particular case; that he will foe able to secure the expert knowledge which he personally lacks, and which is necessary to enable him to equitably decide any case under his consideration. We considered the question of whether or not a permanent Board should be appointed, and we found that such a proposal would not be workable. We also considered the desirableness, of appointing a Board to deal with each specific case as it arose, but that did not appear to foe desirable.

I trust that honourable members opposite will agree to the passing of this provision, for, in my opinion, it is not likely to give rise to any danger. [9.28] I should like to hear the views of the Attorney-General upon this question, which is purely of a technical character. The explanation given by the Minister of Trade and Customs does not clear up the matter. It is quite true thati n clause 15 it is provided that the Minister' may direct a Justice to make an investigation and determination of the question as to whether the goods are being imported with the intention alleged. But when the Justice proceeds to make that inquiry he will be met with an instruction which tells him that he must argue intent if he finds that, in the ordinary circumstances of trade it would probably lead to the Australian goods being no longer produced, being withdrawn from the market, or sold at a loss, unless produced at an inadequate remuneration for labour. member's difficulty, and perhaps I can explain it. to hear the honourable and learned gentleman do so. [9.31], I fully appreciate the difficulty raised by my honourable friend. it is a fair one to raise, and I shall do my best to answer it . The clause with which we are now dealing might be called an interpretation. It defines what is meant by unfair competition. But, having defined it , we must see what use we intend to make of it , and for that we must turn to clause 15, because under clause 14 no powers are given. Under clause 15 we find that the Comptroller-General, in setting the Acti n motion, has to come to the conclusion that the importation is with the intent to destroy or injure an Australian industry by means of unfair competition. the intent by considering the circumstances set out. is not a definition of intent, and that is the distinction. It is a definition of unfair competition. competition may exist, it does not conclude the matter by any means. There must be I am not going intent to destroy the industry, and to destroy it by that means. in clause 15.

I am travelling slightly off the path in order to meet the point raised by the honourable, and learned member for Angas. What he says is correct. There is an alternative, and I have here, already drafted, an amendment which will alter clause 15 so as to readwith intent to destroy or injure any Australian industry by their sale or disposal. I see the honourable ister of Trade and Customs was mistaken. and gets rid of the alternative, but it leaves I shall be glad the other question raised by the honourable member for Parramatta in exactly the same position.

Suppose, we make an algebraic substitution, and read the words into clause 15 thuswith the intent to destroy any Australian industry by the sale or disposal of the imported goods in competition with Australian goods in a manner which, under the ordinary circumstances of trade, would probably lead to those goods being no longer produced, or being withdrawn from the market, or being sold at a loss, unless produced at a lower remuneration for labour. Does my honourable friend see that? knows that the export of our goods to Great Britain must at once disturb and disorganize, to some extent, the trade in similar products of that country. see tint we are not dealing with that at all at the present time. That is covered by another paragraph.

It means, in the ordinary course of trade, if , no matter what you If a man murders may do in the way of improving your machinery, no matter what advanced methods you adopt, how wise your system or how up-to-date it may be, you cannot maintain the Australian industry without giving an inadequate remuneration for labour. We propose, as honourable members are aware, to substitute the word ""inadequate"" for the word "" lower."" I say that you have to assume these things: First of all, an Australian industry which, by the terms of the Bill must, in all cases, be one that is of general benefit to Australian producers, workers, and consumers alike. In the specific words, put in last night, which I do not think carrv the effect much further, but which put the question beyond all doubt, it must be an industry in which the workers receive adequate remuneration, and are not subject to any unfair terms or conditions of employment. Having that industry, which is of general benefit, and is one in which the workers are well treated, then we say that the competition is unfair if goods are imported with the intent, the deliberate intent, to break down that industry by methods which we say are unfair, that is to say, in this instance, methods which no new machinery, good method, or advanced system can avert, and which can only be averted by the lowering of the remuneration of labour to an inadequate honourable friend will amount.

189,Mr Isaacs,"It may be kept in mind,fair, when we are doing it ourselves elsewhere ? are. I think that is a fair answer, though it is immaterial to the Bill what we are doing. We are not going abroad and planting our produce in the Home market with the intent to break down and destroy industries by unfair competition. is the same? vent the importation of goods which would have an injurious effect on our industries if our industries suffer that injury by fair competition-that competition we have to meet, and the Bill offers no obstacle. If foreign countries send their goods here urider our protective Tariff-whic h is intended to meet ordinary: cases, and to provide only for fair competition-and thus lessen our production, we have to bear that, because the Tariff is framed on the basis that we employ advanced methods. I , for one, would do nothing to prevent the necessity for advanced methods, because we ought to be up-to-date; but the Bill declares-rightl y or wrongly; it is a matter of principle-that if , ir. spite cf our Tariff, our advanced methods, and all we can db to keep up-to-date, the only way we can maintain production is by cutting down wages or lengthening the hours of work unduly, the competition is unfair. That is the whole provision in the sub-clause; and under the circumstances I think it is a fair provision. Attorney-General describes is unfair competition, what is fair competition? to be competition that does not necessitate, in spite of all else we can do, lowering the standard of the wage-earner. have no exports. ports, but of what comes into the country. We are. concerned with Australian industries. producers ? that is outside the scope of the Bill. fp.42] I do not think that the Attorney General has met the difficulty. The honourable and learned gentleman, when he [44] argues intent, is assuming, an ordinary actual case; but the Bill goes much further. We have to take info account, not merely the action when committed,, but also the probability of its effect. How are we to argue intent from the mere probabilities of the. case? do that; the sub-clause does not deal with intent. deals with probabilities. deal with intent, because intent is provided for independently. and learned member is now answering his own statement made a little while agothat intentwas provided for later onbut that appears not to be the case. sub-clause the Judge has to argue as to the probabilities of the effect of the importation of goods. The Judge has not to take into account the intention in the actual importation, but he has to consider what will be the probable effect of the importation before it takes place. That is to say, the Judge has to look ahead, and consider the emergencies of the situation; he has to say to himself that, if a certain course is pursued, it may lead to certain results. There is no question of intention; it is simply a sizing up of the whole circumstances surrounding the importation of_ goods. It seems to me impossible to in that way argue any intention. intent by itself. be deduced fromi the mere probabilities of the situation. We can. only judge what a man's intention is when that intention has expressed itself in some concrete act; and the expression of intention in this case would be the actual importation of the goods-ther e could be nothing else from which to argue. No proceeding can take place under the Bill unless a man complains that actual importations are damaging him, or unless he gets to know that importations are in process which will probably damage him by leading to the dislocation and disorganization of his industry. How it is possible to argue any intent from an act which is incomplete, I am. at a loss to understand.

208,Mr Joseph Cook,"Intent cannotwould, lead to simplicity in the administration of the Bill, and would not, so far as I can see, make the measure any less substantially effective, while it would lead to the removal of possible causes of harassment to importers and traders. I take it that so long as substantial justice is done, from the Attorney-General's point of view, there is no desire for harassing restrictions. The sub-clause would lead to almost an infinity of legal argument before a Judge. We may take it that the first .act of the parties interested would be to employ counsel; and if we let the lawyers loose on sub-clause a, to argue the question of probabilities in connection with contingent actions, they would, it seems to me, argue until doomsday. The parties would be in a state of financial collapse before any action could be decided under the subclause. If I could believe that there was any substantial need for the sub-clause, I should not press the matter, neither, I think, would the honourable member for North Sydney. that sub-clause a should be deleted, and the Tudge, or the Comptroller-General, left to decide what, in the circumstances, is unfair competition. Surely such a proposal covers every reasonable ground? After we have set up a tribunal in the shape of a competent Judge, why should we fetter and limit his discretion? Why is there any desire to give a Judge directions? Why not trust the Judge? Court; though I fear very much that it will be a law Court, and not a Court of substantial and rough justice. Let us leave the whole discretion to the Judge, and not tie him with positive directions from those, who, after all, will be laymen, and, perhaps, less able to instruct him-than he will be able to instruct himself from the evidence. I do not see what good this clause can be for the purpose which the Minister has in view, considering the provision later on to which he has referred. For instance, if this sub-clause be deleted, the Tudge will still be left to decide what is unfair in the circumstances-competitio n will still be deemed to be unfair until the contrary is proved, Ori f it probably will, or does in fact, result in lowering the remuneration for labour, in creating substantial disorganization in Australian industries, or in throwing workers out of employment. With all these intimations to the Judge, and with the burden of proof placed on the defendant, there is no need to direct the Judge to regard as improper and unfair, the acts mentioned in sub-clause a. Before leaving this question, I should like to say that I think the Minister had better have said nothing about Great Britain. Wlhen legislative effect is given to this clause, we shall be setting up a law imposing restrictions against Great Britain which, if she reciprocated, would absolutely ruin our export trade. This clause will stand absolutely as the reversion, entire and complete, as between Great Britain and ourselves of the motto, "" Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them."" seems to me, in considering this clause, that if , taking the contention of the Opposition as correct, we assume that what is meant by "" unfair competition "" is "" successful "" competition, and then follow I suggest very strongly out the effect, we shall find that "" the in-, tent"" to which the Attorney-General has referred is no safeguard whatsoever. Any one in the mother country competing with a protected industry in Australia, and finding that his yearly sales in this country were becoming greater and greater, must, if he were a man of ordinary common sense, realize that he was detrimentally affecting the productions of the Australian protected industry with which he competed. He must realize that the goods in that industry were being no longer produced, or were being withdrawn from the market, or were being sold at a loss, or were being produced at an inadequate remuneration) for labour, whenever His sales were becoming greater, that he was injuring the industry, and, therefore, according to this Bill, was guilty of ""unfair competition."" In that case, what"" has the Judge to do? It is his duty to investigate and determine whether the imported goods are being imported with the ""intention aforesaid."" I have just shown that if fhe importer is successful, he must be aware that he is guilty of what this Bill defines as ""unfair competition."" Therefore I say that the word "" intent"" in the Bill, on which the Attorney-General has dwelt, is absolutely no safeguard against abuse. If we wish absolutely to prohibit importations from abroad that might compete with some protected industry, the most open and straightforward method is to pass a law absolutely prohibiting the importation of the",30,Thomson Th E Clause Lowering Of The Wages Of The Wage Earning

We are describing as "" unfair competition "" what is simply successful competition. We are preventing the home manufacturer in Great Britain, under penalties, from dealing in' our markets. In attempting in this way_ to strike at successful competition, we are simply guilty of a mean sham. When we sell our produce cheaper in England than we sell it in this country, is not that "" un fair competition"" within the meaning of this Bill? When we grow wheat on our cheaper lands, ""and under our better climatic conditions, and send that wheat under cheap freights over our local railways and over the seas, and when we know that by so competing we very detrimentally affect the home grower of wheat, are we not guilty, according to our own. definition, of "" unfair competition "" ? But we claim that that is very successful and legitimate trade. agree that it is. But if it is legitimate for us to do these things, ought we not to say that it is equally legitimate for those at the other end of-the world? If we wish to stop them from competing in our* markets, why, in the name of common sense, do we not say, "" We are not going to trick with words; we are not going to employ legal quibbles; we shall absolutely prevent your' products from reaching our shores; we believe that your trade is successful ; we do not want it to be successful ; we are going to stop it in a straightforward, honest way.""

If we are afraid to preach a policy of open meanness to the mother country, honourable members. I ought .not to do mean things towards her in a surreptitious way.

I do not think it will help the great party which he so ably leads if he were to make it known to the people of Australia that he regards his love of the Imperial connection or the great people from whom we are sprung as a mere senti' ment.

No decent men with a sense of read as follows:' For the purposes of this part of the Act comfor such a purpose. petition shall be deemed to be unfair if the means adopted by the person importing or selling the imported goods are, in the opinion of the Comptroller-General or the Justice, as the case may be, unfair in the circumstances. That, I think, would meet the whole case, and, therefore, I heartily support the amendment. [10.2] -Knowing the purpose for which the Bill is introduced, we must oppose any clause of this kind. attempts to make us believe that the great object of the measure is to look after the interests of the workers-in ether words, to prevent goods from being imported with the result that the wages of the workers might be reduced. That is the idea which Ministers wish the public to have, when they know full well that the one great object is to help the manufacturers. Last night they opposed an amendment which would make it clear, that the workers were to get some advantage until the Labour Party began to talk, and then the Minister of Trade and Customs crawled ir.to his hole and assented to the amendment. I wish the hypocrisy of these men to be known. They are describing as unfair competition that which is absolutely reasonable. The object is to prevent persons who are importing goods under fair conditions from fompeting with men in the States. Take the case of the gentlemen in whose interests the Bill is introduced-and it is of no use for Ministers to attempt to deny that it is introduced to benefit men who are' making a fortune every year from the manufacture and sale of harvesters-the Government were afraid to wait until the report of the Tariff Commission was available to assist honourable members in coming in a decision on these matters. I know that before that bodv the gentlemen at whom the Bii: is aimed gave evidence to the effect that in comnarison with Australian manufacturers they paid more for their material, paid higher wn.ges. and manufactured more cheaply, because they specialized more, and used more and better machinery. Because our local manufacturers do not specialize to a greater extent and put in better machinery the gieat public of the Commonwealth are to be penalized by the stopping of such competition on the ground that it is unfair. The idea is an outrage upon common sense and honour would introduce a Bill of this kind The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr not make a remark of that kind. I ask him to withdraw it. I can think it all the same. How can we say that a man intends to do a thing which may bring about a certain effect? If we say that he intends to bring about a certain effect, that is all right. But how The Minister can we say that the intent is really there, simply because the action may bring about a certain effect? The thing is simply ridiculous. I anticipate that what will be done is to get a new kind of X-ray, so that we may be able to see what a man's intent is. If they had only made the invention before bringing in the Bill, it might have been useful. I am against every, clause in the Bill, 1 especially this one which the honourable member for North Sydney seeks to omit. In every class of machinery continuous improvements are being made. Manufacturers in the older countries, with their larger production and population, are able to adopt every improvement at once. But. with our smaller production and population, it does not pay our manufacturers to adopt improvements as they come out. Ofttimes we find our manufacturers employing obsolete machinery, and simply because it would not pay them to change their machinery as often as improvements are made, the great body of the public, the millions, have to suffer for the sake of a few. Legislation is, or ought to be, intended to benefit the larger number. Certainly the greater number should be considered in framing legislation of this kind. At the end of the clause I should like to put in a proviso that the Act shall not be put in force in favour of any industries where an examination of the accounts shows that they are making a fair profit. 1 think that the Minister should not object to that. If the Justice is to be directed as tointention, and as to what is unfair trade, he should also be directed to investigate the accounts of those who ask for the intervention of the Minister, with a view to ascertaining whether, although seeking to prevent competition, they are not really making large profits, as those in whose interests the Bill has been introduced are doing to-day.",32,Thomson Th E Clause Lowering Of The Wages Of The Wage Earning

Ministers do not listen to reason in this matter. I ask honourable members to consider the absurdity of this provision.

325,Mr Lonsdale,"Compared with thetury was to prevent manufacturers and others imposing on the public, whereas, silly Bills of this kind would not allow people to get goods at a fair price, or at the price at which the manufacturer is prepared to sell. In Australia we have the Customs duties, and there is also the cost of transport; and this kind of legislation is utterly absurd. Although a compact has been made that this (Bill shall be passed ;through the Committee stage during this week, I nevertheless think it is an outrage to allow the measure to slip through. I hope fhe Minister of Trade and Customs will pay a little respect to what is right and proper, and omit this clause. the word "" foreign,"" I understand that the provision is drawn from the Sherman Act. under the Sherman Act, mean anything outside the United States. Under this Bill, I understand, the word will not include other parts of the British Empire and the United Kingdom. Australia. there is a "" foreign "" jurisdiction, but it is a straining of the meaning of the word; and I think the meaning ought to be confined to markets outside the Empire. in the Bill, and I accept the explanation of the Attorney-General. doubt the "" f a i r foreign market value"" ought to be the value at the place of. exportation. As the honourable member for Casio has pointed out, it might be the value at any place, and there is no provision in this part of the Bill, which is not incorporated with the Customs Act, for proving what the market value is. I do not know that this part of the clause matters very much, seeing that the onus of proof is on the prosecuting party. All the facts have to be proved by the informant; and when sufficient prima facie evidence is produced, then comes in the defence to show that the competition is not unfair. I think the draftsman has forgotten to be specific as to what is ""foreign,"" and has also forgotten to incorporate the Customs Act of 1891, [45]3 under which bills of lading or invoices may be prima facie evidence of value. I do not think that the provision will help the Government very much, because, as the honourable member for North Sydney has pointed out, it is absurd. I think that if the Minister would take out fhe word "".foreign"" and let the clause read "" a fair profit upon their market value "" it would be improved. If the words "" f a ir foreign market value"" are left in, the clause would mean that, although off-season good's were depreciated in the old country, they could not be sold here at a fair profit upon their actual cost. Sydney) [ n . 11] I can see the greatest objection to any Government fixing the price of goods. The effect will simply be to force up prices against the public. Who can say what_ is a fair profit in any industry? One' per cent, would be a fair profit in some'lines of trade, and 50 per cent, would not be too much in other businesses. Why should we insert a provision imposing upon the Comptroller-General the obligation to decide what are fair profits ? does not decide anything. 15 the words "" with the intention aforesaid "" are used.
