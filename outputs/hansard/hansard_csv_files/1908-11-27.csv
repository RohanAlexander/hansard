Can the Minister of External Affairs inform the House whether the Premier of Queensland or any other person has applied for permission to indent labour? Is the honourable gentleman aware that the current rate of wages in the industry referred to is 30s. a week and keep?

So far as I am aware, no request such as he refers to has been made by the Premier of Queensland, though I shall inquire whether an application has been received by the Department from him or any other person. I ask the honourable member to give notice of his remaining questions. Mr J. H. CATTS asked the Minister representing the Minister of Defence, upon no/ice1. In view of the new syllabus for cadet training recently approved by the Military Board and the Minister for Defence, which lays down physical training as the basis of instruction, does he not think the appo ntment of instiuctors with the following qualifications woidd place every cadet within the reach of an efficient training :(a) Fair military and educational attainments. (4) Special knowledge of physical culture. (ir) Preferably teachers who have been instructed in the methods of the inculcation of knowledge to boys? 2. Is it a fact that persons applying for positions of instructors are asked to submit to an examination in topography, military engineering, and tactics? 3. What have these qualifications to do with physical training for Boys? 4. Do not these facts lend colour to the suspicion that the positions of instructors for cadets are being conserved for the present officers of the Military Department? as follow :1. ia) Yes. (4) Yes. With regard to (c), Yes, other things being equal. The following number of officers and non-commissioned officers of the Cadet Instructional Staff previously served in Education Departments :Officers, eight out of nine appointed. Non-commissioned omcers, four out of nine appointed. The five appointments of non-commissioned officers were filled by qualified candidates from the Permanent Forces, there being no qualified applicants from amongst teachers for these positions. 2. Officers of the Cadet Instructional Staff aTe required to pass in these subjects-thi s is essential for the reasons that they are eligible for transfer to the Instructional Staff of the C. M . Forces, and the knowledge of the subjects 'n question is therefore requisite. [90]2 Non-commissioned officers of the CadetI nstructional Staff require to pass in the following special military subjects :Map reading and field sketching (practical only). Elementary tactics; the examination being of the same standard as for an Instructor of the Commonwealth Militarv Forces. These non-commissioned officers are also eligible for transfer to the Instructional Staff of the C. M . Forces. 3. These qualifications are necessary for the reasons stated in paragraph 2. 4. No, as the majority of appointments are made from teachers, as will be seen from the statement in 1. POST AN D TELEGRAP H POST OFFICE. General, upon notice1.

The whole of the States have been subdivided for Commonwealth registration purposes in such a manner that the registration areas adopted can be utilized for both Commonwealth and State purposes. 2. Arrangements have been completed with the States of Tasmania in relation to the preparation, maintenance, and printing of joint rolls. The Government of the State of South Australia is introducing amending legislation with a view to securing a large measure of co-operation with the Commonwealth. The Governments of the States of New South Wales and Western Australia have under consideration proposals involving amending legislation agreed upon at conferences between .the chief Commonwealth and State electoral oflicials. The Government of the State of Queensland is sympathetically considering proposals submitted by the Commonwealth, and representations have been made to the Government of the State of Victoria (in which State a measure providing for adult suffrage has recently been passed) as to the desirableness of electoral co-operation. 3. The Commonwealth Government is now awaiting the decision of the Governments of the States of New South Wales, Queensland, Western Australia, and Victoria as to the nature of the legislation which they are prepared to submit as a result of the conferences between their representatives and the representative of the Commonwealth. I have a longer memorandum on the subject, which I shall be happy to show to the honourable member, or to anv other honourable member, who may be interested in it. That leave be given to bring in a B ill for an Act to amend the law relating to Parliamentary elections. , Debate resumed from 26th November (vide page 2346) on motion by Mr That, on each sitting day, until otherwise ordered, Government business shall take precedence of general business. listened attentively to the speeches which have been made on this motion. Personally, I desire that Government business shall always take precedence of private business. Previous speakers have commenced their remarks by saying how glad they are to see the present Ministers in office; that a better lot of men could not be found; but although they began by being pleasant, they proceeded to do what they could 10 strangle those whom they had flattered. I call such conduct humbugging. It may not be a 'nice thing to say, but it is my way to speak so. I wish the Ministry a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. I think that Ministers will enjoy that; but they have a very trying winter ahead of them. There will be a financial frost. The late Treasurer was very clever in getting out when he did. He, as well as any man, knows when to disappear. No doubt the Deakin Ministry was not particularly sorry to be relieved of certainfinancial obligations. The present Prime Minister is a Scotchman. I knew that without being told. It will take him all his time to get together the bawbees necessary to pay the expense of managing the ship of State. A fortnight ago the present Ministers had power, but were without responsibility, now the exMinisters have the power and the presentMinisters the responsibility. They have proposed to carry out the remnant of a programme put forward by their predecessors. In any case I should have voted for the measures contained in that programme, so that, as my concern is the public interest, the change of Ministry has not affected my position. As I regard these measures as good, I should have voted for them under the Deakin Administration, and shall do so now that the Fisher Administration is in power. I am glad that the Manufactures Encouragement Bill is to be proceeded with, although I .regret that the Ministry proposes to amend it to provide for the nationalization of the iron industry.

I have had quite enough in listening to them, and have never lent myself to them in either State or Federal politics, nor have I any burning desire to engage in the washing of dirty political linen. Those who like those tactics can adopt them. Personally, I do not care for them. The Ministry are in office, and The Treasurer has the method by which they got there is their own concern. I think they got there just as respectably as do most Ministries in the Federal Parliament. I have heard it said in the past that no Ministry should sit on those benches unless they have a majority in their own ranks. That is a very fine idea which I hope will be lived When he up to in the near future in this Parliament. But since the beginning of Federation we have never had a. Ministry that lived on those benches without some alliance or agreement or outside support. In the same way the present Ministry cannot live an hour without support from outside sources.

That may be a foolish attitude, and it is one which perThey have had haps few honourable members opposite dare to adopt themselves. When I hear Ministers boasting of the growth of their party, their success at the polls, their past and present strength, and their future intentions, I may be permitted to make a little boast on my own account.

No one can deny that he has earned it, for he has been most attentive to his duties in this ber. side the Labour ranks whom the Labour organs attack more severely than the honourable member for Parramatta-and to sav he has come from their own ranksthere is no question regarding his ability or quickness, or attention to public affiairs. A singular fact, which shows that the highest positions in the land are open to able men, no matter what their occupations may be, is that the early occupation of the present Prime Minister was that of a miner, while the leader of the direct Opposition also comes from a similar walk of life. It is a splendid testimony to the liberal and democratic nature of representative in Australia man to rise to the highest in public affairs. required in this country. honourable member for Parramatta uses the vinegar bottle a little more than he oueht to, but in his speech of yesterday there was no evidence of acid drops. danger I apprehend is founded upon my experience that when you start with a hvmn you generally end with a riot. that will not happen in this case. began yesterday with a very good Christian spirit, and I hope the riot is still far of f .

The only additional announcement that I could have expected in the interests of the workers was a foreshadowing by them of the work that they intended to do next session. But the present position strikes another blow at the fiction of the Governor General's speech. Now that we are abandoning parliamentary fictions, even in regard to the selection of Ministries, I hope that the present Labour Administration will admit that the Governor General's speech for next session is alinstitutions ready written for them. Their Leagues that it is open to any have written it. It is in their platform, position that there is no need to wait till next No family influence is session for it.

In my own case I do not admit the right of any Labour League to dictate to me my views on questions of radical thought. In any case the Labour Leagues cannot claim with any truth that their platform is original. They have simply adapted it. When they talk about people stealing their platform, or niching some of their socialistic proposals, they should be reminded that much of what they advocate has been stolen by them from a document over 1,900 years -old-the Sermon on the Mount.

All I ask is that they should not be so hypocritical as to pretend to follow H i m . I admire the man who lives the life of the Master; but I find the Labour Party have as much human nature about them as 1 have myself. politics only as an aggressive force; as soon as they become politically respectable in the Ministerial position, they lose hold of the class of the people to whom they appeal. They dare not take the measures which appear on their platform, and so alter them as to make them acceptable to this House, because they must always act in the capacity of reformers, and cannot afford to bend or truckle to any interests. They have described themselves as political Ishmaelites, and we know that Ishmaelites are never in the clover field. However, all that is the concern of the Labour Party, ancl I fancy that the financial problem is the one with which the Prime Minister will have the greatest trouble. The late Treasurer seems to have an instinct which gets him out of trouble, and he ought to be very happy at being relieved of the financial burden at this stage. But how the present Government are to introduce satisfactory financial proposals without instituting more drastic taxation I cannot understand; and such taxation would mean the end of them as'a Ministry. I suppose that human nature will cause the present Ministry to hang 011 to the sweets of office, and I fancy that the only excuse they will be able to offer will be that they satisfactorily administered the Departments. Tlie Labour Party are politically very ""cute,"" and they may say that^ despite the opinions expressed by newspapers, they are able to administer the Departments, and, therefore, should be allowed to remain in I s the accompanypower. If that be the view they take, the sooner we know the fact the better. I refuse to ber advise the Labour Party to take that view ?

The statements made by newspapers in this conmexion are, in my opinion, very cruel; and it may be that the party will the honourable endeavour to prove that they are capable of efficient administration, and thus worthy of being retained in their present place. But do the Ministers propose to administer the Departments themselves, or will they be content to be merely the echo of the heads of Departments? Personally I think that the Government can do more good for Australia by sound financial and general administration than by introducing fresh and showy legislation, of which the people have probably had more than they can The party can live i'n. digest. The Attorney-General boasted of the success of the Labour Party in Australia, and though he is quite justified i h doing so, his statements require a little examination. As a matter of fact,"" the most noticeable and profitable feature of the Political Labour League is the brand of ""Labour"" which fhey have made their own. The leagues of themselves could hardly return a single member to this House; and they have to rely on a strong popular sympathetic vote, which is given to them simoly because no other party in Australia has brought forward a federalized programme of a progressive character.

No party can live, or deserve to live, in Australia unless it has a radical and advanced programme; and I am looking for a leader to place such a programme before us. In this respect the Labour Party has a distinct advantage. Labour electors, whether they be in Port Darwin, Melbourne, Perth, or Sydney, have one political faith, ancl work with military precision and solidarity. This has made them so powerful in the past. On the other hand, a Liberal of New South Wales would be regarded in Tasmania as a most advanced Radical, and there is a similar distinction as between the Liberal of the and were only too glad to come under the small State and the Liberal of Victoria. conservative than Tasmania.

In Victoria a Liberal is a protectionist, whereas in New South Wales he is a free-trader, wlio believes in a reduction of taxation on all necessaries of life, and recourse to other methods of raising revenue; and that is the policy to which the honourable member for Calare used to subscribe. It is a waste of time to wrangle whether the man who advocates duties of 25 per cent., or the man who advocates duties of 30 per cent., should be regarded as a Liberal; if they are held to represent different classes of political thought, they are not worth wasting time over. orable member's Liberal friends tell us that duties of 25 per cent, are good free trade.

If in the various States, in years gone by, there had been an active Libera'l force, there would have been no necessity for a Labour Party. But the people were afraid of the Conservatives, Labour banner, which offered some hope of progress. The only Liberal leader that I can discern in this House is the late Prime Minister. I was not returned to either support or oppose that honourable gentleman; and all I could do was to vote for legislation in which I believed, whether introduced by his or any other party; and I am in that position to-day. If the present Prime Minister introduces legislation of which I approve, I shall, of course, vote for it ; .but I ask for no immunity from opposition by the Labour Party or any other party at any time. If I desired to work with the Labour Party, the only course open to me would be to resign my seat and submit myself to my constitutents; and I ask for no consideration on the strength of my supporting any measures which the Government may introduce.

On the contrary, I am proud to be in this House as a free man, exercising my judgment in regard to liberal thought and progressive legislation. The honourable member for Parramatta and myself are very old friends; but if , in the course of politics, he thinks I am wrong, let him or his party oppose me. I have heard appeals made here for a re-arrangement of parties; but I do not believe in re-arrangements for the convenience of members or of Parliament. The battle has to be won outside; and the most capable leader is he who has the largest number of followers. Aus-' tralian thought of to-day is anxiously awaiting for a man to lead; and the people do not desire mere showy oratorical or other parliamentary gifts, but a man in whom they can believe. The fact of my not being a member of a political Labour League does not prevent my adopting radical and progressive views.

The late Prime Minister introduced some legislation for which I voted, and I of the members of which are not prepared to vote for measures which I should favour. I am awaiting the coming of a leader who will put forward such a policy as I desire. My hope is that instead of having in New South Wales one able man striking a certain note in politics, and another equally able man striking an altogether different one, we shall have a strong leader striking a liberal note for the whole of Australia. It will then be for the people to decide between his party and the Labour Party. In the past the Labour Party have done their best and their worse, and can do no more. I have heard honourable members talk about friendships in this House, and I think that I may safely say that I have as many friends amomrst the members of the Labour Party as have most honourable members.

Probably they believe that in the multitude of councillors there is wisdom, and are pleased therefore to be directed by their leagues; but I certainly should not like to occupy such a position.

The motion is similar to one which I submitted a fortnight ago to concentrate the attention of honourable members upon the business to be transacted before the Christmas prorogation, and I should not speak upon it but for the opportunity to reply In a few sentences to some statements from members of the Opposition, avoid the need for replying to their -charges at a later stage, though it may not prevent a repetition of tbem. The idea that the members of the late Government should display emotions of regret, mingled with exasperation, because of their -displacement, can be entertained only by those who forget the extraordinary cir-sumstances prevailing during the whole of this and of the last Parliament. The House being divided into three or four political sections, none of which has a majority, it has been necessary, to enable the government of the country to be carried on, for two of these parties to act together. Tn mv replv to a motion of want of confidence moved a month ago. I spoke at some length of the difficulties occasioned by such a, situation. Last Parliament the Labour Party arrived at a resolution, which they made public, to give a general support to the Government when it assumed office. We afterwards received no other assurances of the kind. During this Parliament there was only a tacit understanding that the Ministerial and the Labour Parties would co-operate so long as both should think expedient. Under these extraordinary circumstances, the work of the session was transacted until a fortnight ago, when, on the 6th November, the leader of the Labour Party made an important announcement to the House. The co-operation of two parties was necessary for the conduct of business, but each The workers are remained independent of the other, exercising a separate judgment as to the course it would follow. These exceptional' circumstances supply a sufficient answer to the exclamations of surprise that we should be neither exasperated by what has occurred, nor feel called upon to show the When the dissenslightest personal animus towards those who have displaced us. Again, none of our crtics has pointed out that when the leader of the Labour Party made his announcement of severance he stated the reasons which actuated him and his followers. He mentioned, what had been obvious, that "" from time to time embarrassing circumstances had arisen."" I interpret that to mean "" in this House."" had been "" situations of embarrassment."" He spoke, too, of the "" restraint that a large partu such as his must feel in difficult circumstances."" That was the second This will reason for the action which he was taking. The restraint has been real. He also said that he had ""endeavoured to restrain within reasonable grounds adverse criticism within his own following,"" and, being unable to do so longer, had arrived at the determination of which he was informing the House, that from this out our paths must divide. His was a sufficient, plain, straightforward, and truthful statement. learned member is easily pleased. had to judge for itself. I am not defending the decision of the Labour Party, or saying that the course which it has followed was the best, or that its last action is wise; it is sufficient for me that its members considered it wise.

The leader of the Labour Party was under no obligation to make excuses for his .conduct, and, under the circumstances, could have taken no more straightforward or considerate course. He might have been justified in moving a direct motion of want of confidence, but evidently felt that, having regard to the relations which had subsisted between his party and ours, some more marked divergence of views would have been necessary to call for such action. Instead of striking at us, he frankly gave the reasons why it had been resolved to end the tacit understanding between us. I cannot but suspect that honourable membersopposite who look for the display of acrimony on our part have given some acceptance to the current fables about the relations between the two parties. The honourable member for Wide Bay has been pictured as a tyrant who dictated to our Cabinet the measures which we should propose, and our handling of them.

We cannot avoid being judged by this standard, and we ought to be judged by it. For my own part, I was reluctant to join in this debate, simply because it appeared to me we should gain nothing by it. Seeing the shortness of time in which we have to dispose of a considerable amount of practical business, and the desirability of getting to that business without further delay, my colleagues and myself hastened the vote which has placed that business in other hands.

There are strong evidences that he had no authority to pledge his party. Although the late Prime Minister may or may not have given any such intimation to the Government as I have indicated, the honourable member for Laanecoorie, the honourable member for Corio, and the honourable member for Mernda, have declared that the moment the Government introduce their labour programme, they will be put out of office. Of course, if the Government are prepared to accept the situation and do nothing for the remainder of the life of the present Parliament, their tenure of office may be secure. However that may be, the position is very unsatisfactory, not only to this House, but to the people of Australia. As a matter of fact, the Government are now living on a policy of scuttle; but, in my opinion, they will be compelled to bring their programme before Parliament, and we know that they will not survive the first test vote. What is our position so far as the electors are concerned? We have done little or nothing during the present year; and the Government propose to go into recess, and, five or six months' hence, bring down their programme, on which they are doomed to defeat. All honourable members, except those twenty-seven of the Labour Party, were fleeted to oppose that programme at the first ancl every opportunity; the defeat of the Government next session will mean another change; and, with an approaching the Opposition had general election, nothing will be done during next year.

MrM c WILLIAMS It is a question, not of the Labour Party carrying out their programme now, but of their having the courage to say that they intend to propose next session the legislation that they were elected to secure.

Said that he desired to see an organization formed to fight the Labour Party and its programme. One of the highest tributes that could be paid to our programme is the fact that members of other parties have become tired of those which they have been supporting, and are crying for a new platform and a new organization. We are here first and foremost to give legislative effect to the programme in which we believe, but, as honourable members are aware, we have only a fortnight in which to pass certain necessary measures before the present session closes. It is. absolutely necessary that we should deal first of all with the Estimates, yet we are asked why we have not come forward with what may be described as a Tom Mann programme. Had we done so, we should have delighted the Opposition and the Opposition corner party. I can well imagine the jubilation of the Conservative press if such a programme had been submittedThey would have said, ""Have we not declared again and again that if the Labour Party were in office they would not be able to carry out any legislation, and would' attempt the impossible.

The Labour Party is quite as competent to administer the affairs of the Commonwealth as is any other party. In looking at the history of the Labour Party, I have been somewhat amused by the objections that have always been urged against itstaking possession of the Treasury bench. We have invariably been told that we should"" drive capital out of the country. During this debate, however, we have heard nothing of that cry, and I think we may take it that our opponents now recognise that it is wholly unfounded, and have given it up. wool has already increased ! that Australian stocks have also gone up. Surely it cannot be said that the confidence of the commercial world in Australia has been shaken by our taking office. The one complaint of the Opposition is .that we will not attempt the impossible. There seems to be a feeling in certain quarters that we are ignorant of'finance; that we are familiar with the process of pawning a bonnet, a biooch, or a dress ring, but that we should find it impossible to control the finances of the Commonwealth. I am willing to admit that our party is absolutely ignorant of financial jugglery. We freely give to those who are staunch supporters of the Opposition the palm for financial jugglery, for watering stock, and for questionable finance all along the line. We freely yield to them pride of place in creating prices and dragging money out of the pockets of the people by means of trusts, and it is to fight their abominable finance that we are here.

It has amused me, as a student of these things, to hear the progress of Australia spoken of as if we were concerned only with the wealthy and prosperous. The interests of the people have been left out of sight, and it remains for our party to bring them to the front. We hope to have the assistance of Parliament in passing honest financial proposals. We see the rocks ahead. The last Government, had it remained in power, would have found it difficult to steer past them. Many adjustments must lie made between the States and Commonwealth before the financial outlook can be clear and hopeful. The payment of old age pensions will need somefinancing,and we know the position of the Post Office. I have complained of the present state of affairs there, and shall continue to do so. I shall treat this Government as harshly as any other, if it does not take all means in its power to provide an efficient postal service, especially in the country districts. I have always opposed the idea that country postal services should be made to pav. That is an injustice to the pioneers who go into the country, and face all the hardships of the position. Then, too, the question of defence must be kept in sight. I regard it as criminal to make no provision for the defence of a continent containing 3,000,000 square miles. Defence preparations will absorb some of our cash at a later date. But the Government will not falter when the time comes. to bring forward its proposals, and, if necessary, will suggest direct taxation. I hope to see a land tax imposed, and I desire also the establishment of a Cornwon wealth National Bank. We have not exhausted our sources of revenue. Hitherto we have been satisfied with the revenue from the Customs and Excise duties; but as the Tariff becomes more effective, that will diminish. Still, we must have money to carry on the government of the country. Tn addition to the special expenditure which T have suggested, large funds will 'be necessary for the development of the Northern Territory and the making of the Transcontinental railway. All these works will he proposed in their proper order. It wonld hp ridinilruis to urge that they -should be brought forward within a fortnight.

It is ridiculous for honourable members opposite to trv to make it appear that the members of the Labour Partv think that they can give effect to their platform within six months or a year Our programme is for the future, and our supporters outside know that we shall give effect to it as quickly as we are permitted to do so. Unfortunately, we are in a minority, and until our supporters increase, the giving of effect to the measures which we advocate must be delayed. The new leader of the Opposition has my warm congratulations. He is the right man in the right place, having earned his position by hard work. I pay him that tribute, though I disagree with his politics, and shall have to oppose him. I cannot but think what a keen reader of the times the brainy ex-leader of the Opposition is. But some shred of his mantle has falleni upon his successor, who yesterday stated that he would have nothing to do with an anti-Labour programme. If we can convert the whole Opposition to the Labour programme, we shall be able to sit as one party. The late leader of the Opposition discovered that he made a mistake in fighting a campaign on the anti-Socialism issue. What he meant by anti-Socialism was anti-Labour. He tried to frighten the electors, and having fooled them so long, thought he could fool them for ever. In the days when h did hise best work, he had the support of the Labour Partv, and he knows that when he left it_ his path was full of pitfalls.

He puts his foot quietly in the stirrup, after gathering up the reins, and raises himself slowly and carefully until he gets his leg across.

I am looking to the future; and, in my opinion, this country must pass through a period of Labour domination. I am glad that this is a young country, f u l l of wealth and resources; because this will enable it , if necessary, to make a grand recovery. However, it must pass through the fire before it fulfils its destiny. It is evident to me that, if once the Labour Party get seated firmly on the Treasury benches, they will continue their policy of one step at a time; but, in the meantime, with a sort of runawayknock at the door, they are creeping into recess. What is the policy which the Government present to us ? We are to have brought before us the Federal Capital Site and other questions upon which we are practically agreed, though, unfortunately, the Government do not appear to be so unanimous in regard to the Capital site as Their cry is, I should wish.

We can. have no immigration policy until we have a High Commissioner; but the object of the Labour Party is to close the doors of Australia against immigrants.

I should like some honourable members in the Opposition corner to follow his example, and when they had done so, I should be glad if an honourable member with a mind of his own came forward to lead one united party-the anti-socialistic party-wit h against the minority which now without rhyme or reason occupies the Treasury bench. not intended to take part in this debate, but having listened to so many comments on the situation, I feel inclined to add a moiety of my own. No very brilliant light has been thrown upon the road by which this Parliament certainly progress much more expeditiously than it has done to perform the duties which the country requires of it. The honourable member for Ballarat expressed the opinion that we had now a favorable opportunity to get on with the business of the country; but the honourable member for Franklin, who succeeded him, urged that before it could properly be proceeded with, the present Labour Ministry would have to be driven from office. I inquired, by way of interjection, whether we should be any better off as a Parliament if the present Ministry were out of office, but the honourable member did not condescend to enlighten us. It appears to me that even if the Labour Government be driven from office, the problem of managing the affairs of the Commonwealth with expedition, and with that thoroughness which is demanded of the Parliament, will be no nearer solution than it has been for some time. been playing the game of the ins and the outs to a degree that has been demoralizing to the Parliament as a whole, and has created a considerable measure of dissatisfaction throughout the continent. In view of the fact that a motion, which I have on the business-paper, cannot be reached this session, by reason of the Government having taken over the time usually allotted to private members' business, I wish to point out briefly its appositeness to the situation, as has been indicated by many honourable members, during this debate. The motion reads ber will not be in order in discussing that motion. that the motion has automatically disappeared from the business-paper owing to the fact that the time usually allotted to private members' business has been appropriated by the Government. a workmanlike majority ber will see that although that may be the result, all that is proposed by the motion before the House is not to remove from the business-paper notices of motion given by private members, but simply to give precedence to Government business. The standing order which precludes the anticipation of debate upon a motion on the business-paper must still prevail. the moment, sir, that the motion by the must proceed. It must Prime Minister that Government business should take precedence over private members' business had not yet been carried. the honourable member's party is to pass the motion. serious politics in this House, and if [ could close my ears to frivolous interjections, no doubt I should be able to do so much better. It appears to me that this is the proper time to urge upon honourable members the necessity and advantage of a reform which in another country was adopted for exactly the same reasons that are presenting themselves to honourable members to-day. I am afraid, however, that in view of your ruling, Mr Speaker, I shall be unable now to discuss the question of elective Ministries, as I had hoped to do. I shall only point out that there is undoubtedly a method by which we may overcome the difficulty with which we are at present confronted. It is a difficulty We have, undoubtedly, that has confronted other Parliaments in precisely similar conditions, and the method that they have adopted to overcome it has undoubtedly been successful in facilitating the business of the country and in ending the demoralizing state of affairs in which principles are merely the cards with which politicians play for office. I hope on another occasion to be able to discuss the question more fully. If this Government goes out of office, I trust that I shall be able to give honourable members an opportunity to manifest their patriotism and",33,William Lyne Th E Honourable

I am confident that if the election of Ministries this afternoon. were conducted on the floor of the House, in the full light of day, just as you, Mr Speaker, are elected to the Chair, the result would be the return to office of men capable of carrying out their duties, and that Parliament would be enabled to push on with its work.

In that way, we should have a safeguard, to a large extent, against such methods as the honourable member suggests. I do not wish to take up the time of the House any longer, since I am ""cribb'd, cabin'd, and confined?"" by parliamentary procedure in discussing this matter in its fullest aspects; but I would seriously ask the House to consider whether there is not some effective method of getting out of the present political impassea method which I believe the country will demand before very long ,as one of the absolute necessities to which we are so constantly subjected.

Thus they will be ground between the upper and the nether mill-stones. member for Ballarat attempted this morning to saddle upon the Opposition the responsibility for the change of Government, and, to do so, indulged in a retrospect of our proceedings. But he went back only to the 6th of this month, the day on which the honourable member for Wide Bav made his statement that the Labour Party had withdrawn its support from the Government. But that was not far enough. It is necessary to go back about a fortnight further, when the right honourable member for East Sydney, having moved a motion affirming that the Deakin Administration did not possess the confidence of the House because its financial proposals were unsatisfactory, to which, with his concurrence, I moved the amendment that their old-age pensions proposals were also unsatisfactory, the members of the Labour Party voted with the Government against both motion and amendment, thus declaring their confidence in the Government, and their satisfaction with its financial proposals in general, and its inadequate provision for old-age pension proposals in particular. A few days after doing so, the Labour Party, without giving any reason for' doing so, turned the Deakin Administration out of office. Yet the honourable and learned member for Ballarat had the temerity to taunt the Opposition with not having taken action to prevent the Labour Party from occupying the Treasury bench. Party had refused to co-operate with us in turning out the Deakin Government, and had asserted its confidence in that Government, what support could the leader of the Opposition expect for a second motion of want of confidence within a day or two of the first, when the position of affairs was exactly the same? We on this side were pledged to vote against the socialistic proposals of the Labour Party, and against the Deakin Administration. The accidental consequence of our vote, that the Labour Ministry was put into office, was beyond our control. d We did not know what the Governor General would do. That could at best be merely a matter of conjecture, and it was our duty to consider only what was the right course for us to pursue. Having yesterday declared we had no confidence in the Government, we could not, like the Labour Party, without any change in conditions having occurred in the meantime, stultify ourselves by deThe honourable and learned claring to-day that we had confidence in the same Government. A Labour Ministry, however, having come into power, we have now to consider what next to do. Tn the present temper of the House, it is impossible to remove the Government from office. While the honourable and learned member for Ballarat and his friends give the Government their support, unwillingly even though that support be given, it would be useless for us to move a motion of want of confidence, much as some of us would like to do so. Ministers have been asked their reasons for bringing about a change of Go-' vernment a few days after expressing confidence in the former Administration, whose programme and policy had not been in any way altered; but nothing has been said on the subject, and we have been left to form our own conclusions from the rumours which have reached us as to the dissension between the moderate and extreme socialistic sections of the Labour Party, of which the latter has succeeded in getting its way. Was the change brought about to expedite socialistic legislation? Common-senee replies, No. Had the Labour Partv wished to expedite the passing of the measures on the programme of the Deakin Government, it would have left that Government in office, because its Ministers had the details of those measures at theirfingerends. .member think that the resumption of the Seeing that the Labour land line in Canada would assist our unemployed ? brilliant suggestion, but it was not anticipated when the fatal plunge was taken. fatal plunge. fatal. Did they think that on the Treasury bench they could do more than would be done by an Administration subservient to them? No. They knew that their party numbered only twenty-seven in a House of seventy-four. They knew that there were forty-seven members of the House pledged to oppose socialistic legislation.

Instead of doing so they elected to displace the Government, and by that means not only was the actual business that was then being proceeded with delayed for at least a fortnight and so much valuable time sacrificed, but they absolutely destroyed, as they knew when they committed the act, the possibility of any of the socialistic planks of their Labour platform being carried into effect in this Parliament. We can, therefore, assume that some other consideration induced tliem to put themselves into such an indefensible position. What is their platform, and how do they expect to give effect to it in this Parliament? In their fighting platform for this Parliament are one or two things tliat have been taken from the Liberal programme, and that all Liberals and democrats in Australia agree with, such as the maintenance of a White Australia and old-age pensions. But it includes also a progressive tax on unimproved land values, without any remission of other taxation, the restriction of public borrowing, navigation laws, an amendment of the Arbitration Act, and a Citizens' Defence Force, based, presumably, on a system of compulsory training or conscription, which is no more likelv to be endorsed by a majority of people outside than it is by a majority of this House. When we speak of their Socialism, some honourable members on the other side become extremely restive. "" Socialist "" applied to them, except when they apply it themselves. members rise in a most aggrieved manner to protest against it. The Prime Minister himself has done so. some of the outrageous definitions of Socialism being applied to our policy. fastening the name "" S o c i a l is t "" upon before he became a Minister, speaking in them, although individual members of the party have declared time after time on the floor of the House that they are Socialists -that the party is socialistic, and that their programme and objective are socialistic. We have also their own platform to show that they are Socialists, and the only inference to be drawn from this combination of circumstances is that any legislation which they put forward in the name of their organizations, and which they are sent into this House to try to pass, must be in the direction of Socialism. They are responsible for the application of the term to themselves. They have claimed to be Socialists, and have endeavoured by indirect means to give a socialistic character to a great deal of the legislation which has been proposed in this Chamber. Their objective is Socialism, and it is idle for them to pose as Socialists in the House and injured persons outside, whom their opponents wickedly miscall Socialists. Not long ago, Senator Pearce, Minister of Defence in the present Government, introduced in another Chamber a Bill to amend section 51 of the Constitution by adding at the end thereof the following paragraph"" the nationalization of monopolies with respect to production, manufacture, trade, and commerce."" If that is not whole-hog Socialism, I do not know what is. That. Bill lapsed owing to the prorogation. any one here who will repudiate that B ill . that.

So we have the Minister and one of his supporters contradicting one another. That supporter, by the way, ought to have been a Minister. honourable If any member of that party ought to have been in the Government, it was the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, who has done so much to bring about the change in the occupancy of the Treasury bench. I think he has been most undeservedly treated. If that B ill is not Socialism, perhaps the Minister will say that what I am about to quote is not Socialism. Senator Pearce, public at Hobart, saidIndividualism was doomed, and Socialism must take its place with the means of production manipulated and controlled by the whole people. At that time and now, so f a r as I know, that sentiment was, and is, endorsed by the whole of the Labour Party, and is embodied in the terms of Senator Pearce's Bill which",36,William Lyne Th E Honourable

He and his colleagues have doing nothing, and rather taking pride for No attempt has possession of the Treasury bench, and they have a chance to show their sincerity, and to show some justification for their occupancy of the Treasury bench. The honourable member for South Sydney, the late leader of the Labour Party, speaking at the New South Wales Labour League Conference before the last elections, in regard to Mr Cann's proposal for a cooperative commonwealth, founded upon the socialization of the production and distribution of wealth, is reported to have said thatThe sooner it was made clear that the movement was Socialist in its trend and intentions the better. It would be the wisest thing to make it a sine gua non that those who came into the party were Socialists. The honourable member for Kennedy said on the floor of the HouseLet us appeal to the country, and let honourable members opposite take up the cry of anti-Socialism whilst we take up the cry of Socialism. The Did the Minister for External Affairs object to that proposal when it was made? Did not the appeal of the honourable member for Kennedy mean that the aim of the party was Socialism?

I will say instead, "" misled."" At any rate, the natural assumption is that the late Government was displaced because . it did not go fast enough; and I think it is fair to ask why the various socialistic proposals that have been made by Ministers when they were private members are not embodied in the proposals of the present Government? It is fair to suppose that the Brisbane Worker, and other newspapers of the kind, which are the official organs of the Labour Partv. by whom they are subsidized, represent the views of the organization ? Partv repudiate those organs in the House. these newspapers are subsidized by the party, it is sheer nonsense to pretend to repudiate them. They are the party's official organs. This is what the Brisbane Worker saidNothing short of a policy of straight-out Socialism, vigorously and persistently pursued, can be of much avail, and the labour movement must be part of the great world-wide onsweep which threatens dynasties in its progress, and is shaking established institutions to their base. What are the Labour Party doing now in the way of "" threatening dynasties"" and ""shaking established institutions?"" The same newspaper saidThe flag of our faith is flung out to the battle breezes-the banner of Socialism. Then, again, when speaking of the Labour candidate who was opposing the late Prime Minister at Ballarat at the last election, and of the attempt by some members of the party to water down their Socialism, the Worker saidThe pledged caucus, man who isrunning against the Prime Minister at Ballarat, declared that the objective is collective ownership, but it is being kept in the background, because it is at present unattainable. The objective was not, however, to be lost sight of. He did not wish to deceive his hearers in the slightest degree, but his party was leading direct to Socialism. Although it may be convenient for the party in Parliament to hide the socialistic objective as much as possible, the Brisbane Worker does not take that view. There is evidently a feeling among the Party's candidates that the votes of the people would not be obtained if Socialism were made too prominent; but the Worker declares that the objective must not be lost sight of ; and there is no doubt that Socialism is the objective of the Labour Party, notwithstanding all their cunning devices to disguise the fact. I have now to refer to some of the proposals made by members of the Labour Partv before the present Government took office. The party were then red hot for such ideas as the nationalization of the tobacco industry, which, indeed, was one of their trump cards. Some little time ago a member of the party was instrumental in securing the appointment of a Royal Commission to investigate this subject, with a majority of Socialists appointed as members of it, and tlie recommendation made was that the idea should be carried out. Another proposal was the nationalization of the sugar industhe Labour try; and in another place, in 1905, a motion was actually carried in favour of that step. Further, there was a Royal Commission to inquire into the nationalization of shipping ; and the honourable member for South Sydney, speaking at Redfern, saidIt was time they intervened by nationalizing the shipping industry. It must be remembered that while the Watson Administration was in, office an attempt was made at something like a realization of the socialistic ideal in connection with borrowing money, the Government proposing to force the banks to give the Commonwealth a loan of £8,000,000 without interest. Then the honourable member for Melbourne proposed the nationalization of coal mines; and the nationalization of the milk supply was suggested in New South Wales. We have only to look at the business-paper to see how many notices of similar socialistic motions there are in the names of members of the party. At the present moment some of these members are now Ministers who have the power to bring in legislation, and have the ball at their feet. These notices include the nationalization of Inter-State shipping, of the tobacco industry, of commercial trusts, combines, &c. Further, we cannot dissociate the State Labour Party from the Federal Labour Party, for the reason that both have declared .themselves one, with the same aims and objective, only acting in two different spheres; and the State Labour",38,William Lyne Th E Honourable

Yet again the honourable member for Herbert a few days ago said the Party was going in for "" more Socialism and of a more pronounced type,"" and the Labour Women's Convention has just declared that the time has come to move in the direction' of "" the collective ownership of the means -of production, distribution, and exchange."" In the face of all this evidence, it is idle for the Labour Party to attempt *o throw dust in 'the eyes of the people, and declare that they are being falsely accused of being Socialists. Since the late Prime Minister has thought it necessary to come to the rescue of his .recent allies, who kept him in office for so long, it will be interesting to remind him of some utterances which he made not very long ago bearing upon a situation similar to that which has now arisen. At a meeting held at Ballarat on the 2nd August, 1904, the bonorable member said 'has already been quoted. it has been quoted in this debate. At the meeting in question the following motion was submittedTlint the time has arrived when it is imperative upon members of the general community to take steps to protect the Commonwealth against the sectional aims and interests which"" tend to subordinate the public welfare to their own, and that this meeting approves of the formation of a National Political League, -which has for its object the combination of all leagues which are opposed to Socialism. That motion was moved by the honourable member for Ballarat. right honourable member for Swan, who dealt with it extensively. that; but I thinlfc it may well be referred to again since the situation to-day is exactly what it was when the honourable member for Ballarat supported it, and proposed to bring about a. combination against the party which he is at present deliberately keeping in power. It is well to remind that honourable member that he is the one man in this House who is responsible for a Socialistic Government being in power to-day. He told us in this House only a few days ago that no Government could occupy the Treasury bench without the consent of himself and his party. That is perfectly true. As soon as he chooses to withdraw that support the Government must go to the wall, and that must be the position if only half-a-dozen members of his party withdraw their support from it. The honourable' member for Ballarat, if he chooses, can put an end to the situation to-day ; this very hour. Instead of that, however, he announces his intention to support the present Government. To what extent that support will go I do not know. Speaking on the ist July, 1905, with regard to the pledge taken by honourable members of the Labour Party to abide by the decision of the majority, and to that extent to be responsible, not to the electors, but to the caucus, he saidThe man who is not fit to be trusted on his spoken word is not fit to be trusted on his written word. And what is the object of that I ask you? The object is not to tie the candidate down to his constituents but to forge another link in the chain which binds him to 'the wire pullers and brings him under the thumb of the local committees. Later on, he saidEvery party has its caucus, and I have not a word to say against it. But no caucus except that of the Labour Party seeks to compel the minority to vote against their convictions and their good judgment. Notwithstanding that emphatic condemnation of the methods of the Labour Party, the honourable member now proposes to support them. found that that condemnation was not justified. has repeated it in various forms since. that he should repeat an incorrect statement. ther it is an incorrect statement, but it is his statement, embodying his opinion only. I presume we are right in assuming that he believed it to be correct when he made it. ber does not know whether it is true or not, does he think it fair to quote it? quote it as the opinion of the honourable member who made it, and who is now supporting a party which has adopted a method that he says ought not to prevail.

My plea to-night is not a plea to exasperate it ; it is a plea to the minds ancl consciences of those who listen to me, asking if there is not a better way in politics than the political machine. It is all right when the man dominates the machine, but with the Labour Partv the machine appears to dominate the man. If that statement was true then, it is equally true now, and it is thus all the more difficult for any person of ordinary reasoning powers to understand what could have induced the ex-Prime Minister to take up his present position. The Labour Partyturned him out of office practically without warning, without ceremony, and without explanation a few days after having expressed by vote in a division its entire confidence in him and his Government, and he is now calmly supporting them. He is supporting a Government which has not put forward its own policy, but is simply proposing for the present session to complete a portion, and only a very small portion, of had in hand at the moment of its retirement. Mr Johnson. explanation of the honourable member's attitude, and whilst this farce of responsible government is being enacted, we have simply to look on until, in the fullness of time, such developments are brought about as will enable us to unite on one common platform of a democratic, progressive, liberal, and humane character, the parties in this House opposed to Socialism. We require such a programme as will embrace That is done by all paities. But no m it y all the essentials to human progress-al l those essentials which make for the betterment of industrial conditions and of social life, and which exclude the objectionable elements of the enslaving and tyrannical system of Socialism. We have at the present time such a party in existence, but, unfortunately, owing to a want of cohesion, we are unable to present a united front to the advocates of the socialistic policy. In conclusion I express the hope that in a very short time we shall have a healthier condition of affairs in regard to our parliamentary governmenta party commanding a majority on the Ministerial side, and a united Opposition on the other. . . . What will be the inevitable reColonel FOXTON (Brisbane) [3-46]-I should not have risen had I not desired to refer to a matter immediately affected by the motion which the Prime Minister has I am submitted; but while on my feet I cannot help mentioning one or two matters whicb I am fighting the machine other honourable members luve spoken upon at length, and probably more forcibly than I could. I have to complain, and I think the country will complain, that no satisfactory reason has been given for the recent silent change of Government. The Prime Minister might have been expected to commence his policy speech with a statement of the reasons actuating his party in withdrawing its support from the Deakin Administration. We have not been informed in what respect that Administration forfeited the confidence affirmed by the Labour Party only a few weeks ago. we did not desire to have the right honourable member for East Sydney in power. Colonel FOXTON -As the honourable member for Lang has pointed out, the Labour Party, a few days before the change of Government, had affirmed its satisfaction with the financial proposals of its predecessors, and particularly with its the work which its predecessors proposals in regard to old-age pensions. We have had no satisfactory formula upon which we voted.",40,William Lyne Th E Honourable
204,Mr Fowler,All we declared was that,41,William Lyne Th E Honourable
205,Mr Fowler,"That was merely theColonel FOXTON -A t any rate, those who voted against the motion declared their confidence in the Government of the day. The Attorney-General, when taunted on the subject, boasted that the Labour Party is in power because it commands the support of a majority in this House. I draw particular attention to that boast, since it has been alleged by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat and others that the Opposition was responsible for the change of Government. The test of the matter is this: Are those who sit behind the honourable and learned member ready to give a vote to displace the Labour Party? They are not. He has told us unmistakably that the wreckage of the party which he leads-to use his own phrase, because the whole of his former supporters are not now following him-wil l support the Government, at all events for this session. He says that the Opposition made a tactical blunder in connection with the recent proceedings of the House, and that had it taken other action the result might have been different. I presume he means that another Government would be in power. The members of the Opposition are not political babes. Although the honourable and learned member has announced, three weeks after the event, that in any case he intended to resign, that was not known at the time. If , on the announcement of the honourable member for Wide Bay that the Labour Party would withdraw its support, the honourable and learned member had declared his intention to tender his resignation to the Governor General, the course of events might have been different. But he did not retire until a specific motion had been carried against him. Had the Opposition taken such action as he now suggests they might have taken, it would have again found the Labour Party supporting the Ministry, and the position would have been "" As you were."" The position would have been different had we known that the Prime Minister intended to resign under any circumstances. We had no justification for believing that the honourable member would resign, even though supported by the Opposition. Our experience during the last couple of years was not such as to lead us to suppose that the Government would seek the first opportunity of resigning upon receiving a rebuff. These matters are worthy of consideration in view of the taunt levelled at the Opposition from the Government corner that we [9i] are responsible for placing the Labour Party in power. What we voted against was the unholy alliance, and the improper exercise of power without responsibility. I , for one, notwithstanding the statement of the honourable member for Ballarat that it has been the one desire of the Opposition to keep the Labour Party off the Treasury bench, say emphatically that I very much prefer to see the Labour Party there than the continuance of the unsatisfactorystate of affairs which existed up to a fortnight ago. The position of the present Government is their own. affair. I have said that I expected an intimation Avhether any particular portion of the policy of the late Government, or its neglect to carry it out, Avas responsible for the change. Next to the question of getting safely into recess, and being in a position to see out their six months' notice to quit, of Avhich Ave haA'e heard to-day, the two questions that appear to be most urgent for the consideration of the present Government are, "" What is the least Ave can do without incurring the condemnation of the leagues outside?"" and "" What is the furthest Ave can go Avithout forfeiting the support of the wreckage of the late GoA'ernment Party?"" HOAV are they going to steer betAveen those two beacons? I suppose Ave shall see next session. the last man who should talk about hanging on. Colonel FOXTON I do not know what the honourable member alludes to. Colonel FOXTON I fling the insinuation back upon the honourable member and challenge him to prove Avhat he imputes. Does he mean that I clung to office? The honourable member occupies next to you, sir, the most important position in the House, and has flung at me, not by actual words, but by insinuation, a chargeof hanging on to office, apparently, I presume, for the sake of emolument. that if the Prime Minister recognises that the remark is offensive to the honourable member for Brisbane he will AvithdraAv it. member has just said that our principal business Avas to get into recess. ciple.",41,William Lyne Th E Honourable

It is, therefore, extremely desirto cause this serious delay, but if it was able that the representation should be as possible for the late Government to bring complete and up to date as regards numbers the Act into operation at an early date, 1 as it is possible to make it. If the motion should think it would be just as possible for now before the Chair is carried, that Bill the present Government to give effect to it, will necessarily practically disappear from as early as their officer returns from Westthe .business paper, and there will be no ern Australia and the. necessary arrangechance of its becoming law in time to enable ments can be made.

It now appears,, however, to ask whether the Prime Minister, especithat the Commission is to consist of Mr ally as he is the sole representative of Justice Hood; and there is no doubt that Queensland in the Ministry, could see his with the Prime Minister's especially after the assurance that I received from the late Prime the Act would l^e out the decision of their predecessors, I remember that when the question was dispressed that the Commission should be one of experts, assisted by some members of",42,William Lyne Th E Honourable

212,Mr Storrer (Bass) [4,"3]--It isa commission of one is always most unsatisfactory. how clever he may be, must always regard a question from one point of view; and we shall have merely a written report, dealing probably with only legal points, while there will be no member of the House capable of explaining various questions which may arise. This matter is of vital importance and interest to the general public; and the Commission ought to have consisted of, at any rate, an expert in insurance, and some business man or men quite apart from the legal profession. I have, of course, nothing to say against the gentleman who has been appointed; but he has not had that large business experience of which some honourable members of the House have had the advantage. In the H i g h Court we have five Justices to deal with questions of law, and yet a Royal Commission of one has been created to deal with a matter which affects every member of the community. change of Government, I do not care what party is in power, so long as measures are introduced which I consider to be for the welfare of Australia. Instead of airing our petty grievances and quarrels, and f ill plaint as to delay in taking over quaraning Barnard week after week, and year after year, we ought to study the interests of the whole of the people of the country. I fully sympathize with the appeal made by the honourable member for Kooyong last night for unity for the common good; but that honourable member was followed by the honourable member for Barker, who declared that the late Government had done no business, and that there had been no beneficial results from the eight years of Federation. were like the honourable member for BarkerI do not see how we could expect much result, seeing that he was absent last session for sixty-six days. In any case, I should like to know whether the honourable member has studied the history of other Federations, and ascertained what was done elsewhere in the same period of time. My anxiety is to reach the consideration of the Estimates and to deal with them thoroughly and without haste, because I regard them as the most important business of the Parliament. [4.10] I have no complaint to make of the criticism which has been levelled at the Government, and so long as I have the honour to remain in my present position I [9.]2 opinion, severe or otherwise. I do, howA n individual, no matter ever, appeal to honourable members not to insinuate that the members of the Ministry are any worse than honourable members who sit in other parts of the House. I have a vivid recollection of the leader of the previous Labour Government being accused of an endeavour to obtain another day of office; and any suggestions of that kind would undoubtedly be quite as unfortunate as offensive. I hope I am not misinterpreting what was said by the honourable member for Brisbane. Colonel FOXTON I never intended any offensive meaning. feel keenly any personal insinuation; but any political criticism will be freely accepted, and met by us as far as possible. As to the Bill referred to by the honourable member for Brisbane, I shall give it consideration, although at present I cannot say I take the view he puts forward. As to the Colonel FOXTON -The B ill , as printed, is not complete, but requires further amendment. any information on the subject. The comtine administration can hardly be sustained on the evidence. The Comptroller-General, Dr. Wollaston, has visited four States. Since we came into office he has visited one of the States, and there is still another to visit. In addition two conferences are to be held, and I remind the honourable member for .Bass that it was during my term of office as Minister of Trade and Customs four years ago that quarantine was proclaimed, and, apI f all honourable members parently, we are asked to do, during our few days of office, what it has not been found passible to do during those intervening years. In regard to the appointment of Mr Justice Hood as a Roval Commissioner on Insurance, I may say that it was, and is, the intention of the Government to associate with that gentleman Mr Knibbs, the Government Statistician. At the time the Commission was issued some difficulties were in the way of the appointments, but these have been surmounted. Mr Justice Hood will be chairman, with a casting vote if necessary, and Mr Knibbs will be junior Commissioner, the report to be presented before the 30th June next. not practically decided on by the late Goshall appreciate all expressions of vernment ?",43,William Lyne Th E Honourable
