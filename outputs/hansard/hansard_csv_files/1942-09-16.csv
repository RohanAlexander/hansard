Will the honourable gentleman explain the evident need for the promulgation of a freezing order, so that a quota system may be applied to thousands of growers? Will he indicate whether or not his department is prepared to release as quickly as possible sufficient citrus fruits to meet population to be met. the reasonable requirements of the public, having regard to the special situation caused this year by drought and Army nneds? of the citrus fruit industry has been exerto be frozen, the price of oranges was cised for one purpose only, namely, to procure most urgent andessential snpplies of citrus juices in order to meet the requirements of the armed forces in the northern fighting areas. The health of the troops in the north is causing the greatest concern to the responsible authorities. In the absence of fresh green vegetables and other foodstuffs which provide the necessary vitamin C content, it bas been determined by the most competent authorities in Australia that large quantities of citrus juices are necessary to maintain the health of the troops. The whole question of control has been discussed most carefully with representatives of the citrus-growing industry. The determination to issue in New South Wales an order controlling the citrus fruit supply within that State was taken only Rfter full discussion, and with the full concurrence of the citrus-growing indus^ try. 1 wish to make it perfectly plain that there is no intention on the part of the Government to freeze the whole of the available stocks of citrus fruits. On the contrary, under the quota system that has been applied a percentage of the crop bas already been released, and additional stocks to meet the needs of the civilian population will be automatically released immediately the requirements of the processing firms have been met. Probably not more than 10 per cent, of the total citrus crop will be taken for defense needs. Whilst the percentage in regard to certain Valencia oranges reached as high as 30 per cent., the balance of the crop will be available for the public. Any absence of stocks of citrus fruits, therefore, will be due not to Government action but to the action of selfish individuals who consider only their own wants purchasing large quantities of citrus fruits and holding them in store. If all will restrict their demands for oranges to what may reasonably be regarded as necessary, it will be found that the quota system that has been instituted will enable the essential needs of the civilian Supply and Development aware that immediately after the announcement was made that supplies of citrus fruits were increased hy 4s. a case, and the retail price, for oranges and apples by Is. a dozen?

M., has been sentenced by a Royal Australian Air Force court martial to 28 days detention in Holdsworthy Military Camp? 2. If so-(a ) Is the honourable gentlePrices man satisfied that AC2 Falstein received a fair trial ? (Z>) Does he intend to take action against Squadron Leader A. R. I Gorrie, who abused AC2 Falstein by saying "" It is like your hide to make an illegal request. Just because you are a member of Parliament you can't do everything."" ? 3. Isi t a fact that Squadron Leader Gorrie was removed from the command of Bradfield Park Station, and was subsequently reinstated by the exercise of pressure on the Air Board? 4. On the facts disclosed, does the honourable gentleman consider that Squadron Leader Gorrie is a fit and proper person to continue to hold his present rank and post? 5. Will the honourable gentleman move for the appointment of a select committee of this Parliament to review all the circumstances of the case and report thereon ? 6. Is Holdsworthy military gaol the filthy hole that it was when the present vice, in this Parliament about eighteen months ago, attacked the conditions that he alleged existed there ? AC2 Falstein was tried by court martial and was awarded 28 days detention by a properly constituted tribunal. I cannot furnish the information sought in regard to the record of Squadron Leader Gorrie. But I can express the belief that the tribunal which tried AC2 Falstein dealt with his case in the manner laid down by Air Force law. I voice no opinion as to the merits of the sentence that it promulgated, because I do not consider that I am qualified to do so. Experts in sueh matters advise the officials as to whether or not a court has heen properly constituted, and the proper procedure followed.

COAL-MINING INDUSTRY. eral say whether it is a fact that, at the Richmond Main Colliery, in the northern coal-fields district of New South Wales, the miners, after going down the mine only five minutes late on two successive days, and after having been at work producing coal for 35 minutes, were recalled to the surface by the management, which directed that the knock-off whistle be blown? If this be so, did not the action of the management constitute a breach of the recently issued regulation governing the coal-mining industry? What action does the Government propose to take sgainst the mine-owners for sending the men home, thus losing the production of thousands of tons of coal from the largest coal-mine in Australia? ber's question gives me an opportunity to slate the procedure which is followed in these cases. When a stoppage occurs in any mine, including the stoppages to which the honourable member has referred, Branch, whose report is sent to Sydney for consideration. In every case the investigating officers insist upon getting the. versions of both the employees and the employers. When that is done, counsel advises whether a prosecution shall take place or not.

These retirements have caused an acute shortage of labour in the coal-mining industry. In view of this fact, will the Prime Minister give consideration to repealing the Government's decision so that the men may return to the coal-mining industry?

74,Mr Holt,"I direct a question to thestatement that the Army in this country wa.s not so large as I should like it to be. released from it, and the standard of having regard to all that is at stake. That is the view of our advisers. I went on to say that, as our numbers were limited, it was of major importance that the trained forces should be kept at a maximum of efficiency. On the best advice that, we could get, the interruption of the training of the Army that would be caused by sending men back to work at industries would affect the efficiency of the Army as a whole, and therefore it would not be in the best interests of the country to maintain civil industries at the cost of diminishing the numbers and efficiency of our armed forces. At the same time, applications arc made for the release of certain men in particular places, and tbe machinery which, has been set up to deal with such applications has been explained to the honourable gentleman. doing, I point out that we must take into account the special circumstances of our own country at this stage. I repeat what I said to the House previously, namely, that if I have to take a chance of going short of tucker in the next twelve months and going short of fighting personnel in the next six months, [ shall take the risk of going short of tucker. the Army aware that the refusal of the Army to comply with hundreds of recommendations by the Man Power authorities for the temporary release of men experienced in the shearing of sheep and the slaughtering of lambs and other meat is likely to result in heavy losses to the flock-owners owing to the deterioration of fleeces and the ravages of blowflies, and also cause, a serious glut in the lamb market in the present season, which promises to be one of the best on record? Will not the loss of large quantities of valuable foodstuffs result? Will the Minister arrange an early conference to resolve this problem ? cases in which Man Power officers recommend that a particular man be released ber will submit specific cases to me I temporarily for such work, his commandshall have them examined and furnish an ing officer, who has full knowledge of the ea rly reply. efficiency of the unit under his command, the number of men who were previously training that it has reached, decides that the man cannot be spared. There are certain units in Australia-whic h I do not want to name publicly, but which I mentioned at the secret meeting of senators and members-which , in the opinion of the Commander-in-Chief of tbe Allied Land Forces in the South-west Pacific, must continue their training without interruption owing to the gravity of the war situation. I realize that some inconvenience is being suffered by primary producers and other employers throughout Australia because of the difficulty of obtaining sufficient labour, but that is not entirely due to the Army. Many thousands of young men employed in conn try districts have been attracted to more lucrative positions in munitions factories, others have enlisted in the AusAs to what other countries are tralian Imperial Force, the Royal Australian Air Force, and the Royal Australian Navy, and others have enlisted or have been compulsorily enrolled in the Australian Military Forces. The Government has to look at the complete picture, and intends to be guided in the matteT by its military advisers. As it is considered that even more men will be required for the Army than are at present enrolled, I am not prepared to instruct tbe Commander-in-Chief to release every member of the Army whose release is recommended by the Man Power authorities. The security of Australia, involving the protection of 3,000,000 square miles' of territory and 7,000,000 people, must bo the paramount consideration.

99,Mr Chifley (Macquarie,"Treasurer )As honourable members are aware, the commission was established in 1933 for the purpose of inquiring into and reporting upon applications by States for financial assistance under section 96 of the Constitution. The recommendations of the commission for the last eight years have been approved by the Commonwealth Government and adopted by Parliament. The grants recommended by the commission for payment in the year 1942-43 compare with those paid during 1941-42 as follows:1941-42. £ South Australia.. 1,150,000 Western Australia Tasmania Total The actual grants assessed and recommended by the commission for South Australia and ""Western Australia were £1,220,000 and £970,000 respectively. It , however, recommended that of these amounts, £670,000 in respect of South Australia, and £170,000 in respect of Western Australia, be deferred until next financial year.. Thus, actual payments during this financial year will be £800,000-includin g £250,000 deferred from 1941-42-to South Australia, and £1800,000 to Western Australia. Before explaining the reasons for these deferred payments, it is necessary to mention very briefly the principles that have been followed by the commission. In this year's report, it reiterated the principles that had been followed in the past. I quote the following paragraph from its report:The special grants which we recommend are in 1942-43. Thus, the payment recomhascd on the principle of financial needs, and mended for South Australia in 1942-43 arc determined by the amount of help found i i £550,000, which, with £250,000 deferred necessary to make it possible for a claimant State, by reasonable effort, to function at a from last year, makes a total payment of utandard not appreciably below that of other £800,000. In 1941-42, the year following States. Our methods of assessing needs are that on which the grant for this year was based fundamentally on comparisons between the financial position of the States, and assessed, South Australia enjoyed a surdepend, too, on the financial relations of the plus of £1,2S7,000, which included the Commonwealth and the States. The commission recognizes that war This improvement in South Australia's policy has affected State budgets unbudget, in 1941-42 was due to increased equally, and has thus created further revenue from railways, income tax, and Mr Ohifley. problems in the assessment of special grants. It has made clear that it does not consider that its function is to recommend grants specifically designed to compensate a State for adverse effects of federal war policy. If , as a result of such policy, a drift occur red in the financial position of one or more of the claimant States, the commission would bring the matter immediately to the notice of this Government. Insofar as federal war policy and war finance are reflected in the budgets of the States, however, they are taken into account in Increase 1942-43. or the commission's methods of assessment. Decre/wMi. Jn its last report, the commission stated that circumstances had not yet arisen £ £ which rendered its methods invalid or 800,000 350,000 impracticable for dealing with grants 630.000 800,000 + 170,000 520,000 575,000 + 55,000 based upon the financial year 1940-41; it had therefore decided substantially to 2,300,000 2,175,000 125,000 maintain for this year its existing basis of assessment. It is important to remember that the commission's assessments are based on the budgetary results of the States for 1940-41, tbe latest year for which complete information was available to it. The commission takes into Consideration whatever special conditions may obtain in the years following that on which tbe grants are assessed. Thus in past years it. has at times, by means of deferred payments or advances, made allowance for any obvious disparity between the normal calculated grants and the current needs of the States. This year, the commission has recommended that £670,000 of the grant of £1,220,000 assessed for South Australia be deferred for payment in 1943-44 because the assessed grant of £1,220,000 is considered excessive in relation to South Australia's financial needs special grant of £1,150,000 for that year. succession duties. In 1942-43, under uniform taxation, South Australia will receive £458,000 less than the income tax collections in 1941-42, whilst appreciable reductions of succession duties and racing taxation may be expected. On the other hand, owing to Commonwealth war expenditure, the improvement of railway revonup occurred mainly in tihe ""last four months of 1941-42, and may still continue, whilst returns from primary production will be favourably affected by the increase of the price of wool by 15 per cent. After taking these factors into consideration, the commission estimates that payment of £800,000 should be sufficient to meet South Australia's financial needs in 1942-43. The commission also considers that the assessed grant of £970,000 to Western Australia exceeds that State's currentneeds and recommends that payment of £170,000 be deferred until next year. In 194142, Western Australia enjoyed a surplus of £1,768 after receiving a grant of £630,000. The outlook for 1942-43 ia conditioned by such factors as Commonwealth war expenditure, compensation under the uniform income tax plan, the trend of railway revenue and expenditure, diversion of man-power from goid-mining to war industries, the prospects for primary production, and the trend of costs. After considering all these factors, the commission is of the opinion that payment of £800,000 should meet the financial needs of Western Australia in 194243. The commission recommends that the grant, of £575,000 to Tasmania should be paid in full in 1942-43. In 1941-42, Tasmania had a surplus of £1,585 after taking into account the special grant of £520.000. In 1942-43, Tasmania will receive as compensation under the uniform income tax plan £222,000 less than the collections in 1941-42. Other important factors are the trend of costs, Commonwealth war expenditure, and railway receipts and expenditure. Thus, prospects in 1942-43 do not warrant postponing the payment of any portion of Tasmania's special grant. For the information of honourable memWestern Australia is £340,000 more than bers, I submit tbe following statement that assessed and paid in 1941-42. The [13] showing the trend of net grants paid to States in recent years:Year. South Westeru Australia. Australia. Tasmania.

In assessing the grants, the commission's first step is to calculate the normal standard to which the claimant States should be raised. The normal standard is arrived at by averaging the adjusted budgetary results of the non-claimant States. Ever since the commission's inception in 1933, the budgets of the non-claimant States have shown a deficit standard, but for 1940-41 there was a surplus standard of Is. Id. a head. As this surplus standard arose from conditions largely brought about by the stimulus of war expenditure in the non-claimant States, the commission does not consider it a reasonable standard for their purpose. The commission therefore decided to adopt a balanced budget standard as the normal standard. Honourable members will note that the grant of £1,220,000 assessed for Soutfc Australia is £180,000 less than that assessed for 1941-42, although, as I have already mentioned, payment of £250,000 of that amount was deferred until this financial year. Referring to the actual adjustments made by the commission, the amount necessary to bring South Australia's comparable deficit to the normal standard was £99,000 more than that required last year, but this was more than offset by a decline of that State's taxation collections in 1940-41 which, when related to the position in other States, led to a reduction from £455,000 to £152,000 in the adjustment for relative severity of taxation. The grant of £970,000 assessed for main factor causing this increase concerns the relative severity of taxation adjustment. Due largely to a decline of the relative taxable capacity of ""Western Australia, combined witb a slight increase of that State's taxation collections in 194041, there was an increase of £266,000 in the adjustment for relative severity of taxation. In addition, there was a small increase in the adjustment designed to bring the State's comparable deficit to the normal standard, whilst no penalty was imposed this year on account of ""Road Debt Charges"". On the other hand, an increase of Western Australia's net expenditure per head on certain social services in 1940-41 resulted in an additional amount of £29,000 being deducted from the social services adjustment. The grant of £575,000 to Tasmania is £55,000 more than the grant assessed and paid in 1941-42. This is due largely to an increase of £147,000 in the adjustment necessary to bring Tasmania's comparable deficit to the normal standard, whilst in addition, the penalty for road debt charges was not imposed this year. On the other hand, there was a decrease of £126,000 in the adjustment for relative severity of taxation. This was due to a decline of taxation collections, accompanied by an improvement of the relative taxable capacity of that State. The Government is satisfied that the principles and methods of assessment folment to prevent in war-time the holding lowed by the commission produce reasonable results, and that the grants recommended for payment to South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania are sufficient to meet the financial needs of those States in 1942-43. As in past years, are wasteful of resources, and do the Government has therefore decided to adopt the recommendations of the commission, and I commend the bill to honorreduced as far as possible. Hitherto, able members. Before concluding I take this opportunity to express the Government's appreciation of the splendid work done by Sir Frederic Eggleston, who was chairman of the commission from its establishment in 1933 until November of last year, when his appointment as Australian Minister to China compelled him to resign. The Government has been fortunate in securing the services of Frofuture, the Government finds that it is Mr Chifley. fessor R. C.

Leader of the Opposition) [4.17] Members of the Opposition do not oppose this measure because we recognize, perhaps better than any one else, the necessity which confronts the Treasurer to tap every available source of revenue in an attempt to bridge the gap between receipts and expenditure. In pursuance of the adoption of a policy of uniform taxation, the Commonwealth is now free to impose a tax upon entertainments and amusements, a field which was previously reserved for the exclusive use of the States. This field has now been vacated by the States, which are to be compensated under an arrangement which will be the subject of legislation that is to be introduced later. It would be unwise for the Governof organized sports which, in moderation, serve a useful purpose in maintaining morale, and providing that relaxation which is necessary after a week's hard work. Those forms of sport which not give a full measure of relaxation, should be investigated, and eliminated or the Commonwealth Government has refrained from imposing a tax on entertainments because of an agreement with the States that this field should be enjoyed exclusively by them. In addition, the reA'enue that would have been obtained if a Commonwealth tax had been superimposed ;on the State taxes would have been small. The introduction of a uniform entertainments tax will overcome that difficulty. If , in the",22,Second Reading

105,Mr Jolly,"I have my own viewsHonorable members will see from those figures that approximately one-third of the revenues derived by New South Wales, Queensland, and Western Australia were raised from taxes other than income tax, but one-half of the revenues of Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania was raised from other taxes. than one-half of the revenue was raised from other taxes. uniform income tax proposals, States which in the past relied to a greater degree upon taxes other than income tax, have been penalized, because their allocations have been reduced accordingly. In other words, taxpayers in those States are required to pay the uniform tax on incomes, aud to make a. higher contribution by way of the other taxes. Apart from that, the introduction of a uniform land tax, estate duty, stamp duty, gift tax, liquor tax, and motor tax throughout the Commonwealth is most desirable. MT. SPOONER (Robertson) [4.30] The Government has done well in taking this second step towards complete uniformity of taxation and the proper organization of .finance in Australia. The revenue from the entertainments tax will be small in comparison with the revenue for which the Government has budgeted; but this legislation is a natural corollary to the uniform income tax to which this Parliament has already agreed. The honourable member for Lilley( Mr Jolly) has no cause for complaint, because this bill will do exactly what he says should be done, namely, extend the principle of uniformity in taxation. The measure follows the principle established in the uniform income tax legislation, in that it compensates the States for the amount of revenue which they will cease to collect by vacating the field of entertainments tax. As the result Queensland, which had no entertainments tax, is not entitled to any compensation under this measure, and New South Wales, which had a relatively light entertainments tax, will receive relatively small compensation, whereas Victoria and South Australia, which complained that their compensation was not enough under the uniform income tax, will receive relatively high compensation under this measure. Accordingly, Victoria and South Australia are not so vociferous in their protests against this legislation as they were against the uniform income tax. If the Government applies that principle all the way through the field of taxation, there can be no objection from StatesI n Tasmania, more which, in their wisdom, have in the past properly exercised their taxing powers.

Eor that reason I urge the Commonwealth Government to proceed quickly with the extension of the principle of uniformity in taxation to the land tax field. I shall have no complaints if the State of New South Wales receives no compensation from the Commonwealth by reason of the fact that it has no land tax, and if the States, which do levy land tax, receive from the Commonwealth as compensation, amounts equal to what they would have obtained had their land tax legislation continued. But I should complain if New South Wales, by imposing a new land tax, placed certain revenues beyond the reach of the Commonwealth Treasury, and if the effect of that were that the individual taxpayer would have the advantage of a deduction from his personal income tax return, so that the Commonwealth would be paying a large proportion of the land tax received into the coffers of the State Government. The reason advanced for the proposal to impose a new landtax in New South Wales is that the revenue derived from it will provide a fund for repatriation. I ask the Commonwealth to deal with this matter immediately and to say just who is the authority in Australia to deal with the repatriation of Australian soldiers.

109,Mr Spooner,"Eo r the last twosecond step towards uniformity of taxation, and I ask the Government to hesitate no longer than is necessary in proceeding with the third step, namely, the imposition of a uniform land tax. war has brought within the purview of the national Parliament matters affecting the lives of the people which normally do not come within tbe scope of our consideration. It is one of the weaknesses of the federal system of government, in which there is a division of powers, that many matters, such as health, education, and public recreation, rarely come before this Parliament. I propose, therefore, to take advantage of the opportunity afforded by this measure for the taxing of entertainments to make a few general comments. The needs of the war necessitate a direct contribution from the entertainments industry, and this bill provides for a steep increase of the rates of tax which were previously operating in most of the States. The increased tax has been accepted by the industry, as it will be accepted by the public, as a necessary part of our war finance. It will help, as the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr figures for the whole of Australia, but Fadden) has pointed out, to bridge the enormous gap between the anticipated revenue and the anticipated expenditure. I.u contrast to Australia, public entertainment and recreation are regarded by national legislatures in other countries as being of real importance. Since the last war, governments in Europe, Great Britain and the United States of America not only have taken an interest in public recreation and entertainment but also have provided amenities for the people and, in some instances, subsidized activities which were valuable in the community life, but would be difficult to continue under normal commercial conditions. Russia, whether under the Cza.rist regime or the Communist regime, has maintained the justly famed Russian ballet. France and Germany and Italy have spent vast sums on organizing the entertainment of their subjects. Italy has a state-subsidized opera company. Those countries have recognized that live artist shows provide a colour, variety and vitality in community life which lift it above the drabness that everyday working conditions create, and so they have sought to encourage such entertainment. Younger countries are perhaps concerned more with problems of industrial development and primary production than with the provision of recreation facilities, and usually a young country does not feel that it needs or has the time to encourage these forms of entertainment. However, with the increase of prosperity and leisure the State turns its attention to the support and development of the arts. If we needed any evidence of the necessity for State interest in such matters we may find it in the change which has taken place in our way of life in recent decades. To-day, most of our people live in the cities. Many of them work in offices or at repetitive factory tasks, and therefore they have a real need for regular breaks from the tedium of work, however much they may enjoy it in a general sense. ""We see further evidence of this in the hordes of people who throng places of public entertainment and in the thousands who obtain regular entertainment from radio programmes. I am not in possession of I know that in Victoria alone last year there were about 37,000,000 paid admissions to picture theatres. That indicates the popularity of one of our chief forms of entertainment. These facts should be of interest to the National Parliament, because, when financial measures which may cause a restriction of public entertainment are brought forward, we must approach them with particular care, recognizing, of course, the imperative need to finance our war effort. ""We recognize this need, but we must examine this heavy impost-and by any standard it will bp a heavy impost on the family man with a low income-wit h particular care in order to ensure that we do not create another form of indirect tax which will bear harshly and unfairly on large sections of the community.

I know that the Government does not intend to use this measure as",27,Entertainments Ta X Assessment Bill 1942 Second Reading
110,Mr Holt (Fawkner) [4.35],"Th eu means of restricting public entertainment. Although it may be a matter of Government policy to impose certain restrictions in other directions, this is purely a revenue-raising measure. However, this discussion does provide an opportunity to refer to the fact that the Government has under consideration a plan to restrict one or more forms of public recreation. Prime Minister spoke of the need to impose some restriction on horse racing, and be indicated that the Government would promulgate regulations to give effect to its policy in this regard. No honourable member will deny that there should be some restriction of racing in war-time. In fact, we all know that there has been a substantial reduction of horse-racing in Australia since the outbreak of war, just as there has been in Great Britain. This restriction has not completely deprived the people of opportunities to attend race meetings as a part, of their weekly recreation. I now express the hope, in anticipation of future action, that the Government will not seek to deprive the public of one of the most popular forms of entertainment. ashamed of the fact that we were a race-loving community. tralians have been rather proud of the fact that we stage one of the most widelyknown racing fixtures-certainly largest conducted in the southern hemisphere-the responsible and reputable citizens have eagerly sought election to the committees of our leading race clubs. This popular form of entertainment was catered for extensively in peace-time, but now we do not quarrel with the necessity for some restriction. However, I ask the Government to beware that in this matter, as in some other matters which must come before it, it be not led astray by the stridoubtedly receive the whole-hearted supdent minority which is ever in our midst and whose sole objective apparently is -to deprive other people of forms of entertainment which members of that minority do not themselves enjoy.

It may tend to encourage intemperance, particularly in the consumption of liquor, a problem of which we have heard a great deal recently, but it also tends to increase and-blood artists. All who have had any Mr Holt. intolerance of the rights, privileges and pleasures of other people. This tendency has been apparent in recent months, and it has shown a dangerous facility for growth against which this National Parliament should guard. One man's meat may be another man's poison, but, while it is one man's meat, he should be allowed to enjoy it. Only to-day the The fact that it is another man's poison concerns that man only, and he should not, endeavour to impose his own distastes on his neighbour. I hope that, in this and other matters which affect the rights of the individual, the Government will not be misled by these people whose voices were drowned in happier times, but who to-day find opportunities to express views which most Australians would normally regard as intolerable. The fact that some form of regular entertainment is necessary to the people is recognized by the Commonwealth Government and the State governments in various ways. The State governments consistently provide in the schools organized recreation for the growing youth of the community and one of the most important features of life in the fighting services is the organized In peace-time we were not recreation provided for the troops. Just as schoolboys and members of the ""We Ausfighting services require a judicious means of recreation and entertainment, so likewise do civilians, whose lives are the perhaps more drab and considerably less colourful than those of either schoolboys Melbourne Cup. Many or fighting men. There is a danger that when a community is called upon to accept a policy advanced ostensibly with the object of promoting the war effort, it will do so without analytically examining it. The acceptance of such policies at the value given to them by their advocate* has in it a measure of real risk. ""Whilst policies which can be proved to be in the best interests of the war effort will unport of the general community, there is a need for a vigilant examination of restrictive measures which invade individual rights and intrude on personal privileges without making any commensurate contribution to the war effort.

I dislike this bill because it provides for additional indirect taxation. Such taxes always bear most heavily upon the working classes. I approve of the measure, however, because it enlarges the principle of uniformity in taxation. In that respect the measure is in line with other bills introduced by this Government. I commend the proposal of the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Jolly) and the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr finds that the amount that he is now Spooner) that a uniform land tax should be applied. Those honourable gentlemen also suggested that estate duties and certain other taxes should be imposed upon a uniform basis. I am confident that the people of Australia, would welcome any move in that direction. The Commonwealth Government should pay to the States such amounts as may be required to enable them to discharge their obligations under State law, and to provide funds for this purpose it should impose all taxes on a uniform basis throughout the. Commonwealth. I could offer several objections to phases of the budget which are not at the moment directly before us, and in due course I hope to have an opportunity to point out that certain budget proposals are in conflict, with the declared policy of the Labour party to which I belong. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr doubt that had he been Treasurer he Fadden) commended this bill. Of course he would do so, because it will impose a tax that will fall most heavily upon the working people. Naturally persons who belong to the United Australia party and tbe United Country party approve of taxes that fall upon the basic wage earners. who attend picture shows and other entertainments? tion of the £3,000,000 proposed to be raised will be derived from the tax on the Is. tickets. Admittedly, higher rates will be imposed on the more highly priced tickets; but who wants to spend 5s. on a meal in these days, as many persons who pre-war days and have done since the war started? If the Government were to exclude from the operation of this legislation all tickets priced at Is., very little revenue would be raised, and the proposal would be dropped. It is not right that a tax should be imposed on tickets priced at Is., when the average worker is already being mulct in increases of the cost of living which are vastly greater than the published figures. V.ery much more than the Prices Commissioner has fixed as fair has to be paid for various articles of clothing, and the working man earning is just about sufficient to enable him to keep body and soul together. that. by the right honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Menzies) and others-that members of the working-class are making largely in excess of what they made in pre-war days, and that they have the idea of becoming capitalists when tlie war is over-is entirely erroneous. The budget for this year will not make the workers richer, or the rich poorer, but will probably have a tendency in the opposite direction. Because the bill is not one that will make the wealthy class less wealthy, it commends itself to the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Fadden), who has very gleefully supported it. I have no would have introduced not only legislation of this sort but also provision for the compulsory loans that he advocates and that the capitalist press of Australia so keenly favours. Who was the author of the famous scheme of compulsory loans? It was a gentleman named J. M. Keynes. After he had propounded his scheme, he was made a baron of the realm, and is now Baron Keynes. His schemes are barren of any good to the working classes. He is a member of the House of Lords and, as befits one who renders such a service to the capitalist system of society, has also been made a member of the board of the Bank of England, in which capacity he is a colleague of Sir Otto Niemeyera gentleman who,",30,Entertainments Ta X Assessment Bill 1942 Second Reading

I oppose it because I find in it another attempt by the Government to put off the evil day when it must apply itself to tlie lower ranges of incomes in order to raise the necessary revenue. This Government, by its financial policy, is threatening the country with the curse of inflation. curtail excessive spending by people with a surplus of money, the Government has imposed a system of severe rationing. People, particularly those in the lower income groups, have a surfeit of money. To-day, more money is circulating in the dommunity than ever before in our history. According to the Prime Minister, the spending power of the people has increased by £150,000,000; but that money has not been diverted to the war effort. The policy of the Government has driven the money to seek outlets other than the purchase of rationed goods, and this Government, by rationing some commodities, has created a demand for, and increased the prices of others. Under this bill, the Government will impose a tax on entertainments, because it believes that people are spending money lavishly on amusements. This tax provides the Government with another devious method of scratching a few hundreds of thousands of pounds from the people. Why does not the Government adopt a fearless policy of taking the surplus money from the people? In the past, State governments have taxed entertainments, because the field from which they derived their revenue was restricted. In my opinion, the tax on entertainments has been unfair, because it has been levied with discrimination on specific entertainments. Any tax which is imposed in that' manner is inequitable. The only virtue of the bill is that the tax will be made uniform throughout Australia. In that respect, some benefit will accrue, because the Commonwealth Government will put its imprimatur on a uniform method of controlling the finances of the country. In peace-time.

The absorption of soldiers and munition workers in employment after the war will not be an easy task for whatever government may be in power at that time. Following upon the remarks of the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr happen to the horse-breeding industry. Holt) I refer now to the proposed abolition of horse-racing. I warn the Government to deal cautiously with this project. upon those who attend race meetings as persons who belong to some low class of "" go-getters"", whereas, . in fact, the highest people in the Empire attend race meetings. That is why horse-racing is known as the "" Sport of Kings "". Whilst the Government is proposing to further restrict race meetings in this country. His Majesty the King is the leading racehorse owner in England. Only the other day we saw pictures of the Queen congratulating the jockey and the trainer on a win by that great filly Sun Chariot, which is said to be the greatest horse that the world has known. We also saw pictures of His Majesty leading in Sun Chariot after winning The Oaks. Every Saturday, thousands of People play golf, thousands of others go to cricket or football matches, and thousands enjoy reading or gardening. Thousands of others delight in watching the thoroughbreds produced in this country afternoon's horse-racing. If the Government closed down every form of entertainment it would drive the people into a state of depression which would break down their morale more quickly than anything else. They must have their outdoor entertainment, and the request for race meetings once a week in the capital cities is not unreasonable. I read in the newspapers recently that a friend of mine, Arthur Mailey, the international cricketer, went to a race meeting once and came home tired and depressed. But I know of many men Mr Collins. who have seen one cricket match and have never attended another match. On one occasion, when Woodfull and men, came to play in New South Wale3, I asked a friend of mine whether he would like to see the match. He replied in amazement, ""Go and watch a game of cricket ? I would just as soon watch a hen sitting"". We all have different tastes. Many of us enjoy watching cricket and football matches, whilst others like horse-racing just as well. The Prime Minister said the other night that he did not take any notice of what might The right honourable gentleman was only interested in the effect of his policy on the people generally. But the GovernThere are people who look ment's proposals will affect persons who have invested hundreds of thousands of pounds in the establishment of studs in this country and who have imported the best blood horses in the world. In the future this may be the country to which other countries will look for blood horses. The horse-breeding industry is at present the chief outlet for farm products such as oats, chaff, bran and pollard. Therefore, I consider that the Government should be guided by those who are conversant with the conditions in the racing industry. It should not discriminate against those who enjoy this pleasant form of entertainment as compared with those who prefer golf, football, cricket or some other sport. I hope that the Government will think over what I have said and that wiser counsels will prevail. People who normally find their relaxation in the directions I have indioated should, within at an proper limits, be allowed to continue to do so. Question resolved in the affirmative.

Owing religious, or charitable purposes without any charges on the patrons for any expenses of the entertainment; In the following paragraphs of the clause certain other exemptions are provided. No form of appeal against the Commissioner's decision is provided. Moreover, a heavy responsibility will rest upon the Commissioner in determining the facts in relation to the various classes of entertainments specified in the clause. The Commissioner should not be burdened unduly in this way. It is not fair to place such a responsibility upon him, seeing that he is already carrying heavy responsibilities in respect of other discretionary powers. It is particularly important, however, that some form of appeal should be provided against the Commissioner's decisions under the provisions of this clause. to the law courts. expensive. Could not a board of review or something of the kind, be provided? of the Commissioner will determine the points. 15 provides(1.) Where the payment for admission to an entertainment is made by means of a lump sum paid as a subscription or contribution to any club, association, or society, or for a season ticket . . . entertainments tax shall he paid on the amount of the lump sum. The Treasurer will remember that a few days ago the honourable member for Boothby (Dr. Price), the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Stacey), and I , waited upon him on this subject. We pointed out that a tax on a lump sum in such circumstances would be harsh. For instance the tax on a 6s. subscription would be 2s. 4d. plus 3d. in respect of for every 6d. or part thereof by which the admission charge exceeded 6s. 6d. We pointed out that many people paid annual subscriptions to cricket clubs, in encouraging the game of cricket, and only for the secondary reason of obtaining admission to matches. This applies also to other forms of sport. Cricket clubs and similar sporting bodies are to the demands of Avar work, the number of men available to play cricket is greatly reduced, and so, also, is the number of people available to attend cricket matches. The income of such clubs has therefore diminished greatly. We suggested to the Treasurer that the rate of tax should be only at the rate applicable to each separate admission charge covered by the season ticket. For example, if a season ticket covered ten admissions at a certain rate the tax payable should be only ten times the amount payable in respect of each separate admission. member an assurance that the tax will be on tlie rate applicable to each admission charge covered by the season ticket. assurance. Clause 11 deals with the issue of stamped tickets of admission. I have had pointed out to me by the trade press that an administrative difficulty is quite likely to arise in connection with this provision. It may prove to be impracticable to obtain newly printed admission tickets, or even an adequate supply of overprinted admission tickets, to meet the needs by the time this measure will come into operation. I understand that there is a shortage of paper of the colours required for printing admission tickets. Millions of printed tickets are already in the hands of certain showmen, and unless these can be overprinted to comply with the provisions of this clause, they will be wasted.

I support the submissions of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Fadden) in respect of clause 17. The duties of the Commissioner of Taxation in the administration of taxing measures generally, and also in the exercise of discretionary powers such as those provided in clauses 17 and IS need some attention. The whole position is highly complicated to-day. It is only necessary to interview the Commissioner on such matters to realize this fact. Important questions of technique need consideration by him before he can give decisions. It is not possible for him personally to investigate entertainment of this type in order to see whether or not it is such as should be exempt from entertainments tax. Of necessity, he delegates this task to some officer of his department. That is not quite fair either to him or to the public. If the Treasurer reviews the provisions of clauses 17 and 18, he must see that it would really be the function of some other organization to investigate the many applications 'that will come forward, in order to determine whether or not they are of such a character that they fall within the ambit of those provisions. If the public generally desire to hold entertainments of this character, they should have the opportunity to state their case to some authority external to the administration and collection of taxation. If such applithe proclamation of the act. Tickets cations be made formally to the Commissioner, and he rejects them, there should be the right of appeal to another authority. surer) [6.2] -Some thousrht has been given to the matter of a right of appeal, which has been raised by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Fadden) and the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr discretion, under clause 15, to vary the Spooner). So many decisions will have to be reached in regard to minor matters, and others that could be the subject of [5.59] agreement between the parties concerned, that a good deal of work would be thrown on a board such as the Board of Eeference if it had to deal with all the appeals that came forward. A provision similar to that now proposed was enaated in connection with the Federal entertainments tax that previously operated and it also operates in respect of every State entertainments tax. I do not suppose that the public has always been satisfied, but generally grievances have been satisfactorily dealt with by the commissioners in the different States. I cannot imagine that many of the small matters that have to be dealt with would be worthy of pursuing beyond discussion with the department. It is quite true that the Commissioner would not be able to deal with all minor matters that were raised. Developments may warrant the setting up of a special body. The Board of Referees and the Board of Review are already so overloaded that steps have had to be taken to relieve them of some of their work. It would hardly seem the function of a board with a chairman drawing a salary of £2,000 a year to determine whether or not a certain percentage was correct, or a certain subject was educational or otherwise. Who could determine such a matter better than an officer who was on the spot? But I am quite willing to examine the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition. works. points raised by the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt), I say that it is anticipated-and for that reason I have asked that the bill be dealt with to-daythat all tickets will be available before already in the hands of the States will be capable of being used so long as they do not refer to State tax. I understand that arrangements will be made by the taxation authorities which will ensure the use of the majority of such tickets.

If the Treasurer is satisfied, I shall not raise further objection. [6.6] I give to the honourable member the assurance that the Commissioner understands that that is to be the principle underlying the administration of the act. The Parliamentary Draftsman has assured me that that is what is intended. The tax will therefore be administered in that way. I bring to the notice of the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) the case of a cricket club which reduces its subscription charge and imposes only a nominal charge for which no benefit is given in any year. I am a trustee of the Melbourne Cricket Ground. The subscription to the Melbourne Cricket Club is £3 5s. per annum. The American military forces have taken over the ground and are now camped there. The Melbourne Cricket Club has quite a number of obligations which must be met. It desires to retain its membership, and has reduced its subscription rate from £3 5s. to 10s. 6d. per annummerely a nominal sum. No entertainment of any sort is provided on the ground. tax-that is what the clause means. the assurance that that is the meaning of the clause, because I should regard it as unfair if the sum of 10s. 6d., which provides no entertainment and is designed merely to hold the membership together, were subject to any tax. Another matter has been brought to my notice in which I have little concern and just as little interest; it relates to the entertainment tax on "" live"" shows by flesh-and-blood artists. that country shows, at which boxing and various other forms of entertainment may be provided, have not to pay as much in taxation as is paid in respect of boxing matches in capital cities. I should like to know if there is to be any differentiation in the treatment of a boxing entertainment, and a flesh-and-blood vaudeville show at a city theatre. Will the Treasurer say how it is proposed to treat stadium shows? by my officers that stadium shows are not to be regarded, as flesh and blood shows in the sense that stage entertainments are, and that they will not be entitled to the concession.

I agree with the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) that, if the bill has a fault it is that it errs on the side of generosity to the States. It would appear that the Treasurer is not too enthusiastic regarding the possibility of effecting savings, because he proposes to give to the States the same amount of revenue this year as they collected last year. I believe that if the war situation continues to be grave, the Treasurer will come to the conclusion that he has been over-liberal to the States. I should like to be assured that this measure can be amended during the current financial year, and that we are not committed to paying all the money here provided for. I think that the States are receiving too much under this measure. I understand All of them are showing surpluses, and their actual surpluses are twice as much as they show.

This bill may be bad for either of two reasons. If attendances at various forms of entertainment do not decline during this financial year, the Commonwealth Government will obtain too much money from this source, because the tax' that this bill imposes will, levied on the same number of people as attended various entertainments last year, bring in a much greater sum of money than the Government expects. Buti f attendances fall off subOpposition ( Mr Fadden) deplored the stantially, the Commonwealth will not receive so much money as it expects, but the States will still get the amounts that are set out in the bill. In that event, they will receive too much money. Because of the large un.bridged gap between expenditure and revenue, I believe that the Treasurer will be obliged to Leader of the Opposition gazed into the present supplementary budget statements during the current financial year.

When the wool agreement was signed in 1939, it contained a clause providing for annual review of the price provided either partu to the agreement asked for it. in tlie world, having 40 years of herd testing asking for it. United Country party, which professes to represent the wooi-growers, lifted a finger on behalf of the wool-growers until this Government came into office, and the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) went to Great Britain, asked for a rise of price by 15 per cent., and got it. by the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page). General, who went to Britain after having ! visited America. We have stabilized the price of wheat at 4s. a bushel at railway sidings for the first 3,000 bushels. That was a worthwhile achievement. Queensland we are in an anomalous position in that we do not produce sufficient wheat for local consumption. Wheat has to be brought from the south, and it is hard to do so because of the shortage of rolling-stock and congestion on tbe railways. We have guaranteed to the tobacco growers an increase of the price for their leaf by 10 per cent. The price of raw cotton is now 15d. per lb. The price of bacon has risen by 2d. per lb. The dairying industry is the Cinderella of all industries. The men, women and children engaged in it work under conditions of slavery so that the producers may get cheap dairy products. A dairy committee is now inquiring into all matters connected with the industry, and I hope that as the result the dairy fanners will get a better deal. The fifth progress report from the Joint Committee on Rural Industries statesA t its meeting in Sydney in August, 1040, the Australian Agricultural Council considered that the long-term market prospects justified the adoption of an energetic policy of extensive production in the dairying industr y in all States. The British Government placed dairy products high on the priority list and many countries formerly supplying the British market were subject to enemy occupation or control. Take Denmark, for example; it is a little bigger than the western district of Victoria, but it had over 3,000,000 dairy cows. These had to be fed on imported grain, and as the grain is not now reaching the country, probably many of these cows have already been slaughtered for human consumption. These were probably the best cows behind them. Asi t takes three years to multiply dairy animals it will be impossible for Penmark to get back to its old productivity for many years after peace is declared. We have promised Britain 70,000 tons of butter and 40,000 tons of cheese in the financial year 1942-43. That is a sacred undertaking. In addition we have to supply our own men in the Army, our allies, and the civil population, and there is a very great danger that we may not be able to do so. The report proceedsI n his evidence before the committee, the general president of the Agricultural Bureau of New South Wales( Mr Cavanagh) said that if steps were not taken to offset the shortage of man-power there was a very real danger that we will experience a shortage of foodstuffs. He added: "" That is not an overstatement of the position. There will certainly be a shortage of dairy products. The shortage of manpower in the dairying industry is due largely In to the fact that, because the industry never paid very high wages, many young men entered munitions factories and the Army. . . The question in regard to fodder conservation is also serious as the result of continued dry seasons which have exhausted the reserves, and also because of the shortage of man-power experienced last year has not been made good. On top of that, the whole of the State has experienced a severe drought. . . . Fodder conservation is an urgent problem, and should be tackled on a national basis in order to",42,Opposition Members Chil D Endow

In Queensland the State Director of Dairying( Mr Rice) told the committee: "" R u r a l labour, especially under the South Queensland, and I had the p r i v i low wage conditions of dairying, was early depleted owing to the much higher ratio of voluntary enlistments in country districts and the exodus to the attractive high-wage work available in industrial cities and towns. In my travels through dairying districts I have noticed that many farms are unoccupied. . In the South BurnettI was told that nine farms had gone out of dairying. On the Darling Downs, twenty dairy farms have gone out of production in the last twelve months"". . . . Tlie general manager of the Port Curtis Cooperative Dairy Association Limited( Mr Wilson) said: ""Farmers cannot pay good wages on the price they receive for butter. My opinion is that, with a better price for butter, production will increase. If farmers arc to receive a price comparable with that paid in other industries, and appropriate to the hours worked, the price of butter should be 2s. per lb."" workers in ray electorate. decent worker would object to better conditions in the dairying industry. The average annual consumption of butter petcapita in Australia is 31 lb., and an increase of 6d. per lb. would add only 15s. 6d. a year to tbe worker's cost of living. ""We who pride ourselves on our high standard of livin g do not wish to have some of our people working under slavery conditions. The dairyman has to go into his yard twice a day, seven days a week, and 365 days a year, and when he is not there he has to sow feed. We can no longer close our eyes to his perilous state. The dairyman should be able to earn the basic wage, but at current prices he cannot receive this. I think that all primary industries can take a lead fro m the sugar industry, which is the best-organized primary industry in Australia. It is controlled by a board consisting of a representative of the growers, a representative of the manufacturers, and the Chief Justice of Queensland as chairman. No one who has travelled through the sugar country w ill deny that the sugar industry is on a sound basis, and I do not know why its lead cannot be followed by the wheat industry, the dairying industry, and all other primary industries. Wo are experiencing a shortage of tobacco. We grow only one-fifth of our annual requirements. RecentlyI travelled with the Mlinister for Commerce( Mr. Scully) through the tobacco country in lege of visiting the site of the proposed dam at Mingoola, the point at which four creeks-the Pike, the Mole, the Tenterfield and the Severnlea-com e together to form the Dumaresq River. If that dam were built and half a dozen weirs were constructed on the Dumaresq River and the Mclntyre Brook, thousands of acres of country could be irrigated and made suitable for tobacco-growing, and within a few years we should be independent of overseas sources of supply. The cost of the dam would be about £1,000,000, which is less than our war expenditure for one day. Surely we can afford that. Another imperative work is the railway link from Blackall to Charleville. Floods or a bombing raid on the coastal line would isolate North Queensland, but I do not think that any the construction of the Blackall to Charleville line would afford the necessary link. Later the line could he extended from Cunnamulla to Bourke. In order to provide more food for the Motherland we should increase our production of dehydrated mutton. The Minister for Commerce has this project in hand, and I hope that he will expedite his plans. There are many towns in the west of Queensland where dehydration plants could be erected. I turn my attention now to that well-known parrot cry "" inflation "". As soon as any suggestion is made to use the national credit of Australia, there arises the cry "" inflation"". It is only a bogy, and there would be very little, if any, inflation if we had a proper system of controlling prices, interest rates and costs. As a matter of fact, of the two evils, inflation and deflation, the latter is very much the worse. We all had a. taste of it during the depression period of 1931-32. I often hear the cry raised in this House that the Labour party is using war-time conditions as an excuse to introduce its policy. We make no apology for that. That is why we are here.

I read in a newspaper recently that the coal-mining industry in Great Britain has been nationalized. Many people claim that government enterprises are not successful.

However much we Australia. I understand that national credit was extended last year by an amount of £78,000,000. I hope that it will be extended very much more this year. I work in industry.

I hope that we do not pay a person 'according to sex. We should pay for work done. We should now begin planning a system of post-war rehabilitation because, when the war is over, conditions in this country will be chaotic unless we have planned thoroughly in advance. I am not enamoured of the word ""austerity"", which is heard so much to-day. it connotes bitterness, rigidity, nastiness, sourness. We should rather use the word "" Spartan"", which suggests simplicity, frugality, and intense courage. We all know the story of how 300 Spartans held the pas3 at Thermopylae to the last man. We want more of that sort of thing. We also need a spiritual background, so that we shall move forward in faith and in hope, not with bitterness or austerity. We should move forward with a clear eye, a smile on our lips, and a quip on our tongues to meet the worse that may come. I hope that when this tragic nightmare of war is past, we shall have plans for national reconstruction ready to be put in operation. In conclusion I trust that before long we shall hear the wings of the dove of peace fluttering at the gateway of a glorious day. of the United Australia party) 18.45]. -The Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) laid great stress on the size of this budget. It was natural and proper for him to do so, for the budget is a record, and makes an interesting contrast to the budget presented to the first CommonTho Post Office also is a wealth Parliament, which provided for £10,000,000 of receipts and £10,000,000 of expenditure. But the size of this budget should, not be disturbing, in itself, for it is an outward and visible sign of the wonderful progress that this may differ from the Government in relation to the incidence of taxation, and the means by which the money is to be obtained, we are agreed that the money can, and will be found. This budget provides advocate equal pay for equal for a total expenditure of £550,000,000, of which £440,000,000 is required for war purposes. Of that war total £140,000,000 is to be provided from revenue, and £300,000,000 from loans. The Treasurer warned us that the estimate of expenditure might be exceeded. I think this is quite probable. As I see it, this budget has two major defects. The Opposition does not complain of the amount of taxation to be levied, but of its incidence. The taxes are not being imposed fairly.

There is an irreducible minimum in relation to tbe standard of living which must be preserved. It is necessary to maintain the physical and moral fitness of our people. That is vital. But, subject to this consideration, every body should contribute to the war effort according to his means. The Opposition objects to the budget, also, because it provides for the vast sum of £300,000,000 to be obtained by voluntary loans. Consider the circumstances of the people of this country. A t least 1,000,000 income-earners w ill contribute nothing in taxation. So far as I know this is the only country in the British Empire of which that is true.

He would not have been here but for it . The money spent on the war effort has found its way into the pockets, principally, of wage-earners in the lower ranges of income. Two millions and more are practically exempt from taxation. Thati t has not gone into the pockets of the employers or the well-to-do is proved by glancing down the taxation schedule. Take the case of a man in receipt of 1 £5,000 a year who must by any standard be classed as a bowelless plutocrat who deserves to "" get it in the neck "". What has happened to him? Before the war his income tax amounted to £800 odd a year, leaving him with £4,200. now is £3,300 which leaves him with only £1,700.

II sa.y is that there is no reason to believe application of the principle of compulflint we have not the capacity to produce all that is necessary of munitions and of food at tlie present rate, and even at an accelerated rate. Returning to the question of loans, I say frankly that I cannot understand the attitude of the Government towards compulsory loans. It is illogical, and inconsistent with the basic principles of the Labour party. That party, as everybody knows, rests upon compulsion. ship of the party is on a voluntary basis. the fir3t plank of the party is now; but when I was a member of the party the platform began with socialism, or something of that kind-and that, of course, is based upon supremacy of the State and limitation of the freedom of action of the individual. Then, too, Labour believes quite properly in unionism. Unionism is voluntary in theory, but in practice it is compulsory. It would never be able to function without compulsion. When I was in the ranks of the waterside workers, no man was permitted to work on the wharves who was not a member of the wharf labourers' union. That is true of every union which can do more lihan bleat. SoI say that compulsion is the foundation upon which the doctrines of the Labour party have been built. That has been the case ever since Labour came into politics. But the present position is without parallel in the history of this country. Every man of military age is compelled to join the Army. Every man of any age, provided he is physically fit, and every woman, too, is compelled to work where the Government directs, at the task to which the Government puts him or her, and at the hours and for the wages that arn fixed by awards made under the law. The Government swallows this camel and strains at that gnat-it conscripts labour to fight and to work but it will not agree to compulsory loans-frankl y I cannot understand its attitude. It is true, of course, that when those who now occupy the ministerial benches were in opposition, and my right honourable friend the present Leader of the Opposition ( Mr goods there must be control over the Fadden) introduced n measure for the sory loans, they opposed it. I can understand that; it was natural. They were in opposition and so they opposed the Government's proposals. But now they are in office, and have done things that I never dared to do; they have introduced industrial conscription-the most odious of all-bu t they still balk, at compulsory loans. Whatever else may be said of honourable members who sit on this side of the chamber, although none of them dared to conscript labour, we did dare to propose compulsory loans. I want to make my position perfectly clear. I am not objecting to what the Government has done. But having done so much, why does it now hesitate to apply the principle of compulsory loans? The alternative is inflation. I know very well that some honourable members opposite, happily not very many of them, believe that it is possible, by some hocuspocus, tofinancethe war by means of bank credit. They believe that wars are fought with money. Their leader has reminded them times out of number that wars are fought with physical things-wit h men and things made'by men. If there were anything in the idea of national credit, and wars could befinancedby such means, I put it to my friends who talk so glibly about it-and who, incidentally, in nine cases out of ten, are Communists, with a label that is either displayed or carefully concealed inside -the lapels of their coatsthat Russia would have financed its war operations in that way long ago. Yet what is it doing? It walks the same hard road as the people of every other country. Russia finances its war out of the savings of its people, who are compelled to loan them to the government. That is a sensible way of carrying on business. Russia pays its people interest on their loans. Every body knows that money is not only a medium of exchange, but also a measure of value. In these days, when metallic money has been displaced by paper money, the relation between the quantity of money and goods available for consumption is not so clear as it was formerly; but for all practical purposes it amounts to this: that if there is to be stability of the prices of quantity of money available.

231,Mr Hughes,"I do not know whatspeaking, the more money in circulation, the dearer the goods; and the more goods, the cheaper they are. In order to maintain stable price levels, control of money iu circulation is essential. Too much money means inflation. In order to produce goods, labour and capital must be expended but in order to produce money, all that is needed is to print more notes or ro change the figures on the note, putting "" 5 "" in place of "" 1 "" . It is very simple. receipts and expenditure. Notes are poured out, but as there can be no corresponding increase of the quantity of goods, money loses its value, the people get .alarmed and because prices rise, more money is printed. And so it goes onmoney loses value with every additional issue of new notes. Inflation spells ruin. To those men in this country who and seek to hoard it, to those who think that by putting their money in a savings bank they can escape from the consequences of inflation, I say that that is the road to destruction and disaster. Their money will remain there, but its value will disappear. The Government, is carrying on the business of this country, and I am supporting it. But unless it be prepared to make such provisions as are necessary for ensuring the success of the loans that are essential to the carrying on of the war effort, it will be impossible to fight inflation and, consequently, disaster will follow. gratulate the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) upon having placed before the committee a forthright and simple story in his presentation of the largest war-time budget this country has ever had, and far larger than anything ever forecast. Associated with it are certain pleasant circumstances. The most pleasant is that the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Fadden) has stated that it is the intention of the party that he leads to co-operate with the Government in its attempt to raise the money that it needs to finance the war. The other pleasing thing about the. budget is that nearly all the increased expenditure is for war purposes. Civil expenditure has been kept down to a minimum, and last j-ear was £3,000,000 below the estimate. Let us hope that a similar result can be achieved this yeaT. It is true that the estimate for civil expenditure is £8,000,000 higher than last year, but practically all of that is represented by expenditure on social services, to which Parliament has agreed. The major criticism that can be levelled against the budget is that there is a gap -the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Fadden) calls it a dangerous gap-of £300,000,000 between the estimates of bridge that gap? a different matter altogether from finance in peace-time. The Government, in time of peace, can expand credit for expenditure upon the purchase of consumable goods. The whole process becomes have money in their pockets practically a business transaction, and the money flows back into the Treasury. In time of war, most of the national expenditure is devoted to the production of goods which .are destroyed. They do not go on the market to be bought by the public. Nevertheless, the money finds its way into the hands of the people. Unfortunately, the belief seems to be gaining ground that the war can be financed by central bank credit without taxation. The Treasurer has said that in that way lies grave danger. The Government finances the war by the issue of treasury bills, which are discounted by the Commonwealth bank. The money finds its way to the manufacturers for the purchase of war goods, and to the people in the form of wages. Unless that money returns to the Treasury, we shall have inflation, pure and simple, and it can return only in the form of taxes, or of loans-eithe r interest bearing or noninterest bearing. The best method, and the one which would leave no future debt, would be to get the money hack in the form of taxes. The second best way would be to get it back in the form of interest-free loans, whilst the third method, which is the one generally followed, is to get it back in the form of interest-bearing loans subscribed by the people. This is the method which the Government has chosen to follow. does not expect that the Government will be able to raise all that money. Mir.

259,Mr Coles,"I shall give the honorrationalize industry. These acts represent positive achievements by the Government, which, in the interests of the country, has departed from many of the views which Ministers expressed whon they sat in opposition. Eor that, they are worthy of the trust of the people, and I believe that they enjoy that trust. able member believe that previous governments attempted to do these things, but that the Labour party opposed them for political reasons? in positive action, as opposed to words, and therefore I applaud what is good. The rationalization of industry is almost inextricably linked with reconstruction in the post-war period. As about 50 per cent, of our man-power has heen diverted to war activities, the Government must hasten to re-organize industries which, because they handle materials required for war purposes, have not been put out of existence. From the depleted man-power that remains, the Government most get the greatest possible value, so that the needs of the Army may be satisfied, and the minimum needs of the civilian population may be maintained. To achieve those objects, the Government must group some industries. It ia not possible to wage war without losses. Soldiers risk their lives in battle, if it, finds itself in the position of having and unfortunately many of them are killed. In the circumstances, no great hardship is imposed on the civilian population if they have to lose, for the time being, a portion of their earnings. When the Department of War Organization of Industry begins to regroup the activities of industry, in order to get the maximum efficiency with the least man-power, the Minister should keep in view the potential capacity of each industry for future expansion. ""No one knows when we shall emerge from this war. The end may be a year or five years' hence. But many people are wondering what will happen in the postwar period. It is much easier to build on a known foundation, than to begin afresh in a competitive world, in which other countries will be fighting for our markets. Therefore, I urge the Minister to consult, at every step, people engaged in various industries, seek their advice, and, if possible, adopt their suggestion?. The pooling of petrol, while simple in itself, was an extraordinarily good example of how the rights of those engaged in an industry may be merged and yet protected for later expansion. Another principle to be observed in the rationalization of industry, which is most important, is that we should never totally destroy an industry. If we were to do so, the morale of the people would be depressed. When I was in Great Britain last year, I noticed that the Government adopted the policy, in constricting industry, to allow some goods to trickle to the consumers. The goods might have been available once every quarter and stocks might have been exhausted in a week, but the morale of the people was maintained, because their factories continued to operate and they believed that the war was not lost. The women were able to buy lipstick, and men were able to buy hair oil, in small quantities; and, so, they believed that Old England was carrying on. I shall support the Government, and shall do everything in my power to make the spirit of the people such that they will subscribe the money that the Treasurer requires for war purposes. If they do not, I shall support the Government to introduce post-war credits or compulsory loans. member support the Government if it does not introduce post-war credits or compulsory loans? arises I shall face it. have listened in common with other honourable members with great interest to this strange and somewhat melancholy apology delivered by the honourable member for Henty( Mr Coles).

266,Mr Menzies,"Oh, yes.",53,Opposition Members Chil D Endow
267,Mr Mcewen,He comes down from,53,Opposition Members Chil D Endow
268,""" Mr Menzies","Yes, from 21 to 3.place, he said that the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Fadden) had offered cooperation in "" this thing "" I quote his own words"" this thing"", and I take it the honourable gentleman was referring to the budget. I must say that I am indebted to him. I cannot imagine a better description of this budget than the phrase which I have just quoted. The remark, of course-wha t shall I say? I must use the parliamentary expressionhappened to lack foundation, because the Leader of the Opposition condemned this budget roundly. He offered no co-operation in carrying out such a strange financial scheme as is contained in this budget. What he did say was that the Opposition would co-operate in all those things necessary to the winning of the war, and there is a very sharp distinction between the things necessary for the winning of the war and the budget, which is calculated to impair the war effort of this country. The second thing that the honourable member for Henty said was that he admired the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley). If he had paused there, .1 should have agreed with him, because 3 admire the Treasurer very much. But he said that he admired him for his clear and simple statement of the finances of this country. I shall come back to that in a moment, because the statement of the finances of this country was not clear and it was not simple and, in point of fact it will be disastrous. But, in the third place, the honourable member for Henty engaged in a sort of feeling reminiscence of the last election and said, "" I believe in the law of change "". My word! that was a profound truth. If anybody has had a good look at the campaign in Henty at the last election and compared the speeches then made by the honourable member, who was a candidate, with the speech that he has made here to-night and some of the other speeches he has made in this chamber, he would say, "" Why this man is the very embodiment of the law of change"". I cannot help remembering that at the last election the honourable member, standing as an independent candidate for Henty, with the full support of the United Australia party organization in every senseI emphasize that-in every sense, was happy indeed to seek the suffrage of what was a nonlabour electorate, which could be won only by a candidate who stood on the non-Labour side, and before the law of change had begun to do its deadly work, said, as I recall it, that he stood foi three things. The first was conscription. He now supports a Government which is pledged against it. The second thing ho stood for was a national government. He has now transferred his humble allegiance to the one party which has stood against a national government and whose opposition has prevented it from coming into existence. In the third place, he said that he stood for an all-in war effort. He now stands for a war effort which means all-in for some people and pretty well all-out for hundreds of thousands of others. Now, if we were dealing with an ordinary mortal, these things would excite comment. People would say, ""Oh, that is strangely inconsistent, is it not? How can a man preach one gospel in September. 1940, and another quite as eloquently, I assure you, in September. 1942? "" The answer is although that is not a bad answer; but the real answer is, "" Oh, since then with my wealth of experience in Parliament and on committees, on the rationing committee and on the war damage committee. I have discovered that the one thing that counts is the law of change "". I shall now take the honoraible member, for Henty into ground contained in this budget speech of the Treasurer, which, as described by the honourable member, is such a simple, clear, convincing and even determined statement of financial policy. I have read the speech with some interest, somewhat more closely I imagine than has the honourable member for Henty, and I find in it a most remarkable series of events. In the first place, the speech set out in the 3hop window such goods as the Government thought might be saleable at the next election in all electorates, including Henty, where I understand confidently, there will not be a labour candidate. AndI approve of that, because I think that one is quite unnecessary. Then having set out the goods in .the shop window, the speech goes on to set out what the expenditure will be in this financial year, and I direct attention, in passing,",53,Opposition Members Chil D Endow
269,Mr Spender,A lemon.,54,Opposition Members Chil D Endow
270,Mr Menzies,"No, not a lemon,to one passage from it . IndeedI would respectfully direct tlie honourable member for Henty, as a financial man, to it . After the Treasurer bas set out what the expenditure will be on bis estimates he says-In suite of its size I must warn honourable members that the experience of last year may be repeated and the figure exceeded as the result of the dire necessities of the grim struggle that lies ahead. That is true. If the war expenditure is estimated at this stage to be £440,000,000, who shall say that at the end of the financial year it will not have amounted to £500,000,000. 1 accept that. It is a proper warning. I paid some attention to it , but, as events w ill show, the Treasurer paid none. Now, having set that out, the Treasurer goes on-and this no doubt, wa» the passage which was admired by the honourable member for HentyUnder the arrangement made with the Chan cellor of the Exchequer by my colleague the right honourable the Attorney-General, obligations which we cannot currently meet will be postponed for consideration after the war. 1 invite 'the honourable member for Henty to ask himself in the watches of the night what that means. Mr Coi.su -Thar, means a lag. ber says that it means a lag. I say ro -him that what it means is that the responsibilities of this country for the financing of the war are to a degree being paid for the time being by the people of Great, Britain. The honourable member surely will agree with that. The next thing that we find in this budget speech is this. The Treasurer summarizes the budget, and having stated his revenue and his expenditure, he brings out as the "" deficiency (to be financed by loans, &c.) ""-1941-42 , £211,000,000; and 1942-4'3, £300,000,000. f f the defence expenditure is £60,000,000 over what it has been estimated to be, then the £300,000,000 must become £360,000,000. There is a short, clear, simple statement of the problem. Last year a gap of £211,000,000 had to be filled, and this year a gap of somewhere between £300.000.000 and £400,000,000 will havt to be filled. What happened Inst £127,000,000 and treasury-bills, a draft upon the central bank of the country, accounted for £78,500,000. As to the loans themselves, it is quite true bhat the public borruwing increased by 100 per cent, over the previous year. It would have been curious if it had not, because in the meantime Japan had entered the war, and this country had a sense of imminent danger it had never experienced before. It would have been a strange reflection on the Australian people if loans had not risen, but, notwithstanding all those factors, the total borrowing amounted to £127,000,000. That would suggest to the unsophisticated mind that in this year the Government must be content to have an enormous gap unbridged by central bank credit, or it must, by some means, enormously increase voluntary subscriptions to loans in Australia, or it must exercise compulsion upon every income earner in Australia in order to make up the deficiency. I know no other than those three ways to approach this problem. terest be paid ? question. I refer the honourable member to the Treasurer, because the Treasurei says, with a mere gesture, 30 admired by the honourable member f o i Henty, "" We will borrow £300,000,000 "". He explains that in his speech. I shall quote the passage, because, to my mind, this is the most frivolously irresponsible statement of finance I have ever readThe amount of loans required this year is large, but its provision is not impossible. Last year we doubled the receipts from public loans' and got £120,000,000. If we double them again and I interrupt myself to say that thia is the oldest game of childhood-thin k of a number and then double it . It appealed at once to the honourable member for Griffith( Mr Conelan). He was saying that when 'the results were coming in during the last election! The Treasurer saidIf we double them again we shall get £240,000,000. The arithmetic is impeccablewhich will take us a long way on our journey. It will leave £00,000,000 to be provided from savings bonds and savings certificates. This is about the British rate of contributions to year?

273,Mr Menzies,"D o not ask me that I invite honourable members to have a look at that passage, to chew it over. If we double what we got last year then we shall have £240,000,000. If we subscribe to war savings certificates in the same way and with the same fervour as the hard-pressed people of Great Britain have done out of their much smaller earnings, then we shall have £60,000,000. What are the facts ? In his previous budget speech, the Treasurer said, ""Last year ""-h e was referring to the deplorable regime of myself and my distinguished friend, the Leader of the Opposition"" we got £12,500,000. This year we shall double it "" . And with equal accuracy it was ascertained, on reference to the Treasury, that twice £12,500,000 was £25,000,000. What, in fact, did he get, net ?-£9,000,000 . War savings certificate subscriptions fell in Australia in this great year of emergency by £3,500,000; yet, in spite of that experience, the Treasurer said "" It is all right. I believe in the voluntary system for ever, and, although it is true that there was a little recession from £12,500,000 to £9,000,000, this year we can get £60,000,000"". able gentleman believe that the poorer people took out small loans instead of buying war savings certificates? about the borrowing? I put this to honourable members on the Government side of the chamber: How manymen and how many women who subscribed to public loans last year will be able to subof change may apply to the honourable scribe the same amount this year? We can judge this by our own experience. [ have, I suppose in common with most honourable members, made a point of making such subscriptions as I could to every loan that has been floated in this country during this war. I shall be very lucky to subscribe in the current financial year one-tenth of what I was able to subscribe in the previous financial year. right honourable gentleman get the money by compulsory loans ? ber has conveniently forgotten one thing a thing out of which he likes to make political capital. The simple truth is that the great income total in the lower income bracket in Australia is not doing its share in the finanoing of this war. [14] week. the honourable member trotting out this moth-eaten statement about an average of £3 a week. This is the oldest thing in politics. He says, "" How many breadwinners are there, and what is the total "", and then he works out an average. He includes among the breadwinners small boys earning 10s. a week and youngsters seventeen years of age, who have started work at £1 a week. He knows perfectly well that the adult male wage in this country, if it is taken out on an annual basis, has probably doubled since this war began. Furthermore, he knows that, at the last point at which we had any accurate information, 70 per cent, of the total of all incomes in Australia was being earned by people with incomes of less than £8 a week. Nobody is going to get any pleasure by standing up and saying "" Look here, you have a modest income. You must pay towards this war"". But every body knows, nobody better than those who are in charge of the Government, that if you are going to finance this war you must reduce the enormous volume of purchasing power of the country for civil goods and civil services, whether you like it or not. Then my friends opposite have a choice. They can reduce purchasing power in one of three ways-thi s is the essence of this financial problem. They can do it by taxing, but they say "" Oh, no! The law member for Henty, but it does not apply to us. We are pledged against taxing these people, and therefore we must forget about taxation"". That leaves two methods. The second method is to impose a system of post-war credits, that is to say, to take the money from the people at this stage and give them credit for it, a credit which will be beyond value to them when the war is over. In other words, this second method is to make a part of their pay deferred pay. But, of course, the Leader of the Opposition put up that proposal in crystal-clear terms when, as Prime Minister and Treasurer, he introduced a budget. That budget was dismissed, he was dismissed, and, what is even more melancholy, I was dismissed. In fact, quite a number of us were dismissed.",55,Opposition Members Chil D Endow

Nevertheless, I venture to make a prophecy that, before it is nine months older, it will do so. The third method of reducing the purchasing power of the people is to do it by inflation, the easiest, not, because one of the fouT freedoms is tlie most cowardly and the most unjust of all the methods. That is the method alluded to by my amiable friends in tbe corneT, who are still licking their wounds. bogy. They say it is only a bogy! I shall say a few words about this bogy in a moment. Just now I do not want to draw myself away from the interesting task I had in hand of finishing my glance at this speech. I have told the committee what the Treasurer said about the method of raising the money. It is remarkable; it is a sort of abracadabra. Then, having got that off his chest, I can imagine that the Treasurer, who is by no means lacking in a sense of humour, said to himself, "" Well, now. that was not so good "". So, I imagine, he went away to my distinguished friend, the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt), and said, "" Can you suggest some way by which I can recover my balance on. this thing"" ; and the Attorney-General, with that ingenuity which I have admired in him for many years, said, "" That is all right""-address ing the Treasurer by a suitable appellation"" we can have a paragraph about post-war reconstruction"". And so, in went the paragraph about post-war reconstruction. Far be it from me to quarrel with one word of the picture that is painted of what we need in this post-war reconstruction. This paragraph sets out objectives which I hope are common to decent men and women all over Australia. So far as I am concerned, I subscribe to them and shall do everything in my power to bring them into reality. However, I take the opportunity to draw attention to this fact: Towards the end of that paragraph, after the reference to a constitutional referendum which is received with only modified raptures, there is this statementIt will, therefore, ask the people of Ausfact, the Treasurer has budgeted for the tralia to arm the Commonwealth Parliament with full power to ensure that the four freedoms shall be enjoyed throughout the Commonwealth and its territories. gentleman in favour of this? apparently the honourable gentleman is freedom from want, and if there be one sure way of plunging the people of this country or any country into want it is wholesale inflation of the currency. My friends in the corner can make these sounds of oachinnation, they can whistle to keep up their spirits as they go past their financial graveyards, but the truth is, as they know, that there has heen no country yet in the history of the world that has plunged into inflation as a method of finance that has not, before many years have passed, plunged its people into that very want, freedom from which was one of the four freedoms propounded by the President of the United States of America, I say that there is no better way of preserving the people of Australia against want than to keep the economic structure of the country stable into the post-war period. Having touched on that matter in what I take leave to say was a paradoxical fashion, the Treasurer ended by saying-and this has appealed to me as a sort of deathbed repentanceNo legerdemain can produce the needs for war. Neither can they be obtained by easy financial expedients. able member write that himself? so indeed. It expresses my sentiments to perfection. Does it not express the honourable gentleman's sentiments? did not. That is a statement that can not be improved upon. I had taken a much longer statement from another source, hut I discarded it, because here you have the true essence of the matterNo legerdemain can produce the needs foi war. Neither can they be obtained by easy financial expedients. That is the theory of it. What is the practice of it in this budget?

287,Mr Menzies,"I thought perhaps nsaying, "" Here is a gap of £300,000,000, which will probably be exceeded. You can add to it any number you can think of. How do I bridge that gap ?"" Does he really believe that he is going to borrow £300,000,000 from the public with no compulsion, by pure voluntary subscription? Does he believe that he will be able to tap the current savings of the people of Australia-that is the only true way to avoid inflation-to the tune of £300,000,000 unless he takes every step to create that fund of savings in advance? How can he create that fund in advance? By all-round rationing, by compulsory borrowing in the form of post-war credits, and by taxation. I know of no other course he can pursue to create such a fund of savings on which the Government may draw. If the honourable gentleman does not do these things, I prophesy-and I regard it as a conservative prophecy honourable member it would be a conservative prophecy. conservative than rattle-pated. I make the conservative prophecy that whereas in the last financial year it appears that the central hank was tapped for £S0,000,000 in treasury-bills, it will be an of 1,220. In other words, during that extraordinarily fortunate institution, and this will be an extraordinarily fortunate country,-if in this financial year, the bank by about 20 per cent, is not tapped for £180,000,000 in treasury-bills. wibh that? gentleman realize the effect on the eco> nomy of this country of injecting, in two years, £260,000,000 worth of central bank credit into our financial system? I remind him that last year's injections have not been dealt with in this budget. No provision has been made for funding treasury-bills issued last year. They go on, and may have added to them £1S0,000,000 wor,tlh of similar bills this year. The effect of what has been done already may be seen in the symptoms of inflation in Australia. I direct attention to two or three interesting factors in this connection. Inflation, as honourable members may realize, but as perhaps too few people in this country have discovered, is only another way of devaluing the currency. The currency, in fact, becomes worth less in commodity values. The sure test of commodity values is the price levels. Our price-index is computed in various ways. I have taken, as offering a fair average base, the wholesale prices calculated on the average of the three years ended June, 1939, which was ithe end of the financial year nearest to the beginning of the war. mation was obtained from Dhe Melbourne Stock Exchange? tion was obtained from the Commonwealth Statistician, a most reputable authority, who no doubt will confirm the figures if the honourable member cares to approach him, though I do not expect that that will happen. The wholesale prices of basic materials and foodstuffs over the three years ended June, 1939, which gave an index figure of 1,000, by June of this year gave an index figure of 1,327. The retail prices for the six capital cities-that is, the "" C "" seriesfor the three years ended June, 1939, which gave an index figure of 1,000, by June of this year gave an index figure period the purchasing power of money, expressed in terms of goods, had fallen per cent. able gentleman will realize that it depends upon which figures are accepted as the basis; but I shall not quarrel with his IS per cent. I said about 20 per cent. Let us look at the note issue, to which the Leader of the Opposition referred. In September, 1939, it totalled £51,000,000. By the end of June, 1942, it had risen to nearly £103,000,000. There is some reason to believe that at present it is about £110,000,000. faster ? with the verbiage of the race-course, and, apparently, I shall have little opportunity to amend that deficiency; but this horse gallops faster and faster the longer it travels.

297,Mr Menzies,"I am not familiarwhat inflation has done to other countries, some honourable gentlemen opposite will immediately reply, ""Yes, but that cannot happen to us. We are so much more clever than' the people of those other countries. We know so much more about finance than the people of Germany and France, who dealt with finance there after the last war"". I do not believe it for a moment. I believe that onoe the path of financial rectitude is departed from and an inflationary movement started, it will defeat the best wit of man to stop it, except by methods which would probably be politically entirely unpalatable. With other honourable members on this side of the committee, I consider it necessary, for various reasons, to state my views plainly, if briefly, on the sinister inflationary element in this budget. The tendency towards inflation is indicated clearly in the rising price levels. These inexorably and inevitably impose a very real tax on the f l note, whoever owns it. E tell my honourable friends opposite that the day will come when those who have voted for them will say, "" How is i i that my money is worth less now than it was? How is it that, although I have been given a bigger pension, my bigger pension is worth less to me in terms of meat, potatoes, cauliflowers aud bread than was my original pension ?"" the Menzies Government""! fact will remain that the inflation will have devalued the f l note, alike of the old-age pensioner and the wealthiest millionaire in the country. I should like to say a word-and here I borrow a phrase from the right honourable the Prime Minister-for those whom I represent-the middle section of people in this country: those who have fixed incomes; salary-earners, who have saved money and desire to live on it ; those who have struggled hard for independence. They are the people who are hit most cruelly, and are ultimately destroyed, by inflation. pointed out, quite truly, by observers, that the great continentalinflations of 1923 did one thing more successfully than any other-the y destroyed the middle classes of Germany; and when they did that, they opened the door as wide as a church door for the entry of national socialism. Do not let us forget that. One of the great balancing factors in this and any other country is what I have referred to as the middle section of people. It is all very well for any of my friends to go to the wage-earner, and say: "" It is all right. . If the price of goods goes up, your wages will go up according to the rise of the cost of living "". If the wage-earner allows himself to be deceived by that, I shall be sorry for him; because there never has been a period in the world's history when upward prices have been overtaken by upward wages. The prices rise first, and the wages plod laboriously after them. Therefore, I warn the Government not to believe that it can escape from its financial responsibilities by the easy upward movement of prices through inflation. Those who are on salaries', whose incomes are fixed, cannot go to an arbitration court and say: "" Will you increase our salaries, because the cost of living has risen?"" They have to accept the position. They are completely ground between the upper and nether millstones in any economic system, and are readily forgotten when we are discussing the finances of the country. The last thing that I want to say about inflationand this is merely by way of recalling it to the memory of honourable members-is that when there is a great inflation you may bet your boots that it will be followed by a great depression. After all, if there is one thing that stands out clearly in connection with the financial affairs of the last war, it is that we then financed ourselves by means of inflation. Everybody then said: "" There is plenty of money about; let's eat, drink, and be merry"". They did not believe that tomorrow they would die. But the whirligig of time brought its revenges, and the great inflation was followed by a great depression. it? war, finance had been conducted all over the world with due regard to the diabolical results that can flow from inflation, there would have been no need for",58,Opposition Members Chil D Endow

I say to honourable members "" You cannot fill the stomachs of the people of Australia with a windy diet of promises as to what you are going to do for them after the war"". [Extension of time granted.] It is all very well for honourable members opposite-and I am now addressing myself to one or two of my friends in the corner-to go around drawing sketches of the new heaven and the new earth that will arise in Australia if only Labour be in office. We all are familiar with the particular jargon that is employed in order to describe it.

Minister) [10.32] -The right honourable gentleman who has just resumed his seat has treated us to very much the same sort of speech as he delivered a year ago. It has been full of the evils of inflation. He prefaced his remarks in that connection with what I regretted to observe was an attack upon an honourable member for having indicated, very clearly and specifically, the reasons for the vote that he intends to give. reasons. gentleman was not here at the time. been here practically the whole of this evening. I confess that if I wished to relax from the strain of the present era 1 should regard this as probably the only place in which I could comfortably do so. Taken as a whole, I feel quite confident that the right honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Menzies) would not have delivered the speech that he has delivered to-night, or that which he made a year ago, had he sat on this side of the Chairman of Committees. To-night, the right honourable gentleman said that, inflation having started, it is impossible to arrest it I remind him that the budgets that But nobody cared; consequently, have been introduced into this Parliament since the war commenced have been budgets which laid down three sources from which revenue was to be derived in order to meet war expenditure. These were taxation, loans, and central bank provision. That has been one of the principles of each budget statement made to this committee. The objection to the present budget is that it provides for a war expenditure that is so considerable that the total amount of taxation which is considered fair and reasonable, plus the total amounts of loans which can be raised according to any principle, either voluntary or compulsory, would still leave a deficiency on the total expenditure which the Opposition has accepted as nroper. honourable gentleman get that idea? any speech that has been made either in the Parliament or out of it. I say quite frankly that the £24,000,000 which the right honourable gentleman who now leads the Opposition proposed to raise by means of post-war credits, in the budget which he introduced last year, has already been absorbed into the revenue by means of the direct taxes which this Parliament has imposed, and by the incidence of the indirect taxation that has been levied. Therefore the total tax levied by this Government during the time it has been in office has exhausted the field of postwar credits which the budget statement of the right honourable the Leader of the Opposition envisaged. limiting the amount then stated. we shall find that the last Government proposed in its budget to raise £25,000,000 by post-war credits. The present Government has actually imposed new taxes to the amount of approximately £75,000,000. Whether the moneys required be taken by post-war credits or taxation, this Government has collected for the purpose of war by its taxation policy three times more than the sum which the Leader of the Opposition proposed to get by post-war credits. what is called the gap.

312,Mr Curtin,"I am dealing withand central bank credits were tbe tbree sources from wbicb the two previous Governments and this Government have had to obtain the money needed to meet the war expenditure. The last budget submitted by the Leader of the Opposition would have yielded £74,000,000 less tax than this Government has imposed, but post-war credits which this Government did not impose would have yielded £25,000,000. There is a difference of about £50,000,000. But it should be remembered that this Government raised enormously increased sums by loans over the amounts contemplated by the Leader of the Opposition. are dealing with facts. With more than £100,000,000 of increased war expenditure, this Government has met the problem of finance in the last year with approximately the same use of central bank credits as the previous governments proposed. I invite representative members of the Opposition to have that argument out with me in a place where the umpires can deal with it, the umpires being those who have had to find the money. have it out. opposite have had the argument, and I say to the country most positively that this Government, in the last financial year, found £100,000,000 to meet increased war expenditure without any exceptional drain on central bank credits over and above that contemplated in the budget statement of the Leader of the Opposition when he was Prime Minister and Treasurer. I invite contradiction or challenge on that statement. It is perfectly true that the Treasurer contemplates the use of central bank credit in dealing with the gap in this budget. Is he the only Treasurer who has to deal with this tremendous burden of expenditure in that way? It is most extraordinary that not one criterion of comparison has been put forward by the Opposition in this regard to show that this Government is doing something which is unprecedented. What it is doing is not unprecedented, but is a commonplace of national finance in every country that is at war. gentleman would not get anywhere with that argument. took special pains in his budget speech to justify the use of central bank credit when the expenditure on war was comparatively modest. amount of unemployment. was unemployment, and why? It was because governments of that type had been in office too long. I have before me a table dealing with the gap for the 1942-43 financial year, and showing war expenditure, non-war expenditure, total expenditure, revenue on the basis of 194142 taxation and post-war credits, balance to befinancedhy additional taxation and loans, &c, increases in taxes in 194243, increases in post-w.ar credits in 1942-43, and the amount to be financed by loans, &c. This table deals with Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States of America. The amount to be financed by loans in this country is £300,000,000. Honourable members opposite say that that is impossible, and that it will mean place to inflation. Could the money be raised compulsorily ? determine. orable gentleman that the amount which it would be reasonable by any system of duress to levy compulsorily is approximately the amount which it is expected that this country will provide voluntarily, and that the effect of the gap on the loan provision, as estimated by the Treasurer, is approximately the same whether compulsion or the voluntary principle be used. In the course of the speech of the Leader of the Opposition on this budget, the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) asked me how much we expected to get in voluntary loans, and I -said about £200,000.000.'

324,Mr Ourtin,"I say to the right honOpposition work it out? The right honourable member for Kooyong, directing attention to the general impact on personal incomes, said that during the present financial year it would be difficult for expenditure amounting to £100,000,000 a great number of people to contribute. He said that their patriotism, however great, could not withstand the strain of the taxes imposed on them and their other obligations. Citing his own case, he said that he would have difficulty in subscribing to loans as freely as he had done hitherto. The right honourable member is not an exception. There will be thousands of men like him in Australia, and does he, who cites his own case in this Parliament, suggest that, under a system of compulsory loans, he would be able to do better this year than he is able to do under the voluntary system? Surely that is not so. ter deny that, by a system of compulsion, it would be possible to get better results than under a voluntary system? surer expects to raise approximately £300,000,000 by loan, of which we feel quite certain that at least £200,000,000 can be raised from the public. I am convinced that .any system of compulsion thatsought to obtain a total of more than £200,000,000 this financial year, in addition to what the people will contribute in direct and indirect taxation, would be at once rejected by the right honourable member for Kooyong, as placing an intolerable burden upon the taxpayers. I have not been so stupid as to have failed to discover for myself what would be-the net gain to the Treasury from a system of compulsory loans. orable gentleman sees that the deficit of £100,000,000 must be met by somebody? gap is there, and it occurs, in the first place, because of the time lag between the issuing of the money to the public and the getting of it back to the Treasury in one form and another. In the second place, it occurs because expenditure for war purposes is immediate. Honourable members know that new projects are put forward from month to month, and sometimes from day to day. Emergency expenditure of all kinds must be undertaken. Large additions to the fighting services have to be provided for. Much of the expenditure is of a capital nature, such as that on munitions annexes. That is why there has been a steep increase of more than the estimate, consequent upon Japan's entry into the war. Let us presume that the budget provided for the expenditure of £100,000,000 less than we now estimate. There would then be no gap, and every body would be pleased. However, if to-morrow, or the day after, it was found possible to put 100,000 morb men into the Army, and to equip them without imposing an intolerable strain upon the civil population and on our resources, we would do so. What would be the effect on the budget? The cost would be in the vicinity of £37,000,000. Expenditure on pay, rations, clothing and camp expenses would be £32,000,000, and maintenance of equipment, &c, another £5,000,000. Does the right honourable member for Kooyong say that, because we had made no provision for such expenditure in the budget, we should, therefore, refrain from putting those men into the Army? Of course he does not. Let me give another example. I have told the House and the country that if we could obtain increased naval power in this theatre of war it would be an invaluable contribution to our security. We have asked other countries to assist us-that is no secret. Let us presume that the Government of the United Kingdom, which has graciously given to us a ship to replace HMAS. Canberra, were to give us a whole squadron. A ship of the Canberra class costs £750,000 a year for pay, provisions, clothing, repairs, oil fuel, armament and other stores. The cost of a squadron would, of course, be very much greater. Would the right honourable member for Kooyong say that, because of his fears of inflation, and because it might bs necessary to make a greater use of central bank credit than the budget had provided for, -we should therefore refuse the offer of the squadron? Of course, he would not. Honourable members know that the war is fought with battleships, soldiers, guns and munitions, and they know that all this talk about a gap in ourfinancesis beside the point.

Some honourable members would have us believe that a country's capacity to ""wage war is limited by the amount of money which it can take from its 'taxpayers. Last year the righ t honourable member for Kooyong said that inflation threatened Australia, and that the value of the pound would depreciate. The Treasurer has said that the outpouring of money in excess of the total of goods and services must necessarily result in there being an excess of money in circulation, and that this can be avoided only by the exercise of proper control. If that control be not exercised, inflation w ill follow. Everything that the right honourable member has said about the ultimate consequences of not taking money from the .public is true, and the Treasurer and the Government admit it . vernment doing about it? that the amount of money which the Gothose upon which he, as Treasurer, forvernment proposes to raise by taxation mulated his war budget. and voluntary loans is as great as could be raised by taxation and compulsory differently.

Ant SERVICE TO TASMANIA-AC 2 FAL That the House do now adjourn. afternoon, I asked the Minister for Air( Mr Drakeford) to explain to me the guiding principles that the Department of Civil Aviation followed in deciding what civil aircraft were to be withdrawn from their normal service for other essential requirements. In reply, the Minister outlined what he considered to be tbe general rules that were observed in such cases. I am of opinion that the department should endeavour to maintain, if it is practicable, an air service to places that lack road or rail communications. At short notice, civil aircraft have been taken off a certain route. In war-time that cannot be avoided, and I do not complain about the inconvenience. ""Whilst one cannot, in these days, refer specifically to such matters, I desire to bring to the notice of the responsible Minister the plight of Tasmania. In the last two years, the shipping service has been reduced by 50 per cent., and the effect upon the transport of passengers, mails and goods has been tremendous. People who are obliged to travel between the mainland and Tasmania on urgent business rely almost exclusively on transport by air. As this service has now been reduced, the position has become desperate. Although it may be claimed that the air service between the mainland and Tasmania has not been abolished entirely, because the "" Island Service"" still operates, that is not adequate to cope with the passenger traffic, or to carry even a substantial proportion of the mails. I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to the very real disabilities thai Tasmania now The first was suffers as the result of the curtailment of As for the shipping services, and, if it be possible, to maintain the service by air or at least when services have to be withdrawn to ensure that areas without road or rail services receive proper consideration. -Last week, I asked a question of the Minister representing the Minister for the Interior (Senator Collings) in relation to the employment of bookmakers, bookmakers' clerks, jockeys and turf commission agents, and the degree to which they are being employed in the war effort. In doing so, I referred to a gentleman named Angles. In the meantime, Mr Angles has got in touch with me, and has satisfied me that he is not employed by the Allied ""Works Council. In point of fact, he has offered himself for military service and has been rejected. I make this explanation in fairness to the person concerned. I wish to deal with the treatment of Aircraftman Falstein by a Royal Australian Air Force court martial last week, who was found guilty of a certain offence, and was sentenced to 28 days' confinement at Holdsworthy military gaol. I am advised that Aircraftman Falstein has been deprived of his money, his watch, fountain pen, and all of his possessions except his clothing, and has been forbidden to have access to a newspaper, or to make any contact with the outside world, the exception being that certain people may visit him between 9.30 a.m. and 10.30 a.m. every Sunday morning. Aircraftman Falstein has been very harshly treated. I believe that if he had not been a Labour member of Parliament, he would not have been provoked in the first place by Squadron Leader A. R.

358,Mr Calwell (Melbourne) [11.16].,"that being so, the incident would not have occurred. Squadron Leader Gorrie said to him, "" It is like your hide to make an illegal request. Just because you are a member of Parliament you think you can do everything."" That remark in itself is sufficient to provoke an argument. A squadron leader should display more tact, or should be possessed of a better temperament than to express his spleen against a member of this Parliament who happens to be a Labour representative. It was the initial error-to put it mildly -o n the part of the Squadron Leader that started the trouble. Having said nasty things to Aircraftman Falstein, and the latter having replied in kind, which was unfortunate for him because he was the junior, the Squadron Leader began to show his authority. He had the big stick, and he used it ; and Aircraftman Falstein was placed under close arrest. His request was certainly against the regulations, but it was not against common practice. It is the common practice in these establishments for liquid refreshments to be served at passing out functions. member approve of that? approve of wet canteens under present conditions. Officers can have any quantity of drink in their messes at any time of the day or night, at the discretion of their commanding officer, and sergeants can have a beer at certain times of the day. However, a private can get only so many pints according to the number of coupons issued to him, or none at all. It would be better for all concerned if no differentiation existed in the dispensing of liquor in these establishments. It would make for the better training of the officers and men if they were obliged to take their liquid refreshment outside the camps. The fact is, however, that the officers have as much as they want. Aircraftman Falstein, very foolishly, requested that he be allowed to have this liquor taken to an aircraftmen's assembly, which was being held to celebrate the fact that they had just concluded a period of intensive training extending over eight weeks, and had passed their examinations. himself secured a brilliant pass. He acquitted himself as brilliantly as those who know him expected he would. These air force orders are like the "" safety first"" regulations displayed on trams and trains. Nothing happens when they are not observed until someone wants to revenge himself on somebody else. Had it not been for the fact that a Labour member of Parliament was involved, no court martial at all would have been held in this instance. I am informed on good authority that 99 per cent, of the personnel at that air training station believe that Aircraftman Falstein has been the victim of a political vendetta. I put it to the Minister for Air( Mr Drakeford) that he cannot ignore this feeling, nor the fact that there is a distinct feeling in the Labour movement that the man who arrested the honourable member for Watson, and the people who tried him, not only have no sympathy for the Labour movement, but are also antipathetic towards it. the honourable member possess for that statement? the honourable certitude; and that is quite sufficient for my case. The people who tried Aircraftman Falstein were Wing-Commander G. Mitchell, Squadron Leader Rothe, and Flight Lieutenant Levy. Aircraftman Falstein was defended by Mr Berwick, K.O., who was instructed by Landa Abram Barton and Company. The court, which was presided over by Wing-Commander Mitchell, who is a barrister, did not, as is usual in civil courts, summon counsel for the defence before it passed sentence. The legal representative of the accused knew nothing about the sentence until he read it in the newspapers. To me, it seems significant that counsel for the defence was not asked to be present when sentence was promulgated. Who are these people who passed judgment upon a member of this Parliament? Wing-Commander Mitchell is very wealthy, and has very strong United Australia party leanings. He is a prominent Aircraftman Falstein barrister in New South Wales. Squadron Leader Rothe.

364,Mr Calwell,"Of course it is.no member of that family had ever had a ticket in the Labour movement. The third gentleman. Flight Lieutenant Levy, is associated with very wealthy people in Sydney by the names of Cohen and Phillips. I have not the slightest doubt that the selection of a person named Levy was made for the purpose of camouflaging the whole proceedings and attempting to create the impression that there would be no prejudice against Aircraftman Falstein. these things wealth determines the issue, and the wealthy interests decided that Aircraftman Falstein should be taught a lesson, and that the Labour movement, through him, should be made to feel the power of these extra tall blue orchids. So a. sentence of 28 days was imposed, and has been promulgated, and, in my view, it was imposed for the express purpose of keeping Aircraftman Falstein from attending this Parliament during this session. A man on the same station who was charged with having stolen £10 from a wallet was also court martialled, and sentenced to seven days' imprisonment. Apparently stealing from a fellow aircraftman is not so serious as answering back after one has been maliciously provoked. half of his moustache? jected to a number of indignities on that station, and he ""took it "" , but, when he was insulted on this last occasion, he considered that he had the right to say that he would ventilate his grievance when he came to Canberra. Aircraftman Falstein is in no different a position from that occupied by the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Rankin), the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison), the honourable member for Barker( Mr he did, but I have had occasion to admire Archie Cameron), and other honourable members, who hold military rank and come to this Parliament, and in exercise of their indisputable rights challenge the Government and criticize its administration. In the case of Captain Sandys, a son-in-law of the British Prime Minister, a select committee of the House of Commons held that a member of Parliament was justified in disclosing to Parliainsubordination. ment official information, even secret information, which came into his possession in the discharge of his duties. The honourable gentlemen whom I have named come into this Parliament and criticize Ministers and other honourable members, sometimes honourable members on their own side of the House. Speaking from near where I am now standing the honourable member for Barker, in the uniform of the Australian Military Forces, moved a vote of want of confidence in the then Minister for the Army( Mr Spender), Now, in all and, if I remember rightly, used some information which may have come into his possession as a member of the Intelligence Corps. it clear at the time that he was not using information which had come into his possession in the course of his military duties. ber for Barker used information which he was perfectly entitled to use.

It was not without reason therefore that Mr Keir Hardie, tbe fir6t leader of the Labour party in the British House of Commons, referred to the officers of the British Army of his day as strutting popinjays, and that the Honourable King O'Malley, in this Parliament when it sat in Melbourne, referred to certain military people whom he suspected as "" gilt-spurred roosters"". That feeling still persists in the ranks of the Labour party, who naturally feel, particularly in the case of the Air Force, with its high educational standard for officers, that only those with public school qualifications have a chance of obtaining commissioned rank. That was so at any rate a little time ago, and the tradition still lives. It is true that as the Army has expanded the old school tie has not been so successful in getting people into positions, whole Army organization. It would be but anybody who understands the way armies and departments grow when war breaks out knows that immediately the conflict starts the old pitchfork, by which people hoist their friends into jobs, begins to work overtime. of that lately. concentrate attention on recent times. During the whole period of the war we have seen all sorts of people put into all kinds of jobs. The Victoria Barracks in Melbourne and Sydney contain quite a number of people, with no war experience, occupying important positions. These military establishments are full of ersatz colonels and brummagem majors, who, politically, as a class, hate the Labour movement and Labour men. I am sorry for the plight in which Aircraftman Falstein finds himself, and to which he partly himself contributed. He is the only one who has suffered, and he has suffered grievously. I protest against the imposition of any more punishment upon him, and ask the Minister at least to direct the Air Board that any honourable member who wants to consult the honourable member is to be given the opportunity to visit him, in that filthy hole to which the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Ward) directed his attention about eighteen months ago, without being interfered with by some temporary squadron leader or wing commander. [11.40] I feel that the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) has unconsciously done a great disservice to the Australian fighting forces in bringing forward this matter in the terms he has used. This is the first occasion during the war that any responsible member has tried, in this Parliament or through the press, to cause a division within the forces in regard to their political ideas. It would be very dangerous if from this the impression grew throughout the forces that they might be governed by one political thought or another. It would be injurious to our fighting forces overseas, and particularly dangerous within the even more dangerous if the remarks of the honourable member were published in the Japanese papers. Like the honourable member for Melbourne, I do not know whether Aircraftman Falstein is guilty or not. I might agree with him in saying that probably the accused is guilty to a certain degree, but I think that Aircraftman Falstein started this stupid business by making statements which ought never to have been made by any person who joins the forces of his own free will in order to serve his country side by side with others. He was the first in the whole of the Commonwealth forces to make such a statement to the press, when he said that some of the lads in the camp who cut off half his moustache had done it for politicalmotives. Whilst we may have laughed at the joke at the time, I thought it was a dangerous statement which only a member like the honourable member for Watson would stoop to make, after taking the oath to stand side by side with the rest of the. forces in a unity which the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) has asked the public to display. We must realize that we are all in it, and must drop our everyday ideals and come together in the one resolve and determination to win the war and to stand together without dividing",68,Stein Employmen T Of Bookmakers

The honourable member for sion I heard an honourable member use, there is no more reason why he, because he is a member, should be released than any other unfortunate fellow who had no friend in this Parliament. If he is guilty he should stay there. should exercise a wise judgment in this matter, and Aircraftman Falstein should not, because he is a member of this Parliament, be granted any more concession than the humblest private who has broken the conditions to which he subscribed on enlistment. vocative act for those young fellows to remove half of his moustache? blame him for on that occasion is attributing that incident to political differences between the young men and himself. I am sure that no member of any of the forces would ever motive. The honourable member for Melbourne has to-night set a very bad precedent, and I hope the censor will put his pen through the honourable member's remarks, so that the matter cannot go any further, especially at this time when our men are fighting side by side in New Guinea and the Middle East. We must out out the evil thought that has been propagated by Aircraftman Falstein and ventilated here to our detriment by the honourable member for Melbourne to-night. After listening to the jingoistic speech of Falstein for a supply of beer for a the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser), it will be refreshing to return to the issue raised by the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr vent a little levity on the occasion of the Calwell). The honourable member for Wide Bay said that we shall do a great disservice to the members of the fighting forces by raising a matter of this kind to-night. The only means members of the services have to air their grievances is to obtain the help of an honourable member of this Parliament. Cliqueism, red tape, and the old school tie are still tolerated in the Navy, the Army, and the Air Force. If any rank and file member of the forces dared to ventilate a grievance in the press or to write to a Miniswould appear from the evidence given at ter or member of Parliament about it, he would be quickly dealt with under Melbourne took the proper course to ventilate a grievance of this nature. It is ridiculous for the honourable member for Wide Bay to talk about the Japanese press being pleased about The Minister a debate of this character. What the Japanese press would be pleased about would be the toleration of this sort of thing by honourable members. It is wrong to seek to use the censorship to smother up complaints of this kind. This is a unique occasion. I believe that Aircraftman Falstein is the first member of this Parliament to be placed in durance vile for an alleged offence in a branch of the fighting services. It has been said in some sections of the press that he has acted as he has done for the purpose of publicity, or for the purpose of wielding political influence in order to obtain favours which no other member of the force could obtain. I be influenced by such a think more of his common sense than to believe such suggestions. I am sure that there is more than beer at the bottom of this happening. Aircraftman Falstein could have obtained much more advantageous publicity by calling attention to the food, clothing and accommodation of members of the services. Such action would, undoubtedly, have garnered him more helpful publicity than he is likely to obtain from a discussion of this nature. It has been suggested that the dispute with Squadron Leader Gorrie arose out of an application by Aircraftman send-off social to a member of the school. I am not a wowser, and I consider that if the regulations are so strict as to predeparture of a member of the school for advanced training elsewhere, they should be amended. A member of the Air Force is likely, very early in his career on active service, to face much more serious danger than the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Rankin) has faced in his long career in the defence force. No government should tolerate regulations which would prevent the issue of a reasonable supply of beer for a valedictory social in the circumstances I have outlined.

I do not think that this House could discuss a more serious matter than one involving criticism of the administration of the Royal Australian Air Force, and, for that matter, the Army, merely because an honourable member of this House is suffering as the result of indiscipline. If Aircraftman Falstein has been harshly treated, the circumstances in which he is placed are no different from those of hundreds of others who have had to take their medicine in the different forces. ""Whether the sentence be harsh or not, if he cannot take his medicine he ought not to be in the Royal Australian Air Force, and I rather think that he should be discharged and should return to his duty in this Parliament.

Whether or not Aircraftman Falstein was hardly done by, is another matter. We frequently read in the newspapers of verdicts by magistrates or judges with which there is disagreement, sometimes on account of their severity and at other times because of their leniency; yet they are the pronouncements of properly constituted tribunals and their judgments have to be respected. The Air Force, to the greatest degree of all the services, requires the most rigid discipline. At an sarlier stage-no t so much of late, I am glad to believe-whe n there was some degree of suspicion that the discipline in the Royal Australian Air Force was not so rigid as was necessary, aeroplanes and lives were lost because of the casual acceptance of their responsibility by a number of its members. Many persons came to the conclusion that young men were losing their lives and wrecking their aircraft because air force discipline needed tightening up.

I do not consider that there is any justification for the innuendos and statements that have been made by the two honourable members opposite who have spoken on the matter. Squadron-Leader Gorrie, by a piece of smart manipulation of his own name, has been described as "" Goering"" and "" Goebels "", and by other names that reflect on him, but he has no friends in this chamber whom he has approached in order to present his side of the case. On the other hand, Aircraftman Falstein has his colleagues here, and they have admitted that he told them what be was going to do. He said that he intended to expose this, that and the other matter, in the Royal Australian Air Force. How can we have discipline if an AC2, who has been in the Air Force only six or eight weeks, is permitted to tell a camp commandant how the Air Force is to be conducted. The honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear) said that this was not only a matter of supplying beer but one which went far deeper than that. Aircraf tman Falstein was going to tell the ship of the speeches of members of this world about his commanding officer and every body else who had authority over him, so that he could alter the system of training in this country which has produced pilots of which we are so proud to-day. If that was his object I am very glad that he has been thwarted in his purpose. I sincerely hope that the Minister for Air( Mr Drakeford) will disabuse his mind of all political influences. there is political prejudice in the tribunals set up in the Navy, the Army and the Air Force. It is true that the individuals who compose those tribunals may have held certain political beliefs in private life just as they probably have religious views, but it is most unfair to men who are doing a job for this country that statements concerning them are made under the cloak of parliamentary privilege, simply for the purpose of enabling If that is what a private person-for that is all Aircraftman Falstein is as a member of the Air Force-to drag the names of those connected with the administration of Bradfield Park in the dirt. I do not believe that the Minister for Air or the Minister for the Army will be influenced by petty complaints such as have been introduced to-night. If we do not take a more realistic attitude towards the war, and consider how we are to win it and how our troops should be trained, I am afraid that we may lose the war. It is the duty of Ministers to' look at this matter from a non-political point of view. I regard what has happened to Aircraftman Falstein as though he were the most humble individual in the country. If he be treated in that way, there will be no doubt about the result. -""When the honourable member for ""Wide Bay( Mr Corser) was addressing himself to this subject, he remarked that he hoped the censor would draw his blue pencil effectively through the report of the speech of the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell). I merely wish to remark that that observation discloses extraordinary ignorance on the one hand and depressing pusillanimity on the other, because the honourable member ought to be aware that there is no censorfree Parliament of Australia. Any member of this chamber may, as a representative of the people, say in this chamber whatever he wills to say, provided only his observations conform with the Standing Orders of the House as to the propriety of the language used and as to the order of debate. ""Whatever discipline may be exercised in the Royal Australian Air Force-and I do not deny that there I do not believe that are disciplinary rights-doe s not extend to this Parliament.

It is regrettable that tbe honourable member for Wide Bay should have suggested, in the course of a debate bhat is likely to be very widely read, that this Parliament of Australia, the last bastion of democracy, is in any particular subject to a censorship at the hands of the defence authorities or anybody else. I agree entirely with other honourable members who have spoken that the sentence passed on Aircraftman Falstein is very harsh. We are all aware of the nature of the offence committed. Aircraftman Falstein had approached his commanding officer in order to carry out a customary celebration. Honourable members of this chamber well know that a similar function has taken place at Canberra on the occasion of a send-off to members of the Royal Australian Air Force who have qualified for their wings or for promotion. Apparently certain restrictions have been imposed with regard to functions of this kind, and Aircraftman Falstein approached Squadron Leader Gorrie in order to get his permission to obtain certain liquid refreshment from the mess. Every body knows that Aircraftman Falstein is a non-drinker. He was not attempting to get beer for himself, but merely wished to make the celebration somewhat more convivial. was told by the officer that he would not be allowed to obtain liquor from tbe sergeant's mess. It was all very well for the officer to adopt that attitude. We know that, while the rank and file of the Air Force would be quite satisfied with beer, the officers would be sure to have plenty of more expensive beverages. As has been pointed out, the customary punishment, even for such serious offences as theft is seven days.' detention, so that the sentence imposed upon our colleague was extraordinarily severe. Yet his offence was merely that he stated that the officer was disliked, and I can assure honourable members that he is disliked. Men from his station have told me just how disliked he is. They say that he is a very arrogant person, and that he was a military policeman during the last war. That probably accounts for his arrogance, and for a good deal of the hostility felt towards him. We recognize that military policemen are necessary, but although some of them carry out their duties in an inoffensive manner, others are arrogant bullies. This officer is of that type. I ask the Ministerc whether he proposes to be just a rubber stamp for men of that kind, or whether he proposes to institute an inquiry with a view to seeing that Aircraftman Falstein obtains justice, something he has not had yet. He volunteered for the Air Force for service in an air crew, and he is prepared to take his part in the fighting. He is only 27 years of age, and the officer with whom he came in conflict is a man past middle age. It might have been expected that he would have pointed out to Aircraftman Falstein that he was committing .a breach of the regulations, and advised him to act with more discretion. Instead of doing that, however, he called another officer in and then invited him to repeat what he had said. If he had liked to be a squib, he could have denied saying what was attributed to him, but instead of that he had the courage to repeat it. He is a member of this Parliament, but as such he is not entitled to, nor do I advocate, privileges not enjoyed by other members of the Air Force. On that account the officer might at least have had sufficient respect for him to have tried to advise He him. Instead of doing that, however, he showed his prejudice against the political party to which he belongs. Perhaps the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) is correct in saying that in existing circumstances the Government is in a precarious position, and is in danger of being challenged. Because of the action of this officer, its majority has been effectively disposed of for a month. I ask the Minister to listen to the pleas of Aircraftman Falstein's colleagues and friends, and to set up a committee of inquiry, which will be able to state whether it was really a matter of the supply of beer, or whether there was something more behind it. But foi this unfortunate incident, it is probable that he would have risen as rapidly in the Air Force as he did in civil life. I ask that his future be not jeopardized. The electors of Watson expect that their representative will be treated justly.",73,Stein Employmen T Of Bookmakers
399,Mr James (Hunter) [12.13 A.m.],"Minister for A i r ) [12.25 a.m.] -Honor able members have raised a number of issues in connection with this matter on which I do not feel competent to offer an opinion. I occupy the position of Minister controlling the department in which Aircraftman Falstein is serving, and it is my duty K> see that the law enacted by 1 this Parliament is upheld. I cannot do anything else. This is a painful subject for me as it is for other honourable members. I am concerned that any member of this Parliament should be involved in something which gives rise to a great deal of criticism. The honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) covered a wide field in introducing this subject, and made a number of statements, or allegations, concerning which I know nothing. Some of his statements would appear to be based on hearsay, but whether or not he knows that they have foundation in fact I cannot say. I imagine that he has taken some steps to verify them, but I have no knowledge of the facts. Reference has been made to Squadron Leader Gorrie, who is alleged to have provoked the situation which has caused a sentence of 2>S days to be imposed on Aircraftman Falstein. I do not know anything about what Squadron Leader Gorrie had to do in the matter, except that he is the officer who was directly responsible for the observance of discipline, and that when a dispute took place he had the duty of hearing Aircraftman Falstein. Out of that hearing some argument appears to have arisen, with the result that certain charges were made. Other than certain allegations, no charges have been made against Squadron Leader Gorrie. There are no charges against him under the Air Force Act. If that officer has done something wrong he can be charged. Nothing has come to my notice to prove that he had taken advantage of his position. That puts me in a difficult position in dealing with the reprevice of the members of the court. sentation of honourable members who urge that action should be taken by me. I have no power to take action, because the A i r Force laws provide clearly the course that is open to any person who has been dealt with by a properly constituted tribunal. I think that it would be disadvantageous to the person concerned for me to offer any opinion on the merits of the case, or on the statement furnished to the House. an overriding authority? no such overriding authority in respect of the Navy, the Army or the Air Force. Honourable members ought to acquaint themselves with the powers of Ministers before they make such suggestions. Under section 57 of the Air Force Act Aircraftman Falstein has the right of appeal to the Air Board, and subsequently to the Governor General, if he so desires. means the Governor General in Council, which in fact means the Minister. cases which have occurred since I have been Minister that right of appeal was exercised, and it resulted in a reduction of the sentence in each case. Aircraftman Falstein may appeal immediately, and should he do so his appeal will be heard expeditiously. One thing that the Minister can do is to expedite the proceedings which may arise out of the charges. The Minister, however, has no right to interfere with the decision of a tribunal. I am prepared to take whatever criticisnj is offered for declining to interfere. I do not propose to interfere with the decision. I regard it as my duty to see that the Air Force laws are upheld and are properly observed. Should there be evidence that they have not been properly observed, I should regard it as my duty to see that action is taken to see that they are observed. As Aircraftman Falstein has the right of appeal, first to the Air Board, and, if he so desires, subsequently to the Governor General, I do not think that I should take any action at this stage. As honourable members have suggested that he was tried by persons with certain sympathies, I place before the House the particulars of the positions and serThe President, Wing-Commander G. Mitchell, was a pilot in the war of 1.914-18, and is a qualified barrister. The second member was Squadron Leader F. L .
