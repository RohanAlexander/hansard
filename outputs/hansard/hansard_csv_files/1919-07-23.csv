I think it is often a good thing for a public man to hear both sides of a ques t i o n ; but what struck me most there was a very eloquent attack on Mr Justice Higgins. One speaker asked, "" What chance have the seamen got from a fifty quid a week Judge?

102,Mr Brennan (Batman) [4.15],".'that side of the House has.come most, if not' all,of the criticism of arbitration as :itr. is carried on in this country. I am -.not forgetful of the fact that a movement was made from that side of the -House to remove the present honoured President of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, and that petitions from "" r i g h t t h in k i ng persons"" outside were directed to them, pointing out that thi6 policy of arbitration .was crippling the industries of the country. W it h the principle of arbitration I am in' complete concurrence. that arbitration has done a great deal of good for the workers of this country, as well as, possibly, directly or indirectly, for the employers of the country also. the union had a punch behind it . tration has imposed upon the employer the obligation that if he is desirous of entering upon a .particular kind of indus. t r y or undertaking, and of employing men to do a certain class of work, he is, under the law, compelled to comply with certain conditions and pay a certain wage to the men carrying on such operations for him. It imposes upon employees the obligation that if they desire to engage in a certain class of work they cannot look to the law for any support or assistance beyond, the conditions and wage3 'which have been prescribed by the Arbitration Court as, in all the circumstances, adequate. In this way the Arbitration Court has done much to regulate industry, and has., I think , done much to settle industrial disr putes, real and technical. Rut one thing that arbitration has net done is to compel any employer-as the sidine) has suggested in an interjectionfc': carry on any class of work or to employ any man. It has not imposed any restriction upon his perfect liberty in that regard And the Arbitration Court, conversely, does not impose upon any individual in this community, professing to enjoy British liberty, the obligation to go to-, work for any employer at anv time. Therefore, when' the honourable member (the' injurywhich Mr Justice Higsrins has -done' by. the declaration of nothing more than a' truism, which he made in the Court recently, it appears to me that he is misconceiving the fundamental principle of arbitration. I have only a limited time at my disposal, and I wish to come to the real .issue with which we are faced in connection with this most regrettable industrial trouble. Its effects have not been exaggerated. The suffering has been rather understated than overstated. It is far too great'and intense to be treated lightly by any member of this House. I recognise The position as I understand it is that the Government claim to be the controllers of the shipping. They claim that they are the employers of the men who may man the ships. Yet they sit to-day inactive in the face of the fact that in this, the greatest of all industries, they are not able to obtain men to carry on T h is policy of arbithis work for the country. so. tried or not, the fact remains that they have not done so, and the work is not going on. The Government seek to evade their re3ponsbilities. It is for them, as the employers of labour to be used on the ships, to say whether the claims of the men are or are not fair and reasonable. It is for the Government, responsible to this House, and this House, responsible to the country, to have information in their possession as to what the claims of the seamen are, and what the conditions are which prevent the wheels of industry going round, and which cause all the suffering that is being iinflicted on this country. forgets that the Government send all their servants to the Arbitration Court cannot compel any man to go to the Arbitration Court. Let them put the notion of arbitration out of their heads. Let them not be taking refuge behind the Arbitration Court any-longer. The seamen will not so to the Arbitration Court, and they cannot be compelled to go to it . There is no law to compel them to go to the Court. Very well, what next?

110,Mr Brennan,"The Governmentwhy the Government cannot get the men to man the ships. The reason is that the seamen say, "" This is the lowest wage for which we will work. These alone are the conditions, the bedrock, conditions, upon which we w ill work for you."" Very well, it is for the Government to see if they can offer conditions' to men in this country such as will induce them to work for them. that the seamen have such a prejudice against them that they will not work for a fair thing, or under fair conditions? No; the truth is that the Government keep on referring to the matter of arbitration instead of getting at the crux of the question, and that is the conditions of labour and the wages which they are prepared to offer for the work. They have prosecuted a man because they say he broke the law, have fined him £300 or £ 4 0 0 , and have given him three months' gaol. That ought to satisfy them so far as that matter is concerned. If the Government cannot get men to work for them, if they offer terms so unattractive that not a single seaman will go down to the ships to work, let them have the courage of their opinions. Let them take their courage in both hands, as suggested by honourable members opposite, and bring men down to the waterside, and let them go into the forecastle, and attend to the donkey engines and work the ships, instead of the members of the Seamen's Union. Possibly, when some of those men had been at work for twenty minutes, they would have-a better appreciation of the situation of the seamen of the country, and they might, indeed, come out as propagandists on behalf of the union, and the cause for which it stands.

I do not desire at this present time to repeat the whole history of the strike, step by step, and the efforts made by the Government to settle it.

When the Seamen's Union in England, under Havelock Wilson, refused to allow vessels to carry men, some of whom were ex-Ministers, who had obtained passports from the British Government, every honourable member opposite, and every newspaper that hacks them, said that the seamen were right, although those seamen took the law into their own hands; but when the seamen denounced.

Some newspapers denounce the workers at every season of the year; indeed,, they say that the workers have practically no right to live. If ' one mentions the names of some newspapers in Melbourne one needs an antiseptic mouthwash to clean his mouth out after mentioning their names. There is the Argus; which denounces the workers all the time. What did that newspaper do when the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) spoke at a meeting It soon after the trouble started ? It picked out such names as Brennan, Walsh, Reilly, and others. Such names may be all right for men who write for the Argus, but they are all wrong if they support the workers. If the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Kelly) had Veen at thatmeeting his name would probably have been picked out, though he is no more responsible for his name than I am for mine.

I ask honourable members whether they observe any of those qualities in member for Franklin? Some of his statements are on all-fours, and in true keeping, with the speeches made ftrom time to time by Mr Walsh, as if the two men had one object in view. We know they have not, for whilst the honourable member for Franklin( Mr Mcwilliams) may wish to displace one Minister, Walsh wishes to uproot all authority, law, and order-constitutiona l or otherwise. Walsh? L et us get on with, the debate. because he is so infinitely more, important than the honourable member. There is behind this dispute something more than a grievance about conditionswhich I am quite ready to believe are bad-ther e is something more than a question of the application of the Navigation Act, which has been promised, or fair consideration by a tribunal presided over by a gentleman so highly eulogized as Mr Justice Higgins has been by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor). Whether the ostensible cause be wages or conditions, I think honourable members realize that the underlying motive for the strike is something deeper and more sinister.

I say nothing against the members of the Seamen's Union; but, assuming that there are behind the management of the union qualities that are not shared, perhaps, by the honourable member for Batmination to carry through their revolutionary project at all risksI ask myself how better we can help these men to sub-' vert all authority than by decrying, first the Court, then the Government, and afterwards this Parliament? Those are the means and methods of revolution all the world over. It is our duty to stand behind the constitutional authority which this House has established, and to treat with patience, prudence, and loyalty the Government who are responsible to us. Let us assume that the honourable member for Franklin had been in charge of the Government, and at the mo-' ment that the trouble occurred, he with that great strength which he would have us believe he possesses, had stepped into tbe limelight, and said, "" We shall-man these ships""I tliink he said he would alter, them before he manned them-bu t if he had manned them at once for the benefit of the apple growers of Tasmania, is it not a manifest fact that immediately after he took that course, Mr Willis, who was recently expelled from the Labour movement in New South Wales, because he was too violent a revolutionist, would have been asking and cajoling his own union of coal miners to throw down their tools in sympathy with the oppressed seamen, and Australia from one end to the other would have been threatened with starvation for want of coal? The Government were not guilty of that folly, and what has happened as a result of their refusal to act so foolishly?

From my point of view, the present trouble ha6 been very clearly stated by the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan). The points of view of the honourable member and myself do not often coincide, but I agree with him that we cannot compel the seamen to go to the Arbitration Courti f they do not wish to do so, any more than we can compel an employer, against his wish, to carry on his business. The shipowners are not a party to this dispute, no matter what is said to the contrary by honourable members opposite. whole of the fleet on the Australian coast is under the control of the Government, and ie managed by the Shipping Comptroller. The Government pay the shipowners for the time charter of their vessels, therefore they have become a party to the dispute. As I was saying, there is no power to compel the seamen to go to the Arbitration Court; but as the Government are a party to the dispute, just as the ship-owners would have been if they had been controlling their vessels, the responsibility rests upon them to man the ships. years, and I know the uncomfortable conditions under which seamen work. realize that a vast improvement should be made in those conditions; but I know that, since the Navigation Act was passed, a considerable improvement has been made in the accommodation for the crews on all vessels recently built on the Australian coast. The seamen know as well as any one else how impossible it is to improve the accommodation on some of the vessels built years ago, and they are quite prepared to work on with the knowledge tliat the forecastle w ill be habitable on all vessels built in tlie future. To-day there are quite a number of vessels running on our coast which have had improvements effected as a result of an agreement arrived at hy a conference to which the seamen were a party, and the ship-owners have agreed to build all future vessels in .accordance with those conditions; but what is to happen to the vessels now running on the coast which cannot beUnion, as represented by their spokesman I do not to-day,is conceded-that the whole of the conditions provided on modern ships must be given on all the vessels employed in our coastal trade? They must either be scrapped or sold abroad; and then the -position of the community at large would be worse than ever. I admit, with the Government, that the question is very delicate, ticklish, and complicated; but, as they, a party to the dispute, have offered to their employees, the seamen, through their Comptroller of Shipping (Admiral Clarkson), an arrangement by which they are prepared, to accept the decision of the The Arbitration Court, whatever it may be, and as the seamen have refused the invitation to go to the Court which was established for the settlement of disputes, I consider it is their duty to man the ships. Ministers know the consequences entailed on suffering humanity in Melbourne. It is not the rich nor the well-to-do who are suffering. I guarantee that every honourable member has fuel in his home, and can havo his meals cooked and his rooms warmed. ""We are not the sufferers. It is those who are out of work, those who were forced out of work by the lack of I have lived in a forecastle for coal, who are the sufferers. wickedness of it all. many innocent people suffering through this strike. The Government are a party to the dispute; they are not an independent body sitting apart and watching the ship-owners and seamen fight. They have taken the place of tlie ship-owners, and I find faul t with them for allowing the community to suffer by not taking steps to man their ships. That the great bulk of the seamen in Australia cannot approve of the course of conduct advocated by the man who has just gone into gaol is proved by the public action of South Australian representatives of the seamen, and, knowing the necessity there is to get coal into Melbourne, it is the bounden duty of the Government to ask for volunteers and man the ships, rather than see so many people brought to the verge of starvation.

The Government are not moving in this matter because they hope, in the interests of the sections whom they represent, to smash industrial organization in Australia. Then some of them get up and prate as if they were suffering fro m a nightmare about revolution being behind all this business. well know it member who prates so loudly about arbitration was a few years ago waving the flag and shouting, "" Ulster w ill fight; and Ulster w ill be r i g h t ! "" No arbitration for Ulster then! The honourable member now talks about arbitration. When the war was on, he cried, "" No peace by negotiation ; peace w i th victory! "" Well, the seamen have nailed their colours to the mast, and their cry is, "" No peace by negotiation ; peace with victory! "" I am in sympathy with the attitude of the Government on this important and delicate question. some of us who have not the immediate responsibility to advocate strong and horoic measures; but the Government realize that the extension of the strike would be an unspeakable crime, and every effort must be made to avoid such a contingency. The position was such that if they had. acted with precipitation, and without a f u l l knowledge of the conditions as they now exist, that extension would have been inevitable. I am prepared to think that the Government had better information on this subject than any honourable member in the House, and that, having regard to that information, they are acting in the best interests of the country in the circumstances. I realize that there must be a limit to their forebearance, and To talk that the time is approaching when that limi t will be reached. But when they The give the House the assurance that they have reason to think, on account of certain conferences sitting here, and certain other information which comes to their knowledge, that there is a ""possibility of a peaceful settlement, they are entitled to every consideration in their present attitude. was said a fortnight ago. any of us to ask, "" Why not man the ships ?""

It is part and parcel of the platform of my honourable friends opposite-and there are present in their ranks men of sane, moderate ideas, who would gladly see the strikers resort to arbitration for the purpose of settling this dispute.

The law provides for the settlement of disputes in this way, as in the case of civil disputes between citizen and citizen.

It is only a fair and reasonable request, which the Government have a right to. insist ou,, without attempting to deal themselves with the merits of the dispute.

A t the time of its passing, English opinion in some cases was that it .was a hundred years ahead of its time. Since then we have had the Titanic disaster, and we have passed through a great war, with the result that the Australian Navigation Act, which was thought to be a hundred years before its time, is now to be the text of navigation legislation in all other countries. M . Chanter) -Order! member's time has expired. Knowing that several honourable members still wish to speak to this question, and that the time set apart for its discussion has almost expired, I shall occupy the attention of the House for only a few minutes. It is amusing to listen to the objections which have been raised by the Labour party to the Conciliation and Arbi tration Act, the Navigation Act , and other measures. Quite a number of those who have been raising such objections and indulging in special pleading for the seamen have probably never been on board a ship, and some of them, at all events, took care not to travel by sea while tlie war was in progress. ' I am pleased that this motion has been submitted, since it affords us an opportunity to discuss a question that should have been dealt with in this House at least a month ago. There has been too much procrastination, and the Government should know, without further delay, whether or not the Parliament w ill stand behind them if they enforce the law and protect our industries. No matter what one section of the community may' think, there can be no Navigation question as to whether law and order should prevail. In connection with the seamen's strike it cannot be said that any question of Capital grinding Labour is And , although nine involved. It cannot be urged that a number of shipping companies have combined to ride rough-shod over their employees, since the whole of our shipping is absolutely controlled by the Government. In these circumstances, I think it is time. I believe it is. The that the Government showed their hand, since we are all alive to the misery and suffering that the strike has brought upon the community. Both the Federal and State Parliaments have passed arbitration laws, and the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court is open.to the seamen. The honourable member for M a r i byrnong ( Mr Fenton),who spoke of the Navigation Act as a magnificent measure, is amongst those who, from time to time, have lauded the principle of arbitration, and have pointed to its advantages. Surelyi t is his duty, and that of every The honourable member of the Labour party, to appeal to the seamen to abide by the laws of the country.

It lieve it would be an easy matter so to amend the Act as to do away with the delays of the Court and the huge expenditure involved in bringing a claim before it. This, however, is not the time to discuss that question. The sole consideration for us to-day is whether or not law and order are to prevail. Are we.to'allow the present misery to continue? women and children to be allowed to starve? Are the producers to be ruined?

Producers in the back parts of Australia are suffering severely, and many will probably be ruined, because of the strike. Wo person in the community is gaining by the action taken by the seamen. The workers themselves are the greatest losers, and I appeal to all sections of this House to do everything possible to induce the seamen to conform to the law. We should urge them to go to the Arbitration Court, and, at the same time, impress upon the Government the necessity of at once introducing amendments designed to get rid of many of the difficulties at present associated with our arbitration law.

I supported the War Precautions Act, and the only fault I have, to find with its administration by the Government is that it did not go far enough in some respects-the same objection I . have to the present measure. TheB ill is quite satisfactory so far as it goes, b u t -1 contend that the circumstances and conditions in Australia to-day emphatically demand that, if 'constitutional, it should be expanded still further. "" Only to-day we had a most emph'atic illustration of the necessity for further Government supervision and control in the matter of prices. The statement of Mr Knibbs, published this morning, proves that, instead of prices falling since the end of the war, there has been a decided upward tendency, which I make bold to say is, in the great m a j o r it y of cases, without any justification whatever. It is noifching more than barefaced exploitation of the community; and I urge on the Government that there is no duty more imperative on them at the present time than, to give careful consideration to the profiteering -which is going on, and -to meet it in the most drastic wav possible It is suggested that this matter of controlling prices, and the prevention of the exploitation of the public, is one which ought to be left to the States. I held a view somewhat of that nature for a considerable time, but again I find . myself forced by circumstances to alter it.' be m-ogressive enough to see the direction in which my dutyhes, and I hope that the House as a whole will also indicate that it is possessed of that highly necessary characteristic of all Legislatures. In my own State of Western Australia we are, undoubtedly, suffering from the im position of very heavy prices. tunately, State action in Western Australia would not be effective in controlling prices, because, in a great majority of 'cases, prices are determined before the goods reach the State, and the Government of the State would be forced into the position of altogether refusing those goods admission, or of endeavouring to bring prices down at a cost to the im' porters which would be quite unfair. It appears, (therefore, that in regard to commodities which pass from -one -State to another, nothing short of GOm-monwealth action will be effective.; and I shall do all in my power, so long as the present profiteering continues-ten d it is not likely to be abandoned until very di-astic action is taken-to encourage the Government to take whatever steps may be necessary to deal with the position. The constitutional aspect of the question is one which I confess is somewhat difficult for a layman to deal with. It is suggested-indeed , we are assured by the Government that in regard to price fixing we can go no further than the B ill indicates, but that, because we have been handling these matters in the form of contract, it is permissible to still f u r ther -legislate in fche desired direction. I confess, as a layman, that I am quite unable to see why the contractual element gives the Government the power; and I should be glad to have some indication from legal gentlemen in the Chamber of wliere the justification arises. It appears to me that if the Government have the power to control the specific commodities mentioned in the B ill , whether under contract or not, they also have the power to deal with goods of a similar character. sense, anyhow! opinion, which may go for what it is worth; but I have looked up Quick amd Garran, and, againspeaking as a layman, I say that their interpretation of the Well-known section 51 of the Constitution, dealing with Trade and Commerce, justifies me in my contention. In Quick and Garrani t is pointed outTrade means .the act or business of exchanging commodities' .by barter, or by buying or Unforselling for money; commerce;, traffic; barter. It comprehends every species of exchange or dealing, either in the produce of land, in manufacture, in bills, or in money, but it is chiefly used .to denote the barter or purchase and sale of goods, wares, and merchandise, either b'y wholesale or retail. Commerce means the exchange or buying and selling of commodities; especially the exchange' of merchandise on a large scale between different places or communities ; extended -trade or traffic.

302,Mr Fowler,"It is a layman'sperfeot safety to expand the Bill in the directi' n I am indicating. ' Curiously enough, I have before me a record uf the fact that some years ago in this Parliament the control of prices was not regarded as unconstitutional. . In 1906 this' House was invited to deal with an Australian Industries Preservation B ill , for the repression of .destructive monopolies. before us I submitted certain sub-clauses, to insure that the consumer got a fair deal in respect of th© goods to be protected. The principal amendment was as follows: If the unfairness in tlie competition is indicated in respect of prices, the ConiptrollerBoner,al shall specify what, in his opinion, are fair selling prices for the goods sought to be protected under this Act, or which may be imported, subject to any specified conditions or restrictions under thisoAct. Sitting suspended from 6.S0 to 7.45 p.m. not proceeded .with, and whatever may have been the reasons in the minds of Ministers for putting the measure aside, there certainly was no suggestion that we were unable 'to fix prices because of limitation bf our powers by the Constitution. Edwards supported the honourable member's proposal, and submitted a similar amendment. those and other reasons, which. I need not specify, I have come .to the conclusion that we have the constitutional power to deal with prices under this or any other B ill ; at any rate, unti l the H i g h Court bas ruled that we have no such power it is the duty of the Government to .deal with the prices problem, because there is no doubt that nothing short of very drastic legislation w ill meet all the circumstances of the case. Mr SA MPSON -We tested our powers monwealth can it be carried out in a way in connection with taxation. tested in other ways, but still I think we been to arrive at some method by which can fairly claim that under section 51, profiteering can be checked. with an ordinary common-sense interprevernment have ' adopted certain methods tation of "" trade and commerce,"" we upon which even the most sanguine uphave' some such power as I am contending holders of Government policy-cannot con-: for. upon the question of commerce within the States. jJretation is against all legal precedent. being, to a large extent, a crystallization of common sense, and, although it has its inconsistencies, I think, we are all proud When that Bill was to be livin g under the laws brought into existence by this .Parliament. I suggest that the proposed extension now before us, in the direction I am indicating, will add considerably in the well-being of the oeople, and enhance, the credit of this Parliament amongst the people, if we can only carry our intention into effect."" The Inter-State Commission has left no doubt of the existence of profiteering in the community-at the present time. It 'has issued a series of exceedingly comprehensive and valuable reports, which amply justify the creation of that body, and which it is the duty of this Parliament to follow up with the necessary legislation. not an Intra-State, Commission ber is seeking to make a distinction which I think the late Mr G. B . I cannot admit at the present time. If there is Inter-State trade in the commodities reported on by the Commission we have the power under the Constitution to deal with them. I shall be very glad to hear some of the legal members of the House enlarge upon that point. Is is our duty to at least test whether or not we have power under the present Constitution f o deal with prices. We can no longer afford to sit with hands folded and refer matters of price fixing aiid the checking of profiteering to the various States.

It is necessary to trace the profiteering through which one could poke his evils to their source, and I am bound to finger. say that there is very little, if any, evidence to connect the primary producers been on account of inferior weaving. with profiteering.

The cost of tlie raw material, hides and leather, may have in creased to some extent; but the rise in the prices of boots and shoes is out of all proportion. Another matter in connection with these articles, to which strong exception ought to 'be taken, is that, although the prices have gone up so much, the quality has 'gone down, in some cases, beyond all tolerance. speaking to a medical friend of mine on that .point. He agreed'with, me that large quantities of foot-gear, especially flbo'ots. and. shoes for children, soaked uip water like sponges, and made it almost impossible for any one abroad, in wet weather, for an hour or two to remain dry-footed; and. he expressed the opinion that, a great arapunt. of the sickness and a good -many of the deaths, in Australia during the winter were due to nothing more nor less than the defective foot-gear that many of our people, especially the .poorer section, were compelled tp wear. fWTienI was in Western Australia, recently, a boot manufacturer to l d me that one of his greatest troubles, was to procure decent leather to -put into his shoes. He said that it was not the faul t of the hides, but that it was the faul t of the .process of tanning, and. that the barium, a very objectionable chemical,, whicli was introduced into the leather for the .purpose of weighting, it , had a very injurious effect.

Nevertheless, I propose to .do so again. If tlie producer is to be considered in the fixing of prices, the consumer should certainly have a voice. the Government continues to appoint in dividuals to the various Committees in the same way as has been the practice, then the. consumer w ill not be either con-' sidered or represented at all. The basic idea in fixing prices is that the primary producer shall get a f a i r return for his product. He has as much right to get. f u l l value for his product as has the labourer to receive f u l l value for his hire. There seems to be a misunderstanding w i th respect to our producers. I do uot call an individual who makes profits out of wool a primary producer. [ call h i m a ""vampirate."" He is of the type that sucks the blood of the people. But if we"" consent to-place that class of individual in the list of primary producers, even the honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) will Yes ; and now there admit that the man who has to purchase wool has as much right to be given representation as the man who produced it . If that is not the case, then, the Wool Pool, .so f a r as the people are concerned, is useless. It is only right that both producer and consumer should be represented in the Pool. I know that it goes hard for the "" boss "" to say that the man who works for h i m , and the customer Possibly the Government right to any voice'in the running of his business. Yet both worker and consumer can rightly maintain that they have as much interest in. the production of a commodity as has the producer himself. It is unarguable that the consumer should be represented on the Committees. I would like to see an amendment moved, when this measure is in Committee, with the idea of giving direct representation to the consumer. If such a question came to a division, we would discover the real friends of the consumer in this House. Why are the representatives of the primary producer complacently agreeable to the fixation of prices for the commodities mentioned in the Bill? 'We have not heard a word of objection from country representatives. Why has there been no voice raised by those who are here m behalf-of. the producer? It is because the producer has done so well under the fixation of prices during the war that he Of course; but if desires to continue the system.

The Commonwealth has power to prohibit the importation of any commodity detrimental to the health or morals of the people, but should such a commodity be made, say, in Victoria, this Parliament has no power to prevent it going into New South Wales. It is impossible for any State Parliament to deal effectively witli profiteering and the high cost of living.

The whole situation to-day is governed by the high cost of living. Isi t any wonder that we have turmoil and strife in Australia?

We have been having trouble lately because of the high cost of living, but the same thing, is taking place all over the world. The object of this B ill is to fix the prices of a few commodities in w h i c h ' I admit the wage-earning section of the community is interested. But if it is a good thing in the interests of the community that the prices of these commodities should be fixed, it is equally a good thing for the A number-of people community that the prices of a l l commodities should! be fixed in the same way, and the Government should endeavour t'o secure for this Parliament the powers necessary for that purpose. The need for the fixation of prices is greater now than it used to be in days gone by. A t one time there were only a few profiteers. For instance, the squatter was a profiteer. He always has been, and always w ill be. The great manufacturers and large importers were profiteers. The success of their profiteering was so apparent that to-day every one is trying to emulate them, and we are confronted' with quite an inordinate amount of profiteering. People who never handle, and only give advice concerning commodities expect now to be permitted to profiteer. The Government control sugar in this country. I have a letter here from the Federation of Retail Grocers Associations of Australia.' I shall not read the whole I ' ask honourable of it , but I make this quotation from, it Oil the 5th June] Senator. Russell, speaking on behalf of. the.

The grocers want to be able to sell these commoditiesat higher prices. They say that the men who produce butter and sugar have the prices of those commodities I am endeavouring fixed at a rate which pays them to produce them. In that the grocers are quite correct, because the producers of those commodities desire that the Government should continue to fix the prices. It is clear, that the producer of sugar and the producer of butter are satisfied, because not one of their representatives has raised a voice in this House against the fixing of their prices. The grocer says that if we fix the price of sugar and of butter at a certain rate which is a payable rate for the producers of those commodities, we should fix their retail prices at a. rate",67,Commercial Activities Bill

The trouble is that the retail grocer has no representative in this House. His vote is not so strong as that of the primary producers, or there would be some one taking his part in this chamber.

The material which was priced at 12s. 6d. per yard could not be purchased in any warehouse at under £ 1 per yard. A profit of 7s. 6d. on 12s. 6d. is altogether too much; but that cannot be prevented. The retailer cannot go to the manufacturer to buy. because if the manufacturer sells to him the wholesale houses beat the manufacturer. The man who had the tweeds I refer to admitted that the prices 'charged by the manufacturer were 40 per cent, in' advance of the pre-war prices.

If it I s legal to follow wool and arrange for its pooling, and to fix its ' price, why not do the same with the products of wool ?

As to profiteering generally, I say, as 1 have said before, that T have ho sympathy with it , and I am no apologist for the profiteer. We must look at this question fairly, and if honourable members say there are profiteers, let them be nameddo not let us continue to have all these innuendoes. My only desife is to have honest statements put before the country without camouflage or misrepresentation for political purposes. In any case, profiteers, during the last year or two, have been paying 50 per cent., and 75 per cent., of their profits into the Treasury. the money from the public. they have, if they have made the profits; but let us know where this profiteering is. fiteers i u Flinders-lane. orable member can tell us a good many things, but to know something about the business. I am no apologist for Flinders-lane. barracker for Flinders lane! I believe in being honest whichever side I am on ; and I am going to lay a charge against the Government soon in regard to this very question, and I hope what I say will be taken to heart. In the first place, let us pin down that one wild statement about warehouses being packed from floor to ceiling. Where are those warehouses ? Sydney is the only place where they are. As a matter of fact, such warehouses are not in Sydney. If honourable members talk about profiteering being the cause of the high cost of living, I point out again that in regard to the essential necessaries there is no profiteering. That being so, any profiteering must be in connection with clothing. South Australia ? What about Mr : Reid's evidence as to leatlier being held up? was held up when the honourable member consulted Mr Reid, it is not held up to-day, ' because America and other countries, too,.have come into Australia and are collaring every side of leather they can lay their hands ou. Reid; he gave that evidence before the Inter-State Commission. is being held up, how long has it been held up? While the honourable member was at the war it was held up, not by the tanners, but on their account; and was oh the wharfs of Australia for many months, or a year or two, together. All t'he capital involved was lying idle, because it was not possible to ship the leather to the Old Country. In the matter of clothing there has, no doubt, been profiteering, and the profiteers have very properly been made to pay 50 per cent, and 75 ner cent, into the Treasury. But to say there are warehouses filled from floor to ceiling is absolutely untrue, as every man familiar with trade knows. On the contrary, there are orders that have been placed in the Old Country for twelve months for clothing and soft goods of various kinds that are not yet executed. for Flinders (Captain Bruce) told us that he had £750,000 of stock when the armistice was signed. not an enormous amount at all. firm. the extent of the business of Messrs.

There has been a good deal of talk during the course of this debate about profiteering. much struck by a speech delivered .by the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Victoria at the present time than there Yates), who quoted.statistics to show that, with 'a. smaller-number of sheep, the wool growers had earned more money for the wool groWm on the sheep'. The honourable; member, may be correct, but', at the same time, there may have been no profits on the sale of tliat wool> forduring the drought of 1914 many pastoralists lost three-quarters of their sheep, and others lost the whole of their flocks. I think it will be granted that in the year following the loss of three-quarters of his breeding ewes it would cost a pastoralist four times what it would cost in an ordinary year to produce the number of. lambs he would breed; from the balance of the ewes. H is station expenses would be just the same as in thenormal, years. H is interest on thecapital involved would go on just the Acting Attorney-General( Mr same. lose a quarter of their sheep.

460,Mr Leckie,"I hope that the honormember for Melbourne Porta( Mr Mathews), who, a few minutes ago, after declaiming against profiteering, UTged the Government to increase the price of sugar and butter on behalf of the small grocers. Since this Parliament has met ""there has been a good deal of facing both ways. A schedule to this B ill provides that the protected than is the sugar industry. retail price of sugar shall not be more than 3£d. per lb. That is price fixing pure and simple, and honourable members opposite, seeing that schedule, may be forgiven forsaying that if the Government have the power to fix the retail price of sugar, surely they have the power to fix the price of other commodities. It seems to me that even if the legal opinion the Minister has received is in favour of the Commonwealth having the powers set forth in this B ill , the particular power sought in this respect is open to very grave doubt. The position in regard to sugar is likely to be very serious. A t the beginning of the war raw sugar was sold at £14 per ton, but since the last agreement was entered into the growers have been getting £21 per ton for raw sugar. That is an advance of 50 per cent., and I think that the people of Australia have considerable reason for doubting that the cost of producing sugar has increased by as much as £ 7 per ton. The consumption of this commodity being about; 285,000 tons per annum, the consumers are called upon to pay nearly £2,000,000 by way of a bonus to the growers in Queensland and New South Wales. But those growers are not the only people concerned in the sugar industry, aud it is just as well for Minisman's industry, and I hope it will not be ters to look further abroad. Of course, it -is very easy out of public funds to increase the price to be paid to any particular section of producers, but it is very hard to see the actual results achieved. So far, the actual result of the fixation of the price of sugar at a very high figure has not been as adverse as it might have been because of the heavy cost of freights aud the shortage of shipping during the war, but if it is proposed to continue the present high .price of sugar during the years to come, when commerce becomes normal again and freights are lower, the result will be disastrous to the f r u it growers and the jam-making industry in the southern States. Of late years the Mr Leckie. . fruit-growing industry has assumed large proportions in Victoria, New South Wales, South Australia, Tasmania, and Western Australia, and great strides have been made by jam-makers aud the preserved f r u it industry. being encouraged to settle on irrigated land along the River Murray, and they are producing peaches, apricots', and other soft fruits for preserving. If the manufacturers are not to get sugar at a reasonable price compared with that which prevails in the outside world, then those industries that are growing up in Australia, and some of which the war has enabled to establish themselves, will be endangered. I shall not offer any objections to the B ill as it stands, although I have grave doubts whether the part dealing with sugar is legal. I hope the Government have the power they say they have, but we must be thankfu l that it is not this House, but an outside body, which has the' duty of deciding the point. I trust that-the Government have the power, because it will be disastrous to Australia if they find, after all,, that they do not possess it . In the meantime, until the term of this B ill runs out, I urge the Government to consider seriously the position of the sugar industry, coupled with the position of the jam and fruit-preserving industry. This great industry, which is growing up in the southern States is, after all, a white obliterated for the sake of bolstering up, by artificial prices, the sugar-growers of the northern States. . appears to me that those concerned in the particular commodities enumerated in the Bil l are simply looking after their' own interests. It is the War-time ProfitsB ill over again, so f a r as I am concerned. If fche powers which the Government claim under this B ill depend upon the War Precautions Act, or upon the existence of a state of war, it appears to me that they must cease once peace is declared.

463,Mr Considine ( B A R R I E R ) [9.52],"-I tthe passing of the War Precautions' Act, to deal with the matters contained in this Bill. that point. He said that the Government had certain advice that they were within their powers in passing this measure. The fact remains that if the Pederal Parliament did not possess the power to deal with these matters prior to the passing of the War Precautions Act, they will not possess those powers when the War Precautions Act ceases to operate. The case of thp tanners tends to support that view. The Defence Department wanted them to supply their leather at a price fixed under the War Precautions Act. The tanners did not supply the boot manufacturers with leather at that price, but the Government did not prosecute them, although they threatened them with the penalties of the Act. am given to understand that the tanners told the Government that they were quite willing to test that Act. If the Government had not the power to enforce the Act on the tanners, there does not seem to be much chance of their having the power to deal with the matters enumerated in this B ill . To me the whole business seems to be much on a par with the way the ship-owners are looking after their own interests at the present time. Apparently the wool and other industries mentioned in the measure are' looking after, their own interests, and the Bil l does not matter one iota to the general public, and particularly to the working-class community. As the honourable member for In d i ( Mr Leckie) said, it is merely a"" wrangle between the so called primary -producers and the manufacturing industries, and the only question whicb the workers of the community are interested dn is which of the two is the profiteer. I am of opinion that both are, and the honourable gentlemen ' who represant the profiteering interests affected by the Bill are simply looking after the profiteers. ' So far as the general body of the pu.blic is concerned, it does not matter one iota whether the B ill is passed or lost. is necessary to answer a few statements that have been made to-night. The honourable member for In d i ' ( Mr Leckie) spoke of the sugar industry and the effect of the protection of that industry upon The honorahle gentleman evaded the dried f r u it and jam industries. Perhaps the honourable member is not aware that the people of Australia are getting sugar grown in Queensland far cheaper than they could import it . Sugar could not be imported now under about £ 5 1 per ton. so? it has been so. It is so now, and the honourable member was dealing with tlie present. It.comes with a very bad grace from membere who represent the f r u it districts to criticise adversely the protective duty upon sugar when their industries enjoy far greater protection. In the past my firm has imported dried fruit s I from Spain and Greece. These were landed in Australia at 2£d. per lb. The duty upon those fruits is now 3d. per l b . , or very nearly 110 per cent. All'that you could make out of the protection on sugar is about 28 per cent. The rise in the price of sugar was found absolutely essential on account of the higher cost, of living and the liigher wages that had to be paid by the producers. In view of the great losses thatthose engaged in the sugar industry have sustained through cyclones, drought, aiui frosts, there are very few industries in Australia that are giving less profit to-day than the sugar industry is. It is as well also to point out that the jam industry is protected to an enormous extent. These manufacturers have a protective duty of 2d. per lb., which is higher than the protection upon sugar. Those who.represent the jam and f r u it industries of the various States must have a very bad case to use arguments which can be so easily refuted. As a matter of fact, to-day they .are enjoying privileges which we in Queensland do notenjoy. Everv man who has the interests of the Commonwealth at heart should take care to see that we occupy effectively the north-eastern seaboard of Queensland. We can only do so by tropical and semi-tropical cultivation. If we do not do this, we may possibly have in this country the Indians, who, of course, belong to the Empire, and perhaps some of our AlHes who live not very far from us.

467,Mr Groom (Darling Downs,"Minis case is whether the Act impeached is or may bemeans of defence in time of war; and whether these means, or eitlier of them, be necessary must be a question for our Parliament, or the authority validly delegated by it for the purpose, to determine. Mr Justice Isaacs pointed out how wide is this power, and he stated, at page 455AsI read the Constitution, the Commonwealth, when charged with the duty of defending Commonwealth and States, is armed as a self-governing portion of the British"" Dominion with a legislative power to do in relation to national defence al l that Parliament, as the legislative organ of the nation, may deem advisable to enact, in relation to the defence of Australia as a component part of the Empire, u power which is commensurate with the peril it is designed to encounter, or as that peril may appear to the Parliament itself; and, if need be, it is a power to command, control, organize, and regulate, for the 'purpose of guarding against that peril, the whole resources of the continent, living and inert, and tbe activities of everyinhabitant of the territory. I have called attention to those remarks of the High Court Justices to emphasize how wide is this power of defence in time of war. During the war the Commonwealth Government exercised its powers .to organize the resources of the country for the purposes of the Empire. ""We took control over wheat,'wool, butter, and'flax; and also, for our own local purposes; we took control over sugar. In ordinary circumstances-that is, in normal times' the Commonwealth has no power to enter into the domain of State legislation and enact general price-fixing measures, or to invade any of the reserved powers of the States; but during time of war those reserved powers must yield to national emergency, where necessary, for defence purposes. The view is upheld .by the High Court that during a period of war these powers can be invaded. To effectively exercise this wide power of control over our resources it must he. done for certain definite terms. In dealing with wool, it was necessary to make contracts extending over long periods; and the same applies to dairy and other products. I ask honourable members to look upon the exercise of these powers in this light, namely, that during the period of the war the Commonwealth had legal power to organize the resources concerned and enter"" into contracts which might extend beyond the actual period of hostilities. States in that way. You took the powers during the war. did the opinion of counsel bear out that we could do so. As regards the competence of Parliament i enact the Bill now before the . House, I have given the. opinion of the whole of the counsel who furnished advice on the matter. Those legal gentlemen spent much time in arriving at the conclusions indicated. I presided over the meetings held in Melbourne, and journeyed to Sydney on several occasions to preside over deliberations there. The opinions were most carefully arrived at, and they are confined to the actual activities included in the Bill. The circumstances and conditions which we placed before those gentlemen are set out in' the preamble of this measure. Take the matter of butter, for.in-stfanoe. There is a distinct contract made, by .the Commonwealth which extends over a period beyond the actual term of the war. In order, to effectively organize the resources of the Commonwealth, and to make thebutter industry useful for Imperial purposes, complete control had.to be exercised, for the period concerned, and it had to he organized in. order to secure the effective carrying"" out of the contract) while at ' the ' same time conserving the -interests of the people of Australia. 'A Butter 'Committee had to ' be appointed and given definite powers. We had to take power'for the acquisition of the butter, and to fix the price qf it , to enable these conditions to be properly adjusted in the interests of, not only the Commonwealth, but the' Empire as a whole. The certificates given by counsel were-given after, the facts and circumstances' had been placed before them. It is essential to the carrying out of the arrangements so made that these powers should be continued up to the date of-the ' termination of the contract. necessary was a Bill to validate' the contract. only tovalidate thecontract, but to give",76,Foster Th E Little Knows A Man Who Gets 2 J Per Cent On

Power to acquire the butter and to fix the price of it was essential to the effective carrying out of the contract All this was an exercise of the Defence power. Again, when we came to carry out our sugar scheme, several different powers had to be exercised. No t only had we to make a contract with the Queensland Government, but, in order to secure an adequate supply of sugar for the people, we had to make contracts some time ahead. The honourable member will recognise the reasonableness of that position. ' as to that. foundation principles. In order to carry out the scheme which the Government had organized in regard to sugar, we had, first of all, to secure supplies for the people of Australia. That involved the making of a contract with the Queensland Government for the acquisition of the raw sugar, and so to secure a continuance of the growing of sugar cane. The local production being insuifieient to meet our own requirements, we had then by importations to secure the sugar necessary to make good the shortage. We had also to make contracts with, the refinery companies to secure the refining of the sugar; to arrange for its distribution amongst the people, and to fix the price so that excessive charges should not be made. The price fixing for which this B ill provides is merely that whicli was necessary to meet the conditions existing during the war, and which still continues, and it is an exercise of the power necessary to complete the scheme which was initiated and carried on by the Government during the period of the war. consulted the Colonial Sugar Refining Oompany about the matter? constitutional position, and with that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company has nothing to do. This is a scheme which the Government are carrying out in the in terests of, not only Australia, but the Empire, and at the honourable member's own request I am dealing with certain points raised, by him. I could, if desired, tell the House of the other agencies covered by this B ill , and show why it is absolutely essential in each case that such legislation should be passed. These commercial activities w ill probably be in operation at the termination of the war. They arose out of our war obligations from which we are not released by the mere ending of the war. We are exercising, the Defence power, and included in or incidental to that is the power to carry out and complete those contracts, that were entered into duriiig the war period. It may be said that the powers which we seek in this B ill are practically being exercised only to enable us to wind up all these commercial activities. The legal opinion given as to the competency of the Parliament to pass such a measure is no justification for the assertion of honourable members opposite that, since we have power to pass legislation to wind up these activities now that the war is over, we have power to invade the legislative domain of the States, and to take upon ourselves for all time the authority -to fix prices generally. We have no constitutional authority to do anything of thekind. The legal opinions as to the competence of the Parliament to pass this legislation were -based upon facts in a general way placed before counsel, which I have already submitted' to the House. I hope honourable members w ill recognise that, however desiraJblei t may 'be that the Commonwealth should have wider powers, the position is that which I . have stated. As Acting Attorney General, I have to advise the House as to whether it is competent'for the Parliament to pass this B ill , and I have no hesitation in saying that there is no justification for suggesting that because, during the war, we exercised the power of price fixing, we are entitled to arrogate to ourselves unlimited authority tp fix prices generally for all time, and so, in effect, to vary the Constitution.

But I received a most curt reply to the effect that no forms would be available for New South Wales until an officer had been appointed to that State, that the appointment had not yet been considered, and that, when it was, application would have to be made in Sydney. I was astonished about a month afterwards to find that those who had called on the officer appointed could get forms, but that there were none generally available for soldiers; and that finished the gentleOffice, not even that of a typist. A t any man, in my estimation, as an organizer. A man with any capacity would know that fche first thing was to have such a supply of forms that every .man could start off a f a i r mark, and that the friends of members of Repatriation Committees or of officers should not have any advantage over other soldiers.

I believe some applications were"" in before that gentleman was appointed, and those 'cute ones who sent them ih are likely to get preference. The Minister should endeavour to make an arrangement by which immediate attention can be given to the claims of those men who require assistance to purchase homes already existing. While the gentleman at fche Central Office was telephoning me, or within an hour afterwards-, the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, speaking on behalf of the Government, was announcing that preference was to be given to men who desired to build houses over those who were taking over homes already built. Ifthat is the policy of the Government, it is not only bad business, but brutally unjust to the soldiers who have been induced to Adjournment, f REPRESENTATIVES.] Adjournment. sign agreements for the purchase of It houses. Most of these men desire to marry, and have a right to assistance to wrote to the gentleman in compurchase their homes, and it is not for He had announced in the those in authority to seek to carry out their ownlittle fads. Their duty is to. help thesoldier to do what he himself wishes to do. The men ought to be helped as quickly as possible to marry and settle down, and provide the population we so much need. M a j o r Evans talked about beautiful "" dream cities."" That is a l l right for the future, but what is wanted first is to assist those who are prepared tb buy houses already built.

I wrote on behalf of one or two returned men who wanted positions in the office, and was told that those positions would be advertised in due course, though, in the office now in positions which were not advertised.

511,Mr Poynton,"The r e may ' haveas to stand up in the House and say that it can be done. We have found, in respect to a large number of houses upon which the deposit had been paid, that the agreed-upon purchase price was much in excess of the true value', and in some cases the Department has been obliged to refuse to advance the money required. dier is spending his own money. the maximum amount that can be spent on any one house. If a man buys a house at a price £150 or £200 above the maximum, the Department cannot advance the money. may add to the-departmental advance any inoney of his own. and in many cases that has been done; but the trouble occurs in cases in which the applicant has no inoney of his' own to supplement the departmental advance. nouncement by the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank was unauthorized? stand that announcement, because only at the latter end of. last week I saw a list of houses, the purchase of which had been approved, and another list of building sites, purchased by applicants; they were supplying their own specifications, and we were calling for tenders for the buildings. It is only within the last two weeks that arrangements for financing the whole scheme have been finalized. There have been a number of deputations with a view to insuring a 'supply of building materials at such prioes as would enable us to build cheap houses. In New South Wales, the private brick-making companies are asking 51s. 6d. per 1,000 for bricks, whereas the State Brickworks are supplying them at 40s. per 1,000. The same sort of thing is happening in connection with timber and other materials. We hope to enter into some arrangement for the purchase of material on such terms as will insure that the soldier's house is constructed at a reasonable price. We are trying to make the same arrangement in Victoria, because, [407] owing to' the operations of the Timber Combine, it is almost impossible to erect a house within the financial limits prescribed by the Act. the soldiers. at once. In answer to a questidn asked to-day by the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Sampson), I stated that I hoped to be able at an early date to make a full statement of what had been' done in regard to the war-service homes scheme. I assure the House that the Minister is doing his best to hurry the scheme along. Walker? Do you approve of his centralization policy? sioner appointed under the Act, which does not provide for a Commissioner in each' State. anCommissioner in each State; but Colonel Walker will not allow his deputies to appoint even a typist without getting approval from Melbourne. the centralization policy was carried to that extreme. But we have had evidence recently that we must be careful regard. ing the powers we give to the Deputy Commissioners. One Deputy sought to . enter into an arrangement for the purchase of land for £25,000, which, when valued, was found to be worth less than £8,000. No Deputy has power to purchase land at a price in excess of £1,000. But I cannot conceive it possible that a Deputy Commissioner who has power to purchase laud .to the value of £1,000 has not authority to appoint a typist in his office. However, if the honourable member for Illawarra will send me a copy of his remarks this evening, I shall place them before the Minister for Repatriation, and furnish the honourable member' with a full reply to thc allegations he has made.
